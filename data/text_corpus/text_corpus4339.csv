21695,the present study investigates the mechanism of the after runner surge on the coast of the gulf of tonkin vietnam due to typhoon kalmaegi 2014 landfalling at quang ninh province using a coupled model of surge wave and tide forced by asymmetric and symmetric wind and pressure fields it is found that the after runner surge is mainly caused by tailwinds of the typhoon generating the maximum surge level along the shore on the left side of the track approximately 11 h delayed the tailwind is attributed to maximumly 60 of the peak surge as a result the wind speed is the predominant factor on the kalmaegi surge on the north coast while both the wind speed and the sea level pressure have the identical impact on the west and south coasts through the numerical experiments the slower moving speed results in the higher surge level on the right side of the typhoon while the faster speed causes the higher surge level on the left side of the track the stronger wind speed and sea level pressure correlatively generate the higher surge along the whole coast it means that the asymmetry field is critical to the after runner storm surge keywords after runner storm surge asymmetry typhoon tailwind typhoon moving speed 1 introduction storm surge is primarily dependent on the typhoon characteristics intensity moving speed wind speed radius to the maximum wind angle of approach to the coast and central pressure drop coastal topography water depth and shape of the shoreline tide and waves the storm surge height in general reaches a maximum coinciding with landfall of an extreme event such as a tropical cyclone hurricane and typhoon meanwhile the surge height sometimes reaches the maximum posterior to the landfall so called after runner surge or the large surge generates anterior to the landfall forerunner surge recent studies described that substantial sea level rises occurred in 14 16 h after typhoon songda 2004 passed away the tottori coast japan and headed for offshore kim et al 2014 in 12 24 h in advance of the hurricane ike 2008 on the western louisiana and northern texas latex coasts us kennedy et al 2011 in 6 8 h after the landfall of typhoon kalmaegi 2014 in the gulf of tonkin vietnam thuy et al 2014 for the storm surge study the use of a numerical model taking into account the interaction of surge wave and tide a coupled numerical model has been common in the last two decades e g kim et al 2008 dietrich et al 2011 because it has many advantages in comparison to a conventional stand alone storm surge model which only considers the effect of wind and air pressure in a coupled model the impact of the wave on the storm surge is expressed by the wave induced radiation stress in a coastal water longuet higgins and stewart 1960 and the wave dependent wind stress estimated by a function of wind and wave parameters janssen 1989 1991 several studies have examined the impact of the sea surface stress caused by waves and show that the coupled numerical model significantly improves computed storm surge levels e g zhang and li 1997 in coastal waters the sea level rise induced by the radiation stress has also been studied using the coupled model mastenbroek et al 1993 funakoshi et al 2008 kim et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 bertin et al 2015 funakoshi et al 2008 showed that a wave induced surge could contribute 10 to 15 to the extreme water level in storms chen et al 2008 concluded that a wave induced surge in a coastal area accounts for 80 of an extreme water level due to hurricane katrina 2005 us while other effects such as tide and wind contribute only 20 to a surge kim et al 2010 applied a coupled model of surge wave and tide with the multi level grid system suwat to the tosa gulf japan indicating that the contribution of the wave radiation stress is up to 40 0 5m to the surge level at the peak also kim et al 2010 showed that the surge by the radiation stress is dependent on the resolution of the grid and proposed the use of higher resolution models for the interaction of the tide and surge many studies have concluded that the tide could only affect the surge significantly on coasts with a large tidal amplitude chen et al 2008 choi et al 2003 horsburgh and wilson 2007 kim et al 2008 recent studies introduced that the sea level rise can affect storm surges e g yin et al 2017 pan and liu 2019 in vietnam the influence of the tide on the storm surge has been studied by thuy 2003 sao 2008 chien 2015 and thuy et al 2017 these studies focused mainly on the assessment of the storm surge that landed on the different tidal phases the influence of the wave on the surge has also been studied recently for instance thai et al 2017 showed that the sea level rise induced by the radiation stress is a significant part of the storm surge on the coast of haiphong vietnam for a decade the phenomenon of the after runner forerunner storm surge has been studied for several specific storms kennedy et al 2011 studied the phenomenon of the forerunner storm surge in hurricane iker 2008 landed on the louisiana texas coast and showed that both the ekman effect and coastal topography are attributed to the surge prior to the landfall kim et al 2014 assessed the after runner storm surge due to typhoon songda 2004 passed near the tottori coast japan under various scenarios with different sources symmetric and asymmetric fields of winds and atmospheric pressures the influence of the tide and wave and ekman effect and concluded that the ekman effect is the leading cause for this phenomenon therefore the predominant factor of the after runner forerunner surge is the coriolis force over the coast and the ekman setup coming from the geographical feature kennedy et al 2011 kim et al 2014 on the other hand thuy et al 2019 indicated that the coriolis force could not generate the after runner storm surge in the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin because hainan island located in the south china sea takes the role of a barrier in front of the gulf of tonkin that prevents ocean circulation from the typhoon s feature as a result understanding of the cause and mechanism for the storm surge at a specific area is critical to a suitable operation of a storm surge warning and forecasting system significant effort has been carried out in order to understand the storm surge as a function of hurricane typhoon feature parameters for instance the storm surge could vary up to 30 due to different storm sizes for a given intensity of cyclone irish et al 2008 rego and li 2009 showed that the forward motion of the storm could result in higher water volumes for a slow moving hurricane than a fast moving hurricane with respect to the forward speed a faster storm caused an increase in peak water levels on the coast parallel to the hurricane track thomas et al 2019 while most studies concentrate on the response of the storm surge to the cyclone few studies mentioned that of the after runner storm surge therefore the present study investigates the reaction of the after runner storm surge to the typhoon feature parameter such as the forward speed and intensity the present study analyzes the mechanism of after runner surges due to typhoon kalmaegi landfalling in the quang ninh province using the coupled model of surge wave and tide suwat forcing either symmetric or asymmetric wind and pressure fields estimated by the parametric typhoon and wrf models respectively then the typhoon kalmaegi surge response to the typhoon feature parameter is examined through a series of numerical simulations 2 description of methodology 2 1 a coupled model of surge wave and tide a coupled model of surge wave and tide so called suwat developed by kim et al 2008 2010 2015 was used to simulate a series of the typhoon kalmaegi surge suwat consists of two modules of surge and wave the surge module solves sea surface levels and currents using the depth integrated nonlinear long wave equations the wave module consists of a wave model of simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the wave module provides wave induced radiation stresses and wave dependent drag coefficients to the surge module while the surge module estimates sea surface levels and currents transferring to the wave module two modules are integrated in suwat using messages passing interface mpi on each domain mpi allows suwat to have vertically nesting kim et al 2008 and horizontally neighboring kim et al 2015 domains suwat has been validated in the studies of kim et al 2015 chien 2015 and thuy et al 2017 for instance boundary conditions on suwat were provided kim et al 2010 the solid boundary condition is provided by prohibiting flow normal to land while the radiation condition on open boundaries flather 1994 was applied in the only outermost domain the boundary condition of water elevations and currents on the finer grid is interpolated from the coarse grid by a bilinear interpolation method kim et al 2008 no tide was implemented in the open boundary condition suwat can choose either wind and sea level pressure fields internally provided by a parametric wind and pressure model embedded in suwat or those externally supplied which estimated by a numerical weather prediction model such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model in the present study the parametric wind and pressure model proposed by fujii and mitsuta 1986 and fujita 1952 for wind and pressure respectively were used to predict the typhoon kalmaegi wind and sea level pressure field in addition wrf was also used to reproduce the one hourly wind and pressure data with resolutions of 4 min to drive suwat geophysical domains for the storm surge were downscaled with three levels d01 7400 m d02 1850 m d03 900 m shown in fig 1 the domains were designed to cover typhoon tracks moving over the whole south china sea on the domains the suwat was driven by the wind and pressure field reproduced by the parametric model wrf estimated the atmospheric field of typhoon kalmaegi in a domain as seen in fig 2 and then the kalmaegi wind and pressure field was extracted as adjusting it for the calculation domain of suwat in the outermost domain d01 suwat directly enforces the wrf wind and pressure field while in the rest of the nested domains d02 and d03 suwat interpolates the one hourly data of the outermost domain to the nested domains with every 10 min time interval 2 2 a wind and pressure field of typhoon kalmaegi 2 2 1 a parametric typhoon model the typhoon kalmaegi s wind and pressure field is reproduced by symmetric parametric models of fujii and mitsuta 1986 and fujita 1952 respectively the sea level pressure from the center of the typhoon is determined by fujita 1952 fujii and mitsuta s formulas 1986 is used for the wind speed at 10 m height the detailed formulas can be referred to kim et al 2015 it should be noticed that those formulas simulate the symmetric wind and pressure field in contrast the weather research and forecasting model is used for reproducing the kalmaegi s asymmetric field given in the following section 2 2 2 weather research and forecasting this study used the weather research and forecasting model with arw dynamical core wrf arw version 3 6 1 with multi nested grids and two way interactive options one of the most important things is that the wrf model has been a very flexible and useful tool for both researchers and operational forecasters as it is integrated with various recent advances in physics numeric and data assimilation contributed by scientists and developers from the expansive research community the physical parameterizations have been selected including a the modified kf cumulus parameterization schemes b the goddard and dudhia schemes for the shortwave radiation d the myj planetary boundary and e the wsm6 schemes for the cloud micro physics the wrf arw model is configured with two nested grid domains consisting of 199 x 199 grid points in the horizontal dimensions for both two domains with horizontal resolutions of 18 km and 6 km respectively as seen in fig 2 the gfs model by ncep used to provide boundary conditions for wrf arw in this study has 0 5 horizontal resolution and with output every 3 h at 27 pressure levels from 1000 hpa to 1 hpa the gfs data for this study was downloaded on the research data archive at the national center for atmospheric research via website link https rda ucar edu datasets ds335 0 more information for gfs data can be found at https www nco ncep noaa gov pmb products gfs 3 a series of numerical experiments firstly a series of coupled surge and wave simulations for typhoon kalmaegi was conducted as forcing for the wind and pressure fields estimated by using the parametric model and wrf to validate the suwat model in this experiment the mechanism of the after runner storm surge will be clarified in the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin vietnam secondly a series of coupled surge and wave simulations with kalmaegi s features were carried out to investigate which factor is of a primary impact on the after runner storm surge focusing on three sources of the forward speed wind speed and sea level pressure to find it out the experiment is designed as listed in table 1 in exp01 to exp06 the moving speed only changes as either increasing or decreasing it with the 5 km h interval otherwise other characteristics of the typhoon such as the track central pressure and size are sustained in exp07 to exp12 the wind speed only varies at the interval of 2 m s as done in the experiments above in exp13 to exp18 the drop rate of the central pressure only changes with the interval of 5 hpa but the other kalmaegi s characteristics are fixed as well in the experiment the interaction between the surge and wave is considered to simulate the kalmaegi s surge in other words the wave dependent drag coefficient is used to calculate the wind stress in the storm surge module the wave radiation stress is also considered on the momentum equations the wave field is calculated with the unsteady sea surface level and current 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview of typhoon kalmaegi 2014 according to national disaster risk reduction and management council ndrrmc 2014 in the philippines typhoon kalmaegi was generated on september 10 2014 northeast of palau and headed toward a west north direction as shown in fig 3 on september 13 kalmaegi was upgraded to a category one typhoon and made landfall over cagayan the next day with weakened intensity kalmaegi moved to the south china sea and intensified again on september 15 kalmaegi reached its peak strength as making landfall over hainan island then kalmaegi rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as moving toward the west in vietnam kalmaegi brought strong gusty winds and flash floods reported by the media as of september 18 it was reported that the death toll had risen to 9 and 10 were injured damages have also been topped to us 944 000 on september 19 it was reported that 15 were injured a total of 13 people was reported killed by the storm vietnamnet https english vietnamnet vn fms society 112172 nine dead 10 injured in wake of typhoon kalmaegi html 4 2 overview of after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi typhoon kalmaegi made landfall on the northern quang ninh province at 9 pm on september 16 in utc continued to move toward the mainland and then weakened as a tropical depression it caused strong winds at level 9 10 beaufort scale gust at level 10 11 on the coast of quang ninh and hai phong provinces typhoon kalmaegi hit the land at the lowest tide of the day 10 h later in the coastal area of hai phong quang ninh province the sea level has risen with high waves up to 3 4 m resulted in flooding in some low lying areas for instance do son district hai phong this was an unexpected situation because this is not the highest tidal time of the year thuy et al 2014 the storm surge of typhoon kalmaegi has some unusual points in comparison with other usual typhoons time series of the observed total water level predicted tide and extracted residuals total water level predicted tidal level at the stations of hon dau fig 4 a and hon ngu fig 4b during kalmaegi are given in fig 4 where are on the left hand side of the typhoon for instance the surge level at hon dau on the left hand side of the typhoon begins to rise as the typhoon makes landfall and reaches 1 1 m at peak 3 h later lasting the surge level higher than 1 m over 12 h at hon ngu where goes toward the south further from the typhoon track the surge level also rises up to its maximum of 0 5 m 6 h later after the typhoon hits land lasting over 7 h fig 4b fig 5 shows a relation between observed surges and wind speeds sea level pressures at hon dau the surge profile shows a correlation with the wind speed but no correlation with the sea level pressure during typhoon kalmaegi heading for coastal waters of vietnam the national center for hydro meteorology forecasting nchmf regularly updated forecast of the storm surge and warning of coastal inundation in accordance with regulations according to the forecast result the area at risk of storm surge and relevant flood was the northern coastal area of quang ninh with the surge height of about 1 m so called the north coast near cua ong on the right side of the track and the west near hon dau and south near hon ngu coasts on the left side as a matter of convenience see fig 3 b otherwise the forecast was unlikely to cause inundation in the coastal area due to the typhoon hitting land at low tide the nchmf terminated the storm surge forecasting as the typhoon hit the mainland in vietnam on the one hand the peak surge level usually appears with the typhoon s landfall on the other hand the kalmaegi surge generates several hours later after landfall lasting several hours the phenomenon of the kalmaegi surge is similar with the one reported by kim et al 2014 called the after runner storm surge since the maximum surge height appears several hours later after the typhoon passage this unique feature should be taken into account in forecasting to mitigate flooding damage to coastal facilities and casualties due to the storm surge 4 3 mechanism of after runner storm surge 4 3 1 hindcasting the after runner storm surge simulation in order to investigate the reason of the after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi the suwat model was applied by using the wind and pressure fields hindcasted from the parametric wind and pressure model and wrf respectively fig 6 shows comparisons of calculations and observations for the wind speed and sea level pressure at the station of hon dau results show that there is a fairly similarity between the wrf calculation and observation there are relatively shorter time lags of 7 h 0 h between the observed and calculated lowest sea level pressures highest wind speeds as seen in fig 6 a fig 6 b however the parametric wind and pressure model gave large errors of 15 h 12 h for the time when the lowest sea level pressure highest wind speed are captured due to the large error in the symmetric wind and pressure field a series of the storm surge simulation with it resulted in huge differences between the calculation and observation as given later fig 7 presents comparisons between modeled and observed surges at hon dau fig 7 a and hon ngu fig 7 b the surge level simulated by the wrf s wind and pressure well matches the observation at phase and height even though the calculated surge decreases earlier than the observation around 18h september 16th and 12h september 17th resulted from that the 2d surge model was used in this study we have confirmed that a 3d ocean circulation model could remove such discrepancy do not shown here on the other hand the surge reproduced by the parametric wind and pressure model totally fails to simulate the observation as expected because of the discrepancy of the wind and pressure field not given at hon ngu therefore it can be said that the use of the wind and pressure field from the wrf model gives a fairly similar surge in both in the intensity and phase of the storm surge on the coast meanwhile the surge computed with the wind and pressure field from the parametric model is underestimated this result may come from an asymmetry of the kalmaegi s wind and pressure field for instance wrf reproduced the asymmetric wind and pressure field while the parametric model reproduced the symmetric one such a strong asymmetric feature of the typhoon gives rise to the distinctive storm surge on the west and south coasts of the gulf of tonkin vietnam which never observed ever before since the observation began understanding of the after runner storm surge mechanism is critical to redesigning of the early warning system that has been now operated by nchmf 4 3 2 the mechanism of the after runner surge due to typhoon kalmaegi a series of numerical simulations is additionally conducted to elucidate the effect of the asymmetry of the typhoon kalmaegi s wind field on the mechanism of the after runner storm surge in the additional experiment the wrf s wind and pressure field was only used after the typhoon s landfall the wind force is terminated to ignore the effect of the tailwind but the sea level pressure field is activated it means that the wind speed and atmospheric pressure drive the surge before the landfall similar to the ordinary typhoon s weather state while the wind speed is set equal to a zero wind speed the purpose of the idea is to evaluate the role of the tailwind following the typhoon on the pattern of the after runner storm surge results from two experiments conducted with and without the effect of the tailwind are shown in fig 8 at the station of hon dau fig 8 a the surge height and its duration obtained from the additional experiment are much smaller and shorter than those estimated from the hindcast simulation using the full field of wind and pressure it shows that the tailwind contributes the peak surge generation up to 60 meanwhile at the station of hon ngu fig 8 b those in the additional experiment are not only earlier and smaller but also much shorter thus the tailwind of the landfall is a key factor for the generation of the after runner storm surge to illustrate the phenomenon of the after runner storm surge the distribution of the simulated wind and storm surge is shown in the times after the landfall in 0 h fig 9 a in 4 h fig 9b in 6 h fig 9 c and 8 h fig 9 d respectively it can be seen from the figure that when the typhoon hits the land the water level in the northern coastal water of the gulf of tonkin begins to increase due to the wind heading toward the north coast on the right side of the typhoon on the other hand the water level on the west and south coasts near hon dau and hon ngu is sunk below the mean sea level due to the wind blowing toward offshore on the left side of the typhoon four hours later the water level on the northern gulf of tonkin is reaching the highest on the other hand that is beginning to rise on the west and south shores where hon dau and hon ngu are located as seen in fig 9 b 6 h later the water level reaches a peak at hon dau sustaining the peaked surge level for a while due to the wind heading forward the north coast fig 9 c this phenomenon is seen for several hours as the typhoon passed away from the gulf fig 9 d as a result it can be said on the west and south coasts that the effect of the wind parallel to the shoreline becomes more significant after the typhoon landfall then the wind gradually turned to the shore and continued its direction for several hours causing the peaked sea level rise on the west coast near hon dau it is the reason why the higher surge level was prolonged for several hours after the typhoon landed also the water on the northern gulf after rising moves toward the southern gulf which is also the cause of the storm surge in the coastal sea of hon dau and hon ngu as illustrated in fig 10 showing sea surface levels and currents in 4 h after the landfall the current tends to circulate toward the south sea of the gulf because the water level is higher in the north compared to the south additional experiments were conducted for kalmaegi s wind and pressure field one is forcing the only kalmaegi s wind ignoring the pressure while another one is vice versa in order to quantitatively investigate which factor is predominant on the kalmaegi s after runner storm surge by calculating the non dimensional ratio η p e a k w i n d η p e a k w i n d p r e s s u e or η p e a k p r e s s u r e η p e a k w i n d p r e s s u e as shown in fig 11 it is shown that the wind speed is predominant on the peak surge at cua ong while two external forces are of almost the same contribution at hon dau and hon ngu the results described above give lessons for forecasting a storm surge in the early warning system as follows 1 the after runner storm surge can occur after the typhoon s passage and 2 it lasts for several hours furthermore it was found that the after runner storm surge generates under the appropriate meteorological conditions which are satisfied such as the asymmetry of a wind circulation with the wind direction heading perpendicular to the shoreline on the middle coast of the gulf meanwhile the parametric wind and pressure model which is a conventional method well describing a symmetric wind and pressure field for a storm surge simulation was not able to appropriately reproduce the kalmaegi s wind and pressure field especially it could not estimate the strong tailwind in space which is dominant in the surge as shown above as a result the structure of the wind field is critical to the simulation of the after runner storm surge 4 4 the effect of the typhoon parameter on the after runner storm surge in the previous section it was found that the tailwind field is vital to understanding of the after runner storm surge in this section the effect of the typhoon tc parameter on the after runner storm surge is investigated as changing the following factors typhoon intensity wind speed and pressure and moving speed among the tc parameters of track intensity moving speed and radius to maximum wind speed and so on impacts of the track and the radius of the typhoon are beyond the scope of the study 4 4 1 the effect of the moving speed first kalmaegi s characteristics are taken as the reference run as listed in table 1 then we changed the forward speed either maximally 15 km h faster exp01 and minimally 15 km h slower exp06 with the 5 km h interval fig 12 shows time series of calculated surge levels at cua ong fig 12 a hon dau fig 12 b and hon ngu fig 12 c located from the north to the south respectively in fig 12 d the peak surge level is plotted against the moving speed for each station it was found that the time series of the storm surge in the experiment is generally shifted back and forward in the reference run with almost 6 h as changing the moving speed from all the experiments the peak surge level increases at cua ong as the moving speed is slower at hon dau located on the middle coast between cua ong and hon ngu the variation of the peak level is similar to that at cua ong fig 8 b however its peak level decreases due to the slower movement of tc in exp05 10 km h slower and exp06 15 km h slower than that in exp04 5 km h slower interestingly the surge level at cua ong sharply reaches peak level while that at hon dau is sustained for several hours around peak in contrast at hon ngu the peak surge decreases with the longer stagnated peak due to the slower moving speed of the typhoon in fig 13 change rates of the modeled maximum surge level to the kalmaegi s one in percentage are shown demonstrating how the sea surface level rises in the whole bay the slower tc pushes water of up to 20 more toward the north sea near cua ong while it makes seawater of up to 50 decreasing near hon dau and hon ngu when the tc becomes faster the northern sea surface level near cua ong partially goes down while the southern sea is no change near hon dau or slightly increase hon ngu in other words the slower moving speed is attributed to the severer storm surge damage on the north coast on the other hand the storm surge risk on the west coast near hon dau is reduced at a threshold of the moving speed the south coast near hon ngu is exposed to a higher lower risk for the storm surge as a result of the faster slower moving speed the change of the peak surge level on the northern gulf is in line with rego and li 2009 indicating that the slower forward motion results in higher water volumes while that on the southern and western waters is in accordance with the result of thomas et al 2019 that the faster moving speed is attributed to the higher peak thus the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin is the region where both phenomena co exist and then has to be considered in the design of the storm surge forecasting system in the current study we showed the gulf sea of tonkin where exposes the storm surge risk due to both the slower and faster moving speeds that could be attributed to the higher maximum level of the after runner storm surge in other words in a coastal sea where occurs the after runner storm surge the slowing typhoon has a potential of the generation of higher surges such a potential could be investigated by a bunch of events using either a typhoon hurricane modeled by a statistical typhoon model e g nakajo et al 2014 or projected by a climate change experiments e g mizuta et al 2017 then we should evaluate a storm surge risk quantitively and qualitatively to understand a future flood damage 4 4 2 the effect of the typhoon intensity next we changed the fields of either the wind speed or the sea level pressure to investigate how they influence the surge level for the change of the wind speed the sea level pressure field was retained while for that of the central pressure the wind speed was kept invariant fig 14 shows the change of the peak surge level to the wind speed in the experiments of exp07 to exp12 the peak level exponentially increases at all the stations fig 14 a along with the change of the wind speed because the wind stress term on the momentum equation is inverse proportion to the water depth the ratio of the change peak surge level tc kalmaegi s peak surge level goes up to 1 75 at hon dau from 1 5 at hon ngu when the wind speed is 6 m s larger while it goes down to 0 6 at cua ong from 0 7 at hon ngu when it is 6 m s smaller fig 14 b the change range is almost double from the lowest ratio to the highest one when the wind speed is higher the sea surface level highly increases on the whole water and especially up to 120 near cua ong on the northern gulf of tonkin see fig 15 as the wind speed becomes weaker the sea surface level decreases on the entire bay and maximumly up to 50 near cua ong as a result the after runner storm surge is highly sensitive to the wind speed on the coast of the gulf of tonkin the change of the peak level due to the variation of the sea level pressure shows a similar pattern to that due to the wind speed change see fig 16 a the peak level linearly increases as the sea level pressure becomes lower as listed in table 1 it seems that the sea level rise is an independent term of the water depth on the momentum equations the change of the ratio peak surge level tc kalmaegi s peak surge level in the peak surge level is in the range of 0 7 1 4 as seen in fig 16 b the station showing the largest change at the peak is hon ngu while that revealing the smallest change is cua ong in particular the sea surface level entirely increases and especially almost 100 offshore in the south sea of the gulf of tonkin as the tc becomes intensive see fig 17 in contrast it decreases up to 80 offshore in comparison to the kalmaegi s sea surface level from the result we showed that the intensified wind speed brings more severe risk on the coast in addition sophisticated predictions show that the severity is quantitatively identical along with the shoreline on the other hand the severity due to the strengthened sea level pressure decreases from hon ngu where is the farthest area to cua ong on the right hand side of the typhoon as a result we found both the wind speed and sea level pressure could impact the entire gulf sea even though there are some discrepancies due to both components in surge levels along the coast accordingly a gulf sea in which after runner storm surge generates would be influenced by winds and sea level pressures equivalently as shown in fig 11 thus the finding above leads us to develop a new storm surge forecast system or strategy to predict a forthcoming surge accurately the current study focused on how the forward speed and intensity of typhoon kalmaegi contribute to the after runner storm surge behavior and however puts the vulnerability against typhoon s track and size which generate an after runner storm surge with the longer duration at the peak beyond the study if we use massive typhoon datasets projected by ensemble future climate simulations e g nakajo et al 2014 mizuta et al 2017 covering all the typhoon characteristics of forward speed intensity track and size we can enhance our finding on the effect of the typhoon feature on the after runner storm surge statistically supporting a decision maker or tool to release flood warning quickly and accurately 5 conclusions the national center for hydro meteorology forecasting nchmf vietnam was unsuccessful in forecasting the typhoon kalmaegi 2014 storm surge in the gulf of tonkin generating flood damage in low lying areas of the west coast of the gulf thuy et al 2014 the hindcast of the kalmaegi surge clarifies that the peak surge generated 7 h later after the landfall and the higher surge level 1 m lasted almost 10 h at hon dau located on the west coast the large surge was also observed 11 h later at hon ngu on the south coast in the gulf the recent studies addressed such a phenomenon as an after runner storm surge in this study the mechanism of the after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi was analyzed by suwat model forced by the symmetric and asymmetric fields of the kalmaegi wind and pressure estimated by a parametric model and wrf respectively based on the result of the numerical experiment it was found that the after runner storm surge on the west and south coasts was caused by the strong tailwind following the typhoon passed away toward the continent on the other hand the wind field on the right side of the typhoon is attributed to the ordinary storm surge on the north coast also the wind speed is the predominant factor on the generation of the storm surge on the north coast while both the wind speed and the sea level pressure have the almost identical impact on the after runner storm surge on the west and south coasts in addition understanding of the after runner storm surge against the forward speed and the intensity of typhoon feature is critical to the operation of the current early warning system the change of the forward motion of typhoon shows that slower moving speed results in the higher surge level on the north coast on the right side of the typhoon while the faster speed causes the higher surge level on the west and south shores on the left hand side furthermore the typhoon intensity of the wind speed and sea level pressure makes the sea level rise correlatively on the whole sea of the gulf it means that the asymmetry of the wind and pressure field is fundamental to forecasting of the after runner storm surge and should be taken into account in the early warning system further studies for the size and track of the typhoon are necessary to quantitatively identify their impacts on the after runner storm surge credit authorship contribution statement nguyen ba thuy conceptualization methodology

21695,the present study investigates the mechanism of the after runner surge on the coast of the gulf of tonkin vietnam due to typhoon kalmaegi 2014 landfalling at quang ninh province using a coupled model of surge wave and tide forced by asymmetric and symmetric wind and pressure fields it is found that the after runner surge is mainly caused by tailwinds of the typhoon generating the maximum surge level along the shore on the left side of the track approximately 11 h delayed the tailwind is attributed to maximumly 60 of the peak surge as a result the wind speed is the predominant factor on the kalmaegi surge on the north coast while both the wind speed and the sea level pressure have the identical impact on the west and south coasts through the numerical experiments the slower moving speed results in the higher surge level on the right side of the typhoon while the faster speed causes the higher surge level on the left side of the track the stronger wind speed and sea level pressure correlatively generate the higher surge along the whole coast it means that the asymmetry field is critical to the after runner storm surge keywords after runner storm surge asymmetry typhoon tailwind typhoon moving speed 1 introduction storm surge is primarily dependent on the typhoon characteristics intensity moving speed wind speed radius to the maximum wind angle of approach to the coast and central pressure drop coastal topography water depth and shape of the shoreline tide and waves the storm surge height in general reaches a maximum coinciding with landfall of an extreme event such as a tropical cyclone hurricane and typhoon meanwhile the surge height sometimes reaches the maximum posterior to the landfall so called after runner surge or the large surge generates anterior to the landfall forerunner surge recent studies described that substantial sea level rises occurred in 14 16 h after typhoon songda 2004 passed away the tottori coast japan and headed for offshore kim et al 2014 in 12 24 h in advance of the hurricane ike 2008 on the western louisiana and northern texas latex coasts us kennedy et al 2011 in 6 8 h after the landfall of typhoon kalmaegi 2014 in the gulf of tonkin vietnam thuy et al 2014 for the storm surge study the use of a numerical model taking into account the interaction of surge wave and tide a coupled numerical model has been common in the last two decades e g kim et al 2008 dietrich et al 2011 because it has many advantages in comparison to a conventional stand alone storm surge model which only considers the effect of wind and air pressure in a coupled model the impact of the wave on the storm surge is expressed by the wave induced radiation stress in a coastal water longuet higgins and stewart 1960 and the wave dependent wind stress estimated by a function of wind and wave parameters janssen 1989 1991 several studies have examined the impact of the sea surface stress caused by waves and show that the coupled numerical model significantly improves computed storm surge levels e g zhang and li 1997 in coastal waters the sea level rise induced by the radiation stress has also been studied using the coupled model mastenbroek et al 1993 funakoshi et al 2008 kim et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 bertin et al 2015 funakoshi et al 2008 showed that a wave induced surge could contribute 10 to 15 to the extreme water level in storms chen et al 2008 concluded that a wave induced surge in a coastal area accounts for 80 of an extreme water level due to hurricane katrina 2005 us while other effects such as tide and wind contribute only 20 to a surge kim et al 2010 applied a coupled model of surge wave and tide with the multi level grid system suwat to the tosa gulf japan indicating that the contribution of the wave radiation stress is up to 40 0 5m to the surge level at the peak also kim et al 2010 showed that the surge by the radiation stress is dependent on the resolution of the grid and proposed the use of higher resolution models for the interaction of the tide and surge many studies have concluded that the tide could only affect the surge significantly on coasts with a large tidal amplitude chen et al 2008 choi et al 2003 horsburgh and wilson 2007 kim et al 2008 recent studies introduced that the sea level rise can affect storm surges e g yin et al 2017 pan and liu 2019 in vietnam the influence of the tide on the storm surge has been studied by thuy 2003 sao 2008 chien 2015 and thuy et al 2017 these studies focused mainly on the assessment of the storm surge that landed on the different tidal phases the influence of the wave on the surge has also been studied recently for instance thai et al 2017 showed that the sea level rise induced by the radiation stress is a significant part of the storm surge on the coast of haiphong vietnam for a decade the phenomenon of the after runner forerunner storm surge has been studied for several specific storms kennedy et al 2011 studied the phenomenon of the forerunner storm surge in hurricane iker 2008 landed on the louisiana texas coast and showed that both the ekman effect and coastal topography are attributed to the surge prior to the landfall kim et al 2014 assessed the after runner storm surge due to typhoon songda 2004 passed near the tottori coast japan under various scenarios with different sources symmetric and asymmetric fields of winds and atmospheric pressures the influence of the tide and wave and ekman effect and concluded that the ekman effect is the leading cause for this phenomenon therefore the predominant factor of the after runner forerunner surge is the coriolis force over the coast and the ekman setup coming from the geographical feature kennedy et al 2011 kim et al 2014 on the other hand thuy et al 2019 indicated that the coriolis force could not generate the after runner storm surge in the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin because hainan island located in the south china sea takes the role of a barrier in front of the gulf of tonkin that prevents ocean circulation from the typhoon s feature as a result understanding of the cause and mechanism for the storm surge at a specific area is critical to a suitable operation of a storm surge warning and forecasting system significant effort has been carried out in order to understand the storm surge as a function of hurricane typhoon feature parameters for instance the storm surge could vary up to 30 due to different storm sizes for a given intensity of cyclone irish et al 2008 rego and li 2009 showed that the forward motion of the storm could result in higher water volumes for a slow moving hurricane than a fast moving hurricane with respect to the forward speed a faster storm caused an increase in peak water levels on the coast parallel to the hurricane track thomas et al 2019 while most studies concentrate on the response of the storm surge to the cyclone few studies mentioned that of the after runner storm surge therefore the present study investigates the reaction of the after runner storm surge to the typhoon feature parameter such as the forward speed and intensity the present study analyzes the mechanism of after runner surges due to typhoon kalmaegi landfalling in the quang ninh province using the coupled model of surge wave and tide suwat forcing either symmetric or asymmetric wind and pressure fields estimated by the parametric typhoon and wrf models respectively then the typhoon kalmaegi surge response to the typhoon feature parameter is examined through a series of numerical simulations 2 description of methodology 2 1 a coupled model of surge wave and tide a coupled model of surge wave and tide so called suwat developed by kim et al 2008 2010 2015 was used to simulate a series of the typhoon kalmaegi surge suwat consists of two modules of surge and wave the surge module solves sea surface levels and currents using the depth integrated nonlinear long wave equations the wave module consists of a wave model of simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the wave module provides wave induced radiation stresses and wave dependent drag coefficients to the surge module while the surge module estimates sea surface levels and currents transferring to the wave module two modules are integrated in suwat using messages passing interface mpi on each domain mpi allows suwat to have vertically nesting kim et al 2008 and horizontally neighboring kim et al 2015 domains suwat has been validated in the studies of kim et al 2015 chien 2015 and thuy et al 2017 for instance boundary conditions on suwat were provided kim et al 2010 the solid boundary condition is provided by prohibiting flow normal to land while the radiation condition on open boundaries flather 1994 was applied in the only outermost domain the boundary condition of water elevations and currents on the finer grid is interpolated from the coarse grid by a bilinear interpolation method kim et al 2008 no tide was implemented in the open boundary condition suwat can choose either wind and sea level pressure fields internally provided by a parametric wind and pressure model embedded in suwat or those externally supplied which estimated by a numerical weather prediction model such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model in the present study the parametric wind and pressure model proposed by fujii and mitsuta 1986 and fujita 1952 for wind and pressure respectively were used to predict the typhoon kalmaegi wind and sea level pressure field in addition wrf was also used to reproduce the one hourly wind and pressure data with resolutions of 4 min to drive suwat geophysical domains for the storm surge were downscaled with three levels d01 7400 m d02 1850 m d03 900 m shown in fig 1 the domains were designed to cover typhoon tracks moving over the whole south china sea on the domains the suwat was driven by the wind and pressure field reproduced by the parametric model wrf estimated the atmospheric field of typhoon kalmaegi in a domain as seen in fig 2 and then the kalmaegi wind and pressure field was extracted as adjusting it for the calculation domain of suwat in the outermost domain d01 suwat directly enforces the wrf wind and pressure field while in the rest of the nested domains d02 and d03 suwat interpolates the one hourly data of the outermost domain to the nested domains with every 10 min time interval 2 2 a wind and pressure field of typhoon kalmaegi 2 2 1 a parametric typhoon model the typhoon kalmaegi s wind and pressure field is reproduced by symmetric parametric models of fujii and mitsuta 1986 and fujita 1952 respectively the sea level pressure from the center of the typhoon is determined by fujita 1952 fujii and mitsuta s formulas 1986 is used for the wind speed at 10 m height the detailed formulas can be referred to kim et al 2015 it should be noticed that those formulas simulate the symmetric wind and pressure field in contrast the weather research and forecasting model is used for reproducing the kalmaegi s asymmetric field given in the following section 2 2 2 weather research and forecasting this study used the weather research and forecasting model with arw dynamical core wrf arw version 3 6 1 with multi nested grids and two way interactive options one of the most important things is that the wrf model has been a very flexible and useful tool for both researchers and operational forecasters as it is integrated with various recent advances in physics numeric and data assimilation contributed by scientists and developers from the expansive research community the physical parameterizations have been selected including a the modified kf cumulus parameterization schemes b the goddard and dudhia schemes for the shortwave radiation d the myj planetary boundary and e the wsm6 schemes for the cloud micro physics the wrf arw model is configured with two nested grid domains consisting of 199 x 199 grid points in the horizontal dimensions for both two domains with horizontal resolutions of 18 km and 6 km respectively as seen in fig 2 the gfs model by ncep used to provide boundary conditions for wrf arw in this study has 0 5 horizontal resolution and with output every 3 h at 27 pressure levels from 1000 hpa to 1 hpa the gfs data for this study was downloaded on the research data archive at the national center for atmospheric research via website link https rda ucar edu datasets ds335 0 more information for gfs data can be found at https www nco ncep noaa gov pmb products gfs 3 a series of numerical experiments firstly a series of coupled surge and wave simulations for typhoon kalmaegi was conducted as forcing for the wind and pressure fields estimated by using the parametric model and wrf to validate the suwat model in this experiment the mechanism of the after runner storm surge will be clarified in the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin vietnam secondly a series of coupled surge and wave simulations with kalmaegi s features were carried out to investigate which factor is of a primary impact on the after runner storm surge focusing on three sources of the forward speed wind speed and sea level pressure to find it out the experiment is designed as listed in table 1 in exp01 to exp06 the moving speed only changes as either increasing or decreasing it with the 5 km h interval otherwise other characteristics of the typhoon such as the track central pressure and size are sustained in exp07 to exp12 the wind speed only varies at the interval of 2 m s as done in the experiments above in exp13 to exp18 the drop rate of the central pressure only changes with the interval of 5 hpa but the other kalmaegi s characteristics are fixed as well in the experiment the interaction between the surge and wave is considered to simulate the kalmaegi s surge in other words the wave dependent drag coefficient is used to calculate the wind stress in the storm surge module the wave radiation stress is also considered on the momentum equations the wave field is calculated with the unsteady sea surface level and current 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview of typhoon kalmaegi 2014 according to national disaster risk reduction and management council ndrrmc 2014 in the philippines typhoon kalmaegi was generated on september 10 2014 northeast of palau and headed toward a west north direction as shown in fig 3 on september 13 kalmaegi was upgraded to a category one typhoon and made landfall over cagayan the next day with weakened intensity kalmaegi moved to the south china sea and intensified again on september 15 kalmaegi reached its peak strength as making landfall over hainan island then kalmaegi rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as moving toward the west in vietnam kalmaegi brought strong gusty winds and flash floods reported by the media as of september 18 it was reported that the death toll had risen to 9 and 10 were injured damages have also been topped to us 944 000 on september 19 it was reported that 15 were injured a total of 13 people was reported killed by the storm vietnamnet https english vietnamnet vn fms society 112172 nine dead 10 injured in wake of typhoon kalmaegi html 4 2 overview of after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi typhoon kalmaegi made landfall on the northern quang ninh province at 9 pm on september 16 in utc continued to move toward the mainland and then weakened as a tropical depression it caused strong winds at level 9 10 beaufort scale gust at level 10 11 on the coast of quang ninh and hai phong provinces typhoon kalmaegi hit the land at the lowest tide of the day 10 h later in the coastal area of hai phong quang ninh province the sea level has risen with high waves up to 3 4 m resulted in flooding in some low lying areas for instance do son district hai phong this was an unexpected situation because this is not the highest tidal time of the year thuy et al 2014 the storm surge of typhoon kalmaegi has some unusual points in comparison with other usual typhoons time series of the observed total water level predicted tide and extracted residuals total water level predicted tidal level at the stations of hon dau fig 4 a and hon ngu fig 4b during kalmaegi are given in fig 4 where are on the left hand side of the typhoon for instance the surge level at hon dau on the left hand side of the typhoon begins to rise as the typhoon makes landfall and reaches 1 1 m at peak 3 h later lasting the surge level higher than 1 m over 12 h at hon ngu where goes toward the south further from the typhoon track the surge level also rises up to its maximum of 0 5 m 6 h later after the typhoon hits land lasting over 7 h fig 4b fig 5 shows a relation between observed surges and wind speeds sea level pressures at hon dau the surge profile shows a correlation with the wind speed but no correlation with the sea level pressure during typhoon kalmaegi heading for coastal waters of vietnam the national center for hydro meteorology forecasting nchmf regularly updated forecast of the storm surge and warning of coastal inundation in accordance with regulations according to the forecast result the area at risk of storm surge and relevant flood was the northern coastal area of quang ninh with the surge height of about 1 m so called the north coast near cua ong on the right side of the track and the west near hon dau and south near hon ngu coasts on the left side as a matter of convenience see fig 3 b otherwise the forecast was unlikely to cause inundation in the coastal area due to the typhoon hitting land at low tide the nchmf terminated the storm surge forecasting as the typhoon hit the mainland in vietnam on the one hand the peak surge level usually appears with the typhoon s landfall on the other hand the kalmaegi surge generates several hours later after landfall lasting several hours the phenomenon of the kalmaegi surge is similar with the one reported by kim et al 2014 called the after runner storm surge since the maximum surge height appears several hours later after the typhoon passage this unique feature should be taken into account in forecasting to mitigate flooding damage to coastal facilities and casualties due to the storm surge 4 3 mechanism of after runner storm surge 4 3 1 hindcasting the after runner storm surge simulation in order to investigate the reason of the after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi the suwat model was applied by using the wind and pressure fields hindcasted from the parametric wind and pressure model and wrf respectively fig 6 shows comparisons of calculations and observations for the wind speed and sea level pressure at the station of hon dau results show that there is a fairly similarity between the wrf calculation and observation there are relatively shorter time lags of 7 h 0 h between the observed and calculated lowest sea level pressures highest wind speeds as seen in fig 6 a fig 6 b however the parametric wind and pressure model gave large errors of 15 h 12 h for the time when the lowest sea level pressure highest wind speed are captured due to the large error in the symmetric wind and pressure field a series of the storm surge simulation with it resulted in huge differences between the calculation and observation as given later fig 7 presents comparisons between modeled and observed surges at hon dau fig 7 a and hon ngu fig 7 b the surge level simulated by the wrf s wind and pressure well matches the observation at phase and height even though the calculated surge decreases earlier than the observation around 18h september 16th and 12h september 17th resulted from that the 2d surge model was used in this study we have confirmed that a 3d ocean circulation model could remove such discrepancy do not shown here on the other hand the surge reproduced by the parametric wind and pressure model totally fails to simulate the observation as expected because of the discrepancy of the wind and pressure field not given at hon ngu therefore it can be said that the use of the wind and pressure field from the wrf model gives a fairly similar surge in both in the intensity and phase of the storm surge on the coast meanwhile the surge computed with the wind and pressure field from the parametric model is underestimated this result may come from an asymmetry of the kalmaegi s wind and pressure field for instance wrf reproduced the asymmetric wind and pressure field while the parametric model reproduced the symmetric one such a strong asymmetric feature of the typhoon gives rise to the distinctive storm surge on the west and south coasts of the gulf of tonkin vietnam which never observed ever before since the observation began understanding of the after runner storm surge mechanism is critical to redesigning of the early warning system that has been now operated by nchmf 4 3 2 the mechanism of the after runner surge due to typhoon kalmaegi a series of numerical simulations is additionally conducted to elucidate the effect of the asymmetry of the typhoon kalmaegi s wind field on the mechanism of the after runner storm surge in the additional experiment the wrf s wind and pressure field was only used after the typhoon s landfall the wind force is terminated to ignore the effect of the tailwind but the sea level pressure field is activated it means that the wind speed and atmospheric pressure drive the surge before the landfall similar to the ordinary typhoon s weather state while the wind speed is set equal to a zero wind speed the purpose of the idea is to evaluate the role of the tailwind following the typhoon on the pattern of the after runner storm surge results from two experiments conducted with and without the effect of the tailwind are shown in fig 8 at the station of hon dau fig 8 a the surge height and its duration obtained from the additional experiment are much smaller and shorter than those estimated from the hindcast simulation using the full field of wind and pressure it shows that the tailwind contributes the peak surge generation up to 60 meanwhile at the station of hon ngu fig 8 b those in the additional experiment are not only earlier and smaller but also much shorter thus the tailwind of the landfall is a key factor for the generation of the after runner storm surge to illustrate the phenomenon of the after runner storm surge the distribution of the simulated wind and storm surge is shown in the times after the landfall in 0 h fig 9 a in 4 h fig 9b in 6 h fig 9 c and 8 h fig 9 d respectively it can be seen from the figure that when the typhoon hits the land the water level in the northern coastal water of the gulf of tonkin begins to increase due to the wind heading toward the north coast on the right side of the typhoon on the other hand the water level on the west and south coasts near hon dau and hon ngu is sunk below the mean sea level due to the wind blowing toward offshore on the left side of the typhoon four hours later the water level on the northern gulf of tonkin is reaching the highest on the other hand that is beginning to rise on the west and south shores where hon dau and hon ngu are located as seen in fig 9 b 6 h later the water level reaches a peak at hon dau sustaining the peaked surge level for a while due to the wind heading forward the north coast fig 9 c this phenomenon is seen for several hours as the typhoon passed away from the gulf fig 9 d as a result it can be said on the west and south coasts that the effect of the wind parallel to the shoreline becomes more significant after the typhoon landfall then the wind gradually turned to the shore and continued its direction for several hours causing the peaked sea level rise on the west coast near hon dau it is the reason why the higher surge level was prolonged for several hours after the typhoon landed also the water on the northern gulf after rising moves toward the southern gulf which is also the cause of the storm surge in the coastal sea of hon dau and hon ngu as illustrated in fig 10 showing sea surface levels and currents in 4 h after the landfall the current tends to circulate toward the south sea of the gulf because the water level is higher in the north compared to the south additional experiments were conducted for kalmaegi s wind and pressure field one is forcing the only kalmaegi s wind ignoring the pressure while another one is vice versa in order to quantitatively investigate which factor is predominant on the kalmaegi s after runner storm surge by calculating the non dimensional ratio η p e a k w i n d η p e a k w i n d p r e s s u e or η p e a k p r e s s u r e η p e a k w i n d p r e s s u e as shown in fig 11 it is shown that the wind speed is predominant on the peak surge at cua ong while two external forces are of almost the same contribution at hon dau and hon ngu the results described above give lessons for forecasting a storm surge in the early warning system as follows 1 the after runner storm surge can occur after the typhoon s passage and 2 it lasts for several hours furthermore it was found that the after runner storm surge generates under the appropriate meteorological conditions which are satisfied such as the asymmetry of a wind circulation with the wind direction heading perpendicular to the shoreline on the middle coast of the gulf meanwhile the parametric wind and pressure model which is a conventional method well describing a symmetric wind and pressure field for a storm surge simulation was not able to appropriately reproduce the kalmaegi s wind and pressure field especially it could not estimate the strong tailwind in space which is dominant in the surge as shown above as a result the structure of the wind field is critical to the simulation of the after runner storm surge 4 4 the effect of the typhoon parameter on the after runner storm surge in the previous section it was found that the tailwind field is vital to understanding of the after runner storm surge in this section the effect of the typhoon tc parameter on the after runner storm surge is investigated as changing the following factors typhoon intensity wind speed and pressure and moving speed among the tc parameters of track intensity moving speed and radius to maximum wind speed and so on impacts of the track and the radius of the typhoon are beyond the scope of the study 4 4 1 the effect of the moving speed first kalmaegi s characteristics are taken as the reference run as listed in table 1 then we changed the forward speed either maximally 15 km h faster exp01 and minimally 15 km h slower exp06 with the 5 km h interval fig 12 shows time series of calculated surge levels at cua ong fig 12 a hon dau fig 12 b and hon ngu fig 12 c located from the north to the south respectively in fig 12 d the peak surge level is plotted against the moving speed for each station it was found that the time series of the storm surge in the experiment is generally shifted back and forward in the reference run with almost 6 h as changing the moving speed from all the experiments the peak surge level increases at cua ong as the moving speed is slower at hon dau located on the middle coast between cua ong and hon ngu the variation of the peak level is similar to that at cua ong fig 8 b however its peak level decreases due to the slower movement of tc in exp05 10 km h slower and exp06 15 km h slower than that in exp04 5 km h slower interestingly the surge level at cua ong sharply reaches peak level while that at hon dau is sustained for several hours around peak in contrast at hon ngu the peak surge decreases with the longer stagnated peak due to the slower moving speed of the typhoon in fig 13 change rates of the modeled maximum surge level to the kalmaegi s one in percentage are shown demonstrating how the sea surface level rises in the whole bay the slower tc pushes water of up to 20 more toward the north sea near cua ong while it makes seawater of up to 50 decreasing near hon dau and hon ngu when the tc becomes faster the northern sea surface level near cua ong partially goes down while the southern sea is no change near hon dau or slightly increase hon ngu in other words the slower moving speed is attributed to the severer storm surge damage on the north coast on the other hand the storm surge risk on the west coast near hon dau is reduced at a threshold of the moving speed the south coast near hon ngu is exposed to a higher lower risk for the storm surge as a result of the faster slower moving speed the change of the peak surge level on the northern gulf is in line with rego and li 2009 indicating that the slower forward motion results in higher water volumes while that on the southern and western waters is in accordance with the result of thomas et al 2019 that the faster moving speed is attributed to the higher peak thus the coastal water of the gulf of tonkin is the region where both phenomena co exist and then has to be considered in the design of the storm surge forecasting system in the current study we showed the gulf sea of tonkin where exposes the storm surge risk due to both the slower and faster moving speeds that could be attributed to the higher maximum level of the after runner storm surge in other words in a coastal sea where occurs the after runner storm surge the slowing typhoon has a potential of the generation of higher surges such a potential could be investigated by a bunch of events using either a typhoon hurricane modeled by a statistical typhoon model e g nakajo et al 2014 or projected by a climate change experiments e g mizuta et al 2017 then we should evaluate a storm surge risk quantitively and qualitatively to understand a future flood damage 4 4 2 the effect of the typhoon intensity next we changed the fields of either the wind speed or the sea level pressure to investigate how they influence the surge level for the change of the wind speed the sea level pressure field was retained while for that of the central pressure the wind speed was kept invariant fig 14 shows the change of the peak surge level to the wind speed in the experiments of exp07 to exp12 the peak level exponentially increases at all the stations fig 14 a along with the change of the wind speed because the wind stress term on the momentum equation is inverse proportion to the water depth the ratio of the change peak surge level tc kalmaegi s peak surge level goes up to 1 75 at hon dau from 1 5 at hon ngu when the wind speed is 6 m s larger while it goes down to 0 6 at cua ong from 0 7 at hon ngu when it is 6 m s smaller fig 14 b the change range is almost double from the lowest ratio to the highest one when the wind speed is higher the sea surface level highly increases on the whole water and especially up to 120 near cua ong on the northern gulf of tonkin see fig 15 as the wind speed becomes weaker the sea surface level decreases on the entire bay and maximumly up to 50 near cua ong as a result the after runner storm surge is highly sensitive to the wind speed on the coast of the gulf of tonkin the change of the peak level due to the variation of the sea level pressure shows a similar pattern to that due to the wind speed change see fig 16 a the peak level linearly increases as the sea level pressure becomes lower as listed in table 1 it seems that the sea level rise is an independent term of the water depth on the momentum equations the change of the ratio peak surge level tc kalmaegi s peak surge level in the peak surge level is in the range of 0 7 1 4 as seen in fig 16 b the station showing the largest change at the peak is hon ngu while that revealing the smallest change is cua ong in particular the sea surface level entirely increases and especially almost 100 offshore in the south sea of the gulf of tonkin as the tc becomes intensive see fig 17 in contrast it decreases up to 80 offshore in comparison to the kalmaegi s sea surface level from the result we showed that the intensified wind speed brings more severe risk on the coast in addition sophisticated predictions show that the severity is quantitatively identical along with the shoreline on the other hand the severity due to the strengthened sea level pressure decreases from hon ngu where is the farthest area to cua ong on the right hand side of the typhoon as a result we found both the wind speed and sea level pressure could impact the entire gulf sea even though there are some discrepancies due to both components in surge levels along the coast accordingly a gulf sea in which after runner storm surge generates would be influenced by winds and sea level pressures equivalently as shown in fig 11 thus the finding above leads us to develop a new storm surge forecast system or strategy to predict a forthcoming surge accurately the current study focused on how the forward speed and intensity of typhoon kalmaegi contribute to the after runner storm surge behavior and however puts the vulnerability against typhoon s track and size which generate an after runner storm surge with the longer duration at the peak beyond the study if we use massive typhoon datasets projected by ensemble future climate simulations e g nakajo et al 2014 mizuta et al 2017 covering all the typhoon characteristics of forward speed intensity track and size we can enhance our finding on the effect of the typhoon feature on the after runner storm surge statistically supporting a decision maker or tool to release flood warning quickly and accurately 5 conclusions the national center for hydro meteorology forecasting nchmf vietnam was unsuccessful in forecasting the typhoon kalmaegi 2014 storm surge in the gulf of tonkin generating flood damage in low lying areas of the west coast of the gulf thuy et al 2014 the hindcast of the kalmaegi surge clarifies that the peak surge generated 7 h later after the landfall and the higher surge level 1 m lasted almost 10 h at hon dau located on the west coast the large surge was also observed 11 h later at hon ngu on the south coast in the gulf the recent studies addressed such a phenomenon as an after runner storm surge in this study the mechanism of the after runner storm surge due to typhoon kalmaegi was analyzed by suwat model forced by the symmetric and asymmetric fields of the kalmaegi wind and pressure estimated by a parametric model and wrf respectively based on the result of the numerical experiment it was found that the after runner storm surge on the west and south coasts was caused by the strong tailwind following the typhoon passed away toward the continent on the other hand the wind field on the right side of the typhoon is attributed to the ordinary storm surge on the north coast also the wind speed is the predominant factor on the generation of the storm surge on the north coast while both the wind speed and the sea level pressure have the almost identical impact on the after runner storm surge on the west and south coasts in addition understanding of the after runner storm surge against the forward speed and the intensity of typhoon feature is critical to the operation of the current early warning system the change of the forward motion of typhoon shows that slower moving speed results in the higher surge level on the north coast on the right side of the typhoon while the faster speed causes the higher surge level on the west and south shores on the left hand side furthermore the typhoon intensity of the wind speed and sea level pressure makes the sea level rise correlatively on the whole sea of the gulf it means that the asymmetry of the wind and pressure field is fundamental to forecasting of the after runner storm surge and should be taken into account in the early warning system further studies for the size and track of the typhoon are necessary to quantitatively identify their impacts on the after runner storm surge credit authorship contribution statement nguyen ba thuy conceptualization methodology

model reasonably reproduced the observational data the parametric typhoon model provided reasonably simulated results compared to the observed atmospheric pressure and wind speed the validated model was then utilized to explore the impact of waves on the storm surge and the influences of typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast the results showed that comparing the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model the averaged differences at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor are 0 24 m 0 23 m 0 22 m and 0 22 m respectively the wave setup contributes between 6 and 35 to the total storm surge on taiwan s coast furthermore the typhoon track significantly affects the location of low pressure and the wind direction subsequently causing the increase decrease in surge height the intensity of wind stress and the atmospheric pressure play crucial roles in affecting the water level and dominating the surge height along the coast of taiwan keywords swan adcirc storm surge wave induced surge tide surge wave model taiwan coast 1 introduction storm surges are one of the most dangerous natural disasters causing great damage along low lying coasts as a result of subsequent coastal flooding particularly if the storm surges accompany high tides therefore the accuracy of storm surge elevation has become an important issue in the field of coastal oceanography related to coastal flood warning systems coastal regions are increasingly exposed to disasters such as strong wind high waves and storm surges the total water level that affects flood hazards receptors i e people and defence fragility i e the pathway to the receptors is a combination of tide surge and wave effects the combination of these physical processes must be included however it is further complicated by the interaction of these physical processes lewis et al 2019 currents significantly affect wave generation to enhance the bottom friction therefore alter the speed of tidal current lewis et al 2014 2109 the generation of storm surges and waves is closely related to wind stresses strong nonlinear interactions among waves tides and storm surges during typhoons in shallow waters exist and are enhanced by complex bathymetric and topographic configurations xie et al 2001 nicolle et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2013 sebastian et al 2014 yoon and jun 2015 zou and xie 2016 feng et al 2018 poulose et al 2018 the topographic characteristics play an important role in the increase or decrease in wave setup runup and wind induced surge dietrich et al 2010 2011 kennedy et al 2012 bertin et al 2015 tide surge and waves interact with each other through their influences on the water levels and currents which also affect the propagation of waves and the location of wave breaking waves generate a radiation stress gradient to force setup and currents wind waves influence the vertical momentum mixing and bottom friction in turn to affect the circulation funakoshi et al 2008 and dietrich et al 2010 found that wind driven waves increased water levels by 5 20 in the region of a broad continental shelf and increased water levels by more than 35 in coastal areas with steep slopes murty et al 2014 indicated that the inclusion of a wave induced setup in the coupled simulation resulted in a 23 36 increase in peak surge compared to an uncoupled tide surge simulation yoon and jun 2015 noted a maximum contribution to the peak surge height of 40 by the wave induced surge along the southern coast of korea thuy et al 2017 found that the surge wave interaction was crucial to the storm surge simulation on the coast of central vietnam the wave dependent drag improved the accuracy of the storm surge elevation up to 30 and the radiation stress contributed more than 15 yu et al 2017b investigated the effect of wave current interaction on storm surge by a two dimensional wave current coupling model to simulate the hindcast of typhoon morakot in the taiwan strait they found that wave setup contributed up to 24 of the total storm surge with a maximum value of 0 28 m anyway neglecting the interactions between the wind tide surge currents and waves underestimate not only the water level but also the surge peak heights and cannot faithfully catch the peak timing of surge wolf et al 1988 xie et al 2003 wolf 2008 2009 nicolle et al 2009 the different factors including storm type wind stress wave spectrum tidal current water depth seabed roughness and coastal topography affect the surge dynamics which are also crucially influenced by the wave current interactions brown and wolf 2009 yin et al 2009 2017 huang et al 2010 bruneau et al 2011 olabarrieta et al 2011 roland et al 2012 brown et al 2013 sun et al 2013 mulligan et al 2015 suh et al 2015 hopkins et al 2016 several fully coupled models were developed and performed to simulate storm surges tides and waves on the continental shelf or in coastal regions e g bertin et al 2015 cheng et al 2015 lee and kim 2015 suh et al 2015 tasnim et al 2015 yuk et al 2015 xie et al 2016 zou and xie 2016 fortunato et al 2017 thuy et al 2017 in recent years bennett et al 2018 used a high resolution hurricane wind field to drive coupled delft3d swan hydrodynamic and wave models in the great south bay new york the results indicated that the complex variability in total water levels driven by tides ocean storm surge surge from wind and overwash had a crucial influence on the circulation feng et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2019 established a storm surge wave tide coupled model for the coastal areas of zhejiang china and for the bahamas archipelago in the atlantic ocean basin respectively to fully understand the tide surge and wave characteristics the objective of this study is to establish a tide surge wave coupled model for predicting water level and surge height around the taiwan coast to demonstrate the capability and availability of the coupled model the model was calibrated and validated with measured water levels atmospheric pressures wind speeds wave heights and wave periods at different gauge stations under different historical typhoon events the validated model was then exploited to investigate the influence of waves on the storm surge and the effects of the typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast however the extreme water level estimate uncertainties in parameterizations and the wave tide interaction to modulate the wave height using the coupled model are beyond the scope of this study 2 study area 2 1 location taiwan is located between the west side of the pacific ocean and the continental shelf of china and is usually subject to typhoons during the summer and autumn seasons fig 1 a the marine geography of the east coast of taiwan facing the pacific ocean is rocks and gravels with steep bottom slopes with an order of magnitude of 1 m in 10 m however the west coast along the taiwan strait consists of finer sand with milder slopes of an order of magnitude of 1 m in 200 500 m the central mountain range is higher than 3000 m and is oriented in the north south direction in taiwan which causes different typhoon induced sea states on the east and west coasts of taiwan resulting in coastal flooding and producing different oceanographic conditions in the coastal environments ou et al 2002 huang et al 2007 the semidiurnal tide m2 is the dominant tide controlling the hydrodynamics in the taiwan strait and the east coast of taiwan previous studies lin et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 zu et al 2008 zhu et al 2009 zeng et al 2012 yu et al 2015 2017a based on observations and numerical simulations found that in the taiwan strait the tidal range along the western coast was larger than that along the eastern coast and the tidal range in the southern part was smaller than that in the northern part the amplitude of the m2 tide was larger in the region next to china than in taiwan island the mean tidal ranges of some areas in the taiwan strait exceed 4 m zhang et al 2010 also noted that tidal semidiurnal waves were the dominant waves in the taiwan strait and indicated the coexistence of the propagating and standing wave systems when a typhoon invades the taiwan coast storm surge occurs frequently the storm surge induces strong wind and low atmospheric pressure to increase the sea level which causes devastating disasters to achieve efficient coastal management for minimizing the economic and social damages caused by storm surges developing an integrally coupled tide surge wave model to accurately predict surge for coastal defense is vitally important 2 2 observations during typhoons water level buoys and metrological sensors were deployed by the central weather bureau taiwan to collect the measured data of water level wave height wave period wind speed and air pressure the water level and meteorological gauge stations are located at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor to collect the measured water level wind speed and air pressure data while the buoy stations are set up at hsinchu kinmen penghu qigu eluanbi and suao to collect the measured wave height and wave period data fig 1b all measured data during typhoon events were provided by the central weather bureau for further model calibration and validation 3 methods the tide surge wave coupled model was applied to simulate the typhoon induced storm surges in the study area during historical typhoon events the modeling system is a coupled wave tidal current and astronomical tide model adopting the same computational domain and grid for all the physical processes the contribution of wave induced setup and set down to the total water level the effects of tides and storm surges on wave propagation and the influence of water levels and currents on wind waves have been considered in the dynamic interaction between the wave surge and tidal components the atmospheric pressure field was calculated using the holland formula 1980 while the wind field was derived using the jelesnianski formula 1965 a flexible triangular unstructured grid was used for both wave and hydrodynamic models to take advantage of accurately representing the complex bathymetry and coastal geometry 3 1 swan model the swan simulating waves nearshore is a third generation wind wave model used to calculate the evolution of waves in geographic space and time based on the wave action density spectrum the model can be used to predict the relative frequency and the wave direction based on the governing equation of action balance booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 the parameterizations of the sink and source mechanisms are found in booij et al 1999 the unstructured grids implemented in swan exploit an analog to the four direction gauss seidal iteration technique to maintain unconditional stability zijlema 2010 the swan model computes the wave action density spectrum at the vertices of an unstructured triangular mesh to order the mesh vertices through sweeping processes for updating the action density using information from the neighboring vertices 3 2 adcirc hydrodynamic model the tide storm surge depth averaged version of the adcirc 2ddi model that solves the vertically integrated continuity equation for water level and vertically integrated momentum equations for the currents at different ranges of scales is adopted in this study luettich and westerink 2004 the implicit and explicit procedures are used to solve the generalized wave continuity equation gwce the implicit solution adopts the jacobi conjugate gradient method according to convergence by iteration the explicit solution uses the lumped diagonal mass matrix dietrich et al 2004 a sophisticated algorithm for wetting and drying to periodically activate and deactivate the grid elements during inundation and recession of the coastal topography is adopted in the adcirc model dietrich et al 2004 dietrich 2005 dick et al 2013 the input to the adcirc model includes the topography and bathymetry with an unstructured grid the spatial distributions of the wind velocity vector and pressure gradient the wave induced stresses the bottom drag coefficient and the boundary conditions the output has the time water level and two dimensional velocity fields 3 3 swan and adcirc coupled model the unstructured grid swan model and adcirc model were integrally coupled by dietrich et al 2011 to become the swan adcirc model the adcirc model and the swan model share the same unstructured finite element grid in the first step the adcirc model interpolates the wind and pressure with spatial and temporal variations which are calculated from the parametric typhoon model to the computational vertices and runs to obtain water levels and velocity fields then the wind fields water levels and velocity fields are passed to the swan model to yield the wave spectrum by solving the wave action density balance equation the radiation stress resulting from surface gravity waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 is then passed to the adcirc model to calculate the water levels and velocity fields 3 4 parametric typhoon model wind stress and atmospheric pressure are responsible for generating the storm surge on the sea surface wind and pressure induced by typhoons are the primary factors for simulating storm surges murty et al 2014 adopted the dynamic wind model jelesnianski and taylor 1973 to derive the wind field and the equations to model the pressure determined from the wind speed by balance forces powell and houston 1999 rao et al 2012 lin et al 2018 executed the ensemble typhoon forecast i e wrf members to generate wind and atmospheric pressure fields which input to run the storm surge model chen et al 2019 employed the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform v2 ccmpv2 blended with the parametric typhoon model to product wind fields which were served as driving force in the storm surge wave model torres et al 2019 used different wind models including the european center for medium range weather forecasts the northeast coastal ocean forecasting system based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model and parametric wind based on national hurricane center datasets https www nhc noaa gov data to simulate storm surges and waves in the present study the wind and pressure fields are calculated according to independent formulas to simplify the numerical scheme the atmospheric pressure field for a typhoon can be calculated using the following equation holland 1980 1 p a p c δ p exp r r m b δ p p e p c r 0 where p c denotes the ambient pressure δ p represents the pressure drop r indicates the radius estimated from the typhoon center r m is the radius of the maximum wind speed and b expresses the shape parameter calculated according to the following empirical relationship jakobsen and madsen 2004 2 b 0 1397 δ p 0 288 r 0 although typhoons have different shapes in general they can be represented as a circular storm passing over the ocean the model developed by jelesnianski 1965 was adopted to calculate the wind field expressed as the following equations 3 w r r m r u w i v w j w m 1 r r r m 3 2 a

model implementation in the present study the modeling domain covers the region within longitudes 117 e to 125 e and latitudes 21 n to 26 n the domain consists of the western pacific ocean the taiwan strait the south china sea and the east china sea fig 1a the bathymetric data were collected from the global topography database of the university of california at san diego https topex ucsd edu www html srtm30 plus html and from the ocean data bank of the ministry of science and technology taiwan http www odb ntu edu tw en fig 1a shows the bathymetry and topography map of the study domain to fit the complex shoreline of taiwan an unstructured grid was used to generate the mesh for model simulation the triangulated irregular network was generated for the study area using the collected bathymetric data the mesh generation package sms surface water modeling system was used to generate the computational grids the modeling domain is composed of 18 453 m unstructured triangular elements and 9560 nodes fig 1c the mesh resolution ranges from 2 km to 11 km it can be seen that the coastline of taiwan consisted of fine meshes compared to the coarse meshes that were farther away from the coastline of taiwan fig 1c murty et al 2014 used the minimum and maximum grid sizes which were 1 km along the shallow coast and 20 km along the offshore boundary in the bay of bengal respectively for predicting surge heights compared to the grid size used in other literature the grid size generated in our study is sufficient for precise computation of storm surge to drive tidal force at the open boundaries for the adcirc model a global ocean model developed by the oregon state university which is the topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo http volkov oce orst edu tides tpxo7 2 html is used to specify the open boundaries the detailed method used to compute global tides can be found in egbert et al 1994 and egbert and erofeeva 2002 the water levels and velocities at all computational nodes were set to zero at initialization bottom friction is represented by the quadratic bottom friction stress formulae dietsche et al 2007 the bottom friction coefficient used in the coupled model is 0 004 and the horizontal eddy viscosity is 5 0 m2 s bhaskaran et al 2014 the time step is 20 s for the adcirc and swan model runs the coupling time interval for the adcirc and swan models was set to 3600 s within the swan model wave directions are discretized into 36 frequency bins of 10 each while wave frequencies are divided into 40 bins ranging from 0 03 to 1 4 hz on a logarithmic scale 3 6 statistical error for model performance the model performance adopted to compare the predicted results with the observational data was quantitatively evaluated using three criteria including the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and skill the statistical error for skill is represented by the following equation willmott 1981 warner et al 2005 5 s k i l l 1 i 1 n η m i η o i 2 i 1 n η m i η o η o i η o 2 where n is the total number of data η m denotes the modeled value η o represents the observed value and η o is the mean of the observed value a skill value of 1 0 represents a perfect model performance a skill value between 0 65 and 1 indicates excellent performance a skill value between 0 5 and 0 65 presents very good performance a skill value in the range of 0 2 0 5 denotes good performance and a skill value of less than 0 2 means poor performance chen et al 2016 4 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation is a vitally important procedure to guarantee model reliability the bottom friction coefficient is crucial parameter to be adjusted in the coupled model to minimize the error between the simulated and observed data for model calibration and validation we used the manual adjustment of bottom friction coefficient to achieve the minimum error the bottom friction coefficient is adopted 0 004 which is in the reasonable ranges documented in luettich et al 1992 the observational data were collected from the central weather bureau taiwan and used to validate the predictive capabilities of the model two historical typhoon events typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 were used for model calibration liu et al 2016 two other typhoon events typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for further model validation the path of these four typhoon events is illustrated in fig 2 according to the classification by the central weather bureau taiwan typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon saola 2012 belong to typhoon path 2 while typhoon morakot 2009 and typhoon soudelor 2015 are classified as typhoon path 3 4 1 model calibration in the model calibration procedure the tide surge wave model was considered in the model simulations the comparisons of the modeled and observed water levels at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor during typhoon morakot 2009 are illustrated in fig 3 the model shows reasonable simulated tides and storm surges at different stations table 1 shows the model performance between the simulated and observed water levels at different gauge stations with typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 for model calibration even though the comparison of modeled and observed water levels is not shown with the figure for typhoon janhmi 2009 the maximum mae and rmse values are 0 31 m and 0 39 m respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill value ranges between 0 87 and 0 99 attributing to excellent performance fig 4 and fig 5 present the comparisons between the simulated and observed wind fields and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures respectively at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor the results indicated that the computed wind speeds did not reproduce the observations at some stations well while the computed atmospheric pressures matched the observations fundamentally the wind field is an important force to drive the hydrodynamics for simulating the water level because the comparison of the computed and observed wind speeds did not really match slight differences were found between the simulated and observed water levels at some stations fig 3 torres et al 2019 found that the parametric typhoon model did not reproduce the wind fields far away from the typhoon center because it was difficult for the model to accurately calculate the structure of the typhoon at specific locations table 2 and table 3 indicate the model performance between the simulated and observed wind speeds and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures respectively at different gauge stations using typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 for model calibration table 2 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for wind speed are 17 82 m s and 20 49 m s respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill scores are in the range of 0 21 and 0 9 indicating that the model performance is between good and excellent according to table 3 the maximum mae and rmse values for atmospheric pressure are 6 53 hpa and 8 27 hpa respectively at taipei tamsui for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill score ranges from 0 64 to 0 90 indicating that the model performance is between very good and excellent the comparisons between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods at suao buoy kinmen buoy penghu buoy qigu buoy eluanbi buoy and hsinchu buoy are displayed in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively these figures indicated that the simulated wave heights failed to catch the observations at some stations but the simulated wave periods matched the observations all of the impact factors including wind speed atmospheric pressure and wave height contribute to the tide and surge however the simulated and observed tides and surges presented in fig 3 are reasonable matches table 4 presents the model performance between the simulated and observed wave heights at the buoy stations it shows that the maximum mae and rmse values are 2 24 m and 2 43 m at the eluanbi buoy for typhoon morakot 2009 the skill score ranges between 0 33 and 0 89 indicating that the model performance is in the range of good and excellent conditions table 5 shows the model performance between the simulated and observed wave periods at the buoy stations the maximum mae and rmse values are 1 65 s and 2 19 s respectively at the qigu buoy for typhoon jangmi 2008 the model performance ranges between good and excellent conditions as a result of the skill scores ranging between 0 26 and 0 84 4 2 model validation the historical typhoon events including typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for model validation because of the limitations of article space the validation results with only typhoon saola 2012 are presented fig 8 presents the comparisons of modeled and observed water levels at the different gauge stations during typhoon saola 2012 this indicates that the simulated results mimic the observed water levels with tide and storm surge even though the storm surge in the case of typhoon saola 2012 is not so high the validation results also provide the information that the track of typhoon significantly affects the surge height the track of typhoon saola 2012 passed through the sea surface of northern taiwan fig 2a resulting in little surge heights at different gauge stations table 1 shows the model performance with the mae rmse and skill values for typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 the maximum mae and rmse values are 0 35 m and 0 45 m respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon saolo 2012 however the skill value ranges between 0 79 and 0 98 representing excellent model performance the comparisons between the simulated and observed wind fields and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures during typhoon saola 2012 are illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively for the different gauge stations these figures indicate that the simulated wind fields and atmospheric pressures catch the trends of observations tables 2 and 3 also present the model performances for wind speed and atmospheric pressure respectively at different gauge stations with typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 table 2 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for the wind speed reach 15 64 m s and 18 15 m s respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon soudelor 2015 the skill scores are in the range of 0 28 and 0 9 representing that the model performance ranges between good and excellent table 3 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for the atmospheric pressure are 7 07 hpa and 10 42 hpa respectively at taipei tamsui for typhoon soudelor 2015 the skill score ranges from 0 54 to 0 96 indicating that the model performance ranges between very good and excellent fig 11 and fig 12 display the comparisons between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods respectively at the suao buoy kinmen buoy penghu buoy qigu buoy eluanbi buoy and hsinchu buoy for typhoon saola 2012 in general the simulated wave heights and wave periods quantitatively match the measured data even though there is a slight phase shift in the simulated and measured wave heights at the kienmen buoy penghu buoy and qigu buoy the wave height reached over 10 m at the suao buoy as the typhoon moved northwest of taiwan fig 11a the maximum wave heights appeared in the right forward quadrant of the typhoon center and propagated in the same direction as the typhoon because the wind velocity on the right side of the typhoon by adding the typhoon translation speed increased moon et al 2003 moon et al 2003 also demonstrated that the typhoon generated wave field was dominated by the radius of maximum wind and typhoon translation speed the model performances between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods for model validation are displayed in tables 4 and 5 respectively the mae and rmse values of the wave height range between 0 38 m and 2 15 m and 0 57 m and 2 44 m respectively the skill scores of the wave height range between 0 29 and 0 97 as shown in table 5 the mae and rmse values of the wave period are between 0 59 s and 2 44 s and 0 79 s and 2 75 s respectively the skill scores are between 0 28 and 0 93 for model validation the wide range of skill scores indicated that the wave height and wave period at some gauge stations cannot be accurately simulated see tables 4 and 5 5 model diagnostics and discussion the storm surge is mainly controlled by several factors including astronomical tide atmospheric pressure wind stress typhoon track and waves sebastian et al 2014 yuk et al 2015 zou and xie 2016 hussain and tajima 2017 after the model calibration and validation procedures the validated model was applied to explore the influence of the wave setup on the tide and storm surge and the effect of the atmospheric pressure and wind stress on the surge height to compare and analyze the simulated results the case of typhoon morakot 2009 was taken as the baseline 5 1 influence of wave on storm surge to investigate the influence of wave action on storm surge the historical typhoon event i e typhoon morakot was used to serve as the case study for carrying out with the tide surge wave adcirc swan model and the tide surge only adcirc model the simulated water level using the tide surge wave model and tide surge model and the difference in water levels is illustrated in fig 13 the simulated water levels at different gauge stations using the tide surge model cannot faithfully reproduce the observations while the tide surge wave model improves the simulated water levels to match the observations the skill score using the tide surge wave model ranges from 0 9 to 0 99 decreasing from 0 49 to 0 98 using the tide surge model comparing the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model the averaged differences at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor are 0 24 m 0 23 m 0 22 m and 0 22 m respectively the contributions of wave setup to the total storm surge have been documented in several studies e g dietrich et al 2010 murty et al 2014 yoon and jun 2015 thuy et al 2017 yu et al 2017 how the wave setup contributes to the total storm surge depends on the topography and bathymetry in the coastal sea region funakoshi et al 2008 chen et al 2008 yu et al 2017b used fine horizontal resolution mesh in the range of 0 7 2 5 km in the surf zone and coarse mesh resolution of 2 5 36 km in the taiwan strait and western pacific regions to explore that the contribution of wave setup on total storm surge was up to 24 however in the present study the contribution of wave setup to the total storm surge ranges between 6 and 35 on taiwan s coast in the future work a finer mesh i e hundreds of meters would be used to explore the characteristics of wave setup and wave setdown in the coast of taiwan 5 2 influence of the typhoon track the typhoon track and landfall location significantly influence the water level and storm surge height lewis et al 2014 sebastian et al 2014 poulose et al 2018 to explore how the typhoon track affects the surge height model experiments were conducted with different typhoon tracks including typhoon path 3 for typhoon morakot 2009 path 2 for typhoon dujuan 2015 and path 4 for typhoon fanapi 2010 fig 2b typhoon morakot 2009 has been calibrated with measured data and is regarded as the baseline the wind atmospheric pressure and typhoon intensity for path 2 and path 4 are considered the same as for path 3 for typhoon morakot 2009 this means that the major differences in these three runs are the typhoon tracks and landfall locations for typhoon path 2 path 3 and path 4 the predicted storm surge heights at the different gauge stations for typhoon paths 2 3 and 4 are displayed in fig 14 it shows that for typhoon path 2 the typhoon center directly passed taipei tamsui and hualien harbor therefore the surge height increased during the period of august 7 12 00 24 00 as a result of low pressure in the center of the typhoon fig 14a and a during the same period the wind around the center of the typhoon was blown inland from the taiwan strait offshore wind causing an increase in the surge height at taichung harbor fig 14b kaohsiung harbor is also affected by the wind effect fig 14c but the surge height is less obvious than at taichung harbor as the typhoon center moved away from taiwan the wind was blown from inland to the taiwan strait resulting in a decreasing surge height for typhoon path 3 i e typhoon morakot the typhoon center passed directly through hualien harbor causing an increase in the surge height fig 14d because the exit point of the typhoon center is located on the south side of taipei tamsui the low pressure induced an increase in the surge height fig 14a the increasing surge height at taichung harbor resulted from the wind effect as the typhoon center moved away from taiwan the surge height sharply decreased fig 14b when the typhoon path 4 occurred the typhoon center passed through the north side of hualien harbor and the wind was blowing from the ocean to inland i e onshore wind resulting in an increase in the surge height fig 14d when the typhoon center went to the south of taiwan and passed through the north side of kaohsiung harbor the surge height was higher than those for path 2 and path 3 during august 8 10 fig 14c this was the reason that the low pressure induced surge height and wind direction was from the taiwan strait to the inland moreover the taipei tamsui and taichung harbor are located on the north side of the typhoon center and the wind direction was from inland to the taiwan strait resulting in a decrease in the surge height fig 14a and b we found that the typhoon track significantly affected the location of the low pressure and wind direction subsequently resulting in the increase decrease in surge height pugh 1996 proposed an equation for storm surge η α τ w w g h where τ w represents the wind stress g indicates the gravity acceleration h denotes the water depth and w is the width of continental shelf this equation demonstrated that the wind direction from the taiwan strait i e deep water to inland i e shallow water raised the surge height 5 3 influence of wind stress to explore the influence of wind stress on the storm surge height the adcirc and swan coupled model was used to conduct the experiments typhoon morakot 2009 served as a baseline and the wind speed was raised 20 and decreased 20 based on the wind speed of typhoon morakot 2009 the simulated surge heights for the baseline wind speed plus 20 and wind speed minus 20 at the different stations are displayed in fig 15 obviously the differences in the storm surge heights occurred on august 8 when the typhoon approached land in taiwan two factors wind speed and wind direction can affect the surge height according to the experimental results the surge height for increasing the wind speed by 20 is less than that for decreasing the wind speed by 20 on august 8 at taipei tamsui kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor fig 15a c and 15d this means that the offshore wind occurred at that time the wind direction changed quickly at taichung harbor on august 8 when the onshore wind occurred the increasing the wind speed by 20 resulted in increased surge height conversely the offshore wind resulted in decreasing surge height at taichung harbor fig 15b peng et al 2006 conducted model experiments with an idealized case and demonstrated that the onshore winds increased the sea level while the offshore winds decreased the sea level pugh 1996 developed a sample formation to estimate the surge height which was closely related to the wind speed and average water depth rego and li 2010 reported that wind stress was the key factor in generating the surge height in shallow water zones in the numerical experiments we found that the wind speed and wind direction were of crucial importance to affect the surge height along taiwan s coast 5 4 influence of atmospheric pressure forcing a long period wave induced by strong wind and atmospheric pressure gradients is a major factor for generating storm surges except for the strong wind the atmospheric pressure is another driving force for raising the surge height to examine the influence of atmospheric pressure forcing on surge height the atmospheric pressure was increased and decreased by 1 based on the baseline case for typhoon morakot 2009 using the adcirc and swan coupled model fig 16 illustrates the simulated surge heights for the baseline atmospheric pressure plus 1 and atmospheric pressure minus 1 at different stations compared to the baseline case the atmospheric pressure increased by 1 and decreased by 1 resulted in decreasing and increasing surge height respectively the differences in the peak surge height compared with the baseline case range from 2 8 cm to 10 9 cm and from 3 0 cm to 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively dean and dalrymple 2002 estimated the storm surge height η a caused by atmospheric pressure drop δ p the equation can be expressed as η a 1 04 δ p for example at hualien harbor this simple equation was used to estimate the differences in peak surge height for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 when the atmospheric pressures increase and decrease 1 the pressure drops are 9 26 hp and 9 25 hp respectively compared to the baseline atmospheric pressure 756 38 hp during the peak surge height the differences in the peak surge height can be estimated by 9 26 1 04 9 63 cm and 9 25 1 04 9 63 cm the differences in the peak surge heights are 9 6 cm and 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively compared to the baseline case according to fig 16d we also estimated differences in the peak surge height using a simple equation dean and dalrymple 2002 and found that the estimated results were very close to the simulated results at other stations fig 16a b and 16c 6 conclusion the coupled tide surge wave model adcirc swan was established to simulate the tides storm surges and waves around taiwan s coast to ascertain the model prediction capability two historical typhoon events typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 were adopted for model calibration and two other typhoon events typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for model validation the measured water level wave height wave period wind speed and air pressure data at different gauge stations were collected and used for model calibration and validation generally the model simulation results reasonably reproduced the measured data furthermore the validated model was applied to explore the influence of waves on the tide and storm surge and the effects of the typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast to take into account the influence of waves on the storm surge we calculated the water levels using the tide surge wave adcirc swan model and the tide surge only adcirc model compared to the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model for the study case i e typhoon morakot we found that the contribution by wave setup to the total storm surge ranged between 6 and 35 on taiwan s coast according to the simulated surge heights using different typhoon tracks the results revealed that the typhoon track significantly affected the location of low pressure and the wind direction subsequently causing the increase decrease in the surge height at different gauge stations in the model diagnostics the wind stress and the atmospheric pressure also play crucial roles in determining the storm surge height the onshore winds increased the surge height while the offshore winds decreased the surge height the differences in the peak surge height compared with the baseline i e typhoon morakot ranged from 2 8 cm to 10 9 cm and from 3 0 cm to 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively the simple equation developed by dean and dalrymple 2002 can be used to estimate the differences in the peak surge height the simulated results in this paper significantly improve the understanding of the different physical factors that dominate the storm surge height during typhoon events on the coast of taiwan further study would be focused on investigating the nonlinear effect of tide surge wave interaction and establishing the early warning system for storm surge during typhoon events the impact of wave tide interaction on modulating the

21696,the coupled tide surge and wave model was established for the coast of taiwan and applied to simulate the storm surge during typhoon events to prove the capability and availability of the coupled model the model was calibrated and validated with measured water levels atmospheric pressures wind speeds wave heights and wave periods at different gauge stations under different historical typhoon events based on the statistical metrics including the mean absolute error root mean square error and skill the simulated tide surge wave height and wave period using coupled tide surge wave model reasonably reproduced the observational data the parametric typhoon model provided reasonably simulated results compared to the observed atmospheric pressure and wind speed the validated model was then utilized to explore the impact of waves on the storm surge and the influences of typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast the results showed that comparing the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model the averaged differences at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor are 0 24 m 0 23 m 0 22 m and 0 22 m respectively the wave setup contributes between 6 and 35 to the total storm surge on taiwan s coast furthermore the typhoon track significantly affects the location of low pressure and the wind direction subsequently causing the increase decrease in surge height the intensity of wind stress and the atmospheric pressure play crucial roles in affecting the water level and dominating the surge height along the coast of taiwan keywords swan adcirc storm surge wave induced surge tide surge wave model taiwan coast 1 introduction storm surges are one of the most dangerous natural disasters causing great damage along low lying coasts as a result of subsequent coastal flooding particularly if the storm surges accompany high tides therefore the accuracy of storm surge elevation has become an important issue in the field of coastal oceanography related to coastal flood warning systems coastal regions are increasingly exposed to disasters such as strong wind high waves and storm surges the total water level that affects flood hazards receptors i e people and defence fragility i e the pathway to the receptors is a combination of tide surge and wave effects the combination of these physical processes must be included however it is further complicated by the interaction of these physical processes lewis et al 2019 currents significantly affect wave generation to enhance the bottom friction therefore alter the speed of tidal current lewis et al 2014 2109 the generation of storm surges and waves is closely related to wind stresses strong nonlinear interactions among waves tides and storm surges during typhoons in shallow waters exist and are enhanced by complex bathymetric and topographic configurations xie et al 2001 nicolle et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2013 sebastian et al 2014 yoon and jun 2015 zou and xie 2016 feng et al 2018 poulose et al 2018 the topographic characteristics play an important role in the increase or decrease in wave setup runup and wind induced surge dietrich et al 2010 2011 kennedy et al 2012 bertin et al 2015 tide surge and waves interact with each other through their influences on the water levels and currents which also affect the propagation of waves and the location of wave breaking waves generate a radiation stress gradient to force setup and currents wind waves influence the vertical momentum mixing and bottom friction in turn to affect the circulation funakoshi et al 2008 and dietrich et al 2010 found that wind driven waves increased water levels by 5 20 in the region of a broad continental shelf and increased water levels by more than 35 in coastal areas with steep slopes murty et al 2014 indicated that the inclusion of a wave induced setup in the coupled simulation resulted in a 23 36 increase in peak surge compared to an uncoupled tide surge simulation yoon and jun 2015 noted a maximum contribution to the peak surge height of 40 by the wave induced surge along the southern coast of korea thuy et al 2017 found that the surge wave interaction was crucial to the storm surge simulation on the coast of central vietnam the wave dependent drag improved the accuracy of the storm surge elevation up to 30 and the radiation stress contributed more than 15 yu et al 2017b investigated the effect of wave current interaction on storm surge by a two dimensional wave current coupling model to simulate the hindcast of typhoon morakot in the taiwan strait they found that wave setup contributed up to 24 of the total storm surge with a maximum value of 0 28 m anyway neglecting the interactions between the wind tide surge currents and waves underestimate not only the water level but also the surge peak heights and cannot faithfully catch the peak timing of surge wolf et al 1988 xie et al 2003 wolf 2008 2009 nicolle et al 2009 the different factors including storm type wind stress wave spectrum tidal current water depth seabed roughness and coastal topography affect the surge dynamics which are also crucially influenced by the wave current interactions brown and wolf 2009 yin et al 2009 2017 huang et al 2010 bruneau et al 2011 olabarrieta et al 2011 roland et al 2012 brown et al 2013 sun et al 2013 mulligan et al 2015 suh et al 2015 hopkins et al 2016 several fully coupled models were developed and performed to simulate storm surges tides and waves on the continental shelf or in coastal regions e g bertin et al 2015 cheng et al 2015 lee and kim 2015 suh et al 2015 tasnim et al 2015 yuk et al 2015 xie et al 2016 zou and xie 2016 fortunato et al 2017 thuy et al 2017 in recent years bennett et al 2018 used a high resolution hurricane wind field to drive coupled delft3d swan hydrodynamic and wave models in the great south bay new york the results indicated that the complex variability in total water levels driven by tides ocean storm surge surge from wind and overwash had a crucial influence on the circulation feng et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2019 established a storm surge wave tide coupled model for the coastal areas of zhejiang china and for the bahamas archipelago in the atlantic ocean basin respectively to fully understand the tide surge and wave characteristics the objective of this study is to establish a tide surge wave coupled model for predicting water level and surge height around the taiwan coast to demonstrate the capability and availability of the coupled model the model was calibrated and validated with measured water levels atmospheric pressures wind speeds wave heights and wave periods at different gauge stations under different historical typhoon events the validated model was then exploited to investigate the influence of waves on the storm surge and the effects of the typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast however the extreme water level estimate uncertainties in parameterizations and the wave tide interaction to modulate the wave height using the coupled model are beyond the scope of this study 2 study area 2 1 location taiwan is located between the west side of the pacific ocean and the continental shelf of china and is usually subject to typhoons during the summer and autumn seasons fig 1 a the marine geography of the east coast of taiwan facing the pacific ocean is rocks and gravels with steep bottom slopes with an order of magnitude of 1 m in 10 m however the west coast along the taiwan strait consists of finer sand with milder slopes of an order of magnitude of 1 m in 200 500 m the central mountain range is higher than 3000 m and is oriented in the north south direction in taiwan which causes different typhoon induced sea states on the east and west coasts of taiwan resulting in coastal flooding and producing different oceanographic conditions in the coastal environments ou et al 2002 huang et al 2007 the semidiurnal tide m2 is the dominant tide controlling the hydrodynamics in the taiwan strait and the east coast of taiwan previous studies lin et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 zu et al 2008 zhu et al 2009 zeng et al 2012 yu et al 2015 2017a based on observations and numerical simulations found that in the taiwan strait the tidal range along the western coast was larger than that along the eastern coast and the tidal range in the southern part was smaller than that in the northern part the amplitude of the m2 tide was larger in the region next to china than in taiwan island the mean tidal ranges of some areas in the taiwan strait exceed 4 m zhang et al 2010 also noted that tidal semidiurnal waves were the dominant waves in the taiwan strait and indicated the coexistence of the propagating and standing wave systems when a typhoon invades the taiwan coast storm surge occurs frequently the storm surge induces strong wind and low atmospheric pressure to increase the sea level which causes devastating disasters to achieve efficient coastal management for minimizing the economic and social damages caused by storm surges developing an integrally coupled tide surge wave model to accurately predict surge for coastal defense is vitally important 2 2 observations during typhoons water level buoys and metrological sensors were deployed by the central weather bureau taiwan to collect the measured data of water level wave height wave period wind speed and air pressure the water level and meteorological gauge stations are located at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor to collect the measured water level wind speed and air pressure data while the buoy stations are set up at hsinchu kinmen penghu qigu eluanbi and suao to collect the measured wave height and wave period data fig 1b all measured data during typhoon events were provided by the central weather bureau for further model calibration and validation 3 methods the tide surge wave coupled model was applied to simulate the typhoon induced storm surges in the study area during historical typhoon events the modeling system is a coupled wave tidal current and astronomical tide model adopting the same computational domain and grid for all the physical processes the contribution of wave induced setup and set down to the total water level the effects of tides and storm surges on wave propagation and the influence of water levels and currents on wind waves have been considered in the dynamic interaction between the wave surge and tidal components the atmospheric pressure field was calculated using the holland formula 1980 while the wind field was derived using the jelesnianski formula 1965 a flexible triangular unstructured grid was used for both wave and hydrodynamic models to take advantage of accurately representing the complex bathymetry and coastal geometry 3 1 swan model the swan simulating waves nearshore is a third generation wind wave model used to calculate the evolution of waves in geographic space and time based on the wave action density spectrum the model can be used to predict the relative frequency and the wave direction based on the governing equation of action balance booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 the parameterizations of the sink and source mechanisms are found in booij et al 1999 the unstructured grids implemented in swan exploit an analog to the four direction gauss seidal iteration technique to maintain unconditional stability zijlema 2010 the swan model computes the wave action density spectrum at the vertices of an unstructured triangular mesh to order the mesh vertices through sweeping processes for updating the action density using information from the neighboring vertices 3 2 adcirc hydrodynamic model the tide storm surge depth averaged version of the adcirc 2ddi model that solves the vertically integrated continuity equation for water level and vertically integrated momentum equations for the currents at different ranges of scales is adopted in this study luettich and westerink 2004 the implicit and explicit procedures are used to solve the generalized wave continuity equation gwce the implicit solution adopts the jacobi conjugate gradient method according to convergence by iteration the explicit solution uses the lumped diagonal mass matrix dietrich et al 2004 a sophisticated algorithm for wetting and drying to periodically activate and deactivate the grid elements during inundation and recession of the coastal topography is adopted in the adcirc model dietrich et al 2004 dietrich 2005 dick et al 2013 the input to the adcirc model includes the topography and bathymetry with an unstructured grid the spatial distributions of the wind velocity vector and pressure gradient the wave induced stresses the bottom drag coefficient and the boundary conditions the output has the time water level and two dimensional velocity fields 3 3 swan and adcirc coupled model the unstructured grid swan model and adcirc model were integrally coupled by dietrich et al 2011 to become the swan adcirc model the adcirc model and the swan model share the same unstructured finite element grid in the first step the adcirc model interpolates the wind and pressure with spatial and temporal variations which are calculated from the parametric typhoon model to the computational vertices and runs to obtain water levels and velocity fields then the wind fields water levels and velocity fields are passed to the swan model to yield the wave spectrum by solving the wave action density balance equation the radiation stress resulting from surface gravity waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 is then passed to the adcirc model to calculate the water levels and velocity fields 3 4 parametric typhoon model wind stress and atmospheric pressure are responsible for generating the storm surge on the sea surface wind and pressure induced by typhoons are the primary factors for simulating storm surges murty et al 2014 adopted the dynamic wind model jelesnianski and taylor 1973 to derive the wind field and the equations to model the pressure determined from the wind speed by balance forces powell and houston 1999 rao et al 2012 lin et al 2018 executed the ensemble typhoon forecast i e wrf members to generate wind and atmospheric pressure fields which input to run the storm surge model chen et al 2019 employed the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform v2 ccmpv2 blended with the parametric typhoon model to product wind fields which were served as driving force in the storm surge wave model torres et al 2019 used different wind models including the european center for medium range weather forecasts the northeast coastal ocean forecasting system based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model and parametric wind based on national hurricane center datasets https www nhc noaa gov data to simulate storm surges and waves in the present study the wind and pressure fields are calculated according to independent formulas to simplify the numerical scheme the atmospheric pressure field for a typhoon can be calculated using the following equation holland 1980 1 p a p c δ p exp r r m b δ p p e p c r 0 where p c denotes the ambient pressure δ p represents the pressure drop r indicates the radius estimated from the typhoon center r m is the radius of the maximum wind speed and b expresses the shape parameter calculated according to the following empirical relationship jakobsen and madsen 2004 2 b 0 1397 δ p 0 288 r 0 although typhoons have different shapes in general they can be represented as a circular storm passing over the ocean the model developed by jelesnianski 1965 was adopted to calculate the wind field expressed as the following equations 3 w r r m r u w i v w j w m 1 r r r m 3 2 a

model implementation in the present study the modeling domain covers the region within longitudes 117 e to 125 e and latitudes 21 n to 26 n the domain consists of the western pacific ocean the taiwan strait the south china sea and the east china sea fig 1a the bathymetric data were collected from the global topography database of the university of california at san diego https topex ucsd edu www html srtm30 plus html and from the ocean data bank of the ministry of science and technology taiwan http www odb ntu edu tw en fig 1a shows the bathymetry and topography map of the study domain to fit the complex shoreline of taiwan an unstructured grid was used to generate the mesh for model simulation the triangulated irregular network was generated for the study area using the collected bathymetric data the mesh generation package sms surface water modeling system was used to generate the computational grids the modeling domain is composed of 18 453 m unstructured triangular elements and 9560 nodes fig 1c the mesh resolution ranges from 2 km to 11 km it can be seen that the coastline of taiwan consisted of fine meshes compared to the coarse meshes that were farther away from the coastline of taiwan fig 1c murty et al 2014 used the minimum and maximum grid sizes which were 1 km along the shallow coast and 20 km along the offshore boundary in the bay of bengal respectively for predicting surge heights compared to the grid size used in other literature the grid size generated in our study is sufficient for precise computation of storm surge to drive tidal force at the open boundaries for the adcirc model a global ocean model developed by the oregon state university which is the topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo http volkov oce orst edu tides tpxo7 2 html is used to specify the open boundaries the detailed method used to compute global tides can be found in egbert et al 1994 and egbert and erofeeva 2002 the water levels and velocities at all computational nodes were set to zero at initialization bottom friction is represented by the quadratic bottom friction stress formulae dietsche et al 2007 the bottom friction coefficient used in the coupled model is 0 004 and the horizontal eddy viscosity is 5 0 m2 s bhaskaran et al 2014 the time step is 20 s for the adcirc and swan model runs the coupling time interval for the adcirc and swan models was set to 3600 s within the swan model wave directions are discretized into 36 frequency bins of 10 each while wave frequencies are divided into 40 bins ranging from 0 03 to 1 4 hz on a logarithmic scale 3 6 statistical error for model performance the model performance adopted to compare the predicted results with the observational data was quantitatively evaluated using three criteria including the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and skill the statistical error for skill is represented by the following equation willmott 1981 warner et al 2005 5 s k i l l 1 i 1 n η m i η o i 2 i 1 n η m i η o η o i η o 2 where n is the total number of data η m denotes the modeled value η o represents the observed value and η o is the mean of the observed value a skill value of 1 0 represents a perfect model performance a skill value between 0 65 and 1 indicates excellent performance a skill value between 0 5 and 0 65 presents very good performance a skill value in the range of 0 2 0 5 denotes good performance and a skill value of less than 0 2 means poor performance chen et al 2016 4 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation is a vitally important procedure to guarantee model reliability the bottom friction coefficient is crucial parameter to be adjusted in the coupled model to minimize the error between the simulated and observed data for model calibration and validation we used the manual adjustment of bottom friction coefficient to achieve the minimum error the bottom friction coefficient is adopted 0 004 which is in the reasonable ranges documented in luettich et al 1992 the observational data were collected from the central weather bureau taiwan and used to validate the predictive capabilities of the model two historical typhoon events typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 were used for model calibration liu et al 2016 two other typhoon events typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for further model validation the path of these four typhoon events is illustrated in fig 2 according to the classification by the central weather bureau taiwan typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon saola 2012 belong to typhoon path 2 while typhoon morakot 2009 and typhoon soudelor 2015 are classified as typhoon path 3 4 1 model calibration in the model calibration procedure the tide surge wave model was considered in the model simulations the comparisons of the modeled and observed water levels at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor during typhoon morakot 2009 are illustrated in fig 3 the model shows reasonable simulated tides and storm surges at different stations table 1 shows the model performance between the simulated and observed water levels at different gauge stations with typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 for model calibration even though the comparison of modeled and observed water levels is not shown with the figure for typhoon janhmi 2009 the maximum mae and rmse values are 0 31 m and 0 39 m respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill value ranges between 0 87 and 0 99 attributing to excellent performance fig 4 and fig 5 present the comparisons between the simulated and observed wind fields and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures respectively at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor the results indicated that the computed wind speeds did not reproduce the observations at some stations well while the computed atmospheric pressures matched the observations fundamentally the wind field is an important force to drive the hydrodynamics for simulating the water level because the comparison of the computed and observed wind speeds did not really match slight differences were found between the simulated and observed water levels at some stations fig 3 torres et al 2019 found that the parametric typhoon model did not reproduce the wind fields far away from the typhoon center because it was difficult for the model to accurately calculate the structure of the typhoon at specific locations table 2 and table 3 indicate the model performance between the simulated and observed wind speeds and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures respectively at different gauge stations using typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 for model calibration table 2 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for wind speed are 17 82 m s and 20 49 m s respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill scores are in the range of 0 21 and 0 9 indicating that the model performance is between good and excellent according to table 3 the maximum mae and rmse values for atmospheric pressure are 6 53 hpa and 8 27 hpa respectively at taipei tamsui for typhoon jangmi 2008 the skill score ranges from 0 64 to 0 90 indicating that the model performance is between very good and excellent the comparisons between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods at suao buoy kinmen buoy penghu buoy qigu buoy eluanbi buoy and hsinchu buoy are displayed in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively these figures indicated that the simulated wave heights failed to catch the observations at some stations but the simulated wave periods matched the observations all of the impact factors including wind speed atmospheric pressure and wave height contribute to the tide and surge however the simulated and observed tides and surges presented in fig 3 are reasonable matches table 4 presents the model performance between the simulated and observed wave heights at the buoy stations it shows that the maximum mae and rmse values are 2 24 m and 2 43 m at the eluanbi buoy for typhoon morakot 2009 the skill score ranges between 0 33 and 0 89 indicating that the model performance is in the range of good and excellent conditions table 5 shows the model performance between the simulated and observed wave periods at the buoy stations the maximum mae and rmse values are 1 65 s and 2 19 s respectively at the qigu buoy for typhoon jangmi 2008 the model performance ranges between good and excellent conditions as a result of the skill scores ranging between 0 26 and 0 84 4 2 model validation the historical typhoon events including typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for model validation because of the limitations of article space the validation results with only typhoon saola 2012 are presented fig 8 presents the comparisons of modeled and observed water levels at the different gauge stations during typhoon saola 2012 this indicates that the simulated results mimic the observed water levels with tide and storm surge even though the storm surge in the case of typhoon saola 2012 is not so high the validation results also provide the information that the track of typhoon significantly affects the surge height the track of typhoon saola 2012 passed through the sea surface of northern taiwan fig 2a resulting in little surge heights at different gauge stations table 1 shows the model performance with the mae rmse and skill values for typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 the maximum mae and rmse values are 0 35 m and 0 45 m respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon saolo 2012 however the skill value ranges between 0 79 and 0 98 representing excellent model performance the comparisons between the simulated and observed wind fields and the simulated and observed atmospheric pressures during typhoon saola 2012 are illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively for the different gauge stations these figures indicate that the simulated wind fields and atmospheric pressures catch the trends of observations tables 2 and 3 also present the model performances for wind speed and atmospheric pressure respectively at different gauge stations with typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 table 2 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for the wind speed reach 15 64 m s and 18 15 m s respectively at taichung harbor for typhoon soudelor 2015 the skill scores are in the range of 0 28 and 0 9 representing that the model performance ranges between good and excellent table 3 indicates that the maximum mae and rmse values for the atmospheric pressure are 7 07 hpa and 10 42 hpa respectively at taipei tamsui for typhoon soudelor 2015 the skill score ranges from 0 54 to 0 96 indicating that the model performance ranges between very good and excellent fig 11 and fig 12 display the comparisons between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods respectively at the suao buoy kinmen buoy penghu buoy qigu buoy eluanbi buoy and hsinchu buoy for typhoon saola 2012 in general the simulated wave heights and wave periods quantitatively match the measured data even though there is a slight phase shift in the simulated and measured wave heights at the kienmen buoy penghu buoy and qigu buoy the wave height reached over 10 m at the suao buoy as the typhoon moved northwest of taiwan fig 11a the maximum wave heights appeared in the right forward quadrant of the typhoon center and propagated in the same direction as the typhoon because the wind velocity on the right side of the typhoon by adding the typhoon translation speed increased moon et al 2003 moon et al 2003 also demonstrated that the typhoon generated wave field was dominated by the radius of maximum wind and typhoon translation speed the model performances between the simulated and observed wave heights and the simulated and observed wave periods for model validation are displayed in tables 4 and 5 respectively the mae and rmse values of the wave height range between 0 38 m and 2 15 m and 0 57 m and 2 44 m respectively the skill scores of the wave height range between 0 29 and 0 97 as shown in table 5 the mae and rmse values of the wave period are between 0 59 s and 2 44 s and 0 79 s and 2 75 s respectively the skill scores are between 0 28 and 0 93 for model validation the wide range of skill scores indicated that the wave height and wave period at some gauge stations cannot be accurately simulated see tables 4 and 5 5 model diagnostics and discussion the storm surge is mainly controlled by several factors including astronomical tide atmospheric pressure wind stress typhoon track and waves sebastian et al 2014 yuk et al 2015 zou and xie 2016 hussain and tajima 2017 after the model calibration and validation procedures the validated model was applied to explore the influence of the wave setup on the tide and storm surge and the effect of the atmospheric pressure and wind stress on the surge height to compare and analyze the simulated results the case of typhoon morakot 2009 was taken as the baseline 5 1 influence of wave on storm surge to investigate the influence of wave action on storm surge the historical typhoon event i e typhoon morakot was used to serve as the case study for carrying out with the tide surge wave adcirc swan model and the tide surge only adcirc model the simulated water level using the tide surge wave model and tide surge model and the difference in water levels is illustrated in fig 13 the simulated water levels at different gauge stations using the tide surge model cannot faithfully reproduce the observations while the tide surge wave model improves the simulated water levels to match the observations the skill score using the tide surge wave model ranges from 0 9 to 0 99 decreasing from 0 49 to 0 98 using the tide surge model comparing the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model the averaged differences at taipei tamsui taichung harbor kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor are 0 24 m 0 23 m 0 22 m and 0 22 m respectively the contributions of wave setup to the total storm surge have been documented in several studies e g dietrich et al 2010 murty et al 2014 yoon and jun 2015 thuy et al 2017 yu et al 2017 how the wave setup contributes to the total storm surge depends on the topography and bathymetry in the coastal sea region funakoshi et al 2008 chen et al 2008 yu et al 2017b used fine horizontal resolution mesh in the range of 0 7 2 5 km in the surf zone and coarse mesh resolution of 2 5 36 km in the taiwan strait and western pacific regions to explore that the contribution of wave setup on total storm surge was up to 24 however in the present study the contribution of wave setup to the total storm surge ranges between 6 and 35 on taiwan s coast in the future work a finer mesh i e hundreds of meters would be used to explore the characteristics of wave setup and wave setdown in the coast of taiwan 5 2 influence of the typhoon track the typhoon track and landfall location significantly influence the water level and storm surge height lewis et al 2014 sebastian et al 2014 poulose et al 2018 to explore how the typhoon track affects the surge height model experiments were conducted with different typhoon tracks including typhoon path 3 for typhoon morakot 2009 path 2 for typhoon dujuan 2015 and path 4 for typhoon fanapi 2010 fig 2b typhoon morakot 2009 has been calibrated with measured data and is regarded as the baseline the wind atmospheric pressure and typhoon intensity for path 2 and path 4 are considered the same as for path 3 for typhoon morakot 2009 this means that the major differences in these three runs are the typhoon tracks and landfall locations for typhoon path 2 path 3 and path 4 the predicted storm surge heights at the different gauge stations for typhoon paths 2 3 and 4 are displayed in fig 14 it shows that for typhoon path 2 the typhoon center directly passed taipei tamsui and hualien harbor therefore the surge height increased during the period of august 7 12 00 24 00 as a result of low pressure in the center of the typhoon fig 14a and a during the same period the wind around the center of the typhoon was blown inland from the taiwan strait offshore wind causing an increase in the surge height at taichung harbor fig 14b kaohsiung harbor is also affected by the wind effect fig 14c but the surge height is less obvious than at taichung harbor as the typhoon center moved away from taiwan the wind was blown from inland to the taiwan strait resulting in a decreasing surge height for typhoon path 3 i e typhoon morakot the typhoon center passed directly through hualien harbor causing an increase in the surge height fig 14d because the exit point of the typhoon center is located on the south side of taipei tamsui the low pressure induced an increase in the surge height fig 14a the increasing surge height at taichung harbor resulted from the wind effect as the typhoon center moved away from taiwan the surge height sharply decreased fig 14b when the typhoon path 4 occurred the typhoon center passed through the north side of hualien harbor and the wind was blowing from the ocean to inland i e onshore wind resulting in an increase in the surge height fig 14d when the typhoon center went to the south of taiwan and passed through the north side of kaohsiung harbor the surge height was higher than those for path 2 and path 3 during august 8 10 fig 14c this was the reason that the low pressure induced surge height and wind direction was from the taiwan strait to the inland moreover the taipei tamsui and taichung harbor are located on the north side of the typhoon center and the wind direction was from inland to the taiwan strait resulting in a decrease in the surge height fig 14a and b we found that the typhoon track significantly affected the location of the low pressure and wind direction subsequently resulting in the increase decrease in surge height pugh 1996 proposed an equation for storm surge η α τ w w g h where τ w represents the wind stress g indicates the gravity acceleration h denotes the water depth and w is the width of continental shelf this equation demonstrated that the wind direction from the taiwan strait i e deep water to inland i e shallow water raised the surge height 5 3 influence of wind stress to explore the influence of wind stress on the storm surge height the adcirc and swan coupled model was used to conduct the experiments typhoon morakot 2009 served as a baseline and the wind speed was raised 20 and decreased 20 based on the wind speed of typhoon morakot 2009 the simulated surge heights for the baseline wind speed plus 20 and wind speed minus 20 at the different stations are displayed in fig 15 obviously the differences in the storm surge heights occurred on august 8 when the typhoon approached land in taiwan two factors wind speed and wind direction can affect the surge height according to the experimental results the surge height for increasing the wind speed by 20 is less than that for decreasing the wind speed by 20 on august 8 at taipei tamsui kaohsiung harbor and hualien harbor fig 15a c and 15d this means that the offshore wind occurred at that time the wind direction changed quickly at taichung harbor on august 8 when the onshore wind occurred the increasing the wind speed by 20 resulted in increased surge height conversely the offshore wind resulted in decreasing surge height at taichung harbor fig 15b peng et al 2006 conducted model experiments with an idealized case and demonstrated that the onshore winds increased the sea level while the offshore winds decreased the sea level pugh 1996 developed a sample formation to estimate the surge height which was closely related to the wind speed and average water depth rego and li 2010 reported that wind stress was the key factor in generating the surge height in shallow water zones in the numerical experiments we found that the wind speed and wind direction were of crucial importance to affect the surge height along taiwan s coast 5 4 influence of atmospheric pressure forcing a long period wave induced by strong wind and atmospheric pressure gradients is a major factor for generating storm surges except for the strong wind the atmospheric pressure is another driving force for raising the surge height to examine the influence of atmospheric pressure forcing on surge height the atmospheric pressure was increased and decreased by 1 based on the baseline case for typhoon morakot 2009 using the adcirc and swan coupled model fig 16 illustrates the simulated surge heights for the baseline atmospheric pressure plus 1 and atmospheric pressure minus 1 at different stations compared to the baseline case the atmospheric pressure increased by 1 and decreased by 1 resulted in decreasing and increasing surge height respectively the differences in the peak surge height compared with the baseline case range from 2 8 cm to 10 9 cm and from 3 0 cm to 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively dean and dalrymple 2002 estimated the storm surge height η a caused by atmospheric pressure drop δ p the equation can be expressed as η a 1 04 δ p for example at hualien harbor this simple equation was used to estimate the differences in peak surge height for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 when the atmospheric pressures increase and decrease 1 the pressure drops are 9 26 hp and 9 25 hp respectively compared to the baseline atmospheric pressure 756 38 hp during the peak surge height the differences in the peak surge height can be estimated by 9 26 1 04 9 63 cm and 9 25 1 04 9 63 cm the differences in the peak surge heights are 9 6 cm and 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively compared to the baseline case according to fig 16d we also estimated differences in the peak surge height using a simple equation dean and dalrymple 2002 and found that the estimated results were very close to the simulated results at other stations fig 16a b and 16c 6 conclusion the coupled tide surge wave model adcirc swan was established to simulate the tides storm surges and waves around taiwan s coast to ascertain the model prediction capability two historical typhoon events typhoon jangmi 2008 and typhoon morakot 2009 were adopted for model calibration and two other typhoon events typhoon saola 2012 and typhoon soudelor 2015 were used for model validation the measured water level wave height wave period wind speed and air pressure data at different gauge stations were collected and used for model calibration and validation generally the model simulation results reasonably reproduced the measured data furthermore the validated model was applied to explore the influence of waves on the tide and storm surge and the effects of the typhoon track wind stress and atmospheric pressure on the surge height around the taiwan coast to take into account the influence of waves on the storm surge we calculated the water levels using the tide surge wave adcirc swan model and the tide surge only adcirc model compared to the simulated water levels using the tide surge wave model and the tide surge model for the study case i e typhoon morakot we found that the contribution by wave setup to the total storm surge ranged between 6 and 35 on taiwan s coast according to the simulated surge heights using different typhoon tracks the results revealed that the typhoon track significantly affected the location of low pressure and the wind direction subsequently causing the increase decrease in the surge height at different gauge stations in the model diagnostics the wind stress and the atmospheric pressure also play crucial roles in determining the storm surge height the onshore winds increased the surge height while the offshore winds decreased the surge height the differences in the peak surge height compared with the baseline i e typhoon morakot ranged from 2 8 cm to 10 9 cm and from 3 0 cm to 9 6 cm for increasing atmospheric pressures 1 and decreasing atmospheric pressures 1 respectively the simple equation developed by dean and dalrymple 2002 can be used to estimate the differences in the peak surge height the simulated results in this paper significantly improve the understanding of the different physical factors that dominate the storm surge height during typhoon events on the coast of taiwan further study would be focused on investigating the nonlinear effect of tide surge wave interaction and establishing the early warning system for storm surge during typhoon events the impact of wave tide interaction on modulating the wave height would also be explored in the future work credit authorship contribution statement wen cheng liu conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation resources writing

21697,a new finite element model of the variable length underwater cable with geometrically nonlinear motion is presented in this paper this model accounts for the effects of axial load shear bending and torsion completely first a set of nonlinear time varying differential equations is derived from the theorem of linear and angular momentum and its weak formulation is obtained by the principle of d alembert lagrange correspondingly through a series of consistent linearization with the frechet derivative and discretization with the isoparametric interpolation the governing finite element model for this variable length cable is established second the corresponding newmark implicit time integration formulation is derived and a scheme of adaptive step size is proposed to avoid convergence difficulty during the numerical calculation and the way of mesh rediscretization is also illustrated to show the process of cable deployment third after comparing with the results of two validation examples the performance of the proposed approaches is further assessed with four numerical cases which take consideration of the top alternating excitation the terminal follower forces and the sea current along the cable since these terms are found to have a significant impact on the motion of variable length underwater cable finally some conclusions are drawn keywords variable length underwater cable dynamics calculation nonlinear finite element geometrically nonlinear motion 1 introduction submerged cables are used extensively in fishing offshore engineering oceanographic research hydrographic surveying and salvage typically like the mooring towing and deep sea remotely operated vehicles rovs system hashimoto et al 2004 murashima et al 2009 maki et al 2005 these cables are usually stored on a rotary winch with a big drum through which the cables are paying out or reeling in for underwater operation or heave compensation woodacre et al 2015 yang et al 2008 quan et al 2016 these engineering applications require accurate analysis to predict their static and dynamic behavior and various approaches have been applied to analyze the dynamic models of underwater cables ablow and schechter 1983 proposed a numerical model of underwater cable with discrete time space by using a finite difference method because of failure to meet the compatibility the solution would encounter singularity when the cable tension turns into zero driscoll 1999 driscoll et al 2000a b c proposed a one dimensional lumped mass model consisting of linear viscoelastic elements which could predict the cage heave motion and cable tension under the top excitation buckham 2003 buckham et al 2001 established a three dimensional lumped mass model for low tension cables taking into account the bending and torsion effects of the cable the pool experiments proved that the model could capture the low tension state of underwater cables gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 used the finite difference method to simulate underwater cables in time domain and analyzed two dimensional static and dynamic effects of cables by implicit time integration algorithm and adaptive step size srivastava et al 2011 used the finite difference method to establish a three dimensional model of underwater streamers the numerical calculations used the newton iteration method and the implicit time integration method nguyen and cassidy 2014 regarded underwater cables as being connected by rigid joints through spherical joints and the mass of the cable and the external forces were concentrated on the joints park and kim 2015 used the absolute node coordinate method to model the tow cable between the semi submersible and the underwater towed body considering the added mass and water resistance of the cable the model rationality was verified through the numerical examples of direct sail and u turn eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 used the finite element method to establish the rov umbilical cable model based on the euler bernoulli beam equation and verified by static and dynamic numerical examples zhu and yoo 2017 developed a new element reference frame formulated by the vectors of the element orientation and relative velocity of the fluid for the lumped mass model of marine cables in the above mentioned research the main methods of cable modeling could be classified as finite element method finite difference method and lumped mass method etc which are able to capture the corresponding dynamic responses of the cable in some typical excitation conditions the unstretched lengths of those cables are always assumed as constant however the process of launch or recovery depends on deploying or retracting of the cable which unavoidably involves the changes of cable dynamics caused by the varying unstretched cable length simultaneously in essence the unstretched length of the cable is time dependent during underwater operation and the cable of a certain length for a certain period of time is only a special case of the variable length cable so the dynamic characteristics of the variable length cable actually includes the corresponding characteristics of the fixed length cable and has a much greater significance for understanding and predicting the overall dynamic characteristics of underwater cables there are some articles that considered the dynamics of the variable length underwater cables kamman and huston 1999 2001 used the lumped mass method to study the modeling problem of the variable length underwater towed or tethered cable system and the change of cable length was represented by a variable length rod element near the towed ship the total number of cable nodes in the simulation was constant curic 2003 established a mathematical equation for the continuity of variable length elastic cables during rov deployment the galerkin weighted residual method was used to get a linear finite element model the displacement and tension changes of the cable nodes were obtained but the model was only suitable for taut cables lee et al 2005 designed a fishing simulation software to represent the drawstring and netting of a fishing gear using a linear mass spring system and the winch system was just regarded as a cable length control unit muttin 2011 modeled variable length cables between offshore oil recovery vessels and shipborne unmanned aircraft based on the updated lagrangian method and linear rod elements gonzález et al 2017 compared a linear elastic model ignoring bending stiffness with a finite segment multi body dynamic model for the reel in or pay out real time simulation of towed fishing nets which could be solved by augmented lagrangian and hamiltonian formulation the above mentioned studies have obtained the motion models of long streamed cables under a certain of simplified conditions however most of those works focus on the description of cables in taut condition and ignore the important properties such as bending twisting or shearing to some extent during the modeling process which makes those established models hard to accurately describe the motion of variable length cables especially the large spatial displacement and rotation with alternating excitation actually under the unavoidable influence of sea current disturbance or mother ship excitation the underwater cable will execute spatial motion and have the geometrical nonlinearity with large displacement and rotation therefore a physically sound model that can reflect the complete dynamic properties of the cable including the effects of axial load shear bending and torsion is necessary to be established however as far as we know there are few relevant articles about the complete dynamic modeling of the variable length underwater cable with three dimensional geometrically nonlinear motion this paper focuses on the modeling and calculation of the variable length underwater cable with geometrical nonlinearity of large displacement and rotation and the main contents are organized in the following ways in section2 from the theorem of linear and angular momentum the strong differential formulation of the variable length underwater cable model based on the reissner timoshenko assumption is firstly derived then the equivalent weak integral formulation is obtained according to the principle of d alembert lagrange in order to carry out the later numerical calculation the consistent linearization and spatial discretization of the governing model are processed by assigning their boundary conditions in section3 we give the solution procedure using the newmark implicit time integration method and bring forward an adaptive step size scheme to improve convergence during the cable rediscretization in section4 the proposed model and its solution scheme are validated with two examples including the spiral motion of a flexible cable and the underwater payout of a rubber cable and the reel in of a nylon cable respectively in section5 four numerical cases of a variable length underwater cable with the significant factors of the top alternating excitation the sea current and the terminal follower forces are presented finally the conclusions are summarized in section6 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 cable kinematics it is assumed that the underwater cable is a continuous body with circular cross section and the initial reference configuration b 0 is in the form of a right cylinder as shown in fig 1 there are three frames to describe the cable deformation the spatial inertial frame e i is fixed in three dimensional space with its spatial coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 the frame e i is called the material frame with its material coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 attached to the cable material point for the sake of simplicity e 1 is tangent to the central line of cable initially e 2 e 3 are located at the cable cross section and it is assumed that e i e i i 1 2 3 the floating frame t i coincides with the material frame e i initially the reissner timoshenko assumption simo 1985 simo and vu quoc 1986 cardona and géradin 1988 is then applied i e during the process of deformation the cross section initially perpendicular to the central line is always a plane and does not warp since the shear effect is taken into consideration the tangent of the cable central line is not always parallel to the normal of cross section t 1 during the deformation the conversion relation between the material frame e i and the floating frame t i meets t i r e i where r is the orthogonal rotation operator that could be parameterized by the rodrigues formula marsden and ratiu 2013 as 1 r e s i n ψ ψ ψ 1 c o s ψ ψ 2 ψ 2 e x p ψ where e is the identity tensor ψ is the total rotation vector with respect to the initial configuration whose corresponding asymmetrical tensor ψ is the total material rotation tensor and ψ ψ as the cable moves from initial configuration b 0 to current configuration b t the kinematic relation of an arbitrary point on the cable which is parameterized by time t has the following formulation 2 r t s t r s t x 2 t 2 s t x 3 t 3 s t where the parameter s represents the unstretched length of the cable central line in the initial configuration b 0 2 2 the strong formulation the differential equations of the variable length cable also called strong formulation will be firstly derived according to the basic theorem of linear and angular momentum as shown in fig 1 there are three kinds of cable body description the initial cable body has the mass m and moment of inertia i a with respect to its mass center a whose position vector due to the fixed point o is r a the absolute linear velocity and angular velocity of the initial body with respect to the mass center a is v a and ω a respectively as the cable is deploying the adding cable body has mass δ m and moment of inertia δ i a with respect to its mass center b whose position vector according to the fixed point o is r b the absolute velocity and angular velocity of the adding body with respect to the point b is v b and ω b respectively the final body after the cable length variation which is the sum of the initial body and the adding body has the mass m δ m and the moment of inertia i c with the mass center c whose position due to the fixed point o is given with the vector r c and the linear and angular velocity of the final body is v c and ω c respectively the linear momentum of the initial body with mass m and velocity v a the adding body with mass δ m and the velocity v b and the final body with unknown velocity v c respectively are presented by 3 p a m v a p b δ m v b p c m δ m v c according to eq 3 the difference between the linear momentum before and after cable length variation is denoted as 4 δ p p c p a p b m v c v a δ m v c v b correspondingly the angular momentum of the initial body adding body and final body with respect to the fixed point o can be presented respectively as 5 l o a r a m v a l a l o b r b δ m v b l b l o c r c m δ m v c l c where represents the cross product between two vectors l a l b l c are angular momentum of the initial body adding body and final body with respect to each own mass center a b c respectively according to eq 5 the difference of angular momentum before and after length variation is 6 δ l o l o c l o a l o b r c m δ m v c l c l a l b r a m v a r b δ m v b according to the centroid formula of the continuous body and the position relation between each mass center a b c we have 7 m δ m r c m r a δ m r b r c r a s c r b r a s b where s b s c mean the position vector of the mass center b c with respect to the mass center a respectively from eq 7 we can further obtain that 8 m δ m s c δ m s b by combining eqs 5 8 the difference of angular momentum can also be rewritten as 9 δ l o l c l a l b s b δ m v c v b r a δ p let f r be the resultant force of all external active forces and constraint reactions acting on the cable body m o f r be the moment of resultant force due to the fixed point o for convenience of the derivation some variables substitutions are defined here such as 10 v c v a δ v a l c l a δ l a according to the theorem of momentum and eqs 4 9 10 the variations of the linear momentum and angular momentum in the time interval δ t are given as 11 m δ v a δ m v c v b f r δ t δ l a l b s b δ m v c v b r a f r δ t m o f r δ t it can be found that m o f r m a f r r a f r where m a f r is the moment of resultant force due to the point a and l b δ i a ω b both sides of eq 11 are then divided by δ t we have 12 m δ v a δ t δ m δ t v c v b f r δ l a δ t δ i a δ t ω b s b δ m δ t v c v b m a f r if eq 12 takes limits on both sides by making δ t 0 since δ v a 0 v c v a we can obtain its differential formulation as 13 m r a f r m v b r a l a m a f r s b m v b r a i a ω b where the symbol represents the derivative to time t and r a v a it should be noticed that both the translational and rotational motion are with respect to the mass center a of the initial cable body where the translational part of eq 13 is the relation that was firstly introduced bymeshchersky 1897 and cveticanin and kovacic 2007 for l a i a ω a and according togoldstein et al 2002 we have that 14 l a i a ω a i a ω a ω a i a ω a without loss of generality the subscript a of eqs 13 and 14 will be omitted then the strong formulation of variable length cable can be rewritten as a general form 15 m r f r φ i ω ω i ω m f r m φ m with 16 φ m v b r m φ s b m v b r m i ω b ω where φ denotes the additional force caused by the mass variation m the additional moment m φ is caused by the additional force φ due to the point a and the additional torque m is introduced by the variation of the moment of inertia i if there are no variations of mass and moment of inertia of cable body i e let m i 0 all of the additional terms φ m φ m equal to zero the eq 15 will transform into the dynamic equation of fixed length cable as 17 m r f r i ω ω i ω m f r 2 3 the weak formulation in this section we will obtain the weak integral formulation from its strong formulation of eq 15 by using the principle of d alembert lagrange and the corresponding boundary conditions on the cable endpoints will not be discussed during this derivation until in the subsection 2 5 let f and f be the resultant internal force and couple per unit of reference cable length n and n be the resultant external force and couple per unit of reference cable length respectively according tonordgren 1974 the stress state at any point on the cable is fully characterized by the resultant internal force and couple and based on the balance of linear and angular momentum principles of the three dimensional beam theory simo 1985 the resultant force f r and moment m f r can be given by 18 f r f s n m f r f s r s f n by substituting eq 18 into eq 15 the strong formulation per unit of reference cable length can be expressed as 19 ρ e a c r f s n φ i ω ω i ω f s r s f n m φ m where ρ e ρ c c a ρ w is the effective density including the added mass due to seawater ρ c is the cable density c a is the added mass coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater a c is the cross sectional area of the cable it is noteworthy that eq 19 is described in the current spatial configuration with basis t i that is called spatial description such as the vectors f f i t i n n i t i ω ω i t i and so on by applying the principle of d alembert lagrange and multiplying eq 19 with the virtual displacement δ r and the virtual angular displacement δ θ along the total cable length l c it follows the total virtual work as 20 δ w δ w e x t δ w i n t δ w a c c δ w a d d 0 where δ w a c c is the virtual work caused by the inertial forces δ w i n t is the virtual work of internal forces δ w e x t is the virtual work of external forces and δ w a d d is the virtual work of the additional forces which can be given as 21 δ w a c c l c δ r ρ e a c r d s l c δ θ i ω ω i ω d s δ w i n t l c δ r f s d s l c δ θ f s r s f d s δ w e x t l c δ r n d s l c δ θ n d s δ w a d d l c δ r φ d s l c δ θ m φ m d s where the rotational parts of all these virtual work are described in the spatial form i e the eulerian formulation however in applications the material form of these equations i e the lagrangian formulation is often more convenient by pulling back the spatial vectors to the initial configuration with the rotation operator r they are transformed into the material form with the components described relative to the basis e i soeq 21 can be rewritten as 22 δ w a c c l c δ d ρ e a c r d s l c δ θ i m ω m ω m i m ω m d s δ w i n t l c δ γ n d s l c δ ϒ n d s δ w e x t l c δ d n d s l c δ θ r t n d s δ w a d d l c δ d φ d s l c δ θ r t m φ m d s where the linear displacement is d r s t r s 0 δ d δ r and δ θ is the virtual material angular displacement expressed as δ θ r t δ θ and the material angular acceleration is ω m ω i e i the material moment of inertia i m r t i r n r t f and n r t f are the resultant material internal force and couple whose conjugate strain measures are the material strain γ and curvature ϒ which are defined as 23 γ r t r e 1 ϒ r t θ where a prime represents s it is assumed that the cable observes the hyperelastic constitutive relation with the description as 24 n d i a g e a g a 2 g a 3 γ n d i a g g j e i 2 e i 3 ϒ where e a is the axial stiffness g a 2 g a 3 are the shear stiffness along with the inertial principal axes t 2 and t 3 of cross section and g j is the torsion rigidity and e i 2 e i 3 are the principal bending stiffness relative to t 2 and t 3 therefore the complete effects of axial load shear bending and torsion on the cable are all considered for the convenience of updating variables of the rotation vector during implementation of the finite element calculation and taking full advantage of the path independence property it is suggested to transform the expression 22 into the total lagrangian formulation by using the relation mäkinen 2007 as 25 δ θ t δ ψ ω m t ψ t s i n ψ ψ e 1 c o s ψ ψ 2 ψ ψ s i n ψ ψ 3 ψ ψ where t t ψ is the transformation operator denotes standard tensor product by substituting eq 25 into eq 22 the weak formulation of the variable length cable can be obtained as 26 δ w a c c l c δ d ρ e a c r d s l c δ ψ t t i m t ψ i m t ψ t ψ i m t ψ d s δ w i n t l c δ γ n d s l c δ ϒ n d s δ w e x t l c δ d n d s l c δ ψ t t r t n d s δ w a d d l c δ d φ d s l c δ ψ t t r t m φ m d s where if the additional virtual work δ w a d d is omitted theneq 26 will turn into the weak formulation of the fixed length cable 2 4 consistent linearization the above weak formulation of variable length cable is a set of strongly nonlinear differential equations and its numerical solution usually uses iterative correction such as the newton raphson iterative method which often needs linearization of the nonlinear terms here the consistent linearization of eq 26 applies the frechet derivative which is defined as 27 d g f ν d d ε ε 0 f ν ε g where ν and g are arbitrary vectors ε r the linear representation of the total virtual work formulation of eq 20 can be obtained by the given configuration q q ˆ where the generalized displacement vector is defined as q d ψ t and by definition of the frechet derivative we have 28 l i n δ w q q q δ q δ w ˆ q q q δ q d q δ w ˆ δ q d q δ w ˆ δ q where the first term on the right δ w ˆ supplies the unbalanced force at the configuration q ˆ the terms d q δ w ˆ δ q and d q δ w ˆ δ q linear in δ q and δ q yield the so called tangential stiffness and viscous damping respectively for the external virtual work δ w e x t the part of resultant external force n is already represented by the linear expression and has no need to be linearized repeatedly so it only needs to linearize part of the resultant external couple n the consistent linearization of external virtual work is given by 29 l i n δ w e x t q δ q δ w ˆ e x t q δ q d q δ w ˆ e x t δ q l c δ d n d s l c δ ψ t t r t n d s q q ˆ l c k l o a d δ ψ δ ψ d s where the load stiffness is denoted by k l o a d d ψ t t r t n and denotes the double dot product of two tensors for the internal virtual work δ w i n t which may be rephrased in a more compact form by introducing the following notations 30 δ γ δ ϒ b δ q δ q δ d δ ψ δ ψ f i n t n n where the operator b which characterizes the geometrical relation between the strain and displacement exactly without any simplification is defined as b r t o r t r t o t d ψ t ψ where o is the zero tensor with the notations at hand the internal virtual work is recast as 31 δ w i n t l c b δ q f i n t d s l c δ q b t f i n t d s where the symbol means the dot product of two tensors and the linearization of eq 31 may be denoted as 32 l i n δ w i n t q δ q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q d q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q δ q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q l c δ q d q b t f i n t b t d q f i n t δ q d s δ w ˆ i n t q δ q l c δ q k m a t k g e o δ q d s where the k m a t d q b t f i n t and k g e o b t d q f i n t supply the material stiffness and geometrical stiffness respectively for the inertial virtual work δ w a c c we can see that the linearization of which can be obtained similarly as 33 l i n δ w a c c q q q δ q δ w ˆ a c c q q q δ q d ψ δ w ˆ a c c δ ψ d ψ δ w ˆ a c c δ ψ l c δ ψ t t t ψ i m t ψ i m t ψ d

gyroscopic tensors ofeq 33 usually have very little effect on the cable motion thus can be ignored according toeq 16 since the displacement s b is almost parallel to the additional force φ and the rotation vector ω is approximate to ω b at the moment of cable length variation the additional virtual work δ w a d d may also be reduced by ignoring the small rotation counterpart of the additional moment m φ and m as following form 35 δ w a d d q q δ q l c δ d φ d s and we can obtain the linearization of eq 35 as 36 l i n δ w a d d q q δ q l c δ q f a d d d s l c δ q c a d d q d s with f a d d

of variable length cable body and in this section a two node linear isoparametric element is used to discretize the generalized displacement q as 37 d i 1 2 n i d i ψ i 1 2 n i ψ i n 1 1 η 2 n 2 1 η 2 η 1 1 where n i is the nodal shape function d i and ψ i represent the nodal displacement and total rotation of an element respectively the linearization of total virtual work formulation 28 includes the total unbalanced force and the linearized incremental term with respect to the given configuration q q ˆ and the unbalanced force for an element with length l e may be discretized as 38 δ w ˆ e δ

all nodes of an element we have the equation of the variable length element accordingly 41 f e r e s m e m a s s q e c e a d d q e k e s t i f f δ q e c e g y r o δ q e then we assemble eq 41 into the total finite element equation element by element which is the procedure similar to the assembling in linear finite element analysis the total equation which is discrete spatially but continuous in time domain is also named governing equation with notation as 42 f r e s m m a s s q c a d d q k s t i f f δ q c g y r o δ q where the f r e s is the total residual nodal force m m a s s is the total consistent mass which is usually asymmetrical in the geometrically nonlinear dynamic case c a d d is the total viscous damping caused by the variation of cable length k s t i f f is the total stiffness including the load material geometrical and centrifugal stiffness c g y r o is the total gyroscopic damping caused by the gyroscopic motion of the cable which can usually be ignored if the cable has small gyroscopic motion q q are the total nodal velocity and acceleration respectively and δ q δ q are the total increment of nodal displacement and velocity respectively the solving of eq 42 belongs to the two point boundary value problem in mathematics which needs to designate the corresponding boundary conditions including the top node kinematic condition and the bottom node dynamic condition of the cable and they can be given as 43 q 1 u t o p q 1 v t o p q 1 a t o p m b r c b r t b w b where u t o p v t o p and a t o p are the top node displacement velocity and acceleration respectively q 1 q 1 and q 1 represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the first node of the cable respectively m b c b and w b are the effective mass including the added mass viscous damping and wet weight of the bottom body respectively and t b is the internal tension of the lower end of the cable 2 6 underwater actions the wet weight per unit of volume of the underwater cable can be given by 44 w w e t ρ c ρ w g 0 e 1 where ρ c ρ w are the density of cable and seawater respectively and g 0 is the gravitational acceleration although the volume of the cable may change during deployment the variation of density is often quite small and negligible thus the cable density is assumed to be constant in addition to the gravity and buoyancy the external forces that act on the underwater cable also include the velocity related viscous drag force according to the rotation transformation of the same vector between two different frames if the velocity of a point on the center line is r with its components in the spatial frame e i then the same velocity is r t r with its components in the floating frame t i in order to obtain the viscous drag force the relative velocity between the cable and sea current should be known in advance here we assume that the velocity of sea current is decreased with water depth ħ linearly vaz and patel 2000 which can be described in the spatial frame as 45 v w v w s 1 ħ ħ 0 e 2 0 ħ ħ 0 where the sea current is along the basis e 2 v w s is the surface velocity and ħ 0 is the maximum water depth then the relative velocity between the cable and sea current with its components in the floating frame t i can be given by 46 v r r t r v w v r 1 v r 2 v r 3 according to the semi empirical morison formula for slender underwater body we have the local viscous drag force per unit of cable length 47 f d r a g 1 2 ρ w c d 1 π d c v r 1 v r 1 1 2 ρ w c d 2 d c v r 2 v r 2 2 v r 3 2 1 2 ρ w c d 3 d c v r 3 v r 2 2 v r 3 2 where d c is the cable diameter c d 1 is the tangential drag coefficient and c d 2 and c d 3 are the normal and binormal drag coefficients respectively after the coordinate transformation we can obtain the viscous drag force with its components in the spatial frame e i is r f d r a g and due to the property of the symmetrical cross section of cable the external force couple usually tends to be zero and can be ignored for simplicity i e n 0 from above the total external force and couple per unit of cable length including gravity buoyancy and viscous drag force can be expressed as 48 n w w e t a c r f d r a g n 0 3 solution procedure in this section we obtain the implicit time integration formulation by using the newmark method to avoid the difficulty of numerical convergence the time step sizes are adopted adaptively and the mesh rediscretization of the cable is proposed during the length variation 3 1 newmark formulation the newmark method has the second order approximation of the displacement and velocity as follows 49 q n 1 α 1 q n 1 q n α 2 q n α 3 q n q n 1 α 4 q n 1 q n α 5 q n α 6 q n with α 1 1 β δ t 2 α 2 1 β δ t α 3 1 2 β 2 β α 4 γ β δ t α 5 1 γ β α 6 1 γ 2 β δ t where δ t is the time step size and the constant parameters β γ are usually limited within a certain scope i e β 0 0 5 γ 0 1 according to eq 49 the iterative formulation of the acceleration velocity and displacement at step i 1 can be formulated with respect to the previous step i as 50 q n 1 i 1 α 1 q n 1 i 1 q n α 2 q n α 3 q n q n 1 i 1 α 4 q n 1 i 1 q n α 5 q n α 6 q n q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 δ q n 1 i 1 α 4 δ q n 1 i 1 and the iterative formulation of the governing equation 42 at time t n 1 is 51 m m a s s q n 1 i q n 1 i 1 c a d d q n 1 i q n 1 i 1 k s t i f f q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 c g y r o q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 f r e s q n 1 i 0 by substituting eq 50 into eq 51 the unknown variables can be expressed in the incremental displacement δ q as 52 k c q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 h q n q n q n q n 1 i where k c q n 1 i α 1 m m a s s α 4 c a d d k s t i f f α 4 c g y r o h q n q n q n q n 1 i f r e s m m a s s α 1 q n 1 i q n α 2 q n α 3 q n c a d d α 4 q n 1 i q n α 5 q n α 6 q n then the incremental displacement of the step i 1 at time t n 1 can be obtained as 53 δ q n 1 i 1 k c q n 1 i 1 h q n q n q n q n 1 i the initial iterative values at t n 1 are often set as the convergence values at previous time t n i e 54 q n 1 0 q n q n 1 0 α 5 q n α 6 q n q n 1 0 α 2 q n α 3 q n based on the incremental displacement the update law of the velocity and acceleration is 55 q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i γ β δ t δq n 1 i 1 q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i 1 β δ t 2 δq n 1 i 1 and the convergence criterion is given as 56 δq n 1 i 1 μ q n 1 i 1 where μ is a very small positive number μ 1 0 3 1 0 7 and denotes the 2 norm if the iteration converges at the step m i the convergence values at time t n 1 will be 57 q n 1 q n 1 m i q n 1 q n 1 m i q n 1 q n 1 m i according to these convergence values the total displacement velocity and acceleration of eq 51 at time t n 1 can all be obtained and based on the relation between displacement stress and strain the numerical values of stress and strain at time t n 1 can also be obtained consequently after that the solution procedure enters a new iterative loop by adding a time step δ t again i e t n 1 t n 2 3 2 adaptive step size generally the governing equation 42 is a highly nonlinear partial differential equation set with time dependent coefficients in this nonlinear case the standard newmark method usually cannot guarantee its unconditional numerical stability since the nonlinear solution procedure at every time step may not be unconditionally convergent it is different from the case of linear ordinary differential equations odes where the unconditional numerical stability of standard newmark method can be easily guaranteed regardless of the time step size the newmark solver usually uses the convergent results from the previous time t n as the initial values of the solution for the current time t n 1 and the solution at the new time t n 1 may not converge if the initial values and the exact solution are significantly far apart the fixed step size method was used to calculate the proposed model experimentally but the program often crashed at a certain time and fell into local extreme points therefore a simple adaptive stepping method is presented here to overcome this misconvergence the basic idea is to reduce the step size δ t if the iterations outnumber the upper bound χ u b or to add the step size δ t if the iterations are less than the lower bound χ l b when the solution for the current time t n 1 is not easily convergent i e the numerical solution tends to deviate from the exact solution far away meaning the number of iterations is bigger than the upper bound χ u b that is to say the step size may not be small enough to avoid the misconvergence and needs to be reduced to f u b δ t by a factor of f u b 1 when the solution converges very fast i e the number of iterations is smaller than the lower bound χ l b and the step size then can be increased to f l b δ t by another factor of f l b 1 the quantitative determination of f u b f l b and the initial step size of the newmark solver could be obtained through the trial and error method for numerical solutions the step sizes are always adaptive through the solution procedure which keeps the numerical calculation away from misconvergence effectively showing more robustness and efficiency than the fixed step size method 3 3 mesh rediscretization as we can see from the above mentioned the unstretched length of the element is a state variable and will be varying during cable deployment for the underwater cable stored and deployed by a rotary winch the only variable length element is the boundary element at the interface of the cable on the winch and the segment of cable deployed in the water denoted as the element e i with length l i t initially one of the primary concerns in finite element model is the mesh size which corresponds to the unstretched length of the elements in the assembly and poor spatial resolution of the governing model may result from the very long elements therefore it needs to constrain the size of the variable length element and the scope of which should be limited within a certain interval as l i t l e m i n l e m a x where l e m i n and l e m a x represent the minimal and maximal length of the variable length element respectively once the length of the variable length element exceeds the prescribed upper limit during paying out i e l i t l e m a x the element e i will be automatically divided into an element still named e i with the fixed length of l e m a x plus a new adjacent variable length element e j born at the interface whose initial length is the subtraction of l j t l i t l e m a x on the other hand once the length of the variable length element falls below the lower limit during reeling in i e 0 l i t l e m i n this element e i would be removed from the assembly its adjacent element would turn into a new variable length element e j with an initial length of l j t l e m a x it should be noticed that during this variation of the unstretched length of underwater cable the number of total elements and nodes is also increased or decreased accordingly so as to represent the process of reeling in or paying out 4 validation examples in this section we present two examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches one example is about the flexible straight cable that performs spiral motion in three dimensional and the numerical results are compared with those calculated byibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 the other example is on two kinds of variable length cables that perform reel in and payout experiments in a tank respectively and the numerical results are compared with the available experimental data that was reported byward 1979 and migliore and mcreynolds 1982 4 1 the spiral motion of a flexible cable the main parameters of the flexible cable are shown in table1 at the initial moment the cable is placed on the horizontal plane o x y in a straight line it consists of ten elements with a uniform interval of 1 0 m between the adjacent nodes the cable head is constrained to slide along the vertical axis z and subjected to a nodal force f t and a nodal force couple m t with f t 0 05 m t t 0 2 5 both are in the same direction as the vertical axis z causing the cable to make a spiral motion along the vertical axis the parameters of the newmark method are selected as β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the total solution period is run for 15 s up till that time the cable is just rotated for one turn the overall spatial configurations for the cable motion are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that as the cable head slides along the vertical axis the entire cable rotates spirally around this axis simultaneously this is in good agreement with the results calculated byibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 through the finite element software feap written by prof r l taylor at u c berkeley zienkiewicz et al 2005 and the time histories of displacement components at the free end are shown in fig 3 from which it can be found that the calculated results of the proposed model and algorithm are also very consistent with the results ofibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 specifically as the cable rotates the x axis component first gradually increases from zero to a maximum of 20 m and then gradually decreases to zero again and its value is always non positive the component in the y axis of the free end also shows corresponding changes with the cable rotation it moves back and forth between 10 m and 10 m a bit like the motion of a simple pendulum in plane and the component in the z axis always increases nonlinearly and stepwise which is the distinct feature of the spiral rise it is noted that there are tiny differences between the two results in the z axis component but the components in both x and y axes are quite consistent in general and this may be attributed to the usage of different models and calculation methods therefore this example has shown effectiveness of the proposed approaches in dealing with large displacement and rotation of flexible cable in three dimensional 4 2 variable length underwater cable then the ability of variable length for the proposed approaches is validated by tank experiments with a rubber cable and a nylon cable respectively which are hanging straight down in a tank with a spherical load at the bottom of the cables ward 1979 migliore and mcreynolds 1982 the main parameters of these cable systems are shown in table2 the rubber cable is for the payout experiment and the nylon cable is for the reel in experiment the top of the vertical cable is attached to a winch mechanism through which the cable could be reeled in or paid out in a specified manner and the cable speed and tension near the surface could be measured the parameters of the newmark method are β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the calculation is run for 4 0 s the comparisons between calculated results and tank experiments can be seen in fig 4a and b where the time series of tension at the top of the cable are plotted fig 4a shows tension histories at the top of the rubber cable under payout conditions and fig 4b shows the tension histories at the top of the nylon cable under reel in conditions it should be noticed that the initial stage of both tests involves analogous accelerations i e the cables could achieve a constant speed of 0 61 m s within 0 7 s from a zero speed due to the accelerated initiation there are overshoots within the first 2 s and tensions are able to achieve steady state after about 3 s in both dynamic tests fig 4 shows that the results have a general agreement between the calculated and the tank experiments whether for the rubber cable payout or for the nylon cable reel in from fig 4a it can be learned that the top tension drops rapidly in the first 1 0 s then gradually rises from the time 2 0 s to 3 0 s and reaches the steady state after that there is a little amplitude difference after about 2 0 s and this may be caused by using constant values for elastic modulus of the rubber cable or drag coefficient of the spherical load during the whole stage the drag coefficient of the smooth rubber cable is small and could be assumed to be negligible similarly from fig 4b it can be seen that the top tension rises rapidly within the first 0 7 s then quickly drops from the time 0 7 s to 1 0 s and gradually arrives at the steady state after that where the constant values for elastic modulus of nylon cable and drag coefficients of both nylon cable and load are used as defined in table2 through comparing with the above experimental results we have gained more confidence in applying the proposed approaches to numerical analysis of the variable length underwater cable as follows 5 numerical cases and analysis 5 1 initial conditions the performance of the governing model of variable length underwater cable and its solution scheme proposed in this paper will be further demonstrated by four specific cases in terms of ship heave motion and sea current namely case one is without ship heave motion but with sea current in plane case two is with both sea current and ship heave motion in plane case three is without ship heave motion but with sea current in space case four is with both sea current and ship heave motion in space it is noted that in each case there is always the action of sea current which is assumed as a monotonically decreasing function as shown in eq 45 with the surface velocity of 0 5 m s and the maximum water depth of 500 0 m although the ship usually produces six degrees of freedom dofs at sea including surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw and the primary role is the heave motion which acts upon the first node of the first element here and is assumed as a sinusoidal alternating excitation i e with the amplitude a h 1 0 m and the period t h 10 0 s similar to an rov supporting ship s level four heave motion love et al 2004 in addition to the actions of sea current and heave motion a follower force f y 10 0 n in the direction of positive y axis is applied at the end of cable in planar cases and in three dimensional cases a follower force f y 10 0 n which is opposite to the positive y axis and a follower force f z 10 0 n along the positive z axis are applied at the end of cable simultaneously where the x axis is vertically downward the y axis is horizontally rightward and the z axis is normal to the o x y plane as shown in fig 1 the main properties of the underwater cable used in these cases are shown in table3 which are obtained from a cable supplier the initial length of the cable is l 0 and the cable is released with the rate v p v b vertically considering that the actual release rate of a general winch for underwater rov cable is no faster than 75 m min kyo et al 1995 v p is set as 1 0 m s the unstretched length of the variable length element ranges from l e m i n to l e m a x and the l e m a x is also chosen as the nominal length of the fixed length element if the elemental length is zero it will introduce a numerical singularity that cannot be solved in time domain and the state variables have no or multiple solutions the minimum length of the element also cannot be set too small or else the so called stiffness hardening phenomenon will occur and the pseudo high frequency mode will be introduced which is not conducive to the rapid convergence of numerical solutions here the minimal and the maximal unstretched lengths are set as l e m i n 1 0 5 m and l e m a x 5 0 m respectively the parameters of newmark method are set as β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the total solution period is 100 0 s for each case with these conditions in mind the numerical results and discussion are shown as follows 5 2 case one 2d motion without heave but with sea current firstly we consider the case where there is the action of sea current except heave motion at the initial moment the top node of cable is located at the origin of the spatial frame and the cable coincides with the x axis which is the same direction as the gravitational acceleration when the test starts the cable is deployed at the speed of v p 1 0 m s and moves towards the lower right in the o x y plane under both actions of the sea current and the follower force f y as shown in figs 5 and 6 fig 5a shows the variable length cable configurations from 0s to 100s these planar configurations next to each other look like a leaf as a whole and fig 5b shows some typical configurations of the variable length cable at some given times such as 0s 8s 16s 24s 32s 42s 53s 68s 83s 91s and 100s as can be seen explicitly from this figure the cable head stays at the origin but the cable end moves towards the lower right gradually and the cable configuration at each moment is similar to a catenary curve as shown in fig 6a the nodal coordinates of the cable head represented by the small red circle are unchanged and the blue curve indicates time dependent motion track of the cable end which is not a smooth arc strictly more like a polyline composed of multiple straight lines with alternative slopes the initial position of the end node is 1 5 0 0 and it reaches the position of 95 9 27 8 at 100s during the cable deploying the tension carried by the head node is the largest as shown in fig 6b the total wet weight of the cable always increases linearly with the cable length and in addition to the wet weight the cable is also under the action of the hydrodynamic forces of sea current this causes the tension at the cable head to fluctuate around the wet weight and it can be found that the average tension of the head node is slightly higher than the total wet weight the iterations and the time steps are adaptively changed at each iterative step as shown in fig 6c and d it can be seen from these figures that the iterations vary from 1 to 9 most are distributed in the interval between 1 to 4 and the remaining small portions are distributed in the interval between 5 to 9 the iterative step sizes are distributed in three step sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s in the first 30s the step size of 0 05s is adopted the number of iterations is within a narrow interval between 1 to 4 indicating that the solution speed is fast in the interval from the 30s to 60s two step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used the wide variation of the iterative numbers from 1 to 8 indicates that the solution speed is relatively slower and the calculation does not converge easily corresponding to the larger amplitude of the tension curve in fig 6b thereafter only the step size of 0 1s is used from the 60s to 80s the number of iterations is all within 2 indicating that the solution speed is becoming faster the calculation also converges easily corresponding to the smaller amplitude of the tension curve and in the last 20s the three step sizes of 0 03s 0 05s 0 1s are used respectively including a small step size of 0 03s that has not been used before indicating that the calculation is difficult to converge and the step size should not be too large corresponding to the larger amplitude of the tension curve 5 3 case two 2d motion with heave and sea current next we consider the situation with both sea current and heave motion the initial state of the cable is the same as section5 2 however after starting the test the cable head is deployed with a sinusoidal heave motion which means the cable is moving under the combined actions of heave motion the sea current and the terminal follower force f y in the o x y plane as shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows the dynamic configurations of the variable length cable in the vertical plane during the test time from 0s to 100s all the configurations next to each other resemble a piece of feather as a whole and the movement of the end node is patchy echoing the sinusoidal heave motion at the head node fig 7b shows the configurations of the variable length cable at 11 typical times such as 0s 10s 20s 30s 39s 49s 59s 70s 79s 89s and 100s as can be seen from this figure the cable end gradually moves to the lower right and the cable configuration at each moment is also similar to the catenary curve fig 8a shows the cable head node represented by the red circle fluctuates around the origin with obvious overlap while the blue curve represents the planar motion track of the cable end node which looks like a wavy sawtooth curve obviously the motion of the end node is affected by the sinusoidal heave motion of the head node which is transmitted through the cable so the end node also fluctuates and arrives at the position of 96 9 26 2 in o x y plane at 100s as shown in fig 8b the tension at the cable head is not slightly higher than the wet weight as shown in section5 2 but varies around it an overshoot occurs in the first 5s and the tension once stays above the wet weight until the 22s since then the tension gradually fluctuates around the wet weight with a wider amplitude as the cable length increases the maximum tension in the full test time period reaches about 1 5 times the maximum wet weight it should be noticed that there are several large overshoots around the 70s which may be due to the introduction of pseudo high frequency noise and can be modified by filtering of moving average the number of iterations and the step sizes in the test time are shown in fig 8c d it can be found that the iterations vary from 1 to 10 most are in the interval between 1 to 4 and the distribution of iterative step sizes is focused on two sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s in the first 40s the step size of 0 05s is mainly used the number of iterations is concentrated within a narrow scope between 1 to 4 corresponding to the narrow tension fluctuation of the first 40s in fig 8b after the 40s two kinds of step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used mainly 0 05s and the number of iterations varies widely from 1 to 10 indicating that the solution speed becomes slower and its values can hardly converge corresponding to the wide tension fluctuation in fig 8b 5 4 case three 3d motion without heave but with sea current the motion of the variable length cable is limited to a plane in former cases which will be extended to three dimensions here besides the terminal follower forces f y and f z are applied the entire cable is also subjected to the horizontal sea current that is parallel to the o y z plane under these conditions we first consider the situation where the head node does not have heave motion initially the cable head node is at the origin of the spatial frame and the cable coincides with the x axis when the test starts the cable is deployed at the rate of v p 1 0 m s and moves spatially under the combined actions of the horizontal current and follower forces f y and f z the spatial dynamic configurations of the variable length cable are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 10a b and c the typical configurations of the variable length cable at some times are projected on the o x y o y z o x z planes respectively such as 0s 5s 11s 16s 22s 32s 43s 53s 64s 78s 99s etc as can be seen from fig 10a the cable configuration is presented as an l shape inversely because the cable is forced by the horizontal sea current and the terminal follower force f y together fig 10b shows the cable end moves towards the upper right under the combined actions of f y and f z and in the o x z plane which is perpendicular to the action of sea current the variable length cable moves along the positive x and z directions under its own weight and f z as shown in fig 10c as shown in fig 11a since no heave motion acts upon the cable the head node denoted by the red circle stays static and the motion track represented by the blue spatial curve does not show obvious waveform the position of the end node is 1 5 0 0 0 0 initially and reaches the position of 97 2 6 1 12 2 at 100s it can be seen from fig 11b that the tension of head node varies along with the cable wet weight and the former is slightly higher than the latter in the first 5s due to the sudden release of the cable a certain amount of overshoot is inevitable after that the tension is relatively stable until the 65s and the tension begins to appear more pseudo high frequency noise it can be clearly seen that the spikes make the tension curve fuzzy the changes of the number of iterations and time step sizes are shown in fig 11c d it can be learned that during the test time the iterations vary from 1 to 10 most are distributed in the interval between 1 to 5 and the distribution of the step sizes is mainly focused on three sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s both figures show that the step sizes of 0 03s and 0 05s are mainly used in the first 65s the solution is relatively fast with the number of iterations mainly concentrated on 2 or 3 corresponding to the smaller amplitude of the tension curve in fig 11b after the 65s two step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used and the number of iterations varies widely between 1 and 10 indicating that the numerical convergence is difficult during this time interval which corresponds to the pseudo high frequency noise segment of the tension curve 5 5 case four 3d motion with heave and sea current here we consider the situation where there is heave motion acting upon the first node the cable is deployed at the rate of v p 1 0 m s and moves spatially under the combined actions of the heave motion the horizontal current and the terminal follower forces f y and f z the dynamic spatial configurations of the variable length cable are shown in fig 12 which are connected to resemble a shell with serrated edges as shown in fig 13a b and c the typical cable configurations at some moments are projected on the o x y o y z and o x z planes respectively such as 0s 6s 12s 17s 29s 40s 52s 64s 75s 87s 99s etc fig 13a shows the cable configuration still exhibits an inverted l shape as shown in fig 13b the bottom cable is still moving towards the upper right under those combined actions in the o x z plane the variable length cable still moves along the positive x and z axes under its own weight and f z as shown in fig 13c it can be observed that the heave motion of the first node has little effect on the motion tendency of the variable length cable as shown in fig 14a the first node is up and down around the origin point and the moving trail of the last node forms a jagged curve in space the sinusoidal motion of the first node is transmitted in the form of wave to the last node which exhibits the motion similar to the sinusoidal wave at the initial moment the position of the last node is 1 5 0 0 0 0 and at 100s it reaches the position of 98 3 2 9 11 3 it can be seen from fig 14b that the cable tension gradually varies around its wet weight similar to fig 8b and this tension curve is generally smoother with fewer spikes fig 14c d show that the number of iterations varies from 1 to 7 mainly concentrated on 2 iterations while the step sizes are mostly concentrated on two sizes of 0 03s and 0 05s with a small part that 0 1s is used it can be learned that it is feasible to solve this three dimensional nonlinear problem with only 2 iterations and the time step sizes within 0 05s during most of test time meaning the numerical solution has a high speed and converges easily which can also be verified from the smoother tension curve in fig 14b 6 conclusions in the present work a novel nonlinear finite element model of the variable length underwater cable with time varying coefficients is developed from the strong differential equations to the weak virtual work formulation and the implicit newmark method with adaptive step sizes and mesh rediscretization are applied to solve the cable model numerically the proposed approaches are then validated by comparing with the results of two sets of available experimental data through performance analysis of four numerical cases under the significant actions of the top alternating excitation horizontal sea current and terminal follower forces some conclusions can be summarized here as the variable length cable goes through the large displacement and rotation in plane or spatially the cable configurations appear different for each of the aforementioned cases for example in the case of planar movement with the action of heave motion the edge of the continuous dynamic configurations i e the motion trajectory of the last node is jagged but it is not obvious in the case where no heave motion exists in the three dimensional cases with heave motion a similar phenomenon occurs even though the cable configurations are out of the plane this shows that the heave motion of the first node can be propagated in the form of wave to the end node by the cable so that it has a similar form of motion as the head and this propagation has little to do with the actions of sea current or terminal follower forces although these actions can unavoidably change the dynamic configurations of the cable for instance when the force f y applied to the last node is opposite to the direction of sea current the cable end can be moved against the sea current and f z can move the cable end in the direction towards the positive z axis as well in terms of the cable tension at each moment it is obvious that the wet weight of the first node is larger than that of the other nodes along the entire cable and it varies linearly with the cable length in spite of the cases in plane or three dimensional the cable tension at the first node generally has two different kinds of representation when there is no heave motion the average tension will be slightly higher than the wet weight but when there is heave motion the tension will fluctuate around the wet weight and the tension amplitude also will be amplified gradually as the cable is deploying more as far as the numerical solution is concerned the time step sizes and the number of iterations are varying freely at each time due to the adaptive time step scheme from those four cases we can observe that the step sizes are mainly concentrated on the three sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s and the iterations are almost no more than 10 times some iterations even need only 1 time to achieve convergence most of iterations may take 2 to 4 times and only a few iterations need 5 to 10 times these numerical cases show that by selecting the step sizes adaptively the convergence can be achieved with a small number of iterations which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in calculating such strongly nonlinear problems future improvements may include comparisons with other analytic results and experimental data for the underwater cables such as the tethered towed and mooring etc which should take advantage of the advanced measurement technology for the cable motion and tension the water flow rate and the cable physical parameters so as to minimize the measurement errors as much as possible additional efforts to extend the proposed approaches to the cable systems which have multiple branches topologically are suggested and analysis of the impact of launch and recovery operations on these systems is important to enrich this research through these comparisons and extensions the models and algorithms used in this paper are further improved so that they can be applied to predict and evaluate the dynamics of the variable length underwater cable systems and provide references for their optimization design dynamic control and marine operations credit authorship contribution statement weicai quan

21697,a new finite element model of the variable length underwater cable with geometrically nonlinear motion is presented in this paper this model accounts for the effects of axial load shear bending and torsion completely first a set of nonlinear time varying differential equations is derived from the theorem of linear and angular momentum and its weak formulation is obtained by the principle of d alembert lagrange correspondingly through a series of consistent linearization with the frechet derivative and discretization with the isoparametric interpolation the governing finite element model for this variable length cable is established second the corresponding newmark implicit time integration formulation is derived and a scheme of adaptive step size is proposed to avoid convergence difficulty during the numerical calculation and the way of mesh rediscretization is also illustrated to show the process of cable deployment third after comparing with the results of two validation examples the performance of the proposed approaches is further assessed with four numerical cases which take consideration of the top alternating excitation the terminal follower forces and the sea current along the cable since these terms are found to have a significant impact on the motion of variable length underwater cable finally some conclusions are drawn keywords variable length underwater cable dynamics calculation nonlinear finite element geometrically nonlinear motion 1 introduction submerged cables are used extensively in fishing offshore engineering oceanographic research hydrographic surveying and salvage typically like the mooring towing and deep sea remotely operated vehicles rovs system hashimoto et al 2004 murashima et al 2009 maki et al 2005 these cables are usually stored on a rotary winch with a big drum through which the cables are paying out or reeling in for underwater operation or heave compensation woodacre et al 2015 yang et al 2008 quan et al 2016 these engineering applications require accurate analysis to predict their static and dynamic behavior and various approaches have been applied to analyze the dynamic models of underwater cables ablow and schechter 1983 proposed a numerical model of underwater cable with discrete time space by using a finite difference method because of failure to meet the compatibility the solution would encounter singularity when the cable tension turns into zero driscoll 1999 driscoll et al 2000a b c proposed a one dimensional lumped mass model consisting of linear viscoelastic elements which could predict the cage heave motion and cable tension under the top excitation buckham 2003 buckham et al 2001 established a three dimensional lumped mass model for low tension cables taking into account the bending and torsion effects of the cable the pool experiments proved that the model could capture the low tension state of underwater cables gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 used the finite difference method to simulate underwater cables in time domain and analyzed two dimensional static and dynamic effects of cables by implicit time integration algorithm and adaptive step size srivastava et al 2011 used the finite difference method to establish a three dimensional model of underwater streamers the numerical calculations used the newton iteration method and the implicit time integration method nguyen and cassidy 2014 regarded underwater cables as being connected by rigid joints through spherical joints and the mass of the cable and the external forces were concentrated on the joints park and kim 2015 used the absolute node coordinate method to model the tow cable between the semi submersible and the underwater towed body considering the added mass and water resistance of the cable the model rationality was verified through the numerical examples of direct sail and u turn eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 used the finite element method to establish the rov umbilical cable model based on the euler bernoulli beam equation and verified by static and dynamic numerical examples zhu and yoo 2017 developed a new element reference frame formulated by the vectors of the element orientation and relative velocity of the fluid for the lumped mass model of marine cables in the above mentioned research the main methods of cable modeling could be classified as finite element method finite difference method and lumped mass method etc which are able to capture the corresponding dynamic responses of the cable in some typical excitation conditions the unstretched lengths of those cables are always assumed as constant however the process of launch or recovery depends on deploying or retracting of the cable which unavoidably involves the changes of cable dynamics caused by the varying unstretched cable length simultaneously in essence the unstretched length of the cable is time dependent during underwater operation and the cable of a certain length for a certain period of time is only a special case of the variable length cable so the dynamic characteristics of the variable length cable actually includes the corresponding characteristics of the fixed length cable and has a much greater significance for understanding and predicting the overall dynamic characteristics of underwater cables there are some articles that considered the dynamics of the variable length underwater cables kamman and huston 1999 2001 used the lumped mass method to study the modeling problem of the variable length underwater towed or tethered cable system and the change of cable length was represented by a variable length rod element near the towed ship the total number of cable nodes in the simulation was constant curic 2003 established a mathematical equation for the continuity of variable length elastic cables during rov deployment the galerkin weighted residual method was used to get a linear finite element model the displacement and tension changes of the cable nodes were obtained but the model was only suitable for taut cables lee et al 2005 designed a fishing simulation software to represent the drawstring and netting of a fishing gear using a linear mass spring system and the winch system was just regarded as a cable length control unit muttin 2011 modeled variable length cables between offshore oil recovery vessels and shipborne unmanned aircraft based on the updated lagrangian method and linear rod elements gonzález et al 2017 compared a linear elastic model ignoring bending stiffness with a finite segment multi body dynamic model for the reel in or pay out real time simulation of towed fishing nets which could be solved by augmented lagrangian and hamiltonian formulation the above mentioned studies have obtained the motion models of long streamed cables under a certain of simplified conditions however most of those works focus on the description of cables in taut condition and ignore the important properties such as bending twisting or shearing to some extent during the modeling process which makes those established models hard to accurately describe the motion of variable length cables especially the large spatial displacement and rotation with alternating excitation actually under the unavoidable influence of sea current disturbance or mother ship excitation the underwater cable will execute spatial motion and have the geometrical nonlinearity with large displacement and rotation therefore a physically sound model that can reflect the complete dynamic properties of the cable including the effects of axial load shear bending and torsion is necessary to be established however as far as we know there are few relevant articles about the complete dynamic modeling of the variable length underwater cable with three dimensional geometrically nonlinear motion this paper focuses on the modeling and calculation of the variable length underwater cable with geometrical nonlinearity of large displacement and rotation and the main contents are organized in the following ways in section2 from the theorem of linear and angular momentum the strong differential formulation of the variable length underwater cable model based on the reissner timoshenko assumption is firstly derived then the equivalent weak integral formulation is obtained according to the principle of d alembert lagrange in order to carry out the later numerical calculation the consistent linearization and spatial discretization of the governing model are processed by assigning their boundary conditions in section3 we give the solution procedure using the newmark implicit time integration method and bring forward an adaptive step size scheme to improve convergence during the cable rediscretization in section4 the proposed model and its solution scheme are validated with two examples including the spiral motion of a flexible cable and the underwater payout of a rubber cable and the reel in of a nylon cable respectively in section5 four numerical cases of a variable length underwater cable with the significant factors of the top alternating excitation the sea current and the terminal follower forces are presented finally the conclusions are summarized in section6 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 cable kinematics it is assumed that the underwater cable is a continuous body with circular cross section and the initial reference configuration b 0 is in the form of a right cylinder as shown in fig 1 there are three frames to describe the cable deformation the spatial inertial frame e i is fixed in three dimensional space with its spatial coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 the frame e i is called the material frame with its material coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 attached to the cable material point for the sake of simplicity e 1 is tangent to the central line of cable initially e 2 e 3 are located at the cable cross section and it is assumed that e i e i i 1 2 3 the floating frame t i coincides with the material frame e i initially the reissner timoshenko assumption simo 1985 simo and vu quoc 1986 cardona and géradin 1988 is then applied i e during the process of deformation the cross section initially perpendicular to the central line is always a plane and does not warp since the shear effect is taken into consideration the tangent of the cable central line is not always parallel to the normal of cross section t 1 during the deformation the conversion relation between the material frame e i and the floating frame t i meets t i r e i where r is the orthogonal rotation operator that could be parameterized by the rodrigues formula marsden and ratiu 2013 as 1 r e s i n ψ ψ ψ 1 c o s ψ ψ 2 ψ 2 e x p ψ where e is the identity tensor ψ is the total rotation vector with respect to the initial configuration whose corresponding asymmetrical tensor ψ is the total material rotation tensor and ψ ψ as the cable moves from initial configuration b 0 to current configuration b t the kinematic relation of an arbitrary point on the cable which is parameterized by time t has the following formulation 2 r t s t r s t x 2 t 2 s t x 3 t 3 s t where the parameter s represents the unstretched length of the cable central line in the initial configuration b 0 2 2 the strong formulation the differential equations of the variable length cable also called strong formulation will be firstly derived according to the basic theorem of linear and angular momentum as shown in fig 1 there are three kinds of cable body description the initial cable body has the mass m and moment of inertia i a with respect to its mass center a whose position vector due to the fixed point o is r a the absolute linear velocity and angular velocity of the initial body with respect to the mass center a is v a and ω a respectively as the cable is deploying the adding cable body has mass δ m and moment of inertia δ i a with respect to its mass center b whose position vector according to the fixed point o is r b the absolute velocity and angular velocity of the adding body with respect to the point b is v b and ω b respectively the final body after the cable length variation which is the sum of the initial body and the adding body has the mass m δ m and the moment of inertia i c with the mass center c whose position due to the fixed point o is given with the vector r c and the linear and angular velocity of the final body is v c and ω c respectively the linear momentum of the initial body with mass m and velocity v a the adding body with mass δ m and the velocity v b and the final body with unknown velocity v c respectively are presented by 3 p a m v a p b δ m v b p c m δ m v c according to eq 3 the difference between the linear momentum before and after cable length variation is denoted as 4 δ p p c p a p b m v c v a δ m v c v b correspondingly the angular momentum of the initial body adding body and final body with respect to the fixed point o can be presented respectively as 5 l o a r a m v a l a l o b r b δ m v b l b l o c r c m δ m v c l c where represents the cross product between two vectors l a l b l c are angular momentum of the initial body adding body and final body with respect to each own mass center a b c respectively according to eq 5 the difference of angular momentum before and after length variation is 6 δ l o l o c l o a l o b r c m δ m v c l c l a l b r a m v a r b δ m v b according to the centroid formula of the continuous body and the position relation between each mass center a b c we have 7 m δ m r c m r a δ m r b r c r a s c r b r a s b where s b s c mean the position vector of the mass center b c with respect to the mass center a respectively from eq 7 we can further obtain that 8 m δ m s c δ m s b by combining eqs 5 8 the difference of angular momentum can also be rewritten as 9 δ l o l c l a l b s b δ m v c v b r a δ p let f r be the resultant force of all external active forces and constraint reactions acting on the cable body m o f r be the moment of resultant force due to the fixed point o for convenience of the derivation some variables substitutions are defined here such as 10 v c v a δ v a l c l a δ l a according to the theorem of momentum and eqs 4 9 10 the variations of the linear momentum and angular momentum in the time interval δ t are given as 11 m δ v a δ m v c v b f r δ t δ l a l b s b δ m v c v b r a f r δ t m o f r δ t it can be found that m o f r m a f r r a f r where m a f r is the moment of resultant force due to the point a and l b δ i a ω b both sides of eq 11 are then divided by δ t we have 12 m δ v a δ t δ m δ t v c v b f r δ l a δ t δ i a δ t ω b s b δ m δ t v c v b m a f r if eq 12 takes limits on both sides by making δ t 0 since δ v a 0 v c v a we can obtain its differential formulation as 13 m r a f r m v b r a l a m a f r s b m v b r a i a ω b where the symbol represents the derivative to time t and r a v a it should be noticed that both the translational and rotational motion are with respect to the mass center a of the initial cable body where the translational part of eq 13 is the relation that was firstly introduced bymeshchersky 1897 and cveticanin and kovacic 2007 for l a i a ω a and according togoldstein et al 2002 we have that 14 l a i a ω a i a ω a ω a i a ω a without loss of generality the subscript a of eqs 13 and 14 will be omitted then the strong formulation of variable length cable can be rewritten as a general form 15 m r f r φ i ω ω i ω m f r m φ m with 16 φ m v b r m φ s b m v b r m i ω b ω where φ denotes the additional force caused by the mass variation m the additional moment m φ is caused by the additional force φ due to the point a and the additional torque m is introduced by the variation of the moment of inertia i if there are no variations of mass and moment of inertia of cable body i e let m i 0 all of the additional terms φ m φ m equal to zero the eq 15 will transform into the dynamic equation of fixed length cable as 17 m r f r i ω ω i ω m f r 2 3 the weak formulation in this section we will obtain the weak integral formulation from its strong formulation of eq 15 by using the principle of d alembert lagrange and the corresponding boundary conditions on the cable endpoints will not be discussed during this derivation until in the subsection 2 5 let f and f be the resultant internal force and couple per unit of reference cable length n and n be the resultant external force and couple per unit of reference cable length respectively according tonordgren 1974 the stress state at any point on the cable is fully characterized by the resultant internal force and couple and based on the balance of linear and angular momentum principles of the three dimensional beam theory simo 1985 the resultant force f r and moment m f r can be given by 18 f r f s n m f r f s r s f n by substituting eq 18 into eq 15 the strong formulation per unit of reference cable length can be expressed as 19 ρ e a c r f s n φ i ω ω i ω f s r s f n m φ m where ρ e ρ c c a ρ w is the effective density including the added mass due to seawater ρ c is the cable density c a is the added mass coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater a c is the cross sectional area of the cable it is noteworthy that eq 19 is described in the current spatial configuration with basis t i that is called spatial description such as the vectors f f i t i n n i t i ω ω i t i and so on by applying the principle of d alembert lagrange and multiplying eq 19 with the virtual displacement δ r and the virtual angular displacement δ θ along the total cable length l c it follows the total virtual work as 20 δ w δ w e x t δ w i n t δ w a c c δ w a d d 0 where δ w a c c is the virtual work caused by the inertial forces δ w i n t is the virtual work of internal forces δ w e x t is the virtual work of external forces and δ w a d d is the virtual work of the additional forces which can be given as 21 δ w a c c l c δ r ρ e a c r d s l c δ θ i ω ω i ω d s δ w i n t l c δ r f s d s l c δ θ f s r s f d s δ w e x t l c δ r n d s l c δ θ n d s δ w a d d l c δ r φ d s l c δ θ m φ m d s where the rotational parts of all these virtual work are described in the spatial form i e the eulerian formulation however in applications the material form of these equations i e the lagrangian formulation is often more convenient by pulling back the spatial vectors to the initial configuration with the rotation operator r they are transformed into the material form with the components described relative to the basis e i soeq 21 can be rewritten as 22 δ w a c c l c δ d ρ e a c r d s l c δ θ i m ω m ω m i m ω m d s δ w i n t l c δ γ n d s l c δ ϒ n d s δ w e x t l c δ d n d s l c δ θ r t n d s δ w a d d l c δ d φ d s l c δ θ r t m φ m d s where the linear displacement is d r s t r s 0 δ d δ r and δ θ is the virtual material angular displacement expressed as δ θ r t δ θ and the material angular acceleration is ω m ω i e i the material moment of inertia i m r t i r n r t f and n r t f are the resultant material internal force and couple whose conjugate strain measures are the material strain γ and curvature ϒ which are defined as 23 γ r t r e 1 ϒ r t θ where a prime represents s it is assumed that the cable observes the hyperelastic constitutive relation with the description as 24 n d i a g e a g a 2 g a 3 γ n d i a g g j e i 2 e i 3 ϒ where e a is the axial stiffness g a 2 g a 3 are the shear stiffness along with the inertial principal axes t 2 and t 3 of cross section and g j is the torsion rigidity and e i 2 e i 3 are the principal bending stiffness relative to t 2 and t 3 therefore the complete effects of axial load shear bending and torsion on the cable are all considered for the convenience of updating variables of the rotation vector during implementation of the finite element calculation and taking full advantage of the path independence property it is suggested to transform the expression 22 into the total lagrangian formulation by using the relation mäkinen 2007 as 25 δ θ t δ ψ ω m t ψ t s i n ψ ψ e 1 c o s ψ ψ 2 ψ ψ s i n ψ ψ 3 ψ ψ where t t ψ is the transformation operator denotes standard tensor product by substituting eq 25 into eq 22 the weak formulation of the variable length cable can be obtained as 26 δ w a c c l c δ d ρ e a c r d s l c δ ψ t t i m t ψ i m t ψ t ψ i m t ψ d s δ w i n t l c δ γ n d s l c δ ϒ n d s δ w e x t l c δ d n d s l c δ ψ t t r t n d s δ w a d d l c δ d φ d s l c δ ψ t t r t m φ m d s where if the additional virtual work δ w a d d is omitted theneq 26 will turn into the weak formulation of the fixed length cable 2 4 consistent linearization the above weak formulation of variable length cable is a set of strongly nonlinear differential equations and its numerical solution usually uses iterative correction such as the newton raphson iterative method which often needs linearization of the nonlinear terms here the consistent linearization of eq 26 applies the frechet derivative which is defined as 27 d g f ν d d ε ε 0 f ν ε g where ν and g are arbitrary vectors ε r the linear representation of the total virtual work formulation of eq 20 can be obtained by the given configuration q q ˆ where the generalized displacement vector is defined as q d ψ t and by definition of the frechet derivative we have 28 l i n δ w q q q δ q δ w ˆ q q q δ q d q δ w ˆ δ q d q δ w ˆ δ q where the first term on the right δ w ˆ supplies the unbalanced force at the configuration q ˆ the terms d q δ w ˆ δ q and d q δ w ˆ δ q linear in δ q and δ q yield the so called tangential stiffness and viscous damping respectively for the external virtual work δ w e x t the part of resultant external force n is already represented by the linear expression and has no need to be linearized repeatedly so it only needs to linearize part of the resultant external couple n the consistent linearization of external virtual work is given by 29 l i n δ w e x t q δ q δ w ˆ e x t q δ q d q δ w ˆ e x t δ q l c δ d n d s l c δ ψ t t r t n d s q q ˆ l c k l o a d δ ψ δ ψ d s where the load stiffness is denoted by k l o a d d ψ t t r t n and denotes the double dot product of two tensors for the internal virtual work δ w i n t which may be rephrased in a more compact form by introducing the following notations 30 δ γ δ ϒ b δ q δ q δ d δ ψ δ ψ f i n t n n where the operator b which characterizes the geometrical relation between the strain and displacement exactly without any simplification is defined as b r t o r t r t o t d ψ t ψ where o is the zero tensor with the notations at hand the internal virtual work is recast as 31 δ w i n t l c b δ q f i n t d s l c δ q b t f i n t d s where the symbol means the dot product of two tensors and the linearization of eq 31 may be denoted as 32 l i n δ w i n t q δ q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q d q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q δ q δ w ˆ i n t q δ q l c δ q d q b t f i n t b t d q f i n t δ q d s δ w ˆ i n t q δ q l c δ q k m a t k g e o δ q d s where the k m a t d q b t f i n t and k g e o b t d q f i n t supply the material stiffness and geometrical stiffness respectively for the inertial virtual work δ w a c c we can see that the linearization of which can be obtained similarly as 33 l i n δ w a c c q q q δ q δ w ˆ a c c q q q δ q d ψ δ w ˆ a c c δ ψ d ψ δ w ˆ a c c δ ψ l c δ ψ t t t ψ i m t ψ i m t ψ d s q q ˆ l c m m a s s δ q q d s l c k c e n t δ ψ δ ψ d s l c c g y r o δ ψ δ ψ d s where the symbols m m a s s k c e n t c g y r o are denoted as the mass centrifugal and gyroscopic tensors respectively 34 m m a s s a c ρ e e o o t t i m t k c e n t d ψ t t i m t ψ i m t ψ t ψ i m t ψ c g y r o d ψ t t i m t ψ t ψ i m t ψ when the cable rotation is small enough the centrifugal and gyroscopic tensors ofeq 33 usually have very little effect on the cable motion thus can be ignored according toeq 16 since the displacement s b is almost parallel to the additional force φ and the rotation vector ω is approximate to ω b at the moment of cable length variation the additional virtual work δ w a d d may also be reduced by ignoring the small rotation counterpart of the additional moment m φ and m as following form 35 δ w a d d q q δ q l c δ d φ d s and we can obtain the linearization of eq 35 as 36 l i n δ w a d d q q δ q l c δ q f a d d d s l c δ q c a d d q d s with f a d d m v b o c a d d m e o o o 2 5 finite element discretization when all of linearizations for those four kinds of virtual work are done we employ the finite element method to discretize the total domain of variable length cable body and in this section a two node linear isoparametric element is used to discretize the generalized displacement q as 37 d i 1 2 n i d i ψ i 1 2 n i ψ i n 1 1 η 2 n 2 1 η 2 η 1 1 where n i is the nodal shape function d i and ψ i represent the nodal displacement and total rotation of an element respectively the linearization of total virtual work formulation 28 includes the total unbalanced force and the linearized incremental term with respect to the given configuration q q ˆ and the unbalanced force for an element with length l e may be discretized as 38 δ w ˆ e δ

all nodes of an element we have the equation of the variable length element accordingly 41 f e r e s m e m a s s q e c e a d d q e k e s t i f f δ q e c e g y r o δ q e then we assemble eq 41 into the total finite element equation element by element which is the procedure similar to the assembling in linear finite element analysis the total equation which is discrete spatially but continuous in time domain is also named governing equation with notation as 42 f r e s m m a s s q c a d d q k s t i f f δ q c g y r o δ q where the f r e s is the total residual nodal force m m a s s is the total consistent mass which is usually asymmetrical in the geometrically nonlinear dynamic case c a d d is the total viscous damping caused by the variation of cable length k s t i f f is the total stiffness including the load material geometrical and centrifugal stiffness c g y r o is the total gyroscopic damping caused by the gyroscopic motion of the cable which can usually be ignored if the cable has small gyroscopic motion q q are the total nodal velocity and acceleration respectively and δ q δ q are the total increment of nodal displacement and velocity respectively the solving of eq 42 belongs to the two point boundary value problem in mathematics which needs to designate the corresponding boundary conditions including the top node kinematic condition and the bottom node dynamic condition of the cable and they can be given as 43 q 1 u t o p q 1 v t o p q 1 a t o p m b r c b r t b w b where u t o p v t o p and a t o p are the top node displacement velocity and acceleration respectively q 1 q 1 and q 1 represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the first node of the cable respectively m b c b and w b are the effective mass including the added mass viscous damping and wet weight of the bottom body respectively and t b is the internal tension of the lower end of the cable 2 6 underwater actions the wet weight per unit of volume of the underwater cable can be given by 44 w w e t ρ c ρ w g 0 e 1 where ρ c ρ w are the density of cable and seawater respectively and g 0 is the gravitational acceleration although the volume of the cable may change during deployment the variation of density is often quite small and negligible thus the cable density is assumed to be constant in addition to the gravity and buoyancy the external forces that act on the underwater cable also include the velocity related viscous drag force according to the rotation transformation of the same vector between two different frames if the velocity of a point on the center line is r with its components in the spatial frame e i then the same velocity is r t r with its components in the floating frame t i in order to obtain the viscous drag force the relative velocity between the cable and sea current should be known in advance here we assume that the velocity of sea current is decreased with water depth ħ linearly vaz and patel 2000 which can be described in the spatial frame as 45 v w v w s 1 ħ ħ 0 e 2 0 ħ ħ 0 where the sea current is along the basis e 2 v w s is the surface velocity and ħ 0 is the maximum water depth then the relative velocity between the cable and sea current with its components in the floating frame t i can be given by 46 v r r t r v w v r 1 v r 2 v r 3 according to the semi empirical morison formula for slender underwater body we have the local viscous drag force per unit of cable length 47 f d r a g 1 2 ρ w c d 1 π d c v r 1 v r 1 1 2 ρ w c d 2 d c v r 2 v r 2 2 v r 3 2 1 2 ρ w c d 3 d c v r 3 v r 2 2 v r 3 2 where d c is the cable diameter c d 1 is the tangential drag coefficient and c d 2 and c d 3 are the normal and binormal drag coefficients respectively after the coordinate transformation we can obtain the viscous drag force with its components in the spatial frame e i is r f d r a g and due to the property of the symmetrical cross section of cable the external force couple usually tends to be zero and can be ignored for simplicity i e n 0 from above the total external force and couple per unit of cable length including gravity buoyancy and viscous drag force can be expressed as 48 n w w e t a c r f d r a g n 0 3 solution procedure in this section we obtain the implicit time integration formulation by using the newmark method to avoid the difficulty of numerical convergence the time step sizes are adopted adaptively and the mesh rediscretization of the cable is proposed during the length variation 3 1 newmark formulation the newmark method has the second order approximation of the displacement and velocity as follows 49 q n 1 α 1 q n 1 q n α 2 q n α 3 q n q n 1 α 4 q n 1 q n α 5 q n α 6 q n with α 1 1 β δ t 2 α 2 1 β δ t α 3 1 2 β 2 β α 4 γ β δ t α 5 1 γ β α 6 1 γ 2 β δ t where δ t is the time step size and the constant parameters β γ are usually limited within a certain scope i e β 0 0 5 γ 0 1 according to eq 49 the iterative formulation of the acceleration velocity and displacement at step i 1 can be formulated with respect to the previous step i as 50 q n 1 i 1 α 1 q n 1 i 1 q n α 2 q n α 3 q n q n 1 i 1 α 4 q n 1 i 1 q n α 5 q n α 6 q n q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 δ q n 1 i 1 α 4 δ q n 1 i 1 and the iterative formulation of the governing equation 42 at time t n 1 is 51 m m a s s q n 1 i q n 1 i 1 c a d d q n 1 i q n 1 i 1 k s t i f f q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 c g y r o q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 f r e s q n 1 i 0 by substituting eq 50 into eq 51 the unknown variables can be expressed in the incremental displacement δ q as 52 k c q n 1 i δ q n 1 i 1 h q n q n q n q n 1 i where k c q n 1 i α 1 m m a s s α 4 c a d d k s t i f f α 4 c g y r o h q n q n q n q n 1 i f r e s m m a s s α 1 q n 1 i q n α 2 q n α 3 q n c a d d α 4 q n 1 i q n α 5 q n α 6 q n then the incremental displacement of the step i 1 at time t n 1 can be obtained as 53 δ q n 1 i 1 k c q n 1 i 1 h q n q n q n q n 1 i the initial iterative values at t n 1 are often set as the convergence values at previous time t n i e 54 q n 1 0 q n q n 1 0 α 5 q n α 6 q n q n 1 0 α 2 q n α 3 q n based on the incremental displacement the update law of the velocity and acceleration is 55 q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i γ β δ t δq n 1 i 1 q n 1 i 1 q n 1 i 1 β δ t 2 δq n 1 i 1 and the convergence criterion is given as 56 δq n 1 i 1 μ q n 1 i 1 where μ is a very small positive number μ 1 0 3 1 0 7 and denotes the 2 norm if the iteration converges at the step m i the convergence values at time t n 1 will be 57 q n 1 q n 1 m i q n 1 q n 1 m i q n 1 q n 1 m i according to these convergence values the total displacement velocity and acceleration of eq 51 at time t n 1 can all be obtained and based on the relation between displacement stress and strain the numerical values of stress and strain at time t n 1 can also be obtained consequently after that the solution procedure enters a new iterative loop by adding a time step δ t again i e t n 1 t n 2 3 2 adaptive step size generally the governing equation 42 is a highly nonlinear partial differential equation set with time dependent coefficients in this nonlinear case the standard newmark method usually cannot guarantee its unconditional numerical stability since the nonlinear solution procedure at every time step may not be unconditionally convergent it is different from the case of linear ordinary differential equations odes where the unconditional numerical stability of standard newmark method can be easily guaranteed regardless of the time step size the newmark solver usually uses the convergent results from the previous time t n as the initial values of the solution for the current time t n 1 and the solution at the new time t n 1 may not converge if the initial values and the exact solution are significantly far apart the fixed step size method was used to calculate the proposed model experimentally but the program often crashed at a certain time and fell into local extreme points therefore a simple adaptive stepping method is presented here to overcome this misconvergence the basic idea is to reduce the step size δ t if the iterations outnumber the upper bound χ u b or to add the step size δ t if the iterations are less than the lower bound χ l b when the solution for the current time t n 1 is not easily convergent i e the numerical solution tends to deviate from the exact solution far away meaning the number of iterations is bigger than the upper bound χ u b that is to say the step size may not be small enough to avoid the misconvergence and needs to be reduced to f u b δ t by a factor of f u b 1 when the solution converges very fast i e the number of iterations is smaller than the lower bound χ l b and the step size then can be increased to f l b δ t by another factor of f l b 1 the quantitative determination of f u b f l b and the initial step size of the newmark solver could be obtained through the trial and error method for numerical solutions the step sizes are always adaptive through the solution procedure which keeps the numerical calculation away from misconvergence effectively showing more robustness and efficiency than the fixed step size method 3 3 mesh rediscretization as we can see from the above mentioned the unstretched length of the element is a state variable and will be varying during cable deployment for the underwater cable stored and deployed by a rotary winch the only variable length element is the boundary element at the interface of the cable on the winch and the segment of cable deployed in the water denoted as the element e i with length l i t initially one of the primary concerns in finite element model is the mesh size which corresponds to the unstretched length of the elements in the assembly and poor spatial resolution of the governing model may result from the very long elements therefore it needs to constrain the size of the variable length element and the scope of which should be limited within a certain interval as l i t l e m i n l e m a x where l e m i n and l e m a x represent the minimal and maximal length of the variable length element respectively once the length of the variable length element exceeds the prescribed upper limit during paying out i e l i t l e m a x the element e i will be automatically divided into an element still named e i with the fixed length of l e m a x plus a new adjacent variable length element e j born at the interface whose initial length is the subtraction of l j t l i t l e m a x on the other hand once the length of the variable length element falls below the lower limit during reeling in i e 0 l i t l e m i n this element e i would be removed from the assembly its adjacent element would turn into a new variable length element e j with an initial length of l j t l e m a x it should be noticed that during this variation of the unstretched length of underwater cable the number of total elements and nodes is also increased or decreased accordingly so as to represent the process of reeling in or paying out 4 validation examples in this section we present two examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches one example is about the flexible straight cable that performs spiral motion in three dimensional and the numerical results are compared with those calculated byibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 the other example is on two kinds of variable length cables that perform reel in and payout experiments in a tank respectively and the numerical results are compared with the available experimental data that was reported byward 1979 and migliore and mcreynolds 1982 4 1 the spiral motion of a flexible cable the main parameters of the flexible cable are shown in table1 at the initial moment the cable is placed on the horizontal plane o x y in a straight line it consists of ten elements with a uniform interval of 1 0 m between the adjacent nodes the cable head is constrained to slide along the vertical axis z and subjected to a nodal force f t and a nodal force couple m t with f t 0 05 m t t 0 2 5 both are in the same direction as the vertical axis z causing the cable to make a spiral motion along the vertical axis the parameters of the newmark method are selected as β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the total solution period is run for 15 s up till that time the cable is just rotated for one turn the overall spatial configurations for the cable motion are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that as the cable head slides along the vertical axis the entire cable rotates spirally around this axis simultaneously this is in good agreement with the results calculated byibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 through the finite element software feap written by prof r l taylor at u c berkeley zienkiewicz et al 2005 and the time histories of displacement components at the free end are shown in fig 3 from which it can be found that the calculated results of the proposed model and algorithm are also very consistent with the results ofibrahimbegović and mikdad 1998 specifically as the cable rotates the x axis component first gradually increases from zero to a maximum of 20 m and then gradually decreases to zero again and its value is always non positive the component in the y axis of the free end also shows corresponding changes with the cable rotation it moves back and forth between 10 m and 10 m a bit like the motion of a simple pendulum in plane and the component in the z axis always increases nonlinearly and stepwise which is the distinct feature of the spiral rise it is noted that there are tiny differences between the two results in the z axis component but the components in both x and y axes are quite consistent in general and this may be attributed to the usage of different models and calculation methods therefore this example has shown effectiveness of the proposed approaches in dealing with large displacement and rotation of flexible cable in three dimensional 4 2 variable length underwater cable then the ability of variable length for the proposed approaches is validated by tank experiments with a rubber cable and a nylon cable respectively which are hanging straight down in a tank with a spherical load at the bottom of the cables ward 1979 migliore and mcreynolds 1982 the main parameters of these cable systems are shown in table2 the rubber cable is for the payout experiment and the nylon cable is for the reel in experiment the top of the vertical cable is attached to a winch mechanism through which the cable could be reeled in or paid out in a specified manner and the cable speed and tension near the surface could be measured the parameters of the newmark method are β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the calculation is run for 4 0 s the comparisons between calculated results and tank experiments can be seen in fig 4a and b where the time series of tension at the top of the cable are plotted fig 4a shows tension histories at the top of the rubber cable under payout conditions and fig 4b shows the tension histories at the top of the nylon cable under reel in conditions it should be noticed that the initial stage of both tests involves analogous accelerations i e the cables could achieve a constant speed of 0 61 m s within 0 7 s from a zero speed due to the accelerated initiation there are overshoots within the first 2 s and tensions are able to achieve steady state after about 3 s in both dynamic tests fig 4 shows that the results have a general agreement between the calculated and the tank experiments whether for the rubber cable payout or for the nylon cable reel in from fig 4a it can be learned that the top tension drops rapidly in the first 1 0 s then gradually rises from the time 2 0 s to 3 0 s and reaches the steady state after that there is a little amplitude difference after about 2 0 s and this may be caused by using constant values for elastic modulus of the rubber cable or drag coefficient of the spherical load during the whole stage the drag coefficient of the smooth rubber cable is small and could be assumed to be negligible similarly from fig 4b it can be seen that the top tension rises rapidly within the first 0 7 s then quickly drops from the time 0 7 s to 1 0 s and gradually arrives at the steady state after that where the constant values for elastic modulus of nylon cable and drag coefficients of both nylon cable and load are used as defined in table2 through comparing with the above experimental results we have gained more confidence in applying the proposed approaches to numerical analysis of the variable length underwater cable as follows 5 numerical cases and analysis 5 1 initial conditions the performance of the governing model of variable length underwater cable and its solution scheme proposed in this paper will be further demonstrated by four specific cases in terms of ship heave motion and sea current namely case one is without ship heave motion but with sea current in plane case two is with both sea current and ship heave motion in plane case three is without ship heave motion but with sea current in space case four is with both sea current and ship heave motion in space it is noted that in each case there is always the action of sea current which is assumed as a monotonically decreasing function as shown in eq 45 with the surface velocity of 0 5 m s and the maximum water depth of 500 0 m although the ship usually produces six degrees of freedom dofs at sea including surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw and the primary role is the heave motion which acts upon the first node of the first element here and is assumed as a sinusoidal alternating excitation i e with the amplitude a h 1 0 m and the period t h 10 0 s similar to an rov supporting ship s level four heave motion love et al 2004 in addition to the actions of sea current and heave motion a follower force f y 10 0 n in the direction of positive y axis is applied at the end of cable in planar cases and in three dimensional cases a follower force f y 10 0 n which is opposite to the positive y axis and a follower force f z 10 0 n along the positive z axis are applied at the end of cable simultaneously where the x axis is vertically downward the y axis is horizontally rightward and the z axis is normal to the o x y plane as shown in fig 1 the main properties of the underwater cable used in these cases are shown in table3 which are obtained from a cable supplier the initial length of the cable is l 0 and the cable is released with the rate v p v b vertically considering that the actual release rate of a general winch for underwater rov cable is no faster than 75 m min kyo et al 1995 v p is set as 1 0 m s the unstretched length of the variable length element ranges from l e m i n to l e m a x and the l e m a x is also chosen as the nominal length of the fixed length element if the elemental length is zero it will introduce a numerical singularity that cannot be solved in time domain and the state variables have no or multiple solutions the minimum length of the element also cannot be set too small or else the so called stiffness hardening phenomenon will occur and the pseudo high frequency mode will be introduced which is not conducive to the rapid convergence of numerical solutions here the minimal and the maximal unstretched lengths are set as l e m i n 1 0 5 m and l e m a x 5 0 m respectively the parameters of newmark method are set as β 0 25 γ 0 5 the initial step size is selected as δ t 0 1 s and the total solution period is 100 0 s for each case with these conditions in mind the numerical results and discussion are shown as follows 5 2 case one 2d motion without heave but with sea current firstly we consider the case where there is the action of sea current except heave motion at the initial moment the top node of cable is located at the origin of the spatial frame and the cable coincides with the x axis which is the same direction as the gravitational acceleration when the test starts the cable is deployed at the speed of v p 1 0 m s and moves towards the lower right in the o x y plane under both actions of the sea current and the follower force f y as shown in figs 5 and 6 fig 5a shows the variable length cable configurations from 0s to 100s these planar configurations next to each other look like a leaf as a whole and fig 5b shows some typical configurations of the variable length cable at some given times such as 0s 8s 16s 24s 32s 42s 53s 68s 83s 91s and 100s as can be seen explicitly from this figure the cable head stays at the origin but the cable end moves towards the lower right gradually and the cable configuration at each moment is similar to a catenary curve as shown in fig 6a the nodal coordinates of the cable head represented by the small red circle are unchanged and the blue curve indicates time dependent motion track of the cable end which is not a smooth arc strictly more like a polyline composed of multiple straight lines with alternative slopes the initial position of the end node is 1 5 0 0 and it reaches the position of 95 9 27 8 at 100s during the cable deploying the tension carried by the head node is the largest as shown in fig 6b the total wet weight of the cable always increases linearly with the cable length and in addition to the wet weight the cable is also under the action of the hydrodynamic forces of sea current this causes the tension at the cable head to fluctuate around the wet weight and it can be found that the average tension of the head node is slightly higher than the total wet weight the iterations and the time steps are adaptively changed at each iterative step as shown in fig 6c and d it can be seen from these figures that the iterations vary from 1 to 9 most are distributed in the interval between 1 to 4 and the remaining small portions are distributed in the interval between 5 to 9 the iterative step sizes are distributed in three step sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s in the first 30s the step size of 0 05s is adopted the number of iterations is within a narrow interval between 1 to 4 indicating that the solution speed is fast in the interval from the 30s to 60s two step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used the wide variation of the iterative numbers from 1 to 8 indicates that the solution speed is relatively slower and the calculation does not converge easily corresponding to the larger amplitude of the tension curve in fig 6b thereafter only the step size of 0 1s is used from the 60s to 80s the number of iterations is all within 2 indicating that the solution speed is becoming faster the calculation also converges easily corresponding to the smaller amplitude of the tension curve and in the last 20s the three step sizes of 0 03s 0 05s 0 1s are used respectively including a small step size of 0 03s that has not been used before indicating that the calculation is difficult to converge and the step size should not be too large corresponding to the larger amplitude of the tension curve 5 3 case two 2d motion with heave and sea current next we consider the situation with both sea current and heave motion the initial state of the cable is the same as section5 2 however after starting the test the cable head is deployed with a sinusoidal heave motion which means the cable is moving under the combined actions of heave motion the sea current and the terminal follower force f y in the o x y plane as shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows the dynamic configurations of the variable length cable in the vertical plane during the test time from 0s to 100s all the configurations next to each other resemble a piece of feather as a whole and the movement of the end node is patchy echoing the sinusoidal heave motion at the head node fig 7b shows the configurations of the variable length cable at 11 typical times such as 0s 10s 20s 30s 39s 49s 59s 70s 79s 89s and 100s as can be seen from this figure the cable end gradually moves to the lower right and the cable configuration at each moment is also similar to the catenary curve fig 8a shows the cable head node represented by the red circle fluctuates around the origin with obvious overlap while the blue curve represents the planar motion track of the cable end node which looks like a wavy sawtooth curve obviously the motion of the end node is affected by the sinusoidal heave motion of the head node which is transmitted through the cable so the end node also fluctuates and arrives at the position of 96 9 26 2 in o x y plane at 100s as shown in fig 8b the tension at the cable head is not slightly higher than the wet weight as shown in section5 2 but varies around it an overshoot occurs in the first 5s and the tension once stays above the wet weight until the 22s since then the tension gradually fluctuates around the wet weight with a wider amplitude as the cable length increases the maximum tension in the full test time period reaches about 1 5 times the maximum wet weight it should be noticed that there are several large overshoots around the 70s which may be due to the introduction of pseudo high frequency noise and can be modified by filtering of moving average the number of iterations and the step sizes in the test time are shown in fig 8c d it can be found that the iterations vary from 1 to 10 most are in the interval between 1 to 4 and the distribution of iterative step sizes is focused on two sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s in the first 40s the step size of 0 05s is mainly used the number of iterations is concentrated within a narrow scope between 1 to 4 corresponding to the narrow tension fluctuation of the first 40s in fig 8b after the 40s two kinds of step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used mainly 0 05s and the number of iterations varies widely from 1 to 10 indicating that the solution speed becomes slower and its values can hardly converge corresponding to the wide tension fluctuation in fig 8b 5 4 case three 3d motion without heave but with sea current the motion of the variable length cable is limited to a plane in former cases which will be extended to three dimensions here besides the terminal follower forces f y and f z are applied the entire cable is also subjected to the horizontal sea current that is parallel to the o y z plane under these conditions we first consider the situation where the head node does not have heave motion initially the cable head node is at the origin of the spatial frame and the cable coincides with the x axis when the test starts the cable is deployed at the rate of v p 1 0 m s and moves spatially under the combined actions of the horizontal current and follower forces f y and f z the spatial dynamic configurations of the variable length cable are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 10a b and c the typical configurations of the variable length cable at some times are projected on the o x y o y z o x z planes respectively such as 0s 5s 11s 16s 22s 32s 43s 53s 64s 78s 99s etc as can be seen from fig 10a the cable configuration is presented as an l shape inversely because the cable is forced by the horizontal sea current and the terminal follower force f y together fig 10b shows the cable end moves towards the upper right under the combined actions of f y and f z and in the o x z plane which is perpendicular to the action of sea current the variable length cable moves along the positive x and z directions under its own weight and f z as shown in fig 10c as shown in fig 11a since no heave motion acts upon the cable the head node denoted by the red circle stays static and the motion track represented by the blue spatial curve does not show obvious waveform the position of the end node is 1 5 0 0 0 0 initially and reaches the position of 97 2 6 1 12 2 at 100s it can be seen from fig 11b that the tension of head node varies along with the cable wet weight and the former is slightly higher than the latter in the first 5s due to the sudden release of the cable a certain amount of overshoot is inevitable after that the tension is relatively stable until the 65s and the tension begins to appear more pseudo high frequency noise it can be clearly seen that the spikes make the tension curve fuzzy the changes of the number of iterations and time step sizes are shown in fig 11c d it can be learned that during the test time the iterations vary from 1 to 10 most are distributed in the interval between 1 to 5 and the distribution of the step sizes is mainly focused on three sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s both figures show that the step sizes of 0 03s and 0 05s are mainly used in the first 65s the solution is relatively fast with the number of iterations mainly concentrated on 2 or 3 corresponding to the smaller amplitude of the tension curve in fig 11b after the 65s two step sizes of 0 05s and 0 1s are used and the number of iterations varies widely between 1 and 10 indicating that the numerical convergence is difficult during this time interval which corresponds to the pseudo high frequency noise segment of the tension curve 5 5 case four 3d motion with heave and sea current here we consider the situation where there is heave motion acting upon the first node the cable is deployed at the rate of v p 1 0 m s and moves spatially under the combined actions of the heave motion the horizontal current and the terminal follower forces f y and f z the dynamic spatial configurations of the variable length cable are shown in fig 12 which are connected to resemble a shell with serrated edges as shown in fig 13a b and c the typical cable configurations at some moments are projected on the o x y o y z and o x z planes respectively such as 0s 6s 12s 17s 29s 40s 52s 64s 75s 87s 99s etc fig 13a shows the cable configuration still exhibits an inverted l shape as shown in fig 13b the bottom cable is still moving towards the upper right under those combined actions in the o x z plane the variable length cable still moves along the positive x and z axes under its own weight and f z as shown in fig 13c it can be observed that the heave motion of the first node has little effect on the motion tendency of the variable length cable as shown in fig 14a the first node is up and down around the origin point and the moving trail of the last node forms a jagged curve in space the sinusoidal motion of the first node is transmitted in the form of wave to the last node which exhibits the motion similar to the sinusoidal wave at the initial moment the position of the last node is 1 5 0 0 0 0 and at 100s it reaches the position of 98 3 2 9 11 3 it can be seen from fig 14b that the cable tension gradually varies around its wet weight similar to fig 8b and this tension curve is generally smoother with fewer spikes fig 14c d show that the number of iterations varies from 1 to 7 mainly concentrated on 2 iterations while the step sizes are mostly concentrated on two sizes of 0 03s and 0 05s with a small part that 0 1s is used it can be learned that it is feasible to solve this three dimensional nonlinear problem with only 2 iterations and the time step sizes within 0 05s during most of test time meaning the numerical solution has a high speed and converges easily which can also be verified from the smoother tension curve in fig 14b 6 conclusions in the present work a novel nonlinear finite element model of the variable length underwater cable with time varying coefficients is developed from the strong differential equations to the weak virtual work formulation and the implicit newmark method with adaptive step sizes and mesh rediscretization are applied to solve the cable model numerically the proposed approaches are then validated by comparing with the results of two sets of available experimental data through performance analysis of four numerical cases under the significant actions of the top alternating excitation horizontal sea current and terminal follower forces some conclusions can be summarized here as the variable length cable goes through the large displacement and rotation in plane or spatially the cable configurations appear different for each of the aforementioned cases for example in the case of planar movement with the action of heave motion the edge of the continuous dynamic configurations i e the motion trajectory of the last node is jagged but it is not obvious in the case where no heave motion exists in the three dimensional cases with heave motion a similar phenomenon occurs even though the cable configurations are out of the plane this shows that the heave motion of the first node can be propagated in the form of wave to the end node by the cable so that it has a similar form of motion as the head and this propagation has little to do with the actions of sea current or terminal follower forces although these actions can unavoidably change the dynamic configurations of the cable for instance when the force f y applied to the last node is opposite to the direction of sea current the cable end can be moved against the sea current and f z can move the cable end in the direction towards the positive z axis as well in terms of the cable tension at each moment it is obvious that the wet weight of the first node is larger than that of the other nodes along the entire cable and it varies linearly with the cable length in spite of the cases in plane or three dimensional the cable tension at the first node generally has two different kinds of representation when there is no heave motion the average tension will be slightly higher than the wet weight but when there is heave motion the tension will fluctuate around the wet weight and the tension amplitude also will be amplified gradually as the cable is deploying more as far as the numerical solution is concerned the time step sizes and the number of iterations are varying freely at each time due to the adaptive time step scheme from those four cases we can observe that the step sizes are mainly concentrated on the three sizes of 0 03s 0 05s and 0 1s and the iterations are almost no more than 10 times some iterations even need only 1 time to achieve convergence most of iterations may take 2 to 4 times and only a few iterations need 5 to 10 times these numerical cases show that by selecting the step sizes adaptively the convergence can be achieved with a small number of iterations which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in calculating such strongly nonlinear problems future improvements may include comparisons with other analytic results and experimental data for the underwater cables such as the tethered towed and mooring etc which should take advantage of the advanced measurement technology for the cable motion and tension the water flow rate and the cable physical parameters so as to minimize the measurement errors as much as possible additional efforts to extend the proposed approaches to the cable systems which have multiple branches topologically are suggested and analysis of the impact of launch and recovery operations on these systems is important to enrich this research through these comparisons and extensions the models and algorithms used in this paper are further improved so that they can be applied to predict and evaluate the dynamics of the variable length underwater cable systems and provide references for their optimization design dynamic control and marine operations credit authorship contribution statement weicai quan

21698,scale models are normally designed as alternatives to true ship structures in ultimate strength experiments in this paper a series of true ship hull girders of a 10 000 teu container ship under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness are modeled and analyzed to investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girders ultimate strength and collapse behaviors aiming at developing a more precise scaling criterion of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship in addition the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion has been validated by a series of simplified ship hull girder models of which the numerical results have been validated by scale model experiments results show that under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness the first order scaling law which is derived based on dimension analysis has significant errors in quantifying the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship correspondingly an empirically modified scaling criterion is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship keywords ultimate strength collapse behaviors first order scaling law scaling characteristics modified scaling criterion 1 introduction the scaling law of structural strength is a very classical problem which has been discussed for decades compared with brittle materials such as concrete and glass whose scaling process of structural strength has a characteristic length in dimension analysis the scaling effect of the structural strength of elastoplastic materials whose failure condition can be solely expressed in terms of stress and strain is normally considered to be not so significant bazant 2003 as a result the scaling effect of the ultimate strength and failure behaviors of thin walled hull girder structures which have an elastic or elastoplastic buckling failure basis has always been neglected however for the hull girder structures with a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials the whole progressive collapse process exhibits a highly nonlinear nature including geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity therefore the linear elastic scaling law which is directly derived with dimension analysis is inherently not accurate enough to quantify the scaling process of the ultimate strength between scale model and prototype according to the dimension analysis in thin walled girder theory the scaling criterion between scale model and prototype can be expressed as 1 c σ c m c w or c σ c m c l 2 c t 2 and c σ σ p σ m c m m p m m c w w p w m c l l p l m c t t p t m where c σ c m c w c l c t are the scaling factors of stresses σ bending moment m section modulus w geometrical length l and plate thickness t respectively currently the above scaling criterion is the only feasible way to design the scale model to represent the full scale structures in collapse tests and the following first order scaling law which is derived with dimension analysis is the most commonly used criterion to interpret the test results which are obtained with scale models into those of true ship hull girder structures 3 m s c a l e mod e l m t r u e s h i p c l 2 c t in which certain second order effects are neglected garbatov et al 2015 the accuracy of eq 3 will be evaluated based on the numerical results in section 3 1 compared with theoretical study or numerical analysis ultimate strength experiment is considered to be the most convincing and representative measurement of the ultimate strength and failure behaviors of hull girder structures especially for ship and ship like structures which have a very complicated configuration in the design procedure of ship structures collapse tests are the essential part for evaluating the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the object hull girder structure due to the huge cost and extremely high requirements for the loading and load carrying capacity of laboratory in the collapse tests of a true full scale ship geometrically similar scale models are normally designed as alternatives to the true ship structures to obtain the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of them compared with the experimental studies on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates paik 2008 kolanu et al 2016 cui and wang 2020 scale model experiments of ship hull girders are of more cost and more value a collapse test of a 1 3 scale steel frigate model that could represent a typical warship hull structure subjected to bending loads was performed by dow 1991 in which experimental results were compared with theoretical strength predictions and some insightful suggestions were made for further research paik et al 2013 developed a modified paik mansour formula for the ultimate strength calculations of ship hull girders subjected to vertical bending moments and the accuracy of the developed formula was demonstrated through comparisons with the computations based on nonlinear finite element method intelligent super size finite element method and idealized structural unit method a series of collapse tests with 1 100 scale models of the hull girder were conducted by iijima et al 2015 to investigate the post ultimate strength behaviors of a ship hull girder under whipping loads induced by waves later the ultimate strength performance of a 5250teu container ship under combined loads was experimentally studied with several 1 13 scale models by tanaka et al 2016 aiming at developing an analysis method of the ultimate strength of hull girders under combined loads liu et al 2018 conducted an experimental study of the ultimate strength of a 1 8 swath ship model observing the collapse behaviors of the swath ship subjected to transverse loads more recently a 1 25 scale model collapse test was performed by wang et al 2019 to experimentally investigate the longitudinal bending strength characteristics of an ultra large container ship having illustrated the model design principles and experiment procedures and the ultimate torsional strength performance of an ultra large container ship was experimentally studied by wang et al 2020 having made an evaluation of the ultimate torsional strength of the true ship based on the experimentally obtained results with a 1 25 scale model and the existing scaling law it is obvious that the scale model with a larger scale could be more representative of the true ship structure in collapse behaviors and ultimate strength therefore the full scale model collapse test is normally required in the loading capacity tests of airplane structures to guarantee a result which is accurate enough to characterize the collapse behaviors and ultimate strength of the object structures however for ship structures it is normally unrealistic to conduct full scale model collapse test especially for the structures with a very large dimension like ultra large container ships as is shown in eq 1 the geometrical length l the plate thickness t and the applied load m or f are normally chosen as the basic scaling parameters in the design procedure of the scale model for thin walled hull girder structures the scaling factor of geometrical length l and the plate thickness t can not keep identical since it is impossible to manufacture the scale models with very thin plates when the scaling factor of geometrical length l is not large enough which brings some uncertainties to the converting process of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors between scale model and true ship the objective of this research is to numerically investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors with the scale models under different scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t aiming at making a numerical assessment of the first order scaling law which is derived with dimension analysis and proposing a modified scaling criterion to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship in this paper taking geometrical length l and plate thickness t as two basic design variables a typical transverse mid ship section of a 10 000 teu container ship is adopted as the study object to perform a series of collapse analyses in addition to true ship hull girders simplified hull girders are also modeled to make a comparison with true ship hull girders examining the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion and the accuracy and reliability of the nonlinear finite element analysis involved in this research has been validated by the scale model collapse test of the simplified ship hull girder 2 methodology 2 1 fe modeling of the true ship 2 1 1 description of the object ship the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 the main dimensions and details of the ship are shown in table 1 and table 2 a 1 2 mid ship compartment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads is adopted as the study object and the finite element model is displayed in fig 2 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic materials with the yielding stress of 390 mpa for ah material and 460 mpa for eh material young s modulus of 2 06e 05 mpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and the density of 7 85 t m 3 as is shown in fig 2 different properties of the local plates and stiffeners have been displayed in different colors from which it can be observed that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials 2 1 2 mesh 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 are adopted in the finite element model it is known that the mesh size could have a significant effect on the results obtained with finite element analysis to make the numerical results as accurate as possible the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the yielding and local buckling behaviors of the hull girder however finer meshes require much greater computation efforts which means that it has to make a balance between the mesh size and computation capability it can be observed from fig 3 that the progressive collapse process of the hull girder exhibits quite a stable state under the element sizes ranging from 100 mm to 300 mm in this paper element size of 200 mm is adopted in the finite element models to guarantee a precise numerical result and a relatively high computation efficiency it should be mentioned that for the fe models established in this paper the meshes were created based on an average size of the element that s to say 200 mm is an average element size adopted in the fe models of the full scaled ship hull girder with this average element size the elements between stiffeners were automatically divided into an even or an odd number as a result some of the plate s element numbers between stiffeners are odd and some are even theoretically odd number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners may not be able to well capture the maximum deflection point of the plate therefore an even number of the elements between stiffeners should be required for the study purpose of this paper to examine the effect of the odd numbers of the elements between stiffeners on hull girder s ultimate strength which we care about most the odd numbers of the elements between stiffeners in the original fe model of the full scaled ship hull girder were adjusted to the even ones in the new fe model without any other adjustments and modifications see fig 4 the comparisons of the obtained hull girder s ultimate strength before and after mesh adjustments were displayed in fig 5 in which m b u and m t u respectively denotes the ultimate bending strength for hogging and sagging case and ultimate torsional strength for torsion case of the original full scaled ship hull girder it can be observed from the following fig 5 that for both bending and torsion case the change of the obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder is very little before and after the mesh adjustments that s to say for the fe models which were created based on the average element size of 200 mm although some of the plate s element numbers between stiffeners are odd they have little effect on the obtained hull girder s ultimate strength which we care about most in this research 2 1 3 initial geometric imperfections for stiffened panel structures initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses are inevitably produced during the welding fabrication process which could affect the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder structure paik et al 2004 for the numerical model the initial deflections have been imposed into the hull girder members by modeling the shape and magnitude of the initial geometric imperfections corresponding to true ship structures two types of initial deflections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the stiffeners respectively tanaka et al 2014 cui et al 2016 ao and wang 2016 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 the detailed illustrations of the initial geometric imperfections can be referred in wang et al 2018 which are not introduced here for the study purpose of this paper as for residual stresses they are not taken into account due to the difficulties in the quantitative control of them causing some uncertainties to the scaling process between scale model and true ship in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 10 13 of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be decreased due to the effect of the residual stresses relevant information about the effect of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates can also be found in kim et al 2018 and more details can be referred in issc 2009 issc 2012 and paik 2018 it should also be noted that during the manufacture process of ship structures the residual stresses of structural components can be partially released by loading and unloading cycles in a small amplitude which can effectively weaken the effect of residual stresses on the overall stiffness of ship structures 2 1 4 boundary conditions and load applications with regard to the fem modeling technique such as boundary conditions and load applications there are relevant information by other researchers according to issc 2009 and issc 2012 for the hull girder to efficiently distribute the moment loads across a section it is advisable to tie all nodes in an end section of the model to a central located master node through rigid links or multipoint constraints and apply the moment loads through the master node partially restrained boundary condition is considered to be more representative of true ship hull girders paik et al 2001 hughes and paik 2010 which have also been adopted in the nonlinear finite element analysis of hull girder s ultimate strength paik et al 2013 kim et al 2013 wang et al 2018 for partially restrained boundary condition the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free a rigid body constraint is created for the nodes of the unloaded end section and tied to a reference point locating at the centroid of the end section by which the load application can be transmitted to the loaded end section what should be noted is that the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and will not affect the result solution with the rigid body constraint which has been verified by wang et al 2018 2 2 design of the scale models of true ship hull girder taking the scaling factors of geometric length c l and plate thickness c t as two variables a series of scale hull girder models are created under the scales of geometric length ranging from 1 35 to 1 which are depicted in fig 6 and fig 7 geometric properties of the cross sections of the scale models under different scales are shown in table 3 i x x i y y and i z z are the inertial moments about neutral axis in x y and z directions respectively e m is the height of the neutral axis of the cross sections it can be observed from table 3 that the cross sectional inertial moments and the heights of the neutral axes of the cross sections between true ship and scale models can well follow 4 i m i p c l 3 c t and e m e p c l where i p and i m denotes the inertial moment of the cross sections of true ship and scale models respectively e p and e m denotes the height of the neutral axis of the cross sections of true ship and scale models respectively as a result it can be considered that the geometric similarity between true ship and scale models has been well achieved it should be mentioned that the fe models of the scale hull girders were directly scaled based on the fe model of the true ship hull girder without any adjustments and modifications of the local geometric configurations see fig 8 of course from the perspective of the welding manufacturing of ship hull girder structures this is not proper especially for the small scaled models for example the distance between the stiffeners will be too small to perform welding and assembling for small scaled models however for the study purpose of this paper in this way the geometric similarity between true ship and scale models can be perfectly achieved which is the fundamental of this research also it can be observed from fig 1 that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials this is exactly why we insisted that the true ship hull girder s configuration should be adopted as the study object to develop the new scaling criterion in addition it should be noted that the scaling effect of the material property e g the yielding strength of the materials on the ultimate strength of the hull girder is not discussed because it is not very hard to guarantee a completely identical material property between scale models and true ship in scale model experiments which can eliminate the scaling effect of the material property on hull girder s ultimate strength between scale models and true ship however it is impossible for thin walled marine structures to manufacture the scale models with very thin plates which means that for small scaled models the similarity of the buckling behaviors of hull girder s local members between scale models and true ship can not be achieved and may bring significant errors to the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship with the existing scaling criterion therefore the scale combinations of only geometric length and plate thickness are discussed in this paper to investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors aiming at developing a modified and more precise scaling criterion 3 results 3 1 scaling characteristics of ultimate strength 3 1 1 for sagging case ultimate bending strength for sagging case is adopted as the illustrative example to show the scaling characteristics of true ship hull girder s ultimate strength the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength for hogging and torsion case can also be obtained in the same way corresponding to physical implications the form of the fitted function is constrained as follows 5 m b u m b u 1 c l a c t b where m b u and m b u 1 denotes the ultimate bending strength of the scale model under a certain scale and the ultimate bending strength of the full scale ship respectively as is shown in fig 9 in conjunction with table 4 and table 5 based on the numerical results eq 6 is obtained with nonlinear surface fitting method which is also the optimal fitted equation to quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between the full scale ship and the scale models under all the scale combinations of 1 35 1 for c l and 1 6 1 for c t 6 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 855 c t 1 226 for sagging case as is presented in figs 9 and 10 it turns out that the obtained equation can well represent the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between the full scale ship and the scale models under all the scales as is mentioned before eq 3 is derived based on the dimension analysis and is currently the most commonly used criterion to convert the ultimate strength which is obtained with scale models into that of the full scale hull girder structures in this paper eq 6 is developed based on the numerical results obtained by nonlinear finite element analysis and is considered to be able to well quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship in addition the accuracy and reliability of the proposed eq 6 and the nonlinear finite element analysis will be validated in section 4 here to evaluate the accuracy of eq 3 and show the scaling effect of hull girder s ultimate strength between scale models and true ship the differences of the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and eq 6 under different scales are obtained by 7 difference m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 3 m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 6 m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 3 100 of which the results have been plotted in fig 8 and displayed in table 6 to more clearly show the differences between eq 3 and eq 6 under different scales it can be observed from fig 11 that the differences of the converted ultimate strength between eq 3 and eq 6 are very small only when the geometric scaling factors c l are equal to the plate thickness scaling factors c t however the above differences will become larger and larger with the increase of the difference between the geometric scaling factors c l and the plate thickness scaling factors c t the difference can even approach 67 4 when the ultimate strength of the true ship is converted with eq 3 under a small geometric scaling factor c l but a large plate thickness scaling factor c t and vice versa that s to say the scaling effect of the ultimate strength between the true ship and the scale model can not be neglected when the scale models are designed with an unequal scale of the geometric length l and plate thickness t what should be noticed here is that the scale models employed in model experiments are normally designed with a small geometric scaling factor c l but a relatively large plate thickness scaling factor c t which means that there exist large errors in the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship based on eq 3 corresponding to this problem above eq 6 was proposed as a correction to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between the true ship and scale models similar scaling characteristics of the collapse behaviors between the true ship and the scale models will be discussed in section 3 2 theoretically to well achieve the similarity of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors between the true ship and scale models the similarity of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates which are the basic components of ship hull structures should be satisfied as is known for stiffened plates subjected to compression the ultimate strength and buckling behaviors of them strongly depend on the plate slenderness which is defined by 8 β b t σ y e in which b t σ y e is the plate width between stiffeners plate thickness yielding stress of materials and young s modulus respectively however for thin walled marine structures it is impossible to design a scale model with an equal scaling factor of geometric length l and plate thickness t since it is impossible to use very thin plates to manufacture the scale model as a result the same plate slenderness β of the stiffened plates can not be achieved between true ship and scale model which means that the similarity of the ultimate strength and buckling behaviors of the local plates can not be guaranteed between true ship and scale model causing the scaling effect of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the ship hull structures under different scales 3 1 2 for hogging and torsion case similarly the modified scaling equations for hogging and torsion case can be obtained in the same way which are presented as follows 9 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 823 c t 1 237 for hogging case 10 m t u m t u 1 c l 1 894 c t 1 192 for torsion case in which m t u and m t u 1 denotes the ultimate torsional strength of the scale model under a certain scale and the ultimate torsional strength of the full scale ship respectively the differences of the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and eq 9 for hogging case or eq 10 for torsion case under different scales have been plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 it can be observed from figs 12 and 13 that there also exist large differences in the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and the proposed equations eq 9 and eq 10 in this paper especially when the scale models are designed with a small geometric scaling factor c l but a relatively large plate thickness scaling factor c t 87 6 for hogging case and 45 8 for torsion case indicating that it is necessary to employ the new scaling criterions proposed in this paper to design the scale models when model experiments are conducted 3 2 scaling characteristics of collapse behaviors 3 2 1 for sagging case the collapse behaviors of the 36 hull girder models under the scales of 1 6 1 for c l and 1 6 1 for c t are altogether presented in fig 14 a to show the distribution of hull girder s collapse behaviors under different combinations of c l and c t it can be observed from fig 14 a that the collapse behaviors are obviously divided into three zones which have been marked with different symbols that s to say under different combinations of c l and c t c l c t c l c t c l c t there exist three different collapse behaviors which have been typically selected to display in a more detailed way in fig 14 b c and d respectively also to explicitly and quantitatively show the effect of the scale combinations of c l and c t on the position of the predicted neutral axis for sagging case the differences of the predicted height of the neutral axis between the scale models under different scale combinations and true ship i e full scaled ship are plotted in fig 15 in which the differences are evaluated by 11 difference e m scale model h scale model e m true ship h true ship e m true ship h true ship 100 in which e m scale model e m true ship h scale model and h true ship respectively denotes the height of the neutral axis of scale models the height of the neutral axis of true ship i e full scaled ship the overall height of the scale models and the overall height of the true ship it can be observed from fig 14 b that for c l c t no matter what the scale is the plate slenderness of the local plates of hull girder structures is completely identical to each other under two arbitrary scales which means that an arbitrary scale model that satisfies c l c t could represent the true ship in collapse behaviors and for the true ship hull girder i e full scaled ship hull girder under sagging moment heavy buckling will occur both on the upper deck and the side shell structures causing the overall failure of the hull girder structure also it can be observed from fig 15 that for c l c t the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are almost equal to zero which means that the predicted positions of the neutral axis of the scale models are completely identical to that of the true ship however for c l c t it can be observed from fig 14 c that no obvious buckling can be witnessed at the ultimate limit state of the hull girder structure which means that the scale models which are designed with an unequal scaling factor of geometric length l and plate thickness t can not well represent the true ship in collapse behaviors especially for the buckling behaviors of the local components of the hull girder in addition the predicted neutral axis is higher than that of the true ship hull girder under sagging moment this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 15 in which the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are larger than zero when c l c t for c l c t it can be observed from fig 14 d that the hull girder collapses only at the upper deck which suffers a heavy buckling and yielding state with no obvious buckling on the side shell structures however also the scale models which are designed with a scale combination of c l c t will predict a lower neutral axis than that of the true ship hull girder which can also be observed in fig 15 that the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are smaller than zero when c l c t in particular as is shown in fig 14 a when the geometric scaling factor c l is slightly larger or slightly smaller than the plate thickness scaling factor c t the collapse behaviors of the hull girder exhibit a transitional characteristics between c l c t and c l c t or c l c t 3 2 2 for hogging case for hogging case similar to sagging case there also exist three different collapse behaviors of the hull girder under different combinations of c l and c t marked with different symbols in fig 16 a similarly for hogging case the differences of the predicted height of the neutral axis between the scale models under different scale combinations and true ship i e full scaled ship are plotted in fig 17 in which the differences are also evaluated by eq 11 for c l c t an arbitrary scale model that satisfies c l c t can represent the true ship in collapse behaviors of which heavy buckling will occur on the double bottom plates and the side shell structures under hogging moment shown in fig 16 b however as is shown in fig 16 c for c l c t no obvious buckling can be observed on the hull girder structure also a lower neutral axis is predicted when the scale models are designed with the scale combinations of c l c t which can also be observed in fig 17 that the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are smaller than zero when c l c t for c l c t as is shown in fig 16 d mild buckling can be witnessed on the bottom plates at the ultimate limit state of the hull girder under hogging moment accompanied by a higher neutral axis than that of the true ship and this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 17 in which the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are larger than zero when c l c t similar to sagging case when the geometric scaling factor c l is slightly larger or slightly smaller than the plate thickness scaling factor c t the hogging collapse behaviors of the hull girder also exhibit a transitional feature between c l c t and c l c t or c l c t 3 2 3 for torsion case similar to sagging and hogging case corresponding to the three combinations of c l and c t three typical collapse behaviors are respectively presented in fig 18 a b and c as is known under torsion the hull girder with a large deck opening mainly collapses in the shear failure mechanism of which the shear buckling and yielding of the side shell structures is the main cause of the overall failure of the hull girder wang et al 2020 for c l c t as is shown in fig 18 a the hull girder models all collapse with mild shear buckling on the side shell structures which could represent the torsional collapse behaviors of the true ship however for c l c t no obvious shear buckling can be observed on the side shell structures shown in fig 18 b when it comes to c l c t it can be seen from fig 18 c that there exist heavy shear buckling waves on the panels of the side shell structures at ultimate limit state of the hull girder 4 validation 4 1 validation of the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion to examine the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion which is developed based on the numerical analysis of the true ship hull girder the simplified hull girder models are also designed with the same scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t as those of the true ship hull girder models and analyzed in the same way as the true ship hull girder models another reason for choosing simplified hull girder models as the study object for verification is that the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girder models could be more easily validated by scale model collapse tests which will be illustrated in section 4 2 4 1 1 design of the scale models of simplified ship hull girder the transverse mid ship section of the simplified ship hull girder is depicted in fig 19 compared with the true ship hull girder the simplified hull girder is mainly simplified in two ways geometry configuration and material composition for geometry configuration the longitudinal stiffeners of the simplified hull girder are more sparsely arranged than those of the true ship hull girder which means that the effective breadth of the stiffened plates of the simplified hull girder is smaller than that of the true ship for material composition corresponding to the scale model collapse tests illustrated in section 4 2 the simplified hull girder is assumed to be made of only one kind of elastic perfectly plastic materials with the yielding stress of 300 mpa however it can be observed from section 2 1 1 that the true ship hull girder is composed of various components with very complicated properties as is mentioned before the simplified hull girder models are designed with the same scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t as those of the true ship which are presented in fig 20 4 1 2 examination of the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion the ultimate strength obtained with the simplified ship hull girder models and the analytical surfaces that could represent the scaling criterion equations developed with the true ship hull girder models for sagging hogging and torsion case are respectively depicted in fig 21 a fig 22 a and fig 23 a to more explicitly show the accuracy and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion the differences of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girder models and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion equations for sagging hogging and torsion case are respectively presented in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b in which the differences are evaluated by 12 difference m s i m p l i f i e d h u l l g i r d e r m p r e d i c t e d b y p r o p o s e d s c a l i n g c r i t e r i o n m p r e d i c t e d b y p r o p o s e d s c a l i n g c r i t e r i o n 100 it can be observed from figs 21 a 22 a and 23 a that the ultimate strength of the simplified hull girders under all the scale combinations for sagging case hogging case and torsion case is in very good agreement with the proposed scaling criterion equations which are developed with true ship hull girders indicating that the proposed scaling criterion can well represent the scaling relations of the ultimate strength of the simplified ship hull girder models designed with different scale combinations the differences of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girders and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion are presented in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b for sagging case hogging case and torsion case respectively it can be observed from the differences displayed in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b that the maximum difference of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girders and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion is only 4 4 4 7 and 5 5 for sagging case hogging case and torsion case respectively therefore the proposed scaling criterion which is numerically developed based on true ship hull girders can also well quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength of simplified hull girders under all scale combinations by which the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion in this paper can be verified 4 2 validation of the accuracy of the numerical models the accuracy of the numerical models based on nonlinear finite element analysis can be verified by hull girder s collapse tests two collapse tests of the hull girder that could represent a scale model of the mid ship compartment of a 10 000 teu container ship were conducted by wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 including both hogging collapse test and torsional collapse test the mid ship section of the scale model employed in the collapse tests is the same as that of the simplified ship hull girders shown in fig 19 detailed information about experiment setup and experiment procedures can be found in wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 of which the comparisons of the numerically and experimentally obtained ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder are presented here to show the accuracy and reliability of the numerical models employed in this research the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder for hogging and torsion case are respectively presented in fig 24 and fig 25 in which both experimental and numerical results are included it can be observed from the load displacement response curves shown in figs 24 a and fig 25 a that the differences of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results are only 8 5 and 3 8 for hogging and torsion case respectively and the difference of the elastic limit strength between experimental and numerical results are even much smaller according to wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 there are two main reasons for the differences of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results on the one hand when external loads approach or even reach the ultimate strength of the hull girder the resultant deformations of the hull girder will be too large to be accurately detected causing the difficulty of the accurate data collection on the other hand the inevitable manufacturing defects such as geometrical imperfections and welding residual stresses in the test model can not be fully reflected in the numerical models which can affect the failure characteristics of corresponding local support members of the hull girder causing a discrepancy of the ultimate strength between experiment and numerical analysis for the torsion case shown in fig 25 a the discrepancy of the load displacement response curves at early stage of the loading process between experiment and numerical analysis is a result of the slip of jigs in the experiment which caused the failure of the detection of the loading point s displacement at early stage of the loading process it can also be observed from the collapse behaviors shown in figs 24 b and fig 25 b that the numerical models can well predict the collapse behaviors of the hull girder for both hogging and torsion case especially for the buckling behaviors involved in the collapse process of the hull girder therefore it can be considered that the numerical models employed in this research could well predict both ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girders 5 conclusions in this paper the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors are numerically investigated with both true ship hull girders and simplified ship hull girders under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness having made a numerical assessment of the existing scaling law which is derived based on the dimension analysis and proposed an empirically modified scaling criterion to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship based on the analysis of this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 there exist significant errors in the existing scaling law which is derived based on the dimension analysis for quantifying the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship especially for the scale models which are designed with two very different scales of geometric length l and plate thickness t 2 the proposed scaling criterion in this paper can be employed to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship when scale models are designed to represent true ship in scale model collapse experiment which is defined as follows 13 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 855 c t 1 226 for sagging case m b u m b u 1 c l 1 823 c t 1 237 for hogging case m t u m t u 1 c l 1 894 c t 1 192 for torsion case 3 there exist three different collapse behaviors of the hull girder for sagging case hogging case and torsion case under different scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t the scale models which are designed with an unequal scale of geometric length and plate thickness can not represent the collapse behaviors of the true ship due to the dissimilarity of the buckling behaviors of the local components of the hull girder 4 it has been demonstrated that the proposed scaling criterion developed with true ship hull girders is very suitable for the scaling relations of simplified ship hull girders by which the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion can be verified credit authorship contribution statement qinghu wang formal analysis data curation writing original

21698,scale models are normally designed as alternatives to true ship structures in ultimate strength experiments in this paper a series of true ship hull girders of a 10 000 teu container ship under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness are modeled and analyzed to investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girders ultimate strength and collapse behaviors aiming at developing a more precise scaling criterion of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship in addition the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion has been validated by a series of simplified ship hull girder models of which the numerical results have been validated by scale model experiments results show that under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness the first order scaling law which is derived based on dimension analysis has significant errors in quantifying the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship correspondingly an empirically modified scaling criterion is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship keywords ultimate strength collapse behaviors first order scaling law scaling characteristics modified scaling criterion 1 introduction the scaling law of structural strength is a very classical problem which has been discussed for decades compared with brittle materials such as concrete and glass whose scaling process of structural strength has a characteristic length in dimension analysis the scaling effect of the structural strength of elastoplastic materials whose failure condition can be solely expressed in terms of stress and strain is normally considered to be not so significant bazant 2003 as a result the scaling effect of the ultimate strength and failure behaviors of thin walled hull girder structures which have an elastic or elastoplastic buckling failure basis has always been neglected however for the hull girder structures with a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials the whole progressive collapse process exhibits a highly nonlinear nature including geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity therefore the linear elastic scaling law which is directly derived with dimension analysis is inherently not accurate enough to quantify the scaling process of the ultimate strength between scale model and prototype according to the dimension analysis in thin walled girder theory the scaling criterion between scale model and prototype can be expressed as 1 c σ c m c w or c σ c m c l 2 c t 2 and c σ σ p σ m c m m p m m c w w p w m c l l p l m c t t p t m where c σ c m c w c l c t are the scaling factors of stresses σ bending moment m section modulus w geometrical length l and plate thickness t respectively currently the above scaling criterion is the only feasible way to design the scale model to represent the full scale structures in collapse tests and the following first order scaling law which is derived with dimension analysis is the most commonly used criterion to interpret the test results which are obtained with scale models into those of true ship hull girder structures 3 m s c a l e mod e l m t r u e s h i p c l 2 c t in which certain second order effects are neglected garbatov et al 2015 the accuracy of eq 3 will be evaluated based on the numerical results in section 3 1 compared with theoretical study or numerical analysis ultimate strength experiment is considered to be the most convincing and representative measurement of the ultimate strength and failure behaviors of hull girder structures especially for ship and ship like structures which have a very complicated configuration in the design procedure of ship structures collapse tests are the essential part for evaluating the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the object hull girder structure due to the huge cost and extremely high requirements for the loading and load carrying capacity of laboratory in the collapse tests of a true full scale ship geometrically similar scale models are normally designed as alternatives to the true ship structures to obtain the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of them compared with the experimental studies on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates paik 2008 kolanu et al 2016 cui and wang 2020 scale model experiments of ship hull girders are of more cost and more value a collapse test of a 1 3 scale steel frigate model that could represent a typical warship hull structure subjected to bending loads was performed by dow 1991 in which experimental results were compared with theoretical strength predictions and some insightful suggestions were made for further research paik et al 2013 developed a modified paik mansour formula for the ultimate strength calculations of ship hull girders subjected to vertical bending moments and the accuracy of the developed formula was demonstrated through comparisons with the computations based on nonlinear finite element method intelligent super size finite element method and idealized structural unit method a series of collapse tests with 1 100 scale models of the hull girder were conducted by iijima et al 2015 to investigate the post ultimate strength behaviors of a ship hull girder under whipping loads induced by waves later the ultimate strength performance of a 5250teu container ship under combined loads was experimentally studied with several 1 13 scale models by tanaka et al 2016 aiming at developing an analysis method of the ultimate strength of hull girders under combined loads liu et al 2018 conducted an experimental study of the ultimate strength of a 1 8 swath ship model observing the collapse behaviors of the swath ship subjected to transverse loads more recently a 1 25 scale model collapse test was performed by wang et al 2019 to experimentally investigate the longitudinal bending strength characteristics of an ultra large container ship having illustrated the model design principles and experiment procedures and the ultimate torsional strength performance of an ultra large container ship was experimentally studied by wang et al 2020 having made an evaluation of the ultimate torsional strength of the true ship based on the experimentally obtained results with a 1 25 scale model and the existing scaling law it is obvious that the scale model with a larger scale could be more representative of the true ship structure in collapse behaviors and ultimate strength therefore the full scale model collapse test is normally required in the loading capacity tests of airplane structures to guarantee a result which is accurate enough to characterize the collapse behaviors and ultimate strength of the object structures however for ship structures it is normally unrealistic to conduct full scale model collapse test especially for the structures with a very large dimension like ultra large container ships as is shown in eq 1 the geometrical length l the plate thickness t and the applied load m or f are normally chosen as the basic scaling parameters in the design procedure of the scale model for thin walled hull girder structures the scaling factor of geometrical length l and the plate thickness t can not keep identical since it is impossible to manufacture the scale models with very thin plates when the scaling factor of geometrical length l is not large enough which brings some uncertainties to the converting process of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors between scale model and true ship the objective of this research is to numerically investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors with the scale models under different scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t aiming at making a numerical assessment of the first order scaling law which is derived with dimension analysis and proposing a modified scaling criterion to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale model and true ship in this paper taking geometrical length l and plate thickness t as two basic design variables a typical transverse mid ship section of a 10 000 teu container ship is adopted as the study object to perform a series of collapse analyses in addition to true ship hull girders simplified hull girders are also modeled to make a comparison with true ship hull girders examining the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion and the accuracy and reliability of the nonlinear finite element analysis involved in this research has been validated by the scale model collapse test of the simplified ship hull girder 2 methodology 2 1 fe modeling of the true ship 2 1 1 description of the object ship the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 the main dimensions and details of the ship are shown in table 1 and table 2 a 1 2 mid ship compartment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads is adopted as the study object and the finite element model is displayed in fig 2 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic materials with the yielding stress of 390 mpa for ah material and 460 mpa for eh material young s modulus of 2 06e 05 mpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and the density of 7 85 t m 3 as is shown in fig 2 different properties of the local plates and stiffeners have been displayed in different colors from which it can be observed that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials 2 1 2 mesh 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 are adopted in the finite element model it is known that the mesh size could have a significant effect on the results obtained with finite element analysis to make the numerical results as accurate as possible the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the yielding and local buckling behaviors of the hull girder however finer meshes require much greater computation efforts which means that it has to make a balance between the mesh size and computation capability it can be observed from fig 3 that the progressive collapse process of the hull girder exhibits quite a stable state under the element sizes ranging from 100 mm to 300 mm in this paper element size of 200 mm is adopted in the finite element models to guarantee a precise numerical result and a relatively high computation efficiency it should be mentioned that for the fe models established in this paper the meshes were created based on an average size of the element that s to say 200 mm is an average element size adopted in the fe models of the full scaled ship hull girder with this average element size the elements between stiffeners were automatically divided into an even or an odd number as a result some of the plate s element numbers between stiffeners are odd and some are even theoretically odd number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners may not be able to well capture the maximum deflection point of the plate therefore an even number of the elements between stiffeners should be required for the study purpose of this paper to examine the effect of the odd numbers of the elements between stiffeners on hull girder s ultimate strength which we care about most the odd numbers of the elements between stiffeners in the original fe model of the full scaled ship hull girder were adjusted to the even ones in the new fe model without any other adjustments and modifications see fig 4 the comparisons of the obtained hull girder s ultimate strength before and after mesh adjustments were displayed in fig 5 in which m b u and m t u respectively denotes the ultimate bending strength for hogging and sagging case and ultimate torsional strength for torsion case of the original full scaled ship hull girder it can be observed from the following fig 5 that for both bending and torsion case the change of the obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder is very little before and after the mesh adjustments that s to say for the fe models which were created based on the average element size of 200 mm although some of the plate s element numbers between stiffeners are odd they have little effect on the obtained hull girder s ultimate strength which we care about most in this research 2 1 3 initial geometric imperfections for stiffened panel structures initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses are inevitably produced during the welding fabrication process which could affect the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder structure paik et al 2004 for the numerical model the initial deflections have been imposed into the hull girder members by modeling the shape and magnitude of the initial geometric imperfections corresponding to true ship structures two types of initial deflections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the stiffeners respectively tanaka et al 2014 cui et al 2016 ao and wang 2016 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 the detailed illustrations of the initial geometric imperfections can be referred in wang et al 2018 which are not introduced here for the study purpose of this paper as for residual stresses they are not taken into account due to the difficulties in the quantitative control of them causing some uncertainties to the scaling process between scale model and true ship in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 10 13 of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be decreased due to the effect of the residual stresses relevant information about the effect of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates can also be found in kim et al 2018 and more details can be referred in issc 2009 issc 2012 and paik 2018 it should also be noted that during the manufacture process of ship structures the residual stresses of structural components can be partially released by loading and unloading cycles in a small amplitude which can effectively weaken the effect of residual stresses on the overall stiffness of ship structures 2 1 4 boundary conditions and load applications with regard to the fem modeling technique such as boundary conditions and load applications there are relevant information by other researchers according to issc 2009 and issc 2012 for the hull girder to efficiently distribute the moment loads across a section it is advisable to tie all nodes in an end section of the model to a central located master node through rigid links or multipoint constraints and apply the moment loads through the master node partially restrained boundary condition is considered to be more representative of true ship hull girders paik et al 2001 hughes and paik 2010 which have also been adopted in the nonlinear finite element analysis of hull girder s ultimate strength paik et al 2013 kim et al 2013 wang et al 2018 for partially restrained boundary condition the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free a rigid body constraint is created for the nodes of the unloaded end section and tied to a reference point locating at the centroid of the end section by which the load application can be transmitted to the loaded end section what should be noted is that the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and will not affect the result solution with the rigid body constraint which has been verified by wang et al 2018 2 2 design of the scale models of true ship hull girder taking the scaling factors of geometric length c l and plate thickness c t as two variables a series of scale hull girder models are created under the scales of geometric length ranging from 1 35 to 1 which are depicted in fig 6 and fig 7 geometric properties of the cross sections of the scale models under different scales are shown in table 3 i x x i y y and i z z are the inertial moments about neutral axis in x y and z directions respectively e m is the height of the neutral axis of the cross sections it can be observed from table 3 that the cross sectional inertial moments and the heights of the neutral axes of the cross sections between true ship and scale models can well follow 4 i m i p c l 3 c t and e m e p c l where i p and i m denotes the inertial moment of the cross sections of true ship and scale models respectively e p and e m denotes the height of the neutral axis of the cross sections of true ship and scale models respectively as a result it can be considered that the geometric similarity between true ship and scale models has been well achieved it should be mentioned that the fe models of the scale hull girders were directly scaled based on the fe model of the true ship hull girder without any adjustments and modifications of the local geometric configurations see fig 8 of course from the perspective of the welding manufacturing of ship hull girder structures this is not proper especially for the small scaled models for example the distance between the stiffeners will be too small to perform welding and assembling for small scaled models however for the study purpose of this paper in this way the geometric similarity between true ship and scale models can be perfectly achieved which is the fundamental of this research also it can be observed from fig 1 that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials this is exactly why we insisted that the true ship hull girder s configuration should be adopted as the study object to develop the new scaling criterion in addition it should be noted that the scaling effect of the material property e g the yielding strength of the materials on the ultimate strength of the hull girder is not discussed because it is not very hard to guarantee a completely identical material property between scale models and true ship in scale model experiments which can eliminate the scaling effect of the material property on hull girder s ultimate strength between scale models and true ship however it is impossible for thin walled marine structures to manufacture the scale models with very thin plates which means that for small scaled models the similarity of the buckling behaviors of hull girder s local members between scale models and true ship can not be achieved and may bring significant errors to the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship with the existing scaling criterion therefore the scale combinations of only geometric length and plate thickness are discussed in this paper to investigate the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors aiming at developing a modified and more precise scaling criterion 3 results 3 1 scaling characteristics of ultimate strength 3 1 1 for sagging case ultimate bending strength for sagging case is adopted as the illustrative example to show the scaling characteristics of true ship hull girder s ultimate strength the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength for hogging and torsion case can also be obtained in the same way corresponding to physical implications the form of the fitted function is constrained as follows 5 m b u m b u 1 c l a c t b where m b u and m b u 1 denotes the ultimate bending strength of the scale model under a certain scale and the ultimate bending strength of the full scale ship respectively as is shown in fig 9 in conjunction with table 4 and table 5 based on the numerical results eq 6 is obtained with nonlinear surface fitting method which is also the optimal fitted equation to quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between the full scale ship and the scale models under all the scale combinations of 1 35 1 for c l and 1 6 1 for c t 6 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 855 c t 1 226 for sagging case as is presented in figs 9 and 10 it turns out that the obtained equation can well represent the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between the full scale ship and the scale models under all the scales as is mentioned before eq 3 is derived based on the dimension analysis and is currently the most commonly used criterion to convert the ultimate strength which is obtained with scale models into that of the full scale hull girder structures in this paper eq 6 is developed based on the numerical results obtained by nonlinear finite element analysis and is considered to be able to well quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship in addition the accuracy and reliability of the proposed eq 6 and the nonlinear finite element analysis will be validated in section 4 here to evaluate the accuracy of eq 3 and show the scaling effect of hull girder s ultimate strength between scale models and true ship the differences of the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and eq 6 under different scales are obtained by 7 difference m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 3 m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 6 m c o n v e r t e d b y e q 3 100 of which the results have been plotted in fig 8 and displayed in table 6 to more clearly show the differences between eq 3 and eq 6 under different scales it can be observed from fig 11 that the differences of the converted ultimate strength between eq 3 and eq 6 are very small only when the geometric scaling factors c l are equal to the plate thickness scaling factors c t however the above differences will become larger and larger with the increase of the difference between the geometric scaling factors c l and the plate thickness scaling factors c t the difference can even approach 67 4 when the ultimate strength of the true ship is converted with eq 3 under a small geometric scaling factor c l but a large plate thickness scaling factor c t and vice versa that s to say the scaling effect of the ultimate strength between the true ship and the scale model can not be neglected when the scale models are designed with an unequal scale of the geometric length l and plate thickness t what should be noticed here is that the scale models employed in model experiments are normally designed with a small geometric scaling factor c l but a relatively large plate thickness scaling factor c t which means that there exist large errors in the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship based on eq 3 corresponding to this problem above eq 6 was proposed as a correction to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between the true ship and scale models similar scaling characteristics of the collapse behaviors between the true ship and the scale models will be discussed in section 3 2 theoretically to well achieve the similarity of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors between the true ship and scale models the similarity of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates which are the basic components of ship hull structures should be satisfied as is known for stiffened plates subjected to compression the ultimate strength and buckling behaviors of them strongly depend on the plate slenderness which is defined by 8 β b t σ y e in which b t σ y e is the plate width between stiffeners plate thickness yielding stress of materials and young s modulus respectively however for thin walled marine structures it is impossible to design a scale model with an equal scaling factor of geometric length l and plate thickness t since it is impossible to use very thin plates to manufacture the scale model as a result the same plate slenderness β of the stiffened plates can not be achieved between true ship and scale model which means that the similarity of the ultimate strength and buckling behaviors of the local plates can not be guaranteed between true ship and scale model causing the scaling effect of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the ship hull structures under different scales 3 1 2 for hogging and torsion case similarly the modified scaling equations for hogging and torsion case can be obtained in the same way which are presented as follows 9 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 823 c t 1 237 for hogging case 10 m t u m t u 1 c l 1 894 c t 1 192 for torsion case in which m t u and m t u 1 denotes the ultimate torsional strength of the scale model under a certain scale and the ultimate torsional strength of the full scale ship respectively the differences of the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and eq 9 for hogging case or eq 10 for torsion case under different scales have been plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 it can be observed from figs 12 and 13 that there also exist large differences in the converted ultimate strength of the true ship between eq 3 and the proposed equations eq 9 and eq 10 in this paper especially when the scale models are designed with a small geometric scaling factor c l but a relatively large plate thickness scaling factor c t 87 6 for hogging case and 45 8 for torsion case indicating that it is necessary to employ the new scaling criterions proposed in this paper to design the scale models when model experiments are conducted 3 2 scaling characteristics of collapse behaviors 3 2 1 for sagging case the collapse behaviors of the 36 hull girder models under the scales of 1 6 1 for c l and 1 6 1 for c t are altogether presented in fig 14 a to show the distribution of hull girder s collapse behaviors under different combinations of c l and c t it can be observed from fig 14 a that the collapse behaviors are obviously divided into three zones which have been marked with different symbols that s to say under different combinations of c l and c t c l c t c l c t c l c t there exist three different collapse behaviors which have been typically selected to display in a more detailed way in fig 14 b c and d respectively also to explicitly and quantitatively show the effect of the scale combinations of c l and c t on the position of the predicted neutral axis for sagging case the differences of the predicted height of the neutral axis between the scale models under different scale combinations and true ship i e full scaled ship are plotted in fig 15 in which the differences are evaluated by 11 difference e m scale model h scale model e m true ship h true ship e m true ship h true ship 100 in which e m scale model e m true ship h scale model and h true ship respectively denotes the height of the neutral axis of scale models the height of the neutral axis of true ship i e full scaled ship the overall height of the scale models and the overall height of the true ship it can be observed from fig 14 b that for c l c t no matter what the scale is the plate slenderness of the local plates of hull girder structures is completely identical to each other under two arbitrary scales which means that an arbitrary scale model that satisfies c l c t could represent the true ship in collapse behaviors and for the true ship hull girder i e full scaled ship hull girder under sagging moment heavy buckling will occur both on the upper deck and the side shell structures causing the overall failure of the hull girder structure also it can be observed from fig 15 that for c l c t the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are almost equal to zero which means that the predicted positions of the neutral axis of the scale models are completely identical to that of the true ship however for c l c t it can be observed from fig 14 c that no obvious buckling can be witnessed at the ultimate limit state of the hull girder structure which means that the scale models which are designed with an unequal scaling factor of geometric length l and plate thickness t can not well represent the true ship in collapse behaviors especially for the buckling behaviors of the local components of the hull girder in addition the predicted neutral axis is higher than that of the true ship hull girder under sagging moment this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 15 in which the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are larger than zero when c l c t for c l c t it can be observed from fig 14 d that the hull girder collapses only at the upper deck which suffers a heavy buckling and yielding state with no obvious buckling on the side shell structures however also the scale models which are designed with a scale combination of c l c t will predict a lower neutral axis than that of the true ship hull girder which can also be observed in fig 15 that the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are smaller than zero when c l c t in particular as is shown in fig 14 a when the geometric scaling factor c l is slightly larger or slightly smaller than the plate thickness scaling factor c t the collapse behaviors of the hull girder exhibit a transitional characteristics between c l c t and c l c t or c l c t 3 2 2 for hogging case for hogging case similar to sagging case there also exist three different collapse behaviors of the hull girder under different combinations of c l and c t marked with different symbols in fig 16 a similarly for hogging case the differences of the predicted height of the neutral axis between the scale models under different scale combinations and true ship i e full scaled ship are plotted in fig 17 in which the differences are also evaluated by eq 11 for c l c t an arbitrary scale model that satisfies c l c t can represent the true ship in collapse behaviors of which heavy buckling will occur on the double bottom plates and the side shell structures under hogging moment shown in fig 16 b however as is shown in fig 16 c for c l c t no obvious buckling can be observed on the hull girder structure also a lower neutral axis is predicted when the scale models are designed with the scale combinations of c l c t which can also be observed in fig 17 that the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are smaller than zero when c l c t for c l c t as is shown in fig 16 d mild buckling can be witnessed on the bottom plates at the ultimate limit state of the hull girder under hogging moment accompanied by a higher neutral axis than that of the true ship and this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 17 in which the differences of the height of the predicted neutral axis between scale models and true ship are larger than zero when c l c t similar to sagging case when the geometric scaling factor c l is slightly larger or slightly smaller than the plate thickness scaling factor c t the hogging collapse behaviors of the hull girder also exhibit a transitional feature between c l c t and c l c t or c l c t 3 2 3 for torsion case similar to sagging and hogging case corresponding to the three combinations of c l and c t three typical collapse behaviors are respectively presented in fig 18 a b and c as is known under torsion the hull girder with a large deck opening mainly collapses in the shear failure mechanism of which the shear buckling and yielding of the side shell structures is the main cause of the overall failure of the hull girder wang et al 2020 for c l c t as is shown in fig 18 a the hull girder models all collapse with mild shear buckling on the side shell structures which could represent the torsional collapse behaviors of the true ship however for c l c t no obvious shear buckling can be observed on the side shell structures shown in fig 18 b when it comes to c l c t it can be seen from fig 18 c that there exist heavy shear buckling waves on the panels of the side shell structures at ultimate limit state of the hull girder 4 validation 4 1 validation of the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion to examine the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion which is developed based on the numerical analysis of the true ship hull girder the simplified hull girder models are also designed with the same scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t as those of the true ship hull girder models and analyzed in the same way as the true ship hull girder models another reason for choosing simplified hull girder models as the study object for verification is that the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girder models could be more easily validated by scale model collapse tests which will be illustrated in section 4 2 4 1 1 design of the scale models of simplified ship hull girder the transverse mid ship section of the simplified ship hull girder is depicted in fig 19 compared with the true ship hull girder the simplified hull girder is mainly simplified in two ways geometry configuration and material composition for geometry configuration the longitudinal stiffeners of the simplified hull girder are more sparsely arranged than those of the true ship hull girder which means that the effective breadth of the stiffened plates of the simplified hull girder is smaller than that of the true ship for material composition corresponding to the scale model collapse tests illustrated in section 4 2 the simplified hull girder is assumed to be made of only one kind of elastic perfectly plastic materials with the yielding stress of 300 mpa however it can be observed from section 2 1 1 that the true ship hull girder is composed of various components with very complicated properties as is mentioned before the simplified hull girder models are designed with the same scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t as those of the true ship which are presented in fig 20 4 1 2 examination of the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion the ultimate strength obtained with the simplified ship hull girder models and the analytical surfaces that could represent the scaling criterion equations developed with the true ship hull girder models for sagging hogging and torsion case are respectively depicted in fig 21 a fig 22 a and fig 23 a to more explicitly show the accuracy and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion the differences of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girder models and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion equations for sagging hogging and torsion case are respectively presented in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b in which the differences are evaluated by 12 difference m s i m p l i f i e d h u l l g i r d e r m p r e d i c t e d b y p r o p o s e d s c a l i n g c r i t e r i o n m p r e d i c t e d b y p r o p o s e d s c a l i n g c r i t e r i o n 100 it can be observed from figs 21 a 22 a and 23 a that the ultimate strength of the simplified hull girders under all the scale combinations for sagging case hogging case and torsion case is in very good agreement with the proposed scaling criterion equations which are developed with true ship hull girders indicating that the proposed scaling criterion can well represent the scaling relations of the ultimate strength of the simplified ship hull girder models designed with different scale combinations the differences of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girders and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion are presented in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b for sagging case hogging case and torsion case respectively it can be observed from the differences displayed in figs 21 b 22 b and 23 b that the maximum difference of the ultimate strength between the numerical results obtained with simplified hull girders and those predicted by the proposed scaling criterion is only 4 4 4 7 and 5 5 for sagging case hogging case and torsion case respectively therefore the proposed scaling criterion which is numerically developed based on true ship hull girders can also well quantify the scaling relations of the ultimate strength of simplified hull girders under all scale combinations by which the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion in this paper can be verified 4 2 validation of the accuracy of the numerical models the accuracy of the numerical models based on nonlinear finite element analysis can be verified by hull girder s collapse tests two collapse tests of the hull girder that could represent a scale model of the mid ship compartment of a 10 000 teu container ship were conducted by wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 including both hogging collapse test and torsional collapse test the mid ship section of the scale model employed in the collapse tests is the same as that of the simplified ship hull girders shown in fig 19 detailed information about experiment setup and experiment procedures can be found in wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 of which the comparisons of the numerically and experimentally obtained ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder are presented here to show the accuracy and reliability of the numerical models employed in this research the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder for hogging and torsion case are respectively presented in fig 24 and fig 25 in which both experimental and numerical results are included it can be observed from the load displacement response curves shown in figs 24 a and fig 25 a that the differences of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results are only 8 5 and 3 8 for hogging and torsion case respectively and the difference of the elastic limit strength between experimental and numerical results are even much smaller according to wang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 there are two main reasons for the differences of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results on the one hand when external loads approach or even reach the ultimate strength of the hull girder the resultant deformations of the hull girder will be too large to be accurately detected causing the difficulty of the accurate data collection on the other hand the inevitable manufacturing defects such as geometrical imperfections and welding residual stresses in the test model can not be fully reflected in the numerical models which can affect the failure characteristics of corresponding local support members of the hull girder causing a discrepancy of the ultimate strength between experiment and numerical analysis for the torsion case shown in fig 25 a the discrepancy of the load displacement response curves at early stage of the loading process between experiment and numerical analysis is a result of the slip of jigs in the experiment which caused the failure of the detection of the loading point s displacement at early stage of the loading process it can also be observed from the collapse behaviors shown in figs 24 b and fig 25 b that the numerical models can well predict the collapse behaviors of the hull girder for both hogging and torsion case especially for the buckling behaviors involved in the collapse process of the hull girder therefore it can be considered that the numerical models employed in this research could well predict both ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girders 5 conclusions in this paper the scaling characteristics of hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors are numerically investigated with both true ship hull girders and simplified ship hull girders under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness having made a numerical assessment of the existing scaling law which is derived based on the dimension analysis and proposed an empirically modified scaling criterion to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship based on the analysis of this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 there exist significant errors in the existing scaling law which is derived based on the dimension analysis for quantifying the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship especially for the scale models which are designed with two very different scales of geometric length l and plate thickness t 2 the proposed scaling criterion in this paper can be employed to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scale models and true ship when scale models are designed to represent true ship in scale model collapse experiment which is defined as follows 13 m b u m b u 1 c l 1 855 c t 1 226 for sagging case m b u m b u 1 c l 1 823 c t 1 237 for hogging case m t u m t u 1 c l 1 894 c t 1 192 for torsion case 3 there exist three different collapse behaviors of the hull girder for sagging case hogging case and torsion case under different scale combinations of geometric length l and plate thickness t the scale models which are designed with an unequal scale of geometric length and plate thickness can not represent the collapse behaviors of the true ship due to the dissimilarity of the buckling behaviors of the local components of the hull girder 4 it has been demonstrated that the proposed scaling criterion developed with true ship hull girders is very suitable for the scaling relations of simplified ship hull girders by which the reliability and applicability of the proposed scaling criterion can be verified credit authorship contribution statement qinghu wang formal analysis data curation writing original

21699,a steady state actuator force model using the rans equations is developed to calculate the power production and the flow through arrays of tidal or river darrieus turbines it uses detailed three dimensional force distributions depending on the position on the turbine obtained beforehand by a set of blade resolved urans simulations of the turbine new power coefficient and force coefficient laws depending on the local velocity instead of the upstream velocity are established and appear to be independent from the local turbine blockage in an array those laws are used to construct a model that adapt the actuator force distributions to the local velocity of the flow reaching each turbine in order to simulate each turbine functioning close to its maximum efficiency point the model is validated against experimental measurements on a reduced scale darrieus turbine a fence farm configuration and a two row farm configuration are investigated and compared to results of the same model adapted in two dimensions the local blockage effect is more favorable for fences than for staggered turbine configurations increasing the local velocity and the power production for each turbine keywords tidal turbine array turbine wake actuator vertical axis turbine darrieus turbine 1 introduction tidal energy is currently undergoing fast progress and the first deployment projects of several machines are planned at different places in the world in the future simplified models will be needed for choosing the location of several tens of turbines in an array and studying their influence on the hydrodynamic currents in the vast oceanic areas impacted the wake interaction between turbines must be considered with the influence of the velocity deficit and turbulence created by the upstream turbines in an array the influence of the upstream turbulence intensity was clearly shown by mycek et al 2014 for horizontal axis tidal turbines they measured experimentally that the wake of a turbine placed in a zone of high turbulence 15 turbulence intensity recovered much faster than for low turbulence 3 turbulence intensity our study focuses on vertical axis water turbines which have the main advantage of being insensitive to the direction of the upstream flow they are also less sensitive to the upstream turbulence level as 1 showed comparing the cfd results of various turbine models a large eddy simulation les conducted by guillaud et al 2016 showed in details the different vortices created in all parts of a darrieus vertical axis turbine including the arm shaft connections and the blade tips those vortices lead to a big reduction of the turbine efficiency this simulation model is the more accurate to describe the turbine behavior yet it requires huge computational resources which is prohibitive for array optimization different approaches have been used to reduce the computational costs for axial turbines analytical methods based on the betz joukowsky law the actuator disk method have been improved to take into account the confinement of stream turbines due to the presence of the bathymetry free surface and the other adjacent turbines garrett and cummins 2007 whelan et al 2009 the models were extended to an array of tidal stream turbines by vennell 2013 or 4 simplified cfd models seem promising at the oceanic scale large domains and long duration are computed thanks to 2d models in order to simulate properly the effects of the tides at a potential site all along the year two different approaches exist to compute the effect of a tidal turbine it can be modeled by a friction force on the bottom kramer and piggott 2016 or by adding a force source term in the momentum equations thiébot et al 2016 both methods representing the action of the turbine on the mean flow in the vertical water column with significantly the same results three dimensional simulations might be useful to take into account the 3d characteristic of the flow and the bathymetry more precisely as in nguyen et al 2019 or 25 wimshurst and willden 2016 showed using an actuator disk ad approach that a turbine at a location where water depth is diminishing in the current direction produces less power than the same turbine at a location with increasing water depth this is due to modifications in the boundary layer as turbines are often placed at elevations that are still impacted by the velocity reduction in the bed boundary layer to improve ad models the blade element method embedded in a rans solver rans be can be used for the different types of turbines to calculate the forces to impose in the so called actuator line models a force distribution depending on the position on the turbine and depending on time is used instead of the uniform force distribution of ad models such simulations were done for axial turbines using the rans approach for modeling turbulence edmunds et al 2017 with a good accuracy the method to obtain the force distribution seems crucial especially for darrieus turbines where the stall phenomenon occurs in their actuator line method 13 23 and 7 calculated the force distribution on darrieus turbine blades with a semi empirical dynamic stall model they used the les turbulence model and were able to calculate the wake of one turbine with a great accuracy in array configurations the flow reaching each turbine is modified due to the local blockage defined as the fraction of the channel section occupied by the turbines the behavior of the turbine for those different flow conditions will determine the distribution forces that have to be imposed the turbine regulation is important and will act on the operating point used equipping the turbines with variable speed technology seems the most promising issue and allows the use of a maximum power point tracking mppt system in order to always take advantage of the best efficiency point of the turbine the local velocity that is striking each turbine of an array must be used to calculate the best efficiency point for this flow configuration for axial turbines 19 used the rans k ϵ model to obtain the velocity in each cell of their actuator disk volume the turbine forces are deduced using the drag coefficient value corresponding to the best efficiency point of the turbine an elaborate actuator cylinder method based on the rans k ω sst model was developed by shives et al 2017 for cross flow turbines the drag coefficient and power coefficient values were also depending on the upstream reynolds number and turbulence intensity in order to be accurate for different flow conditions satisfactory velocity deficits are achieved in the wake thanks to the sst eddy viscosity limiter that prevents a too fast velocity recovery a few array layout behaviors have been investigated in the literature a power production law for turbines side by side in a channel the fence configuration was proposed by garrett and cummins 2007 they found out that turbines in a fence benefit from local blockage effects if they are working at their optimal operating point vogel and willden 2017 2019 used a bem model with the forces and power production adapting to several tested advance parameters they found out a maximal power production increase of 26 for a fence of eight machines compared to the power production of the same isolated machines in free stream conditions with a mean power coefficient cp 0 608 instead of 0 484 dominguez et al 2016 considered 2d fences of ducted cross flow water turbines a power increase factor equal to 2 6 was found for a fence containing 15 turbines with a lateral spacing of 1 turbine width and a blockage ratio of 0 4 more recently an experimental study mcnaughton et al 2019 showed that two side by side axial turbines witness a power production increase if they are placed close to each other and operate at their new optimal advance parameter concerning staggered configurations the urans farm simulation realized by nuernberg and tao 2018 showed a small increase of the production of turbines placed closely downstream and on the side of a first one with a maximum 11 power increase 21 did experimental measurements for different configurations of cross flow turbine arrays and also found power increases when adapting the turbine advance parameters the present study aims at developing a 3d steady state method for turbine array modelings that does not need aerodynamic foil coefficients nor empirical data for taking into account the rotating blades and the possible stall phenomenons moreover the proposed method allows one to calculate the turbine power production with a good accuracy and different farm configurations are tested the turbine used is a three bladed n 3 reduced scale darrieus turbine that had already been experimented by maître et al 2013 its characteristics are presented in fig 1 it has a diameter d 175 mm and a height h 175 mm the blades are naca0018 profiles with a camber following a rotating circle of diameter 175 mm its chord value is c 32 mm leading to a solidity 2nc d 1 1 the upstream flow direction is represented by the vector u and the rotational speed ω is controlled the turbine advance parameter is defined in a classical way as λ ω d 2 u the origin of all coordinates in this work is the intersection of the rotation axis and the mid height plane of the turbine the x axis is along the inlet flow direction z is the vertical axis and y the transverse axis the force distributions used are obtained from a few unsteady rans rotor stator simulations of the turbine done for different upstream flow conditions an interpolation from those force distributions is performed for intermediate cases the model developed adapts the force values to the upstream flow velocity with an equation linking those forces to the local velocity calculated for each turbine therefore simulations of any configuration of turbine array can be easily performed without having to tune any parameter the method can be extended to axial turbine or others in any case the mesh used is cartesian which will be an advantage in the future to calculate the influence of the masts or external parts of the turbine not represented in this study those parts could be modeled by adding the corresponding drag force in the affected cells or by the use of ibm methods that prove to be efficient on cartesian meshes constant et al 2017 2 methodology 2 1 preliminary urans simulations the force distributions imposed in the adaptive model are results obtained beforehand from unsteady blade resolved simulations of the darrieus turbine these simulations are done with the open source software openfoam4 1 a rans turbulence closure model is used with the k omega shear stress transport linear eddy viscosity equations menter 1994 menter et al 2003 this model has two equations on k and ω and allows to capture correctly the flow separation it has been widely used to calculate the performances and loads of cross flow turbines maître et al 2013 used this turbulence model and did a mesh sensitivity analysis for a 2d simulation of a darrieus turbine to capture the boundary layer flow near the turbine they found out that the maximum dimensionless wall distance y has to be lower than 5 with good results obtained for values always lower than 2 and the mean y value has to be less than 1 kramer et al 2015 showed that a 3d urans simulation with a mean y value less than 1 is able to reproduce correctly the geometry effects like the arm blade connections in our simulations the wall refinement used has a cell height of 1 0 1 0 5 m near the wall and is extended within 15 layers with a growth rate of 1 17 after convergence a maximum y value of 2 4 and a mean value always lower than 0 2 are obtained for the different positions during one turbine revolution and for all the simulated advance parameters the inlet conditions are a flow velocity of 2 3m s a turbulence intensity of 2 5 and a value ω 1 s 1 which is low and creates no turbulence decay along the domain wall laws are used as lateral top and bottom boundary conditions the outlet conditions are a constant pressure condition and a zero gradient velocity condition the dimensions of the simulation domain are 0 60 m wide 0 55 m high and 2 5 m long in the direction of the flow 0 5 m upstream and 2 m downstream of the turbine a view of this domain is presented in fig 2 to reduce the number of cells a symmetry is used on the median plane z 0 therefore only the upper half of the domain in fig 2 is simulated the turbine rotation is taken into account using a dynamic mesh interface between the tunnel domain and a cylinder containing the turbine these specifics lead to a full mesh composed of about 14 million cells with 9 million cells in the rotor domain the turbine shaft and its support structures are not modeled the pimpledymfoam solver is used to get accurate results in acceptable time it is a large time step transient solver for incompressible turbulent flow using the pimple merged piso simple algorithm it is able to take into account dynamic meshes the numerical schemes used are second order backward for the time and second order for pressure velocity k and omega gauss linear with a limiter for k and omega classical time step values are used depending on the advance parameter λ simulated for the turbine at λ 2 which is larger or close to the optimal advance parameter in the present study the time step is chosen to correspond to a rotation of the turbine of 1 degree this value was recommended by maître et al 2013 a smaller time step corresponding to 0 5 degree of rotation is chosen for lower λ values a maximum of 30 subiterations is chosen for each time step results are obtained only once the two following criteria are met at least 12 revolutions of the turbine have been completed and the flow is converged in the wake doing only 6 revolutions has led to differences with the final force and power values less than 1 using a coarser mesh containing 6 million cells with the same near wall grid has also led to differences of the same order of magnitude the urans simulation results are compared to experiments using the same reduced scale darrieus turbine new experiments were conducted in the cerg hydrodynamic tunnel th2 in grenoble whose test section is approximately 2 m long with a constant rectangular shape that is 60 cm wide by 55 cm high three different flow velocities are used in the test section 1 8 m s 2 3 m s and 2 8 m s the turbine is not centered and is shifted 5 cm towards negative y values but simulations showed that this has no influence since the walls are far enough away from the turbine a turbulence grid is located 1 m upstream of the turbine and creates homogeneous isotropic turbulence it has rectangular bars of thickness 1 cm regularly spaced each 5 cm in the two transverse directions the turbulence intensity has been measured beforehand without turbine along the tunnel and an extrapolation at the turbine location where the absence of window is hindering measurements gives the turbulence intensity value of 5 5 this value is different from the urans inlet turbulence intensity value but no significant effect is expected because the flow through vertical axis turbines has a low sensitivity to turbulence three different flow velocities have been tested the instrumentation of the turbine is detailed in the work of maître et al 2013 the power production of the turbine is measured via the electrical torque and the corresponding power coefficient cp is deduced cp is equal to the turbine kinetic power p divided by the maximum extractable power from a free stream flow of velocity u considering the projected section s of the turbine 1 c p p 1 2 ρ s u 3 in this equation ρ is the density of the water chosen to 1000 kg m 3 the cp curves for each flow velocity are compared to the numerical cp values obtained with the urans blade resolved simulation of the turbine in fig 3 all experimental curves are close which means that there are few reynolds effects for those tunnel velocities the urans curve is in good agreement with the experimental ones with the highest error for λ 2 forces along the streamwise x and lateral y directions are measured via piezoelectric sensors and the corresponding dimensionless force coefficients cx and cy are deduced in order to compare them with the results of the urans blade resolved simulation that was done without the turbine shaft the drag created by this part is estimated using the drag coefficient curve of an infinite fixed cylinder of the same diameter the value of 12 3 n is calculated and is added to the total simulated drag the comparison of the experimental and simulation results is presented in fig 4 the cx results are very close but there are discrepancies in term of cy values with high relative errors since the turbine transverse force values are small however the urans simulation is validated against the experiments and its results are used to construct the simplified model as explained in the following section 2 2 a force conservative simplified model in our simplified model a classical representation of the turbine is used force source terms are added in the momentum equations for each cell of the domain swept by the turbine the method used to obtain a time averaged force field from the urans simulation results consists of two steps the first step is to project the forces on a new cylindrical mesh which geometry is adapted to represent the darrieus force distribution it is more suitable than using a cartesian mesh that might lead to a loss of information if the mesh is too rough or to discontinuities if the cell sizes are too close to the urans cell dimensions the cylindrical mesh used is presented in fig 5 its cells are the basic volume elements of a fixed cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z which does not rotate with the turbine the decomposition is done here for the half of the turbine simulated and will be extended later by symmetry to the whole turbine the zone where blade forces are present is decomposed into one cell in the radial direction r 10 cells in the z direction and 72 cells along the 360 of θ d θ 5 the arm forces are extracted in a domain that contains 10 cells in the radial direction and 1 cell in z direction with d θ 5 when the simulation is converged during one turbine revolution both arm and blade forces are extracted for each cell of this cylindrical mesh for each time step equivalent to 1 or 0 5 of rotation this referential being fixed at each time step cells of the cylindrical mesh intersect either a part of the blades or arms in this case the corresponding forces are extracted or only a fluid part no forces are extracted at last a time averaging of those force distributions during the whole turbine revolution is performed for each cell to obtain a steady state spatial distribution of the forces the second step is a projection of those forces on a new cartesian mesh of which the cell size can be adapted to have a proper representation of the turbine this projection step has been chosen for its simplicity to model whatever number of turbines in an array without having to take care of the turbine positions to construct the mesh forces from the cylindrical steady state force distribution are projected in the simplified model mesh the cell forces imposed in the simplified mesh are obtained from a weighting of the forces of all the neighbor cells of the cylindrical mesh whose center is comprised within a distance lower than a constant distance of the code named d i s t a c t i o n this is illustrated in fig 6 for a two dimension mesh in the following equations the index i is taken for numbering the cells of the simplified mesh noted m e s h s i m p and the index j for cells of the cylindrical mesh noted m e s h c y l γ i j is a linear function of the distance d i s t i j between the cells i and j and is defined as 2 γ i j d i s t a c t i o n d i s t i j i f d i s t i j d i s t a c t i o n 3 γ i j 0 i f d i s t i j d i s t a c t i o n in order to have the conservation of the total forces applied in the mesh a factor has to be used to calculate the part of the force on a cell i due to the influence of the cell j it is the function β i j calculated as 4 β i j γ i j k m e s h s i m p γ k j the total force vector f i applied on the cell i of the simplified mesh is defined as a function of the cylindrical mesh cell forces f j as 5 f i j m e s h c y l f j β i j j m e s h c y l f j γ i j k m e s h s i m p γ k j it can be easily seen that the addition of the forces f i for all cells of the simplified mesh is equal to the total force applied on the cylindrical mesh another advantage of this method is that a smoothing is automatically done close to the borders of the turbine area indeed even if cells are not comprised in the turbine swept volume they witness a force contribution from cells comprised in a distance d i s t a c t i o n the factor d i s t a c t i o n is therefore a smoothing factor of our simulations that has to be chosen carefully the force distribution obtained after projection for λ 2 is presented in fig 7 in the horizontal plane z 2 cm z r 0 23 under the turbine arms and the vertical plane y 0 a grid sensitivity study has been done it is linked to the smoothing parameter d i s t a c t i o n presented before and both the cell size dx and this parameter have been tested in order to be sure to have at least one cell in the radius direction for modeling the blades the parameter d i s t a c t i o n cannot be lower than dx the velocity deficits at 2 diameters 2d and 8 diameters 8d downstream of the turbine are plotted versus y at the altitude z 2 cm for different values of the tested parameters they are presented in fig 8 we observe that the curves are converging towards the curve with dx 0 005 m the case with dx 0 01 m and d i s t a c t i o n 0 02 m gives the same velocity profiles and it will be used in the simulations it gives better results than using d i s t a c t i o n 0 01 m because in this last case the arms are badly represented with only one cell in the z direction and no vertical forces imposed and the near wake is slightly impacted the chosen parameters dx 0 01 m and d i s t a c t i o n 0 02 m lead to a small over estimation of the turbine drag and power of respectively 2 4 and 3 6 compared to the converged values 2 3 research of a maximum efficiency operating point independent of the confinement a classical representation of the turbine performances is the power coefficient versus λ curve already presented in fig 3 this curve presents a maximum of efficiency for λ close to 2 and can be used to calculate the turbine power production in free stream conditions knowing the upstream flow velocity u with a turbine placed in a restricted section for example in a natural channel or between other turbines in an array the flow just upstream of the turbine is generally accelerated compared to an isolated configuration this effect is due to the straightening of the streamlines upstream the turbine it induces an increase of the turbine extractable power as a consequence the power production cannot be calculated with the performance coefficient of eq 1 anymore the confinement number is usually defined as s s c h a n n e l with s c h a n n e l the cross section of the channel simulated in the present simulations the domain height is kept constant and the confinement is changed in the horizontal direction to correspond to turbines close to each other always located at the same water depth a lateral confinement is defined as ϵ d b with d the turbine diameter and b the horizontal dimension of the channel chosen for each simulation three different confinement geometries are simulated with the urans model ϵ 0 29 ϵ 0 44 and ϵ 0 58 different advance parameters are used to draw the power coefficient curves for each simulation a mean local velocity u l o c a l is calculated to obtain a new local advance parameter λ defined as 6 λ ω d 2 u l o c a l the local velocity is calculated as the mean streamwise velocity value in all cells of the cylinder swept by the vertical axis turbine that is time averaged over one turbine revolution the local power coefficient cp is defined using the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity as 7 c p p 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 3 the local force coefficients for each components of forces the local thrust coefficient cx and the equivalent coefficients in the 2 other directions cy and cz are defined in the same way using the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity and depending on the three components of the total forces applied on the turbine f x y z 8 c x y z f x y z 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 2 the cp versus λ curves are presented for each confinement in fig 9 a and compared to the corresponding c p versus λ curves in fig 9 b the labels added on this last plot correspond to the respective λ values used for each calculation point the cp versus λ curves are different for each confinement and the maximum efficiency values are increasing as the confinement is increasing the maximum of efficiency is also slightly shifted towards larger λ values as the confinement is raised however the cp versus λ curves are all superimposed a 4th order polynomial fitting curve has been drawn using the method of least squares with all the cp calculated points all points are very close to the fitting curve in regard to the simulation uncertainties a justification is proposed for the existence of this unique curve the turbine performances are increased if the velocity triangles on its blades are favorable it means that the angle of attack on the blades has to be optimized this angle depends on the relative velocity and the λ parameter is a good spatial average representation of this velocity for the whole turbine volume therefore a same λ parameter leads approximately to the same power coefficient the classical and local force coefficients on the x and y axes are drawn in figs 10 and 11 the force values in the z direction are not presented 4th order polynomial fitting curves have been plotted using all the simulated cx and cy points the dimensionless local force coefficients are also independent from the confinement in figs 10 b and 11 b finally time averaged force values at several turbine locations have been monitored in the cylindrical mesh the chosen locations are shown in fig 5 the positions 1 and 2 are located in the zone of strong radial and tangential forces at the angle θ 207 5 position 1 is at the turbine center altitude z 0 and position 2 is located at z r 0 46 where there is no influence of the arms position 3 is located at z r 0 46 at the most upstream position of the turbine θ close to 180 the cell forces for those monitored cells are also made dimensionless using the local velocity to get the coefficients c x y z c e l l the values c x c e l l and c y c e l l are plotted versus λ for the three different confinement configurations in fig 12 only three λ values have been simulated the piecewise linear curves are drawn with the three points obtained for the confinement case ϵ 0 29 for each position the points obtained for the other confinement cases are located on these curves even if small discrepancies occur the monitoring on all the other cells gives the same order of accuracy excepted the calculation uncertainties a source of discrepancies can be the fact that the mean local velocity over the whole darrieus turbine is used and forces can be locally slightly different for some confinement cases if the flow velocity and angle of attack are locally modified for example by the presence of nearby channel walls however it is shown that those dimensionless force coefficients obtained for each cell of the cylindrical mesh are also independent from the confinement they will be used later in the adaptive model without any additional confinement correction each cp versus λ curve in fig 9 a has a different point of maximum efficiency those points are found using the different polynomial fitting curves for each confinement the order of the fitting polynomial is the number of simulated points minus one the corresponding cp and λ are calculated and presented in table 1 it appears that the cp and λ values found are close to each others taking the average of those points is a good approximation of a maximum efficiency operating point independent from confinement the maximum differences in terms of λ and cp between two points are noted respectively δ λ and δ c p the uncertainty analysis for the maximum power output p m a x is done as following 9 p m a x 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 3 c p ρ s ω d 2 3 c p 2 λ 3 10 δ p m a x p m a x 3 δ λ λ δ c p c p by using values found in table 1 the relative error δ c p c p is lower than 2 7 and the relative error δ λ λ lower than 3 which gives a total error on the maximum power production always lower than 11 7 therefore using λ 3 6 and cp 1 98 is a good approximation for imposing the best efficiency operating point in the simulations for any possible flow configuration 2 4 the adaptive model implementation in real operating cases the turbine performances and the forces applied on the turbine depend on the configuration of the flow through the turbine the aim here is to develop an adaptive model that calculates automatically the forces and performances depending on this flow using the λ parameter the calculation loop steps for the so called adaptive model are summarized in fig 13 dimensionless urans force distributions the c x c e l l and c y c e l l distributions from fig 12 and the corresponding c z c e l l have been extracted on the cylindrical mesh for three λ values 1 4 4 25 and 9 7 a linear interpolation is done for each cell if the chosen λ is located in between those values the force coefficients are then multiplied by the term 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 2 to get the force distributions that will be projected on the cartesian mesh according to the previous paragraph those forces are added in the navier stokes equations then the flow and the new local velocity are calculated for the current iteration after convergence the final u l o c a l value is calculated and the c p versus λ curve of fig 9 b is used to calculate the corresponding power production of the turbine the adaptive model is tested for different configurations for the cerg test case in next section and for array calculations in section 4 the cerg test case simulation is performed as a model validation the adaptive model in which the force distribution is an unknown is compared with the force conservation model using the forces given by the urans calculations moreover a 2d version of these two models removing the z direction has been implemented to measure the effect of the 2d assumption on the results the same software and setup are used and the same cell size dx dy 0 01 m in the central zone the only differences are the domain size which is modified to keep the same turbine confinement and the force distribution which is adapted in 2d the confinement in 3d is d h b h 0 0928 in 2d the value b 188 6 cm is chosen to have the same confinement value d b 0 0928 the z component of force vanishes in 2d because the turbine height is set equal to 1 m the x and y components f x y 2 d are calculated for each r θ position in the cylindrical mesh as the sum of the 3d cell forces f x y 3 d along z with cell altitude indices z k ranging from z k m i n to z k m a x divided by the height of the turbine h 11 f x y 2 d r θ z k z k m i n z k m a x f x y 3 d r θ z k h in the case of array calculations the low array confinement is enough to have no influence on the results anymore therefore the same x and y domain lengths are used both in the 2d and 3d models 3 simulation results for a single machine 3 1 the test case setup to check the validity of the simulation results piv measurements have been realized on the experimental hydrodynamic tunnel downstream of the turbine in several horizontal planes of different altitudes the reference plane is located at the altitude z 1 cm then 5 planes are located above it and 5 planes below it each of the consecutive planes are separated by a 4 cm increment in the z direction vertical profiles of the axial velocity are reconstructed at several x positions downstream of the axis of the turbine with the values obtained on the horizontal planes the experimental values present a shift of approximately 3 cm towards the top of the tunnel compared to the simulations it has been observed that the peculiar geometry of the flume with an upstream half convergent section placed only in the lower part of the tunnel creates a z component of velocity close to 0 05 m s this deviates progressively the wake of the turbine towards the top hence all measurement points altitudes are shifted of 3 cm when compared to the numerical results the reference plane will therefore be described as the plane of altitude z 2 cm when compared to numerical results the simulation domain is the domain already presented in fig 2 that corresponds to the experimental setup the k omega shear stress transport turbulence model is used the uniform inlet velocity of 2 3 m s is chosen and the turbulence inlet values are chosen to k 0 0711 m 2 s 2 and ω 90 s 1 in order to have the turbulence intensity value of 5 5 and the correct turbulence decay at the turbine location 3 2 wake results the advance parameter λ 2 is first simulated with all models it is slightly different from the point of maximum efficiency presented in table 1 the corresponding forces calculated via the urans simulation are imposed for the force conservation model and λ 4 25 is now imposed in the adaptive model that was the local advance parameter calculated in the urans simulation at λ 2 the wakes obtained are compared to the experimental one the transverse velocity profiles are plotted in fig 14 in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm z r 0 23 at several positions downstream of the turbine at the distances 2d 3d downstream of the turbine axis the available vertical velocity profiles are plotted at the same positions downstream of the turbine in fig 15 at the lateral position y 0 cm we observe that both 3d models give sensibly the same results even if the forces imposed are slightly different the turbine drags are respectively equal to 80 2n and 84 3n for the force constant and the adaptive cases though the experimental drag without the axis drag is equal to 79 9n the velocity in the wake is indeed little sensitive to the imposed force values regarding the vertical profiles results are more accurate in the lower part where the shaft of the turbine is not present in the experiments than in the upper part where the shaft is present in the experiments but not in the simulations in both figures the 3d simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments in the far wake at distances larger or equal to 4d or 6d there are discrepancies in the near wake that are common with the use of actuator force models the eddies generated by the turbine blades are not calculated with those models but may influence the velocity field in the near wake therefore we cannot expect to have accurate predictions in the near wake but the model is validated for modeling turbine arrays with distances higher than 4d between consecutive turbines the turbulent kinetic energy k profiles are also plotted at the same positions in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm in fig 16 the differences found between the two models are insufficient to act on the velocity profiles the turbulent kinetic energy is over estimated in both simplified models compared to the experiments it causes the wake to decay fast enough which was not the case for axial turbine in classical actuator disk models for which authors tried to add extra turbulence source terms at the disk position nguyen et al 2016 our vertical axis actuator force model creates this extra turbulent kinetic energy by itself which makes the velocity recover fast enough in the wake regarding the horizontal profiles obtained with the 2d simulations the velocity deficit does not decrease fast enough and there are big discrepancies in the far wake in the turbulence theory pope 2000 the velocity deficit decay of an axisymmetric wake as a function of the position x is following the function x 2 3 in 3d whereas it is following the function x 1 2 in 2d that decreases slower this is due to geometrical aspects as the wake limits where the mixing occurs are an area circling the wake in 3d and only two lines in both sides of the wake in 2d therefore 2d models are not expected to give correct results for the wake prediction without adding any extra correcting force or turbulence source term however 2d models require much smaller calculation efforts to quantify the discrepancies that can be introduced by these models the 2d version of the developed model has been compared to the 3d one in terms of power production and velocity deficits in the next sections 3 3 power production results the force conservation model results are presented for the cases λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 as well as the corresponding adaptive model results for λ 1 4 λ 4 25 and λ 9 7 the table 2 summarizes the experimental urans and the two aforementioned models results with the calculated local velocity λ λ c p power p and relative error on power er p the urans simulation is taken as reference because its force values are used rather than the experimental ones in the two actuator force models for the case λ 2 close to the optimal advance parameter both 2d models present high power production discrepancies and are not accurate for calculating this value in 3d as well as in 2d results are more accurate for the adaptive model the local velocity calculated is closer to the urans calculated one the power production is hence better calculated with errors of 3 5 14 3 in 2d for the adaptive model and 21 5 56 4 in 2d for the force conservation model the larger error value obtained with the force conservation model is due to an overestimation of the local velocity leading to an overestimation of the power using eq 7 the force conservation approach is the classical approach and implies a conservation of the total forces but this approach might not be the best to model the flow through the turbine and its wake another approach would be to enforce the flow rate through the turbine which might create a more accurate wake in the simulation the adaptive model is a compromise between those two approaches in this model neither the force values nor the local velocity u l o c a l are conserved but the λ value is imposed it gives a relation linking the local velocity and the forces imposed that leads to a compromise between the conservation of those two values for the lower advance parameter λ 1 corresponding to the case of a high stream velocity or a low turbine rotation speed the power production is correctly estimated with both 3d models because the local velocity is always correctly predicted for the higher advance parameter λ 3 that corresponds to a high turbine rotation speed or a low stream velocity results are less accurate but this case is extreme with even a negative turbine power production that is small in magnitude as a result small discrepancies on the local velocity lead to high relative errors on the power however the adaptive model produces less than 9 error on the power production and this model is suitable to estimate the power production for a wide range of advance parameters between 1 and 3 4 tidal turbine array calculations 4 1 the different configuration setups the aforementioned adaptive model is used in this section to compute several configurations of turbine arrays the 2d and 3d models are considered the lateral spacing distance between two consecutive turbine centers in a row is first tested in a fence configuration with 8 turbines side by side a configuration of two rows of turbine with staggered positions 8 turbines in the first row and 7 turbines in the second row is also studied with different lateral spacing and distances between the two rows denoted axial spacing the same turbine reduced scaled model of height 17 5 cm is kept for all cases a same mesh refined in the central zone around the turbines is used it is presented in fig 17 the constant cell height dz 1 cm is used in the whole domain cubic cells of size dx dy dz 1 cm are used in the central zone the domain height is 55 cm and the turbines are located at mid height to remain close to real oceanic configurations where turbines are expected to occupy approximately the central third of the water column height the central zone extends up to 18d in both y directions and 3d upstream and 25d downstream of the first turbine row in the x direction the distance l 7d is introduced as the distance between the two extreme turbine centers of a 8 turbine fence if no space is left between two adjacent turbines an inflation of maximum growth rate 1 2 is used in the x and y directions along an upstream distance of 5 l a downstream distance of 20 l and a lateral distance of 6 6 l with this mesh the boundary conditions are far away and are not influencing the calculations anymore the total mesh size is about 26 million cells symmetry conditions are used in the two lateral the upper and the lower domain boundaries the inlet velocity of 2 253 m s in the x direction is chosen the inlet turbulence intensity is set to 2 5 with a value ω 1 s 1 that ensures almost no turbulence decay all along the farm the same outlet conditions as for the single machine simulations are used a number of iterations of 20000 is required to obtain a convergence in terms of local velocity and power production it leads to calculation times of about 4600 core hours on nodes intel sandy bridge ep e5 2670 8c 2 6 ghz 20m 8 gt s with 4 gb ram core which is an acceptable time lower than for a single rotor urans simulation moreover the domain length influence and the cell refinement in the array wake more than 1 l downstream of the array have not been tested and it is more than likely that the cell number could be drastically reduced without significant differences in the results the simulations are realized with the values λ 3 6 and cp 1 98 in order to stay close to the optimum of power production as explained in the former sections all the tested farm cases are summarized in table 3 4 2 fence configuration results the velocity colormap and the streamlines in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm are presented in fig 18 for the fence configuration with the lateral spacing of 1 2d both 2d model results in the right and 3d model results in the left are presented for this spacing the wakes of all turbines are joining to form a unique wake that continues until a distance of several l downstream of the fence a slight global deviation of the wake towards negative y values occurs the velocity deficit is highly overestimated in the far wake for the 2d model it is in agreement with the behavior of this model that overestimates the velocity deficit for a single turbine wake as already shown in fig 14 results in term of power production are analyzed hereafter the dimensionless farm power dfp is defined to compare the total power production to the maximal one produced by the same number n of isolated turbines with the same inlet velocity as 12 d f p i 0 n p i n 1 2 ρ s c p m a x u 3 c p m a x 0 273 is the maximal power coefficient value obtained from the urans simulations for the less confined case in table 1 that is close to the non confined case the results for the different lateral spacing are presented in fig 21 the results for the same simulations using the 2d model are also shown in the fence the closer the turbines are to each other the higher the extracted power is the same behavior is observed both in 2d and 3d the 2d model overestimates the local blockage effect because the stream cannot flow above or under the turbines when the lateral spacing is lower than 3d a 10 to 24 power increase is obtained compared to turbines in free stream conditions this is coherent with results presented by mcnaughton et al 2019 that found out a power increase of 20 for an experimental fence of two axial tidal turbines the local blockage effect in our study is higher due to the higher number of turbines and certainly increases again the power production vogel and willden 2019 found out a maximum power increase of 16 for their 8 turbine fence simulated with a bem method adapting to the flow conditions the trend is respected in our simulations however this extra power extracted from the fluid creates a stronger velocity deficit in the wake that might decrease the production of a potential second turbine row that would be added therefore a two row staggered configuration is studied in the following section 4 3 staggered configuration results the staggered configuration wakes are presented in fig 19 for the lateral spacing of 1 5d and the axial spacing of 15d and in fig 20 for the lateral spacing of 4d and the axial spacing of 15d both 3d model results case a and 2d model results case b are presented in the first configuration the velocity deficit in the wake of the first line is far higher than in the second case where the low local blockage allows the flow in between the turbines the flow reaching the second row has a decreased velocity and a lower power production is expected the global farm wake recovers also slower than for the higher lateral spacing case in fig 19 the velocity deficit just upstream of the second row is far higher for the 2d model the power production of the second row calculated with this model is expected to be small compared to the 3d model one in fig 20 b the wakes of the first row turbines extend in between the second row turbines for the central turbines but the first row wakes are partially impacting the 4 turbines of the second row located the most at the outsides therefore their power production are decreased the power production results of the staggered configurations are presented in fig 22 the 3d model results are first analyzed the solution maximizing the power production is to put all turbines on the same line the staggered case with the axial spacing of 0d and lateral spacing of 4d is then equivalent to a 15 turbine fence with a lateral spacing of 2d it is also noticed from figs 21 and 22 that in this case the dfp is 1 18 higher than the one obtained in the fence of 8 turbines with 2d lateral spacing dfp 1 14 adding turbines in a row increases the local blockage effect and the dfp in the staggered cases the lateral spacing of 1 5d hinders the flow to pass through the first row and the flow reaching the second row witnesses a big velocity deficit as a result the power production of the second row is highly decreased and the dimensionless farm power is impacted with values lower than 1 consequences are less grave if the second row is far enough from the first one with a dimensionless farm power higher than one for the distance 15d for the lateral spacing of 4d the flow is reaching the second row without any velocity deficit and the second row witnesses even a slight local velocity increase the farm power increase is close to 10 for all axial spacing of the second row between 5d and 15d the staggered configuration benefits less from the local blockage effects than the fence configuration with the same number of turbines placed close to each other for more rows in a staggered disposition the power harnessed is also expected to decrease if rows are too close with better results if a bigger lateral spacing is kept between all turbines keeping a lateral distance sufficient enough for the stream to flow besides the first row turbines and an axial spacing of 15d between two consecutive rows seems enough to have a global farm wake recovery and to enable one to put extra turbine rows without huge power decrease regarding the 2d model the same behavior is observed but there are big discrepancies on the calculated dfp values with the lateral spacing of 1 5d the second row power production is always highly reduced because the velocity deficit created by the first row is overestimated with the 2d model the dfp calculated are lower than 0 8 for all those cases the axial spacing of 15d is not enough to have a velocity deficit recover in 2d contrary to the 3d model for the lateral spacing of 4d the first row wakes are expanding in between the second row turbines when the two rows are close enough and the power production is not decreased compared to the 3d model it starts to decrease when the axial spacing is higher than 10d an explanation can be that some of the first row wakes are impacting the second row turbines and decreasing their power production as already presented before finally the 2d model is not accurate to compute the farm power production 5 conclusions different urans blade resolved simulations of a vertical axis darrieus turbine have been performed to feed a steady state 3d actuator force model the calculated turbine forces are time averaged over one turbine revolution to obtain a detailed spatial force distribution instead of the uniform force distribution of standard actuator disk models or their equivalent for vertical axis turbines this method replaces the classical bem approach to obtain the force distribution the urans computations have been performed for different turbine lateral confinements in order to draw several classical power coefficient and force coefficient curves when the coefficients are plotted as a function of the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity the curves become independent of the confinement those curves are used to construct an adaptive model independent of the turbine confinement or the local blockage effect it gives a good estimation of the power production of a single turbine with only 3 5 relative error at advance parameters close to the maximum efficiency point and less than 9 for extreme operating points the model is also calculating correctly the far wake flow at distances higher than 4d or 6d but presents discrepancies for the near wake velocity profiles an operating point close to the maximum efficiency point has been found for the simulated turbine for this point the turbine power production is calculated with an error always lower than 11 7 whatever the local blockage is it is used in several farm configurations and could be a starting point for future optimization simulations which could be performed with the model presented here that requires relatively low computational efforts amongst the tested farm configurations the fence configuration with the lowest inter turbine spacing gives the highest farm power production a maximum power increase of 24 is found for the 8 turbine fence with a lateral spacing of 1 2d staggered farm configurations benefit less from local blockage effects even if an optimization of the lateral and axial inter turbine spacing still has to be done a compromise has to be found between having closely spaced first row turbines harvesting a lot of power and still a sufficient power production in the next rows the same calculations have been performed using 2d models for the single turbine simulation the local velocity is calculated with large discrepancies that lead to large power production discrepancies 2d models might be sufficient to deduce general trends concerning the turbine positioning in an array but they prove to produce large errors to calculate the array power production finally the 3d model seems promising for calculating arrays of vertical axis water turbines a comparison to measurements in the case of wake interactions between several turbines still has to be done to confirm the model the whole methodology could also be applied to axial tidal turbines of any shape the model validity still has to be checked for those turbines for which the wake decay mechanisms are different credit authorship contribution statement v

21699,a steady state actuator force model using the rans equations is developed to calculate the power production and the flow through arrays of tidal or river darrieus turbines it uses detailed three dimensional force distributions depending on the position on the turbine obtained beforehand by a set of blade resolved urans simulations of the turbine new power coefficient and force coefficient laws depending on the local velocity instead of the upstream velocity are established and appear to be independent from the local turbine blockage in an array those laws are used to construct a model that adapt the actuator force distributions to the local velocity of the flow reaching each turbine in order to simulate each turbine functioning close to its maximum efficiency point the model is validated against experimental measurements on a reduced scale darrieus turbine a fence farm configuration and a two row farm configuration are investigated and compared to results of the same model adapted in two dimensions the local blockage effect is more favorable for fences than for staggered turbine configurations increasing the local velocity and the power production for each turbine keywords tidal turbine array turbine wake actuator vertical axis turbine darrieus turbine 1 introduction tidal energy is currently undergoing fast progress and the first deployment projects of several machines are planned at different places in the world in the future simplified models will be needed for choosing the location of several tens of turbines in an array and studying their influence on the hydrodynamic currents in the vast oceanic areas impacted the wake interaction between turbines must be considered with the influence of the velocity deficit and turbulence created by the upstream turbines in an array the influence of the upstream turbulence intensity was clearly shown by mycek et al 2014 for horizontal axis tidal turbines they measured experimentally that the wake of a turbine placed in a zone of high turbulence 15 turbulence intensity recovered much faster than for low turbulence 3 turbulence intensity our study focuses on vertical axis water turbines which have the main advantage of being insensitive to the direction of the upstream flow they are also less sensitive to the upstream turbulence level as 1 showed comparing the cfd results of various turbine models a large eddy simulation les conducted by guillaud et al 2016 showed in details the different vortices created in all parts of a darrieus vertical axis turbine including the arm shaft connections and the blade tips those vortices lead to a big reduction of the turbine efficiency this simulation model is the more accurate to describe the turbine behavior yet it requires huge computational resources which is prohibitive for array optimization different approaches have been used to reduce the computational costs for axial turbines analytical methods based on the betz joukowsky law the actuator disk method have been improved to take into account the confinement of stream turbines due to the presence of the bathymetry free surface and the other adjacent turbines garrett and cummins 2007 whelan et al 2009 the models were extended to an array of tidal stream turbines by vennell 2013 or 4 simplified cfd models seem promising at the oceanic scale large domains and long duration are computed thanks to 2d models in order to simulate properly the effects of the tides at a potential site all along the year two different approaches exist to compute the effect of a tidal turbine it can be modeled by a friction force on the bottom kramer and piggott 2016 or by adding a force source term in the momentum equations thiébot et al 2016 both methods representing the action of the turbine on the mean flow in the vertical water column with significantly the same results three dimensional simulations might be useful to take into account the 3d characteristic of the flow and the bathymetry more precisely as in nguyen et al 2019 or 25 wimshurst and willden 2016 showed using an actuator disk ad approach that a turbine at a location where water depth is diminishing in the current direction produces less power than the same turbine at a location with increasing water depth this is due to modifications in the boundary layer as turbines are often placed at elevations that are still impacted by the velocity reduction in the bed boundary layer to improve ad models the blade element method embedded in a rans solver rans be can be used for the different types of turbines to calculate the forces to impose in the so called actuator line models a force distribution depending on the position on the turbine and depending on time is used instead of the uniform force distribution of ad models such simulations were done for axial turbines using the rans approach for modeling turbulence edmunds et al 2017 with a good accuracy the method to obtain the force distribution seems crucial especially for darrieus turbines where the stall phenomenon occurs in their actuator line method 13 23 and 7 calculated the force distribution on darrieus turbine blades with a semi empirical dynamic stall model they used the les turbulence model and were able to calculate the wake of one turbine with a great accuracy in array configurations the flow reaching each turbine is modified due to the local blockage defined as the fraction of the channel section occupied by the turbines the behavior of the turbine for those different flow conditions will determine the distribution forces that have to be imposed the turbine regulation is important and will act on the operating point used equipping the turbines with variable speed technology seems the most promising issue and allows the use of a maximum power point tracking mppt system in order to always take advantage of the best efficiency point of the turbine the local velocity that is striking each turbine of an array must be used to calculate the best efficiency point for this flow configuration for axial turbines 19 used the rans k ϵ model to obtain the velocity in each cell of their actuator disk volume the turbine forces are deduced using the drag coefficient value corresponding to the best efficiency point of the turbine an elaborate actuator cylinder method based on the rans k ω sst model was developed by shives et al 2017 for cross flow turbines the drag coefficient and power coefficient values were also depending on the upstream reynolds number and turbulence intensity in order to be accurate for different flow conditions satisfactory velocity deficits are achieved in the wake thanks to the sst eddy viscosity limiter that prevents a too fast velocity recovery a few array layout behaviors have been investigated in the literature a power production law for turbines side by side in a channel the fence configuration was proposed by garrett and cummins 2007 they found out that turbines in a fence benefit from local blockage effects if they are working at their optimal operating point vogel and willden 2017 2019 used a bem model with the forces and power production adapting to several tested advance parameters they found out a maximal power production increase of 26 for a fence of eight machines compared to the power production of the same isolated machines in free stream conditions with a mean power coefficient cp 0 608 instead of 0 484 dominguez et al 2016 considered 2d fences of ducted cross flow water turbines a power increase factor equal to 2 6 was found for a fence containing 15 turbines with a lateral spacing of 1 turbine width and a blockage ratio of 0 4 more recently an experimental study mcnaughton et al 2019 showed that two side by side axial turbines witness a power production increase if they are placed close to each other and operate at their new optimal advance parameter concerning staggered configurations the urans farm simulation realized by nuernberg and tao 2018 showed a small increase of the production of turbines placed closely downstream and on the side of a first one with a maximum 11 power increase 21 did experimental measurements for different configurations of cross flow turbine arrays and also found power increases when adapting the turbine advance parameters the present study aims at developing a 3d steady state method for turbine array modelings that does not need aerodynamic foil coefficients nor empirical data for taking into account the rotating blades and the possible stall phenomenons moreover the proposed method allows one to calculate the turbine power production with a good accuracy and different farm configurations are tested the turbine used is a three bladed n 3 reduced scale darrieus turbine that had already been experimented by maître et al 2013 its characteristics are presented in fig 1 it has a diameter d 175 mm and a height h 175 mm the blades are naca0018 profiles with a camber following a rotating circle of diameter 175 mm its chord value is c 32 mm leading to a solidity 2nc d 1 1 the upstream flow direction is represented by the vector u and the rotational speed ω is controlled the turbine advance parameter is defined in a classical way as λ ω d 2 u the origin of all coordinates in this work is the intersection of the rotation axis and the mid height plane of the turbine the x axis is along the inlet flow direction z is the vertical axis and y the transverse axis the force distributions used are obtained from a few unsteady rans rotor stator simulations of the turbine done for different upstream flow conditions an interpolation from those force distributions is performed for intermediate cases the model developed adapts the force values to the upstream flow velocity with an equation linking those forces to the local velocity calculated for each turbine therefore simulations of any configuration of turbine array can be easily performed without having to tune any parameter the method can be extended to axial turbine or others in any case the mesh used is cartesian which will be an advantage in the future to calculate the influence of the masts or external parts of the turbine not represented in this study those parts could be modeled by adding the corresponding drag force in the affected cells or by the use of ibm methods that prove to be efficient on cartesian meshes constant et al 2017 2 methodology 2 1 preliminary urans simulations the force distributions imposed in the adaptive model are results obtained beforehand from unsteady blade resolved simulations of the darrieus turbine these simulations are done with the open source software openfoam4 1 a rans turbulence closure model is used with the k omega shear stress transport linear eddy viscosity equations menter 1994 menter et al 2003 this model has two equations on k and ω and allows to capture correctly the flow separation it has been widely used to calculate the performances and loads of cross flow turbines maître et al 2013 used this turbulence model and did a mesh sensitivity analysis for a 2d simulation of a darrieus turbine to capture the boundary layer flow near the turbine they found out that the maximum dimensionless wall distance y has to be lower than 5 with good results obtained for values always lower than 2 and the mean y value has to be less than 1 kramer et al 2015 showed that a 3d urans simulation with a mean y value less than 1 is able to reproduce correctly the geometry effects like the arm blade connections in our simulations the wall refinement used has a cell height of 1 0 1 0 5 m near the wall and is extended within 15 layers with a growth rate of 1 17 after convergence a maximum y value of 2 4 and a mean value always lower than 0 2 are obtained for the different positions during one turbine revolution and for all the simulated advance parameters the inlet conditions are a flow velocity of 2 3m s a turbulence intensity of 2 5 and a value ω 1 s 1 which is low and creates no turbulence decay along the domain wall laws are used as lateral top and bottom boundary conditions the outlet conditions are a constant pressure condition and a zero gradient velocity condition the dimensions of the simulation domain are 0 60 m wide 0 55 m high and 2 5 m long in the direction of the flow 0 5 m upstream and 2 m downstream of the turbine a view of this domain is presented in fig 2 to reduce the number of cells a symmetry is used on the median plane z 0 therefore only the upper half of the domain in fig 2 is simulated the turbine rotation is taken into account using a dynamic mesh interface between the tunnel domain and a cylinder containing the turbine these specifics lead to a full mesh composed of about 14 million cells with 9 million cells in the rotor domain the turbine shaft and its support structures are not modeled the pimpledymfoam solver is used to get accurate results in acceptable time it is a large time step transient solver for incompressible turbulent flow using the pimple merged piso simple algorithm it is able to take into account dynamic meshes the numerical schemes used are second order backward for the time and second order for pressure velocity k and omega gauss linear with a limiter for k and omega classical time step values are used depending on the advance parameter λ simulated for the turbine at λ 2 which is larger or close to the optimal advance parameter in the present study the time step is chosen to correspond to a rotation of the turbine of 1 degree this value was recommended by maître et al 2013 a smaller time step corresponding to 0 5 degree of rotation is chosen for lower λ values a maximum of 30 subiterations is chosen for each time step results are obtained only once the two following criteria are met at least 12 revolutions of the turbine have been completed and the flow is converged in the wake doing only 6 revolutions has led to differences with the final force and power values less than 1 using a coarser mesh containing 6 million cells with the same near wall grid has also led to differences of the same order of magnitude the urans simulation results are compared to experiments using the same reduced scale darrieus turbine new experiments were conducted in the cerg hydrodynamic tunnel th2 in grenoble whose test section is approximately 2 m long with a constant rectangular shape that is 60 cm wide by 55 cm high three different flow velocities are used in the test section 1 8 m s 2 3 m s and 2 8 m s the turbine is not centered and is shifted 5 cm towards negative y values but simulations showed that this has no influence since the walls are far enough away from the turbine a turbulence grid is located 1 m upstream of the turbine and creates homogeneous isotropic turbulence it has rectangular bars of thickness 1 cm regularly spaced each 5 cm in the two transverse directions the turbulence intensity has been measured beforehand without turbine along the tunnel and an extrapolation at the turbine location where the absence of window is hindering measurements gives the turbulence intensity value of 5 5 this value is different from the urans inlet turbulence intensity value but no significant effect is expected because the flow through vertical axis turbines has a low sensitivity to turbulence three different flow velocities have been tested the instrumentation of the turbine is detailed in the work of maître et al 2013 the power production of the turbine is measured via the electrical torque and the corresponding power coefficient cp is deduced cp is equal to the turbine kinetic power p divided by the maximum extractable power from a free stream flow of velocity u considering the projected section s of the turbine 1 c p p 1 2 ρ s u 3 in this equation ρ is the density of the water chosen to 1000 kg m 3 the cp curves for each flow velocity are compared to the numerical cp values obtained with the urans blade resolved simulation of the turbine in fig 3 all experimental curves are close which means that there are few reynolds effects for those tunnel velocities the urans curve is in good agreement with the experimental ones with the highest error for λ 2 forces along the streamwise x and lateral y directions are measured via piezoelectric sensors and the corresponding dimensionless force coefficients cx and cy are deduced in order to compare them with the results of the urans blade resolved simulation that was done without the turbine shaft the drag created by this part is estimated using the drag coefficient curve of an infinite fixed cylinder of the same diameter the value of 12 3 n is calculated and is added to the total simulated drag the comparison of the experimental and simulation results is presented in fig 4 the cx results are very close but there are discrepancies in term of cy values with high relative errors since the turbine transverse force values are small however the urans simulation is validated against the experiments and its results are used to construct the simplified model as explained in the following section 2 2 a force conservative simplified model in our simplified model a classical representation of the turbine is used force source terms are added in the momentum equations for each cell of the domain swept by the turbine the method used to obtain a time averaged force field from the urans simulation results consists of two steps the first step is to project the forces on a new cylindrical mesh which geometry is adapted to represent the darrieus force distribution it is more suitable than using a cartesian mesh that might lead to a loss of information if the mesh is too rough or to discontinuities if the cell sizes are too close to the urans cell dimensions the cylindrical mesh used is presented in fig 5 its cells are the basic volume elements of a fixed cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z which does not rotate with the turbine the decomposition is done here for the half of the turbine simulated and will be extended later by symmetry to the whole turbine the zone where blade forces are present is decomposed into one cell in the radial direction r 10 cells in the z direction and 72 cells along the 360 of θ d θ 5 the arm forces are extracted in a domain that contains 10 cells in the radial direction and 1 cell in z direction with d θ 5 when the simulation is converged during one turbine revolution both arm and blade forces are extracted for each cell of this cylindrical mesh for each time step equivalent to 1 or 0 5 of rotation this referential being fixed at each time step cells of the cylindrical mesh intersect either a part of the blades or arms in this case the corresponding forces are extracted or only a fluid part no forces are extracted at last a time averaging of those force distributions during the whole turbine revolution is performed for each cell to obtain a steady state spatial distribution of the forces the second step is a projection of those forces on a new cartesian mesh of which the cell size can be adapted to have a proper representation of the turbine this projection step has been chosen for its simplicity to model whatever number of turbines in an array without having to take care of the turbine positions to construct the mesh forces from the cylindrical steady state force distribution are projected in the simplified model mesh the cell forces imposed in the simplified mesh are obtained from a weighting of the forces of all the neighbor cells of the cylindrical mesh whose center is comprised within a distance lower than a constant distance of the code named d i s t a c t i o n this is illustrated in fig 6 for a two dimension mesh in the following equations the index i is taken for numbering the cells of the simplified mesh noted m e s h s i m p and the index j for cells of the cylindrical mesh noted m e s h c y l γ i j is a linear function of the distance d i s t i j between the cells i and j and is defined as 2 γ i j d i s t a c t i o n d i s t i j i f d i s t i j d i s t a c t i o n 3 γ i j 0 i f d i s t i j d i s t a c t i o n in order to have the conservation of the total forces applied in the mesh a factor has to be used to calculate the part of the force on a cell i due to the influence of the cell j it is the function β i j calculated as 4 β i j γ i j k m e s h s i m p γ k j the total force vector f i applied on the cell i of the simplified mesh is defined as a function of the cylindrical mesh cell forces f j as 5 f i j m e s h c y l f j β i j j m e s h c y l f j γ i j k m e s h s i m p γ k j it can be easily seen that the addition of the forces f i for all cells of the simplified mesh is equal to the total force applied on the cylindrical mesh another advantage of this method is that a smoothing is automatically done close to the borders of the turbine area indeed even if cells are not comprised in the turbine swept volume they witness a force contribution from cells comprised in a distance d i s t a c t i o n the factor d i s t a c t i o n is therefore a smoothing factor of our simulations that has to be chosen carefully the force distribution obtained after projection for λ 2 is presented in fig 7 in the horizontal plane z 2 cm z r 0 23 under the turbine arms and the vertical plane y 0 a grid sensitivity study has been done it is linked to the smoothing parameter d i s t a c t i o n presented before and both the cell size dx and this parameter have been tested in order to be sure to have at least one cell in the radius direction for modeling the blades the parameter d i s t a c t i o n cannot be lower than dx the velocity deficits at 2 diameters 2d and 8 diameters 8d downstream of the turbine are plotted versus y at the altitude z 2 cm for different values of the tested parameters they are presented in fig 8 we observe that the curves are converging towards the curve with dx 0 005 m the case with dx 0 01 m and d i s t a c t i o n 0 02 m gives the same velocity profiles and it will be used in the simulations it gives better results than using d i s t a c t i o n 0 01 m because in this last case the arms are badly represented with only one cell in the z direction and no vertical forces imposed and the near wake is slightly impacted the chosen parameters dx 0 01 m and d i s t a c t i o n 0 02 m lead to a small over estimation of the turbine drag and power of respectively 2 4 and 3 6 compared to the converged values 2 3 research of a maximum efficiency operating point independent of the confinement a classical representation of the turbine performances is the power coefficient versus λ curve already presented in fig 3 this curve presents a maximum of efficiency for λ close to 2 and can be used to calculate the turbine power production in free stream conditions knowing the upstream flow velocity u with a turbine placed in a restricted section for example in a natural channel or between other turbines in an array the flow just upstream of the turbine is generally accelerated compared to an isolated configuration this effect is due to the straightening of the streamlines upstream the turbine it induces an increase of the turbine extractable power as a consequence the power production cannot be calculated with the performance coefficient of eq 1 anymore the confinement number is usually defined as s s c h a n n e l with s c h a n n e l the cross section of the channel simulated in the present simulations the domain height is kept constant and the confinement is changed in the horizontal direction to correspond to turbines close to each other always located at the same water depth a lateral confinement is defined as ϵ d b with d the turbine diameter and b the horizontal dimension of the channel chosen for each simulation three different confinement geometries are simulated with the urans model ϵ 0 29 ϵ 0 44 and ϵ 0 58 different advance parameters are used to draw the power coefficient curves for each simulation a mean local velocity u l o c a l is calculated to obtain a new local advance parameter λ defined as 6 λ ω d 2 u l o c a l the local velocity is calculated as the mean streamwise velocity value in all cells of the cylinder swept by the vertical axis turbine that is time averaged over one turbine revolution the local power coefficient cp is defined using the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity as 7 c p p 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 3 the local force coefficients for each components of forces the local thrust coefficient cx and the equivalent coefficients in the 2 other directions cy and cz are defined in the same way using the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity and depending on the three components of the total forces applied on the turbine f x y z 8 c x y z f x y z 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 2 the cp versus λ curves are presented for each confinement in fig 9 a and compared to the corresponding c p versus λ curves in fig 9 b the labels added on this last plot correspond to the respective λ values used for each calculation point the cp versus λ curves are different for each confinement and the maximum efficiency values are increasing as the confinement is increasing the maximum of efficiency is also slightly shifted towards larger λ values as the confinement is raised however the cp versus λ curves are all superimposed a 4th order polynomial fitting curve has been drawn using the method of least squares with all the cp calculated points all points are very close to the fitting curve in regard to the simulation uncertainties a justification is proposed for the existence of this unique curve the turbine performances are increased if the velocity triangles on its blades are favorable it means that the angle of attack on the blades has to be optimized this angle depends on the relative velocity and the λ parameter is a good spatial average representation of this velocity for the whole turbine volume therefore a same λ parameter leads approximately to the same power coefficient the classical and local force coefficients on the x and y axes are drawn in figs 10 and 11 the force values in the z direction are not presented 4th order polynomial fitting curves have been plotted using all the simulated cx and cy points the dimensionless local force coefficients are also independent from the confinement in figs 10 b and 11 b finally time averaged force values at several turbine locations have been monitored in the cylindrical mesh the chosen locations are shown in fig 5 the positions 1 and 2 are located in the zone of strong radial and tangential forces at the angle θ 207 5 position 1 is at the turbine center altitude z 0 and position 2 is located at z r 0 46 where there is no influence of the arms position 3 is located at z r 0 46 at the most upstream position of the turbine θ close to 180 the cell forces for those monitored cells are also made dimensionless using the local velocity to get the coefficients c x y z c e l l the values c x c e l l and c y c e l l are plotted versus λ for the three different confinement configurations in fig 12 only three λ values have been simulated the piecewise linear curves are drawn with the three points obtained for the confinement case ϵ 0 29 for each position the points obtained for the other confinement cases are located on these curves even if small discrepancies occur the monitoring on all the other cells gives the same order of accuracy excepted the calculation uncertainties a source of discrepancies can be the fact that the mean local velocity over the whole darrieus turbine is used and forces can be locally slightly different for some confinement cases if the flow velocity and angle of attack are locally modified for example by the presence of nearby channel walls however it is shown that those dimensionless force coefficients obtained for each cell of the cylindrical mesh are also independent from the confinement they will be used later in the adaptive model without any additional confinement correction each cp versus λ curve in fig 9 a has a different point of maximum efficiency those points are found using the different polynomial fitting curves for each confinement the order of the fitting polynomial is the number of simulated points minus one the corresponding cp and λ are calculated and presented in table 1 it appears that the cp and λ values found are close to each others taking the average of those points is a good approximation of a maximum efficiency operating point independent from confinement the maximum differences in terms of λ and cp between two points are noted respectively δ λ and δ c p the uncertainty analysis for the maximum power output p m a x is done as following 9 p m a x 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 3 c p ρ s ω d 2 3 c p 2 λ 3 10 δ p m a x p m a x 3 δ λ λ δ c p c p by using values found in table 1 the relative error δ c p c p is lower than 2 7 and the relative error δ λ λ lower than 3 which gives a total error on the maximum power production always lower than 11 7 therefore using λ 3 6 and cp 1 98 is a good approximation for imposing the best efficiency operating point in the simulations for any possible flow configuration 2 4 the adaptive model implementation in real operating cases the turbine performances and the forces applied on the turbine depend on the configuration of the flow through the turbine the aim here is to develop an adaptive model that calculates automatically the forces and performances depending on this flow using the λ parameter the calculation loop steps for the so called adaptive model are summarized in fig 13 dimensionless urans force distributions the c x c e l l and c y c e l l distributions from fig 12 and the corresponding c z c e l l have been extracted on the cylindrical mesh for three λ values 1 4 4 25 and 9 7 a linear interpolation is done for each cell if the chosen λ is located in between those values the force coefficients are then multiplied by the term 1 2 ρ s u l o c a l 2 to get the force distributions that will be projected on the cartesian mesh according to the previous paragraph those forces are added in the navier stokes equations then the flow and the new local velocity are calculated for the current iteration after convergence the final u l o c a l value is calculated and the c p versus λ curve of fig 9 b is used to calculate the corresponding power production of the turbine the adaptive model is tested for different configurations for the cerg test case in next section and for array calculations in section 4 the cerg test case simulation is performed as a model validation the adaptive model in which the force distribution is an unknown is compared with the force conservation model using the forces given by the urans calculations moreover a 2d version of these two models removing the z direction has been implemented to measure the effect of the 2d assumption on the results the same software and setup are used and the same cell size dx dy 0 01 m in the central zone the only differences are the domain size which is modified to keep the same turbine confinement and the force distribution which is adapted in 2d the confinement in 3d is d h b h 0 0928 in 2d the value b 188 6 cm is chosen to have the same confinement value d b 0 0928 the z component of force vanishes in 2d because the turbine height is set equal to 1 m the x and y components f x y 2 d are calculated for each r θ position in the cylindrical mesh as the sum of the 3d cell forces f x y 3 d along z with cell altitude indices z k ranging from z k m i n to z k m a x divided by the height of the turbine h 11 f x y 2 d r θ z k z k m i n z k m a x f x y 3 d r θ z k h in the case of array calculations the low array confinement is enough to have no influence on the results anymore therefore the same x and y domain lengths are used both in the 2d and 3d models 3 simulation results for a single machine 3 1 the test case setup to check the validity of the simulation results piv measurements have been realized on the experimental hydrodynamic tunnel downstream of the turbine in several horizontal planes of different altitudes the reference plane is located at the altitude z 1 cm then 5 planes are located above it and 5 planes below it each of the consecutive planes are separated by a 4 cm increment in the z direction vertical profiles of the axial velocity are reconstructed at several x positions downstream of the axis of the turbine with the values obtained on the horizontal planes the experimental values present a shift of approximately 3 cm towards the top of the tunnel compared to the simulations it has been observed that the peculiar geometry of the flume with an upstream half convergent section placed only in the lower part of the tunnel creates a z component of velocity close to 0 05 m s this deviates progressively the wake of the turbine towards the top hence all measurement points altitudes are shifted of 3 cm when compared to the numerical results the reference plane will therefore be described as the plane of altitude z 2 cm when compared to numerical results the simulation domain is the domain already presented in fig 2 that corresponds to the experimental setup the k omega shear stress transport turbulence model is used the uniform inlet velocity of 2 3 m s is chosen and the turbulence inlet values are chosen to k 0 0711 m 2 s 2 and ω 90 s 1 in order to have the turbulence intensity value of 5 5 and the correct turbulence decay at the turbine location 3 2 wake results the advance parameter λ 2 is first simulated with all models it is slightly different from the point of maximum efficiency presented in table 1 the corresponding forces calculated via the urans simulation are imposed for the force conservation model and λ 4 25 is now imposed in the adaptive model that was the local advance parameter calculated in the urans simulation at λ 2 the wakes obtained are compared to the experimental one the transverse velocity profiles are plotted in fig 14 in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm z r 0 23 at several positions downstream of the turbine at the distances 2d 3d downstream of the turbine axis the available vertical velocity profiles are plotted at the same positions downstream of the turbine in fig 15 at the lateral position y 0 cm we observe that both 3d models give sensibly the same results even if the forces imposed are slightly different the turbine drags are respectively equal to 80 2n and 84 3n for the force constant and the adaptive cases though the experimental drag without the axis drag is equal to 79 9n the velocity in the wake is indeed little sensitive to the imposed force values regarding the vertical profiles results are more accurate in the lower part where the shaft of the turbine is not present in the experiments than in the upper part where the shaft is present in the experiments but not in the simulations in both figures the 3d simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments in the far wake at distances larger or equal to 4d or 6d there are discrepancies in the near wake that are common with the use of actuator force models the eddies generated by the turbine blades are not calculated with those models but may influence the velocity field in the near wake therefore we cannot expect to have accurate predictions in the near wake but the model is validated for modeling turbine arrays with distances higher than 4d between consecutive turbines the turbulent kinetic energy k profiles are also plotted at the same positions in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm in fig 16 the differences found between the two models are insufficient to act on the velocity profiles the turbulent kinetic energy is over estimated in both simplified models compared to the experiments it causes the wake to decay fast enough which was not the case for axial turbine in classical actuator disk models for which authors tried to add extra turbulence source terms at the disk position nguyen et al 2016 our vertical axis actuator force model creates this extra turbulent kinetic energy by itself which makes the velocity recover fast enough in the wake regarding the horizontal profiles obtained with the 2d simulations the velocity deficit does not decrease fast enough and there are big discrepancies in the far wake in the turbulence theory pope 2000 the velocity deficit decay of an axisymmetric wake as a function of the position x is following the function x 2 3 in 3d whereas it is following the function x 1 2 in 2d that decreases slower this is due to geometrical aspects as the wake limits where the mixing occurs are an area circling the wake in 3d and only two lines in both sides of the wake in 2d therefore 2d models are not expected to give correct results for the wake prediction without adding any extra correcting force or turbulence source term however 2d models require much smaller calculation efforts to quantify the discrepancies that can be introduced by these models the 2d version of the developed model has been compared to the 3d one in terms of power production and velocity deficits in the next sections 3 3 power production results the force conservation model results are presented for the cases λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 as well as the corresponding adaptive model results for λ 1 4 λ 4 25 and λ 9 7 the table 2 summarizes the experimental urans and the two aforementioned models results with the calculated local velocity λ λ c p power p and relative error on power er p the urans simulation is taken as reference because its force values are used rather than the experimental ones in the two actuator force models for the case λ 2 close to the optimal advance parameter both 2d models present high power production discrepancies and are not accurate for calculating this value in 3d as well as in 2d results are more accurate for the adaptive model the local velocity calculated is closer to the urans calculated one the power production is hence better calculated with errors of 3 5 14 3 in 2d for the adaptive model and 21 5 56 4 in 2d for the force conservation model the larger error value obtained with the force conservation model is due to an overestimation of the local velocity leading to an overestimation of the power using eq 7 the force conservation approach is the classical approach and implies a conservation of the total forces but this approach might not be the best to model the flow through the turbine and its wake another approach would be to enforce the flow rate through the turbine which might create a more accurate wake in the simulation the adaptive model is a compromise between those two approaches in this model neither the force values nor the local velocity u l o c a l are conserved but the λ value is imposed it gives a relation linking the local velocity and the forces imposed that leads to a compromise between the conservation of those two values for the lower advance parameter λ 1 corresponding to the case of a high stream velocity or a low turbine rotation speed the power production is correctly estimated with both 3d models because the local velocity is always correctly predicted for the higher advance parameter λ 3 that corresponds to a high turbine rotation speed or a low stream velocity results are less accurate but this case is extreme with even a negative turbine power production that is small in magnitude as a result small discrepancies on the local velocity lead to high relative errors on the power however the adaptive model produces less than 9 error on the power production and this model is suitable to estimate the power production for a wide range of advance parameters between 1 and 3 4 tidal turbine array calculations 4 1 the different configuration setups the aforementioned adaptive model is used in this section to compute several configurations of turbine arrays the 2d and 3d models are considered the lateral spacing distance between two consecutive turbine centers in a row is first tested in a fence configuration with 8 turbines side by side a configuration of two rows of turbine with staggered positions 8 turbines in the first row and 7 turbines in the second row is also studied with different lateral spacing and distances between the two rows denoted axial spacing the same turbine reduced scaled model of height 17 5 cm is kept for all cases a same mesh refined in the central zone around the turbines is used it is presented in fig 17 the constant cell height dz 1 cm is used in the whole domain cubic cells of size dx dy dz 1 cm are used in the central zone the domain height is 55 cm and the turbines are located at mid height to remain close to real oceanic configurations where turbines are expected to occupy approximately the central third of the water column height the central zone extends up to 18d in both y directions and 3d upstream and 25d downstream of the first turbine row in the x direction the distance l 7d is introduced as the distance between the two extreme turbine centers of a 8 turbine fence if no space is left between two adjacent turbines an inflation of maximum growth rate 1 2 is used in the x and y directions along an upstream distance of 5 l a downstream distance of 20 l and a lateral distance of 6 6 l with this mesh the boundary conditions are far away and are not influencing the calculations anymore the total mesh size is about 26 million cells symmetry conditions are used in the two lateral the upper and the lower domain boundaries the inlet velocity of 2 253 m s in the x direction is chosen the inlet turbulence intensity is set to 2 5 with a value ω 1 s 1 that ensures almost no turbulence decay all along the farm the same outlet conditions as for the single machine simulations are used a number of iterations of 20000 is required to obtain a convergence in terms of local velocity and power production it leads to calculation times of about 4600 core hours on nodes intel sandy bridge ep e5 2670 8c 2 6 ghz 20m 8 gt s with 4 gb ram core which is an acceptable time lower than for a single rotor urans simulation moreover the domain length influence and the cell refinement in the array wake more than 1 l downstream of the array have not been tested and it is more than likely that the cell number could be drastically reduced without significant differences in the results the simulations are realized with the values λ 3 6 and cp 1 98 in order to stay close to the optimum of power production as explained in the former sections all the tested farm cases are summarized in table 3 4 2 fence configuration results the velocity colormap and the streamlines in the horizontal plane of altitude z 2 cm are presented in fig 18 for the fence configuration with the lateral spacing of 1 2d both 2d model results in the right and 3d model results in the left are presented for this spacing the wakes of all turbines are joining to form a unique wake that continues until a distance of several l downstream of the fence a slight global deviation of the wake towards negative y values occurs the velocity deficit is highly overestimated in the far wake for the 2d model it is in agreement with the behavior of this model that overestimates the velocity deficit for a single turbine wake as already shown in fig 14 results in term of power production are analyzed hereafter the dimensionless farm power dfp is defined to compare the total power production to the maximal one produced by the same number n of isolated turbines with the same inlet velocity as 12 d f p i 0 n p i n 1 2 ρ s c p m a x u 3 c p m a x 0 273 is the maximal power coefficient value obtained from the urans simulations for the less confined case in table 1 that is close to the non confined case the results for the different lateral spacing are presented in fig 21 the results for the same simulations using the 2d model are also shown in the fence the closer the turbines are to each other the higher the extracted power is the same behavior is observed both in 2d and 3d the 2d model overestimates the local blockage effect because the stream cannot flow above or under the turbines when the lateral spacing is lower than 3d a 10 to 24 power increase is obtained compared to turbines in free stream conditions this is coherent with results presented by mcnaughton et al 2019 that found out a power increase of 20 for an experimental fence of two axial tidal turbines the local blockage effect in our study is higher due to the higher number of turbines and certainly increases again the power production vogel and willden 2019 found out a maximum power increase of 16 for their 8 turbine fence simulated with a bem method adapting to the flow conditions the trend is respected in our simulations however this extra power extracted from the fluid creates a stronger velocity deficit in the wake that might decrease the production of a potential second turbine row that would be added therefore a two row staggered configuration is studied in the following section 4 3 staggered configuration results the staggered configuration wakes are presented in fig 19 for the lateral spacing of 1 5d and the axial spacing of 15d and in fig 20 for the lateral spacing of 4d and the axial spacing of 15d both 3d model results case a and 2d model results case b are presented in the first configuration the velocity deficit in the wake of the first line is far higher than in the second case where the low local blockage allows the flow in between the turbines the flow reaching the second row has a decreased velocity and a lower power production is expected the global farm wake recovers also slower than for the higher lateral spacing case in fig 19 the velocity deficit just upstream of the second row is far higher for the 2d model the power production of the second row calculated with this model is expected to be small compared to the 3d model one in fig 20 b the wakes of the first row turbines extend in between the second row turbines for the central turbines but the first row wakes are partially impacting the 4 turbines of the second row located the most at the outsides therefore their power production are decreased the power production results of the staggered configurations are presented in fig 22 the 3d model results are first analyzed the solution maximizing the power production is to put all turbines on the same line the staggered case with the axial spacing of 0d and lateral spacing of 4d is then equivalent to a 15 turbine fence with a lateral spacing of 2d it is also noticed from figs 21 and 22 that in this case the dfp is 1 18 higher than the one obtained in the fence of 8 turbines with 2d lateral spacing dfp 1 14 adding turbines in a row increases the local blockage effect and the dfp in the staggered cases the lateral spacing of 1 5d hinders the flow to pass through the first row and the flow reaching the second row witnesses a big velocity deficit as a result the power production of the second row is highly decreased and the dimensionless farm power is impacted with values lower than 1 consequences are less grave if the second row is far enough from the first one with a dimensionless farm power higher than one for the distance 15d for the lateral spacing of 4d the flow is reaching the second row without any velocity deficit and the second row witnesses even a slight local velocity increase the farm power increase is close to 10 for all axial spacing of the second row between 5d and 15d the staggered configuration benefits less from the local blockage effects than the fence configuration with the same number of turbines placed close to each other for more rows in a staggered disposition the power harnessed is also expected to decrease if rows are too close with better results if a bigger lateral spacing is kept between all turbines keeping a lateral distance sufficient enough for the stream to flow besides the first row turbines and an axial spacing of 15d between two consecutive rows seems enough to have a global farm wake recovery and to enable one to put extra turbine rows without huge power decrease regarding the 2d model the same behavior is observed but there are big discrepancies on the calculated dfp values with the lateral spacing of 1 5d the second row power production is always highly reduced because the velocity deficit created by the first row is overestimated with the 2d model the dfp calculated are lower than 0 8 for all those cases the axial spacing of 15d is not enough to have a velocity deficit recover in 2d contrary to the 3d model for the lateral spacing of 4d the first row wakes are expanding in between the second row turbines when the two rows are close enough and the power production is not decreased compared to the 3d model it starts to decrease when the axial spacing is higher than 10d an explanation can be that some of the first row wakes are impacting the second row turbines and decreasing their power production as already presented before finally the 2d model is not accurate to compute the farm power production 5 conclusions different urans blade resolved simulations of a vertical axis darrieus turbine have been performed to feed a steady state 3d actuator force model the calculated turbine forces are time averaged over one turbine revolution to obtain a detailed spatial force distribution instead of the uniform force distribution of standard actuator disk models or their equivalent for vertical axis turbines this method replaces the classical bem approach to obtain the force distribution the urans computations have been performed for different turbine lateral confinements in order to draw several classical power coefficient and force coefficient curves when the coefficients are plotted as a function of the local velocity instead of the free stream velocity the curves become independent of the confinement those curves are used to construct an adaptive model independent of the turbine confinement or the local blockage effect it gives a good estimation of the power production of a single turbine with only 3 5 relative error at advance parameters close to the maximum efficiency point and less than 9 for extreme operating points the model is also calculating correctly the far wake flow at distances higher than 4d or 6d but presents discrepancies for the near wake velocity profiles an operating point close to the maximum efficiency point has been found for the simulated turbine for this point the turbine power production is calculated with an error always lower than 11 7 whatever the local blockage is it is used in several farm configurations and could be a starting point for future optimization simulations which could be performed with the model presented here that requires relatively low computational efforts amongst the tested farm configurations the fence configuration with the lowest inter turbine spacing gives the highest farm power production a maximum power increase of 24 is found for the 8 turbine fence with a lateral spacing of 1 2d staggered farm configurations benefit less from local blockage effects even if an optimization of the lateral and axial inter turbine spacing still has to be done a compromise has to be found between having closely spaced first row turbines harvesting a lot of power and still a sufficient power production in the next rows the same calculations have been performed using 2d models for the single turbine simulation the local velocity is calculated with large discrepancies that lead to large power production discrepancies 2d models might be sufficient to deduce general trends concerning the turbine positioning in an array but they prove to produce large errors to calculate the array power production finally the 3d model seems promising for calculating arrays of vertical axis water turbines a comparison to measurements in the case of wake interactions between several turbines still has to be done to confirm the model the whole methodology could also be applied to axial tidal turbines of any shape the model validity still has to be checked for those turbines for which the wake decay mechanisms are different credit authorship contribution statement v
