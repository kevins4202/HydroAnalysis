8120,study region 61 catchments located in hungary with drainage areas from 8 74 to 810 km2 study focus many engineering tasks require the estimation of the catchment response time t r the most frequently used t r parameters are the time of concentration and the lag time at ungauged catchments they are usually estimated by empirical equations that relate t r to catchment characteristics this paper provides a comparative study of three dimension reduction techniques and seven clustering methods for fitting empirical equations to the observed values of t r 60 catchment descriptors were calculated for each catchment then three subsets with 1 3 descriptors were extracted from the entire parameter set during the dimension reduction analysis two and four catchment groups were created during a cluster analysis by re calibrating the three equations that resulted from the dimension reduction analysis new hydrological insights for the region under study it is demonstrated that the principal component analysis can be easily outperformed by the linear correlation and the all possible regressions methods the latter yielding a root mean squared error rmse of 6 77 h when applied with three catchment descriptors the most interesting finding of the dimension reduction is that t r is strongly connected to field capacity in the region of study the performance of the clustering methods varies considerably rmse 5 05 12 03 h the best overall performance comes from the residual approach rmse 8 14 h on average it is shown that several of the methods outperform the grouping based on geographical regions however the estimation error is reduced only in a few cases when compared to the regional estimation i e one cluster method clusters created based on catchment width yields the best results resulting in rmse values of 5 80 and 5 77 h with two and four clusters respectively the comparison of the new and the existing empirical equations clearly demonstrated that the estimation of t r needs improvement in hungary while the application of more than two clusters is unwarranted for the study region abbreviations tr catchment response time tc time of concentration tl lag time tp

introduction estimating the response time of a catchment is a crucial step of many engineering tasks different time parameters need to be estimated for different purposes such as peak flow estimation modeling or flood risk environmental hazard mapping the most frequently used time parameters are the time of concentration t c the lag time t l the time to peak t p and the time to equilibrium t e mccuen et al 1987 the theoretical background of these time parameters is tangled and their calculation is still an elaborate task even though their study dates back more than 150 years recently beven 2020 highlighted the differences between t c and t e and how they became systematically mistreated in the last century moreover several definitions are used for the calculation of time parameters in the literature creating further confusion around their calculation the present work aims to provide a broader picture of the catchment response time t r in general studies focusing on time parameter estimation involve three main assessment methods that rely on i measured data ii hydraulic equations and iii empirical or semi empirical formulae measurements can be carried out using i laboratory models ii a tracer substance or iii registering rainfall and runoff data although tracer measurements provide detailed information on the runoff generation process and form the only approach that can be considered as a direct measurement of t r it can be completed only for research and not for an operational purpose pilgrim 1976 the employment of model catchments built in a laboratory suffers from the same limitations the ensuing results obtained by either of such measurements are not necessarily valid for natural catchments gaál et al 2012 the main disadvantage of applying measured time series of rainfall and runoff is the lack of a clear definition for time parameters however for catchments larger than the experimental catchment size i e a few square kilometers it is the most effective way to collect information about the true value of t r since a large number of events on numerous catchments can be processed using historical precipitation and streamflow data recently giani et al 2021 provided a new method to estimate the average value of the catchment response time using measured rainfall and runoff data the authors of this paper used this method to calculate t r on the event scale these recent developments made the estimation of t r from measured time series more straightforward and comprehensive the observed value of t r can be assessed by catchment descriptors to set up empirical equations the performance of the equations can be bolstered in two steps i selecting catchment descriptors which describe the response variable t r most efficiently and ii through the grouping of catchments the result of catchment grouping highly depends on the selection of descriptors therefore identification of the proper catchment descriptors is a crucial step there is a vast amount of parameters available in the literature ssegane et al 2012 collected 72 topographic parameters 66 climatic parameters 98 soil parameters and 15 land use land cover parameters while sanborn and bledsoe 2006 gathered 84 streamflow metrics from literature even if the set of examined parameters is reduced by hydrological reasoning at the very beginning application of a dimension reduction technique is typically required to set up a smaller parameter space the two most often used dimension reduction techniques in hydrological studies are stepwise regression analysis sra and principal component analysis pca a notable difference between the two methods is that while sra utilizes information from the response variable as it minimizes the prediction error pca would not necessarily involve the response variable ssegane et al 2012 while pca is helpful to reduce dimensions and group parameters it may lead to the removal of hydrologically significant parameters for example myronidis and ivanova 2020 applied pca to reduce the parameter space followed by employing sra to estimate design flow values as it turned out it is not guaranteed that pca would retain the most efficient parameter set in terms of design flow estimation singh et al 2009 also relied on pca to group parameters and set up a reduced parameter set they state that one parameter from each principal component pc can subsequently estimate specific hydrological processes even though this set of parameters indeed retains the largest information content from the initial parameter space regarding the variance it is not guaranteed that the selected parameters will lead to the best estimation of the chosen hydrological process ssegane et al 2012 compared sra pca and five other causal selection methods on parameter selection of known functional relationships in their study pca was outperformed by sra and two of the causal selection methods performed the best catchment grouping is a fundamental tool to transfer information from gauged catchments to ungauged sites it can provide a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that control the studied runoff characteristics groups can be categorized based on their i construction fixed or targeted to the catchment of interest and ii spatial continuity contiguous or non contiguous blöschl et al 2013 the applications of grouping methods may include the estimation of i annual runoff ii seasonal runoff flow regime iii flow duration curve iv low flow design flow values and v model parameters comprehensive studies usually focus on one application however different clustering techniques can easily lead to different results laaha and blöschl 2006 found that employing seasonality regions based on low flow exceedance yields the best result in the case of low flow estimation for flow duration curve estimation in france the visual grouping method and the regression tree rt method performed equally well sauquet and catalogne 2011 parajka et al 2005 estimated the model parameters of a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model the most successfully via a kriging approach and a donor catchment method based on similarity to the present authors best knowledge there is no literature available on grouping methods to estimate t r ravazzani et al 2019 examined the effect of catchment grouping on the performance of 24 empirical equations however their clustering approach was based on the result of flow duration curve estimation boscarello et al 2016 they found that the predictions did not improve significantly when homogeneous groups of catchments were created the broad spectrum of such findings underlines the need for a comprehensive study of clustering methods concerning the estimation of t r an added motivation of the present study is that the currently employed equation for the estimation of t c in hungary dates back to 1958 wisnovszky 1958 thus clearly requiring a revision this paper focuses on two main aspects i to find the optimal dimension reduction method and ii to identify the best catchment grouping approach along with the optimal number of groups we also focus on quantifying the pca s effectiveness as a parameter selection technique and conclude that it does not necessarily yield the best set of parameters and on assessing the improvement via comparison to existing empirical equations a further novelty of the present study is that we provide the clustering methods efficiency in terms of probability by a monte carlo approach 2 study area and data this study involves 61 small to medium sized catchments located in the carpathian basin an overview of the catchments location is provided in fig 1 while table 1 lists some important characteristics the size of the catchments ranges from 8 74 to 810 km2 while the average catchment area is 206 km2 6 5 of the catchments are larger than 500 km2 and 54 of the catchments have an area smaller than 150 km2 the proportion of forested area ranges from 3 83 to 88 7 while the impervious area is between 0 275 and 19 9 based on the copernicus land use land cover products copernicus 2020a 2020b the soil types covering the catchments are dominantly deposits such as glacial and alluvial loess and loess like tertiary and older deposits third of the catchments coincide with karst regions while volcanic rocks such as andesite rhyolite and basalt are dominant in a few 5 ones sandstone shale and phyllite are dominantly present in even fewer catchments the study covers the years from 2000 to 2017 when the annual rainfall and runoff ranged between 394 and 1377 and 21 1 642 mm respectively the region s climate is predominantly warm summer humid continental dfb based on the köppen climate classification peel et al 2007 while the aridity index i e the annual potential evaporation divided by the annual precipitation varies between 0 75 and 1 25 catchment delineation was performed by the copernicus land monitoring services eu dem v1 1 digital surface model this is a freely available dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 m in raster format copernicus 2016 three main selection criteria were applied regarding the selection of the discharge time series namely i no significant human influence on flow ii high temporal resolution of measurements and iii record availability for at least ten years similar to sauquet and catalogne 2011 the local water directorates provided high resolution 5 min discharge and precipitation time series for 61 and 17 stations respectively since not every catchment has a nearby rainfall gauging station the european centre of medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis data from the copernicus climate data store were used in addition to the gauging station data the used product is the era5 land dataset copernicus 2019 with an hourly temporal and a 0 1 x 0 1 7 5 km x 11 km spatial resolution the applicability of the ecmwf reanalysis data to response time calculation was examined separately in a previous study nagy and szilágyi 2020 in the referred study eight different graphical t r definitions were compared at the 38 catchments having both gauging station and ecmwf precipitation data we found that the ecmwf data is adequate for t r estimation especially when the centers of masses and peaks of the measured runoff and rainfall time series are used 3 methodology 3 1 overview the methodology of the study is comprised of three main steps i assembling the initial data which included calculation of the observed t r values and evaluation of the catchment descriptors cds ii reduction of the initial cd dataset into different number of cds by various dimension reduction methods and iii grouping catchments into different number of groups by selected clustering methods the first step resulted in one characteristic i e the observed value of t r for 61 watersheds each accompanied by 60 cds for each catchment the second step yielded the optimal subsets of cds by applying three dimension reduction methods lastly the most efficient combination of the number of groups and clustering method was identified through cluster analysis the general form of the fitted empirical equations throughout the study is given as 1 t r mod α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α 3 x n α n 1 where x 1 x n are the selected cds α 1 α n 1 are model coefficients while the number of selected parameters n can be 1 through 3 the overview of the workflow and the applied methods are summarized in fig 2 3 2 derivation of t r from observations the characteristic measured values of t r were calculated for each catchment applying the detrending moving average cross correlation analysis dmca following giani et al 2021 the strength of the dmca method is that it can find the timescale at which two time series are linked even when they exhibit different frequency spectra and are nonlinearly related giani et al 2021 therefore the dmca method is capable to estimate t r using the measured precipitation and discharge time series this method can determine t r values for every event resulting in a set of t r values for each catchment for the 61 examined catchments 11 646 event based values were collected altogether the number of events i e t r values per catchment ranged from 25 to 625 with a median of 117 in what follows the median of the dmca based set of values is considered as the characteristic observed value of t r for each catchment hence the empirical equations later were fitted using these values in fig 3 we present the distribution of the observed t r values by means of boxplots representing the medians the 25th and 75th percentiles and the outliers along with a map of the observed median values from fig 3 it is clear that the value of t r exhibits significant variability especially for larger catchments this can be attributed to the fact that the distribution of rainfall becomes less uniform as the catchment area increases the authors would prefer to consider t r as a stochastic value since its value is exposed to randomness e g the distribution of precipitation over a catchment however in this study we only aim to estimate the median of the measured set of t r values this median can be interpreted as the t r of a typical flood 3 3 catchment descriptors since the aim is to connect the observed value of t r to cds altogether 60 parameters were collected and classified into five main categories i size and relief ii topography iii channel network iv shape indices and v hydro climatological indices the list of parameters and their definitions can be found in appendix a1 a5 including name abbreviation and measurement unit along with a reference a selection of cds is presented in fig 4 3 4 dimension reduction the initial number of cds had to be reduced to a smaller parameter set which could subsequently be used to construct and fit empirical equations to the observed values of t r first the method of all possible regressions apr were evaluated which means the evaluation of all possible parameter combinations by eq 1 see above in section 3 1 the number of combinations grows from 60 to 1830 and 35990 as the number of cds increases from one to two and three respectively this method s output should agree with the result of sra in moderately well behaved problems hocking 1976 although gugel 1972 reported 37 improvement in the results when apr was compared to sra the efficiency of other dimension reduction methods can be assessed in probability terms since apr yields the probability distribution function of the performance index as a second dimension reduction technique pca was employed and one parameter with the highest load on the first three pcs was kept the third method was simple but arbitrary to a certain degree the parameter sets were obtained from the linear correlation matrix lcm between the response variable t r and the entire cd set parameters expressing the highest correlation with t r but producing a weak correlation pearson correlation coefficient r 0 7 among each other were selected according to previous studies on empirical t r estimation equations azizian 2018 fang et al 2008 grimaldi et al 2012 nagy et al 2016 ravazzani et al 2019 most equations include one to three parameters additionally the selection of four or more cds would have increased the computation time of the apr method significantly since the number of possible cd combinations grows an order of magnitude with each additional cd therefore with the help of these dimension reduction methods apr pca and lcm one to three parameters were selected out of the 60 cds 3 5 catchment grouping altogether seven clustering methods were compared regional estimation re geographic clustering gc k means clustering km hierarchical clustering hc regression tree rt method residual approach ra and monte carlo mc approach re means no clustering or one cluster its inclusion is meant to show the efficiency of applying different numbers of clusters in the following the array of estimated t r values comprises the dependent or response variable while the independent variables are the selected cds using the three dimension reduction methods apr pca and lcm the above clustering methods are widely used here we only present a short description of each method gc is based on the regions defined in the most recent design estimation manual published by the general directorate of water management general directorate of water management 2001 the manual differentiates six regions as well distinguishable runoff regions in hungary but it gives no further explanation on the creation of such units it is therefore assumed that the regions were created with the help of geological and hydrological i e catchment boundaries referred to as geographical units the six regions presented in the manual were later merged into four and two separate groups the groups were created with consideration to the geological and climatological properties of the carpathian basin the original and the merged groups are presented in fig 5 km was performed by lloyd s algorithm lloyd 1982 which does not include the response variable and consists of the following steps i choosing the initial cluster centers or centroids randomly from the data points ii computing point to cluster centroid distances of all residual points to each centroid based on the chosen distance metric iii assigning each point to the cluster with the closest centroid iv computing the average of the points in each cluster to obtain new centroid locations v repeating steps ii iv until cluster assignments stop changing vi repeating i v until the number of replicates is reached the number of replicates defines the number of repetitions of the clustering procedure starting from the random selection of initial cluster centers this method minimizes the total variance of clusters which is the sum of the deviation of each data point from its cluster s center by the chosen distance metric the latter meant the sample correlation between the data points treated as sequences of values when subtracted from unity each centroid is the component wise mean of the points in that cluster after centering and normalizing those points to zero mean and unity standard deviation the algorithm has two parameters the maximum number of iterations and the number of replicates which were set to 10 000 and 100 respectively in order to ensure a global optimum the main disadvantage of this method is that the number of clusters must be defined before applying the algorithm more detailed information on km is given by everitt et al 2011 in chapters 5 4 1 5 4 3 hc in contrast does not require the number of clusters defined since it builds a dendrogram based on data point distances everitt et al 2011 the dataset can be split at the desired level into clusters using the dendrogram the correlation method was chosen again as the distance metric this algorithm maximizes the distances between the clusters its advantage is the visualization of the clusters since outliers can be easily spotted on the dendrogram the rt method creates a decision tree with the desired number of nodes and bins breiman et al 1984 the bins represent the clusters ensuring their maximum homogeneity this method s advantage is that it needs no parametrization and is sensitive to outliers laaha and blöschl 2006 however it results in one discrete value of the response variable for each cluster the ra involves applying the rt method using the residuals t r res of the response variable s regional estimation hence the residual becomes the response variable and one cd is used as the independent variable to define the clusters bins the residual is simply calculated as t r res t r mod t r obs where t r mod is the modeled while t r obs is the observed value of t r every cd was tested as the independent variable on average drainage texture t 1 km performed the best therefore it was used for every set of cds and every number of groups the mc approach aims to find the optimal set of clusters by testing a high number 100 000 of sets first the number of catchments in each cluster was defined randomly the minimum number of catchments was set to n 2 were n is the number of cds involved in the empirical equation see section 3 1 to ensure the stability of the fitted regression the maximum number of catchments were set to 61 k 1 n 2 where k is the number of clusters this way the minimum number of catchments can be selected for each cluster second the required number of catchments were selected also on a random basis this approach yields the cumulative distribution function cdf of the performance indices therefore the performance of the other clustering methods can be assessed in terms of probability even though the optimal set of clusters can be found this is the only method where ungauged catchments could not be sorted into clusters based on their cds 3 6 goodness of fit measures during the dimension reduction analysis the following goodness of fit measures were used pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse hr akaike information criteria aic fox 2016 and the sum of relative differences δt r these were calculated as 2 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 4 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 5 aic n ln rmse 2 2 n 1 6 t r i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where x i is the observed value t r obs y i is the modeled value t r mod n is the number of model parameters cds and n is the number of observations the value of r can range from 1 1 meaning perfect inverse linear and linear relationships respectively at its extremes the value of nse demonstrates the model s capability of giving a better estimation than the mean of the observed values and its value can range from to 1 if nse is in the range of 0 1 the model provides a better estimation than the observed values mean an nse value of 1 represents a perfect fit of the model the rmse value is 0 for a perfect fit and the smaller the value the better the model the value of aic can quantify the relative information loss gain of the models a higher value denotes a more efficient equation the value of δt r defines the model s estimation error in percentage relative to the observed values all measures were employed during the dimension reduction analysis while only rmse and nse were used for the cluster analysis 3 7 existing empirical equations as mentioned in section 1 the empirical equation for t r estimation dates back to 1958 in hungary wisnovszky 1958 many other countries regions developed their own empirical equations therefore a large amount of equations can be found in the literature also there are numerous studies comparing different empirical equations and assessing their performances e g azizian 2018 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 nagy et al 2016 michailidi et al 2018 perdikaris et al 2018 ravazzani et al 2019 in order to express the improvement in the estimation accuracy four existing empirical equations were applied to estimate t r we chose to use the wisnovszky salcher ventura and haktanir shezen equations the first is the most often used equation in hungary and it was derived from the salcher equation the ventura equation is also mentioned in one of the hungarian textbooks the haktanir shezen equation was chosen based on the results of a former study nagy et al 2016 the equations and their performance indices rmse and nse are presented in table 2 4 results 4 1 dimension reduction one to three cds were identified applying pca lcm and apr eq 1 was fitted using these cds in each case the model coefficients in eq 1 were estimated by ordinary least squares the model performance was assessed by executing leave one out cross validation consisting of the following steps i remove catchment j from the dataset ii estimate the coefficients of the equation using all n 1 catchments without catchment j iii apply the fitted equation to estimate the value of t r at catchment j t r mod j iv repeat steps i iii for all n catchments v calculate the goodness of fit measures r nse rmse aic δt r as a result one equation for each dimension reduction technique was selected and used afterward during the evaluation of the clustering techniques pca showed that the first three pcs explain 26 7 14 3 and 10 2 51 2 altogether of the total variance of the dataset the cds having the highest loads on the pcs are p basin perimeter h max maximum elevation and r c elongation ratio two of these cds p and h max belong to the size and relief category while r c is a shape index the cds having the highest loads on the following three pcs are map mean annual precipitation c m channel maintenance and ks 0 saturated hydraulic conductivity these cds are part of the hydro climatological indices channel network parameters and size and topography metrics respectively this underlies the efficiency of pca retaining the highest variability of the initial dataset since the resulting cds do not belong into only one or two descriptor categories the lcm method resulted in the correlation matrix of the cds and t r fig 6 the cds selected with this method are l longest flow path s slope of longest flow path and c compactness these parameters describe size relief and shape l is strongly r 0 9 correlated with sl sn a p l b and l c while s is strongly correlated with other relief metrics r r 1 r r 2 and r r m the latter is expected since their formulas are based on the ratio of the relief h and other strongly correlated cds l p l b a 1 2 c is strongly correlated with c circularity because a functional relationship exists between these two metrics namely c 1 c 2 the linear correlation matrix did not reveal any unexpected strong correlation amongst the cds it can also be seen that in some cases the correlation is not linear in nature fig 6 which underlies the need for non linear analyses such as apr the results of apr i e empirical distribution functions can be seen in fig 7 along with the performance of the other two pca and lcm dimension reduction methods for r nse rmse δt r and by the number 1 2 or 3 of cd values prescribed table 3 displays the fitted t r equations and their performance metrics for r nse rmse aic and δt r the coefficient values in the equations are the means of the values resulting from the cross validation process as expected apr provided the lowest estimation error with an rmse of 6 77 h and an nse value of 0 583 employing three cds the lcm dimension reduction method outperformed pca at every number of cds increasing the number of cds in the equations did not significantly reduce the prediction error in the case of pca in terms of probability pca and lcm identified cds performing in the upper 20 the value of nse is negative for 39 18 and 10 of the combinations when applying 1 2 and 3 cds respectively δt r varies from 34 6 to 43 8 while r changes between 0 480 and 0 764 the aic value of the best set of cds does not change considerably when increasing the number of cds from 2 to 3 the difference is more significant in the case of the lcm equations while the variation in the performance is almost negligible considering the pca equations in what follows the three parameter versions of the equations were used to make the cluster analysis results more comparable the cds of these equations see table 3 were applied subsequently during the cluster analysis when the equations coefficients were recalculated for the clusters the coefficients remained the same for the re method as displayed in table 3 since re only consists of one cluster 4 2 catchment grouping the general form of the fitted equation remained the same as in the case of the dimension reduction see eq 1 and the leave one out cross validation was again performed laaha and blöschl 2006 as follows i remove catchment j from the dataset ii update the catchment grouping for the remaining n 1 catchments iii assign catchment j to one of the groups obtained in step ii iv estimate the coefficients of the equation using all n 1 catchments apart from catchment j v apply the fitted equation to estimate the value of t r at catchment j t r mod j vi repeat step i v for all n catchments vii calculate the goodness of fit measures rmse and nse the final values of model coefficients can be assessed as the means of the model parameters calculated for the groups in total 111 equations were fitted applying the seven clustering methods and creating two and four groups to fit the empirical functions employing the cds determined by the three dimension reduction methods we created only one cluster applying the re method which yielded only 3 equations while the other 6 clustering methods result in 2 4 3 equations each so we obtain 3 6 2 4 3 111 equations the cdfs of the performance indices rmse and nse resulted from the mc method and the performance of the other clustering methods are presented in fig 8 and table 4 the cdfs flatten as the number of groups increases from two to four this is because as the number of clusters increases the number of catchments within a group decreases since the calibrated function is a power function its sensitivity to extrapolation is relatively high the model parameters are more stable when they are calibrated for a higher number of catchments the mc approach clearly shows that the performance can be improved by at least 20 finding the right groups but there is no unequivocal method that yields better results than re ra is able to find more efficient groups in some cases but does not improve the performance of the equations significantly also it cannot be assured that using drainage texture t for ra as the independent variable would lead to similar results for other catchments with different properties it is hard to create an order for the different clustering methods in terms of performance the efficiency of the different methods strongly varies with the number of clusters and cds selected using the different dimension reduction methods on average gc and km appear to give the worst results since those methods perform worse than re in every case hc and ra yield the best results while the performance of re and rt is intermediate the probability of finding a better set of groups than re representing one group is under 20 when creating two groups and it goes below 5 in the case of four groups fig 8 even the best performing ra reaches only the upper 10 of the cdf when creating two groups in table 3 we only provided the best performing set of cds but apr results in the list of best performing cd combinations the authors found that when relying on the result of apr using one cd the second best parameter the catchment width w can be used to create both two and four clusters performing in the upper 1 the optimal clusters found by the mc method and the groups created using w only are presented in fig 9 the catchment groups of the two methods differ therefore the connection between the catchments within a cluster resulting from the mc approach is not clear however the grouping based on w outperformed all other clustering methods with an nse value of 0 693 and 0 697 as well as an rmse value of 5 80 and 5 77 h when creating two and four clusters respectively 4 3 existing empirical equations the four existing empirical equations performed worse than the derived new equations in general the haktanir shezen equation performed best in comparison with the equations including one cd see tables 2 and 3 however even the equation created by using the result of pca gave slightly better results interestingly and unfortunately the most often applied wisnovszky equation gave the worst results even the salcher equation performed better from which the former was derived wisnovszky s methodology to improve the performance of the salcher equation was purely theoretical he introduced a parameter describing catchment shape which is similar to s b in fact the wisnovszky equation can be written as t c l s b 0 5 s 100 0 5 interestingly the exponent of s b 0 5 is very close to the one calibrated by the authors 0 46 however instead of l and s other cds proved to be more efficient to estimate t r the ventura equation s performance is between wisnovszky s and salcher s the nse value reaches 0 210 in the case of the haktanir shezen equation compared to that the nse value of 0 583 resulting from the apr method see table 3 using three cds without clustering is clearly a significant improvement the error of the most often used wisnovszky equation underlines the need for the new empirical equation 5 discussion and conclusions the variety of the selected cds in the different dimension reduction methods is relatively wide which underlines the need for comparative studies from a hydraulic point of view it is not surprising that l and s showed the strongest correlation with t r also these two cds are very often used in empirical and semi empirical equations nagy et al 2016 primarily when they are derived from the chezy equation such as the equation used in hungary wisnovszky 1958 another often used cd is the catchment area a however it was not selected by any of the dimension reduction methods instead p and a g were selected which are closely related to a three shape indices r c c and s b were also selected by the three dimension reduction methods applied which denotes the influence of catchment shape on response time however none of the hydro climatological and channel network parameters were selected the most exciting result appeared to be the selection of fc 0 by apr since it verifies the hydrological applicability of the 3d soil hydraulic database of europe toth et al 2017 the inverse relationship between fc 0 and t r is plausible since a lower water retention capability can lead to a higher amount of groundwater recharge therefore a higher proportion of subsurface runoff the latter can be attributed to a slower response time than that for surface runoff verifying fc 0 s influence on t r following this reasoning bfi could have been selected instead of fc 0 since its value should describe the same phenomenon however the calculated values of bfi do not necessarily represent the true values since the exact amount of base flow is unknown it was shown that pca in itself is not sufficient to select the best cds to predict a hydrologic variable even the simple and arbitrary lcm method outperforms pca especially as the number of involved parameters grows apr is computationally more expensive and requires more advanced programming skills but yields the absolute best set of parameters and the cdfs of estimation error the shift in the cdfs does not imply a significant improvement in the model performance due to increasing the number of cds involved in the calibrated equation therefore the use of 2 or 3 cds is suggested for catchment with similar climatic and geographic conditions the flattening of the cdfs in relation to the different number of groups applied clearly highlights the sensitivity of the derived equations to extrapolation in the future the applicability of fewer groups may be warranted based on the results related to the estimation of t r it is also questionable whether the use of six geographical regions is beneficial to estimate design flows in hungary general directorate of water management 2001 considering the results of apr the improvement in model performance is significant when two groups are created instead of one but applying four groups instead of two does not yield a considerable change the performance of the different clustering methods is highly variable there is no distinguishable clustering method that performs best amongst the employed dimension reduction methods and group numbers this underscores further the effect and significance of cd selection km and hc are often used for clustering and are easy to perform using the built in functions e g in matlab but they perform inconsistently ra is the only method that outperforms gc in most cases but it does not always perform better than re the authors suggest using catchment width w combined with apr to estimate t r for catchment groups this method is the most likely to provide the best results in similar climatic and geographic conditions however the thresholds for w to differentiate between clusters as presented in fig 9 a b may not yield similarly satisfactory results for a different set of catchments the authors found it surprising that from the 60 more or less complex cds w appeared to provide a solid base to create catchment groups since w is related to both catchment size and shape it is not unlikely that this result can be verified for another set of catchments as a summary we collected 60 cds for 61 hungarian catchments while calculating the characteristic observed value of t r first we compared eight different graphical definitions of t r nagy and szilágyi 2020 then we applied the method of giani et al 2021 to calculate the value of t r at the event scale in this paper we presented the outcome of a broad study involving three dimension reduction and seven clustering techniques which yielded significantly more accurate empirical equations than the ones employed in hungary however there are still many further possibilities in the research of relating t r to catchment characteristics the efficiency of other clustering methods such as bayesian networks as presented by ssegane et al 2012 and or neural networks should also be evaluated as ravazzani et al 2019 state the value of t r is only weakly driven by climatological and morphological factors two approaches could deal with this problem i evaluating calculations based on hydraulic equations as in beven 2020 or michailidi et al 2018 and ii employing a stochastic approach the difficulty with the former approach is to set a proper value for the hydraulic parameters such as roughness the latter approach means that observed values could be employed to fit a theoretical distribution function the parameters of the distribution can then be connected to catchment characteristics the authors wish to evaluate both of these approaches in the future in order to further examine and explain the variability in the observed value of t r as illustrated in fig 3 continuing the study presented in this paper this way will hopefully lead to a more detailed and accurate estimation of t r credit authorship contribution statement eszter d nagy

8120,study region 61 catchments located in hungary with drainage areas from 8 74 to 810 km2 study focus many engineering tasks require the estimation of the catchment response time t r the most frequently used t r parameters are the time of concentration and the lag time at ungauged catchments they are usually estimated by empirical equations that relate t r to catchment characteristics this paper provides a comparative study of three dimension reduction techniques and seven clustering methods for fitting empirical equations to the observed values of t r 60 catchment descriptors were calculated for each catchment then three subsets with 1 3 descriptors were extracted from the entire parameter set during the dimension reduction analysis two and four catchment groups were created during a cluster analysis by re calibrating the three equations that resulted from the dimension reduction analysis new hydrological insights for the region under study it is demonstrated that the principal component analysis can be easily outperformed by the linear correlation and the all possible regressions methods the latter yielding a root mean squared error rmse of 6 77 h when applied with three catchment descriptors the most interesting finding of the dimension reduction is that t r is strongly connected to field capacity in the region of study the performance of the clustering methods varies considerably rmse 5 05 12 03 h the best overall performance comes from the residual approach rmse 8 14 h on average it is shown that several of the methods outperform the grouping based on geographical regions however the estimation error is reduced only in a few cases when compared to the regional estimation i e one cluster method clusters created based on catchment width yields the best results resulting in rmse values of 5 80 and 5 77 h with two and four clusters respectively the comparison of the new and the existing empirical equations clearly demonstrated that the estimation of t r needs improvement in hungary while the application of more than two clusters is unwarranted for the study region abbreviations tr catchment response time tc time of concentration tl lag time tp

introduction estimating the response time of a catchment is a crucial step of many engineering tasks different time parameters need to be estimated for different purposes such as peak flow estimation modeling or flood risk environmental hazard mapping the most frequently used time parameters are the time of concentration t c the lag time t l the time to peak t p and the time to equilibrium t e mccuen et al 1987 the theoretical background of these time parameters is tangled and their calculation is still an elaborate task even though their study dates back more than 150 years recently beven 2020 highlighted the differences between t c and t e and how they became systematically mistreated in the last century moreover several definitions are used for the calculation of time parameters in the literature creating further confusion around their calculation the present work aims to provide a broader picture of the catchment response time t r in general studies focusing on time parameter estimation involve three main assessment methods that rely on i measured data ii hydraulic equations and iii empirical or semi empirical formulae measurements can be carried out using i laboratory models ii a tracer substance or iii registering rainfall and runoff data although tracer measurements provide detailed information on the runoff generation process and form the only approach that can be considered as a direct measurement of t r it can be completed only for research and not for an operational purpose pilgrim 1976 the employment of model catchments built in a laboratory suffers from the same limitations the ensuing results obtained by either of such measurements are not necessarily valid for natural catchments gaál et al 2012 the main disadvantage of applying measured time series of rainfall and runoff is the lack of a clear definition for time parameters however for catchments larger than the experimental catchment size i e a few square kilometers it is the most effective way to collect information about the true value of t r since a large number of events on numerous catchments can be processed using historical precipitation and streamflow data recently giani et al 2021 provided a new method to estimate the average value of the catchment response time using measured rainfall and runoff data the authors of this paper used this method to calculate t r on the event scale these recent developments made the estimation of t r from measured time series more straightforward and comprehensive the observed value of t r can be assessed by catchment descriptors to set up empirical equations the performance of the equations can be bolstered in two steps i selecting catchment descriptors which describe the response variable t r most efficiently and ii through the grouping of catchments the result of catchment grouping highly depends on the selection of descriptors therefore identification of the proper catchment descriptors is a crucial step there is a vast amount of parameters available in the literature ssegane et al 2012 collected 72 topographic parameters 66 climatic parameters 98 soil parameters and 15 land use land cover parameters while sanborn and bledsoe 2006 gathered 84 streamflow metrics from literature even if the set of examined parameters is reduced by hydrological reasoning at the very beginning application of a dimension reduction technique is typically required to set up a smaller parameter space the two most often used dimension reduction techniques in hydrological studies are stepwise regression analysis sra and principal component analysis pca a notable difference between the two methods is that while sra utilizes information from the response variable as it minimizes the prediction error pca would not necessarily involve the response variable ssegane et al 2012 while pca is helpful to reduce dimensions and group parameters it may lead to the removal of hydrologically significant parameters for example myronidis and ivanova 2020 applied pca to reduce the parameter space followed by employing sra to estimate design flow values as it turned out it is not guaranteed that pca would retain the most efficient parameter set in terms of design flow estimation singh et al 2009 also relied on pca to group parameters and set up a reduced parameter set they state that one parameter from each principal component pc can subsequently estimate specific hydrological processes even though this set of parameters indeed retains the largest information content from the initial parameter space regarding the variance it is not guaranteed that the selected parameters will lead to the best estimation of the chosen hydrological process ssegane et al 2012 compared sra pca and five other causal selection methods on parameter selection of known functional relationships in their study pca was outperformed by sra and two of the causal selection methods performed the best catchment grouping is a fundamental tool to transfer information from gauged catchments to ungauged sites it can provide a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that control the studied runoff characteristics groups can be categorized based on their i construction fixed or targeted to the catchment of interest and ii spatial continuity contiguous or non contiguous blöschl et al 2013 the applications of grouping methods may include the estimation of i annual runoff ii seasonal runoff flow regime iii flow duration curve iv low flow design flow values and v model parameters comprehensive studies usually focus on one application however different clustering techniques can easily lead to different results laaha and blöschl 2006 found that employing seasonality regions based on low flow exceedance yields the best result in the case of low flow estimation for flow duration curve estimation in france the visual grouping method and the regression tree rt method performed equally well sauquet and catalogne 2011 parajka et al 2005 estimated the model parameters of a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model the most successfully via a kriging approach and a donor catchment method based on similarity to the present authors best knowledge there is no literature available on grouping methods to estimate t r ravazzani et al 2019 examined the effect of catchment grouping on the performance of 24 empirical equations however their clustering approach was based on the result of flow duration curve estimation boscarello et al 2016 they found that the predictions did not improve significantly when homogeneous groups of catchments were created the broad spectrum of such findings underlines the need for a comprehensive study of clustering methods concerning the estimation of t r an added motivation of the present study is that the currently employed equation for the estimation of t c in hungary dates back to 1958 wisnovszky 1958 thus clearly requiring a revision this paper focuses on two main aspects i to find the optimal dimension reduction method and ii to identify the best catchment grouping approach along with the optimal number of groups we also focus on quantifying the pca s effectiveness as a parameter selection technique and conclude that it does not necessarily yield the best set of parameters and on assessing the improvement via comparison to existing empirical equations a further novelty of the present study is that we provide the clustering methods efficiency in terms of probability by a monte carlo approach 2 study area and data this study involves 61 small to medium sized catchments located in the carpathian basin an overview of the catchments location is provided in fig 1 while table 1 lists some important characteristics the size of the catchments ranges from 8 74 to 810 km2 while the average catchment area is 206 km2 6 5 of the catchments are larger than 500 km2 and 54 of the catchments have an area smaller than 150 km2 the proportion of forested area ranges from 3 83 to 88 7 while the impervious area is between 0 275 and 19 9 based on the copernicus land use land cover products copernicus 2020a 2020b the soil types covering the catchments are dominantly deposits such as glacial and alluvial loess and loess like tertiary and older deposits third of the catchments coincide with karst regions while volcanic rocks such as andesite rhyolite and basalt are dominant in a few 5 ones sandstone shale and phyllite are dominantly present in even fewer catchments the study covers the years from 2000 to 2017 when the annual rainfall and runoff ranged between 394 and 1377 and 21 1 642 mm respectively the region s climate is predominantly warm summer humid continental dfb based on the köppen climate classification peel et al 2007 while the aridity index i e the annual potential evaporation divided by the annual precipitation varies between 0 75 and 1 25 catchment delineation was performed by the copernicus land monitoring services eu dem v1 1 digital surface model this is a freely available dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 m in raster format copernicus 2016 three main selection criteria were applied regarding the selection of the discharge time series namely i no significant human influence on flow ii high temporal resolution of measurements and iii record availability for at least ten years similar to sauquet and catalogne 2011 the local water directorates provided high resolution 5 min discharge and precipitation time series for 61 and 17 stations respectively since not every catchment has a nearby rainfall gauging station the european centre of medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis data from the copernicus climate data store were used in addition to the gauging station data the used product is the era5 land dataset copernicus 2019 with an hourly temporal and a 0 1 x 0 1 7 5 km x 11 km spatial resolution the applicability of the ecmwf reanalysis data to response time calculation was examined separately in a previous study nagy and szilágyi 2020 in the referred study eight different graphical t r definitions were compared at the 38 catchments having both gauging station and ecmwf precipitation data we found that the ecmwf data is adequate for t r estimation especially when the centers of masses and peaks of the measured runoff and rainfall time series are used 3 methodology 3 1 overview the methodology of the study is comprised of three main steps i assembling the initial data which included calculation of the observed t r values and evaluation of the catchment descriptors cds ii reduction of the initial cd dataset into different number of cds by various dimension reduction methods and iii grouping catchments into different number of groups by selected clustering methods the first step resulted in one characteristic i e the observed value of t r for 61 watersheds each accompanied by 60 cds for each catchment the second step yielded the optimal subsets of cds by applying three dimension reduction methods lastly the most efficient combination of the number of groups and clustering method was identified through cluster analysis the general form of the fitted empirical equations throughout the study is given as 1 t r mod α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α 3 x n α n 1 where x 1 x n are the selected cds α 1 α n 1 are model coefficients while the number of selected parameters n can be 1 through 3 the overview of the workflow and the applied methods are summarized in fig 2 3 2 derivation of t r from observations the characteristic measured values of t r were calculated for each catchment applying the detrending moving average cross correlation analysis dmca following giani et al 2021 the strength of the dmca method is that it can find the timescale at which two time series are linked even when they exhibit different frequency spectra and are nonlinearly related giani et al 2021 therefore the dmca method is capable to estimate t r using the measured precipitation and discharge time series this method can determine t r values for every event resulting in a set of t r values for each catchment for the 61 examined catchments 11 646 event based values were collected altogether the number of events i e t r values per catchment ranged from 25 to 625 with a median of 117 in what follows the median of the dmca based set of values is considered as the characteristic observed value of t r for each catchment hence the empirical equations later were fitted using these values in fig 3 we present the distribution of the observed t r values by means of boxplots representing the medians the 25th and 75th percentiles and the outliers along with a map of the observed median values from fig 3 it is clear that the value of t r exhibits significant variability especially for larger catchments this can be attributed to the fact that the distribution of rainfall becomes less uniform as the catchment area increases the authors would prefer to consider t r as a stochastic value since its value is exposed to randomness e g the distribution of precipitation over a catchment however in this study we only aim to estimate the median of the measured set of t r values this median can be interpreted as the t r of a typical flood 3 3 catchment descriptors since the aim is to connect the observed value of t r to cds altogether 60 parameters were collected and classified into five main categories i size and relief ii topography iii channel network iv shape indices and v hydro climatological indices the list of parameters and their definitions can be found in appendix a1 a5 including name abbreviation and measurement unit along with a reference a selection of cds is presented in fig 4 3 4 dimension reduction the initial number of cds had to be reduced to a smaller parameter set which could subsequently be used to construct and fit empirical equations to the observed values of t r first the method of all possible regressions apr were evaluated which means the evaluation of all possible parameter combinations by eq 1 see above in section 3 1 the number of combinations grows from 60 to 1830 and 35990 as the number of cds increases from one to two and three respectively this method s output should agree with the result of sra in moderately well behaved problems hocking 1976 although gugel 1972 reported 37 improvement in the results when apr was compared to sra the efficiency of other dimension reduction methods can be assessed in probability terms since apr yields the probability distribution function of the performance index as a second dimension reduction technique pca was employed and one parameter with the highest load on the first three pcs was kept the third method was simple but arbitrary to a certain degree the parameter sets were obtained from the linear correlation matrix lcm between the response variable t r and the entire cd set parameters expressing the highest correlation with t r but producing a weak correlation pearson correlation coefficient r 0 7 among each other were selected according to previous studies on empirical t r estimation equations azizian 2018 fang et al 2008 grimaldi et al 2012 nagy et al 2016 ravazzani et al 2019 most equations include one to three parameters additionally the selection of four or more cds would have increased the computation time of the apr method significantly since the number of possible cd combinations grows an order of magnitude with each additional cd therefore with the help of these dimension reduction methods apr pca and lcm one to three parameters were selected out of the 60 cds 3 5 catchment grouping altogether seven clustering methods were compared regional estimation re geographic clustering gc k means clustering km hierarchical clustering hc regression tree rt method residual approach ra and monte carlo mc approach re means no clustering or one cluster its inclusion is meant to show the efficiency of applying different numbers of clusters in the following the array of estimated t r values comprises the dependent or response variable while the independent variables are the selected cds using the three dimension reduction methods apr pca and lcm the above clustering methods are widely used here we only present a short description of each method gc is based on the regions defined in the most recent design estimation manual published by the general directorate of water management general directorate of water management 2001 the manual differentiates six regions as well distinguishable runoff regions in hungary but it gives no further explanation on the creation of such units it is therefore assumed that the regions were created with the help of geological and hydrological i e catchment boundaries referred to as geographical units the six regions presented in the manual were later merged into four and two separate groups the groups were created with consideration to the geological and climatological properties of the carpathian basin the original and the merged groups are presented in fig 5 km was performed by lloyd s algorithm lloyd 1982 which does not include the response variable and consists of the following steps i choosing the initial cluster centers or centroids randomly from the data points ii computing point to cluster centroid distances of all residual points to each centroid based on the chosen distance metric iii assigning each point to the cluster with the closest centroid iv computing the average of the points in each cluster to obtain new centroid locations v repeating steps ii iv until cluster assignments stop changing vi repeating i v until the number of replicates is reached the number of replicates defines the number of repetitions of the clustering procedure starting from the random selection of initial cluster centers this method minimizes the total variance of clusters which is the sum of the deviation of each data point from its cluster s center by the chosen distance metric the latter meant the sample correlation between the data points treated as sequences of values when subtracted from unity each centroid is the component wise mean of the points in that cluster after centering and normalizing those points to zero mean and unity standard deviation the algorithm has two parameters the maximum number of iterations and the number of replicates which were set to 10 000 and 100 respectively in order to ensure a global optimum the main disadvantage of this method is that the number of clusters must be defined before applying the algorithm more detailed information on km is given by everitt et al 2011 in chapters 5 4 1 5 4 3 hc in contrast does not require the number of clusters defined since it builds a dendrogram based on data point distances everitt et al 2011 the dataset can be split at the desired level into clusters using the dendrogram the correlation method was chosen again as the distance metric this algorithm maximizes the distances between the clusters its advantage is the visualization of the clusters since outliers can be easily spotted on the dendrogram the rt method creates a decision tree with the desired number of nodes and bins breiman et al 1984 the bins represent the clusters ensuring their maximum homogeneity this method s advantage is that it needs no parametrization and is sensitive to outliers laaha and blöschl 2006 however it results in one discrete value of the response variable for each cluster the ra involves applying the rt method using the residuals t r res of the response variable s regional estimation hence the residual becomes the response variable and one cd is used as the independent variable to define the clusters bins the residual is simply calculated as t r res t r mod t r obs where t r mod is the modeled while t r obs is the observed value of t r every cd was tested as the independent variable on average drainage texture t 1 km performed the best therefore it was used for every set of cds and every number of groups the mc approach aims to find the optimal set of clusters by testing a high number 100 000 of sets first the number of catchments in each cluster was defined randomly the minimum number of catchments was set to n 2 were n is the number of cds involved in the empirical equation see section 3 1 to ensure the stability of the fitted regression the maximum number of catchments were set to 61 k 1 n 2 where k is the number of clusters this way the minimum number of catchments can be selected for each cluster second the required number of catchments were selected also on a random basis this approach yields the cumulative distribution function cdf of the performance indices therefore the performance of the other clustering methods can be assessed in terms of probability even though the optimal set of clusters can be found this is the only method where ungauged catchments could not be sorted into clusters based on their cds 3 6 goodness of fit measures during the dimension reduction analysis the following goodness of fit measures were used pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse hr akaike information criteria aic fox 2016 and the sum of relative differences δt r these were calculated as 2 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 4 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 5 aic n ln rmse 2 2 n 1 6 t r i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where x i is the observed value t r obs y i is the modeled value t r mod n is the number of model parameters cds and n is the number of observations the value of r can range from 1 1 meaning perfect inverse linear and linear relationships respectively at its extremes the value of nse demonstrates the model s capability of giving a better estimation than the mean of the observed values and its value can range from to 1 if nse is in the range of 0 1 the model provides a better estimation than the observed values mean an nse value of 1 represents a perfect fit of the model the rmse value is 0 for a perfect fit and the smaller the value the better the model the value of aic can quantify the relative information loss gain of the models a higher value denotes a more efficient equation the value of δt r defines the model s estimation error in percentage relative to the observed values all measures were employed during the dimension reduction analysis while only rmse and nse were used for the cluster analysis 3 7 existing empirical equations as mentioned in section 1 the empirical equation for t r estimation dates back to 1958 in hungary wisnovszky 1958 many other countries regions developed their own empirical equations therefore a large amount of equations can be found in the literature also there are numerous studies comparing different empirical equations and assessing their performances e g azizian 2018 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 nagy et al 2016 michailidi et al 2018 perdikaris et al 2018 ravazzani et al 2019 in order to express the improvement in the estimation accuracy four existing empirical equations were applied to estimate t r we chose to use the wisnovszky salcher ventura and haktanir shezen equations the first is the most often used equation in hungary and it was derived from the salcher equation the ventura equation is also mentioned in one of the hungarian textbooks the haktanir shezen equation was chosen based on the results of a former study nagy et al 2016 the equations and their performance indices rmse and nse are presented in table 2 4 results 4 1 dimension reduction one to three cds were identified applying pca lcm and apr eq 1 was fitted using these cds in each case the model coefficients in eq 1 were estimated by ordinary least squares the model performance was assessed by executing leave one out cross validation consisting of the following steps i remove catchment j from the dataset ii estimate the coefficients of the equation using all n 1 catchments without catchment j iii apply the fitted equation to estimate the value of t r at catchment j t r mod j iv repeat steps i iii for all n catchments v calculate the goodness of fit measures r nse rmse aic δt r as a result one equation for each dimension reduction technique was selected and used afterward during the evaluation of the clustering techniques pca showed that the first three pcs explain 26 7 14 3 and 10 2 51 2 altogether of the total variance of the dataset the cds having the highest loads on the pcs are p basin perimeter h max maximum elevation and r c elongation ratio two of these cds p and h max belong to the size and relief category while r c is a shape index the cds having the highest loads on the following three pcs are map mean annual precipitation c m channel maintenance and ks 0 saturated hydraulic conductivity these cds are part of the hydro climatological indices channel network parameters and size and topography metrics respectively this underlies the efficiency of pca retaining the highest variability of the initial dataset since the resulting cds do not belong into only one or two descriptor categories the lcm method resulted in the correlation matrix of the cds and t r fig 6 the cds selected with this method are l longest flow path s slope of longest flow path and c compactness these parameters describe size relief and shape l is strongly r 0 9 correlated with sl sn a p l b and l c while s is strongly correlated with other relief metrics r r 1 r r 2 and r r m the latter is expected since their formulas are based on the ratio of the relief h and other strongly correlated cds l p l b a 1 2 c is strongly correlated with c circularity because a functional relationship exists between these two metrics namely c 1 c 2 the linear correlation matrix did not reveal any unexpected strong correlation amongst the cds it can also be seen that in some cases the correlation is not linear in nature fig 6 which underlies the need for non linear analyses such as apr the results of apr i e empirical distribution functions can be seen in fig 7 along with the performance of the other two pca and lcm dimension reduction methods for r nse rmse δt r and by the number 1 2 or 3 of cd values prescribed table 3 displays the fitted t r equations and their performance metrics for r nse rmse aic and δt r the coefficient values in the equations are the means of the values resulting from the cross validation process as expected apr provided the lowest estimation error with an rmse of 6 77 h and an nse value of 0 583 employing three cds the lcm dimension reduction method outperformed pca at every number of cds increasing the number of cds in the equations did not significantly reduce the prediction error in the case of pca in terms of probability pca and lcm identified cds performing in the upper 20 the value of nse is negative for 39 18 and 10 of the combinations when applying 1 2 and 3 cds respectively δt r varies from 34 6 to 43 8 while r changes between 0 480 and 0 764 the aic value of the best set of cds does not change considerably when increasing the number of cds from 2 to 3 the difference is more significant in the case of the lcm equations while the variation in the performance is almost negligible considering the pca equations in what follows the three parameter versions of the equations were used to make the cluster analysis results more comparable the cds of these equations see table 3 were applied subsequently during the cluster analysis when the equations coefficients were recalculated for the clusters the coefficients remained the same for the re method as displayed in table 3 since re only consists of one cluster 4 2 catchment grouping the general form of the fitted equation remained the same as in the case of the dimension reduction see eq 1 and the leave one out cross validation was again performed laaha and blöschl 2006 as follows i remove catchment j from the dataset ii update the catchment grouping for the remaining n 1 catchments iii assign catchment j to one of the groups obtained in step ii iv estimate the coefficients of the equation using all n 1 catchments apart from catchment j v apply the fitted equation to estimate the value of t r at catchment j t r mod j vi repeat step i v for all n catchments vii calculate the goodness of fit measures rmse and nse the final values of model coefficients can be assessed as the means of the model parameters calculated for the groups in total 111 equations were fitted applying the seven clustering methods and creating two and four groups to fit the empirical functions employing the cds determined by the three dimension reduction methods we created only one cluster applying the re method which yielded only 3 equations while the other 6 clustering methods result in 2 4 3 equations each so we obtain 3 6 2 4 3 111 equations the cdfs of the performance indices rmse and nse resulted from the mc method and the performance of the other clustering methods are presented in fig 8 and table 4 the cdfs flatten as the number of groups increases from two to four this is because as the number of clusters increases the number of catchments within a group decreases since the calibrated function is a power function its sensitivity to extrapolation is relatively high the model parameters are more stable when they are calibrated for a higher number of catchments the mc approach clearly shows that the performance can be improved by at least 20 finding the right groups but there is no unequivocal method that yields better results than re ra is able to find more efficient groups in some cases but does not improve the performance of the equations significantly also it cannot be assured that using drainage texture t for ra as the independent variable would lead to similar results for other catchments with different properties it is hard to create an order for the different clustering methods in terms of performance the efficiency of the different methods strongly varies with the number of clusters and cds selected using the different dimension reduction methods on average gc and km appear to give the worst results since those methods perform worse than re in every case hc and ra yield the best results while the performance of re and rt is intermediate the probability of finding a better set of groups than re representing one group is under 20 when creating two groups and it goes below 5 in the case of four groups fig 8 even the best performing ra reaches only the upper 10 of the cdf when creating two groups in table 3 we only provided the best performing set of cds but apr results in the list of best performing cd combinations the authors found that when relying on the result of apr using one cd the second best parameter the catchment width w can be used to create both two and four clusters performing in the upper 1 the optimal clusters found by the mc method and the groups created using w only are presented in fig 9 the catchment groups of the two methods differ therefore the connection between the catchments within a cluster resulting from the mc approach is not clear however the grouping based on w outperformed all other clustering methods with an nse value of 0 693 and 0 697 as well as an rmse value of 5 80 and 5 77 h when creating two and four clusters respectively 4 3 existing empirical equations the four existing empirical equations performed worse than the derived new equations in general the haktanir shezen equation performed best in comparison with the equations including one cd see tables 2 and 3 however even the equation created by using the result of pca gave slightly better results interestingly and unfortunately the most often applied wisnovszky equation gave the worst results even the salcher equation performed better from which the former was derived wisnovszky s methodology to improve the performance of the salcher equation was purely theoretical he introduced a parameter describing catchment shape which is similar to s b in fact the wisnovszky equation can be written as t c l s b 0 5 s 100 0 5 interestingly the exponent of s b 0 5 is very close to the one calibrated by the authors 0 46 however instead of l and s other cds proved to be more efficient to estimate t r the ventura equation s performance is between wisnovszky s and salcher s the nse value reaches 0 210 in the case of the haktanir shezen equation compared to that the nse value of 0 583 resulting from the apr method see table 3 using three cds without clustering is clearly a significant improvement the error of the most often used wisnovszky equation underlines the need for the new empirical equation 5 discussion and conclusions the variety of the selected cds in the different dimension reduction methods is relatively wide which underlines the need for comparative studies from a hydraulic point of view it is not surprising that l and s showed the strongest correlation with t r also these two cds are very often used in empirical and semi empirical equations nagy et al 2016 primarily when they are derived from the chezy equation such as the equation used in hungary wisnovszky 1958 another often used cd is the catchment area a however it was not selected by any of the dimension reduction methods instead p and a g were selected which are closely related to a three shape indices r c c and s b were also selected by the three dimension reduction methods applied which denotes the influence of catchment shape on response time however none of the hydro climatological and channel network parameters were selected the most exciting result appeared to be the selection of fc 0 by apr since it verifies the hydrological applicability of the 3d soil hydraulic database of europe toth et al 2017 the inverse relationship between fc 0 and t r is plausible since a lower water retention capability can lead to a higher amount of groundwater recharge therefore a higher proportion of subsurface runoff the latter can be attributed to a slower response time than that for surface runoff verifying fc 0 s influence on t r following this reasoning bfi could have been selected instead of fc 0 since its value should describe the same phenomenon however the calculated values of bfi do not necessarily represent the true values since the exact amount of base flow is unknown it was shown that pca in itself is not sufficient to select the best cds to predict a hydrologic variable even the simple and arbitrary lcm method outperforms pca especially as the number of involved parameters grows apr is computationally more expensive and requires more advanced programming skills but yields the absolute best set of parameters and the cdfs of estimation error the shift in the cdfs does not imply a significant improvement in the model performance due to increasing the number of cds involved in the calibrated equation therefore the use of 2 or 3 cds is suggested for catchment with similar climatic and geographic conditions the flattening of the cdfs in relation to the different number of groups applied clearly highlights the sensitivity of the derived equations to extrapolation in the future the applicability of fewer groups may be warranted based on the results related to the estimation of t r it is also questionable whether the use of six geographical regions is beneficial to estimate design flows in hungary general directorate of water management 2001 considering the results of apr the improvement in model performance is significant when two groups are created instead of one but applying four groups instead of two does not yield a considerable change the performance of the different clustering methods is highly variable there is no distinguishable clustering method that performs best amongst the employed dimension reduction methods and group numbers this underscores further the effect and significance of cd selection km and hc are often used for clustering and are easy to perform using the built in functions e g in matlab but they perform inconsistently ra is the only method that outperforms gc in most cases but it does not always perform better than re the authors suggest using catchment width w combined with apr to estimate t r for catchment groups this method is the most likely to provide the best results in similar climatic and geographic conditions however the thresholds for w to differentiate between clusters as presented in fig 9 a b may not yield similarly satisfactory results for a different set of catchments the authors found it surprising that from the 60 more or less complex cds w appeared to provide a solid base to create catchment groups since w is related to both catchment size and shape it is not unlikely that this result can be verified for another set of catchments as a summary we collected 60 cds for 61 hungarian catchments while calculating the characteristic observed value of t r first we compared eight different graphical definitions of t r nagy and szilágyi 2020 then we applied the method of giani et al 2021 to calculate the value of t r at the event scale in this paper we presented the outcome of a broad study involving three dimension reduction and seven clustering techniques which yielded significantly more accurate empirical equations than the ones employed in hungary however there are still many further possibilities in the research of relating t r to catchment characteristics the efficiency of other clustering methods such as bayesian networks as presented by ssegane et al 2012 and or neural networks should also be evaluated as ravazzani et al 2019 state the value of t r is only weakly driven by climatological and morphological factors two approaches could deal with this problem i evaluating calculations based on hydraulic equations as in beven 2020 or michailidi et al 2018 and ii employing a stochastic approach the difficulty with the former approach is to set a proper value for the hydraulic parameters such as roughness the latter approach means that observed values could be employed to fit a theoretical distribution function the parameters of the distribution can then be connected to catchment characteristics the authors wish to evaluate both of these approaches in the future in order to further examine and explain the variability in the observed value of t r as illustrated in fig 3 continuing the study presented in this paper this way will hopefully lead to a more detailed and accurate estimation of t r credit authorship contribution statement eszter d nagy

8121,study region catchments wölzerbach raab styria austria study focus the study was carried out to investigate the fitness for purpose of the high resolution austrian national climate datasets öks15 in hydrological applications provided as a standard for climate impact studies in austria in 2016 the potential of the öks15 data for hydrological impact studies has not previously been assessed to fill this research gap we evaluated the öks15 datasets for the recent climate period 1961 2005 to determine their suitability for hydrological analyses hydro meteorological indicators of the öks15 datasets as well as of the data used to obtain them by bias correcting and downscaling the euro cordex models were assessed at different spatio temporal scales and compared to the raw euro cordex data the hydrological model wasim was driven with the different datasets to generate the hydrological simulations used for validation against long term observations new hydrological insights for the region hydro meteorological indicators obtained from öks15 models are comparable to observations and associated with less uncertainty than the raw euro cordex data we thus consider the öks15 dataset basically appropriate for hydrological impact studies however despite bias correction some biases in the öks15 data remain and differences in timing magnitude and spatial characteristics lead to deviations in hydrological indicators at different scales keywords öks15 climate datasets bias correction hydrological impacts hydrological modeling 1 introduction regional climate model rcm projections provide essential information for hydrological climate change impact assessments these are commonly used as input in hydrological models e g pastén zapata et al 2020 rössler et al 2019 smiatek and kunstmann 2019 willkofer et al 2018 however the application of climate hydrology modelling chains specifically for smaller sized basins 100 km2 remains challenging for this reason such an application has been subject to numerous studies smiatek and kunstmann 2019 reszler et al 2018 olsson et al 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2010 among others maraun et al 2010 identified major gaps between dynamic climate models and the end users needs the poor representation of heavy localized convective precipitation and the spatial precipitation distribution in these models as well as problems in the correct reproduction of sub daily rainfall are particularly challenging aspects for hydrologic applications liersch et al 2018 posed a valid question when they asked if climate model simulations are the right fuel to drive hydrological models they showed that bias correction may enhance the validity of climate simulations for driving hydrological models but it can also deteriorate hydrological extremes they concluded that it might be reasonable to select a climate model subset instead of full ensembles in a regional context hakala et al 2018 confirmed the importance of bias correcting rcms driven by general circulation models gcms which improved discharge simulations in most cases in their study they proposed using hydrological models to rank gcm rcm simulations i e simulations from rcms forced by gcms according to their performance of discharge simulations before applying bias correction which would allow the user to evaluate their output in a process oriented framework although a good performance in the past does not guarantee a robust model performance in the future mendlik and gobiet 2016 huang et al 2015 reifen and toumi 2009 users must assess the fitness for purpose of climate and hydrological model data to meet stakeholders increasing demands for robust information about water availability and flood risk in austria the öks15 study austrian national climate datasets study chimani et al 2016 provided high resolution gcm rcm simulations for researchers and practitioners it was also carried out to implement a robust climate database and thus enable intervention measures and climate change adaptation strategies to achieve this goal the high resolution öks15 simulations were derived by downscaling and bias correcting projections from the euro cordex ensemble jacob et al 2014 for additional information regarding the euro cordex climate modelling initiative including numerous studies that have evaluated the euro cordex data in various settings we refer to the overview article of jacob et al 2020 the approach of the öks15 project followed a general idea of several similar projects that are being conducted to generate and provide national reference climate projections for climate change impact assessment these projects include ch2018 ch2018 2018 in switzerland ukcp18 lowe and bernie 2018 in the united kingdom and the gridded 1 km x 1 km climate and hydrological projections wong et al 2016 in norway in order to evaluate the added value for hydrology in switzerland rössler et al 2019 presented a scheme to compare two swiss climate scenario datasets ch2011 ch2011 2011 and ch2018 ch2018 2018 which are based on different climate model chains and postprocessing methods they analyzed the hydrological consequences of the different postprocessing procedures e g delta change approach quantile mapping weather generator the authors identified an added value for quantile mapping and particularly for extremes compared to averages and emphasized the benefit of using numerous realizations from a weather generator in this paper we argue that the climate scenario data that is initially available for hydrological impact research in austria can be effectively compared with data from other regions despite apparent differences in national climate projections e g from different reference datasets bias correction methods underlying model chains however as in other regions worldwide austrian researchers are still uncertain how best to use such datasets in hydrological impact studies to generate robust hydrological findings e g useful for climate adaptation in particular the spatial and temporal scales at which the climate input data provide robust hydrological information is still uncertain to address this gap we explored the potential of the austrian öks15 dataset for hydrological climate impact assessment using it as exemplary study for other regions two different catchments alpine pre alpine were defined as case study regions we applied the following sequence of data analyses we quantified the uncertainty of the meteorological dataset air temperature and precipitation that was used to construct the öks15 dataset by bias correcting and downscaling the raw euro cordex gcm rcm data using data inter comparison statistics such as mean absolute error bias and correlation coefficient we then compared the uncertainty associated with these observational data with that of the bias corrected öks15 and the raw euro cordex dataset respectively we applied the hydrological model wasim to perform discharge simulations for all meteorological input data observational and climate model data next we evaluated the robustness of the simulated hydrological output for the individual input datasets by using selected hydro meteorological indicators finally we condensed our results in order to enable their transfer to other regions and to guide the use of öks15 and similar datasets in but not limited to hydrological impact studies 2 study areas data and methods 2 1 study areas in this study we examined two hydrologically diverse basins an alpine and a pre alpine catchment located in the federal state of styria in southeastern austria styria is located in a transition zone between the alpine and the mediterranean climate regions an area characterized by specific weather patterns and related precipitation distribution due to the interaction among cyclones approaching from the west northwest and the south the warm and dry southeastern parts of styria experienced a temperature increase of near 0 7 c per decade from 1971 to 2016 hohmann et al 2018 kabas et al 2011 and thus are considered as particularly sensitive to climate change the case study catchments fig 1 differ in size orographic complexity climatic setting data availability hydro economic vulnerability and hydrological regimes this makes them ideal contrasting examples of small catchments within the greater alpine region 2 1 1 wölzerbach catchment the wölzerbach a tributary of the mur is a medium sized 227 km2 mountainous catchment located in the niedere tauern range of the central eastern alps it covers an altitudinal range of more than 1700 m from 740 m a s l at the stream gauge in the southeast to the highest peak in the northwestern part of the catchment at 2475 m a s l the wölzerbach basin is mainly covered by forest 48 alpine dwarf shrub heath and grasslands 25 as well as pastures and rock ribbed mountain tops the northern parts of the catchment are characterized by a steep mountainous topography the geology is mainly dominated by mica schist and gneiss with some enclosures of limestone dolomite and amphibolite the three main tributaries cut into highly erodible quaternary unconsolidated sediments making them vulnerable to torrential floods that carry huge amounts of bedload due to its elevation range snow accumulation and snow melt play a relevant role in the catchment hydrology major precipitation events can mainly be attributed to convective summer precipitation mean precipitation sums in the wölzerbach catchment range from around 1800 700 mm following the north south elevation gradient with snow melt as the main driver the wölzerbach is characterized by a moderate nival discharge regime with a peak in may c f mader et al 1996 2 1 2 raab catchment the raab being a typical southeastern pre alpine river flows from the eastern most alpine ridges toward the southeast through hungary and ends as a tributary of the danube the austrian part of the catchment covers an area of about 1000 km2 with the outlet at an altitude of 230 m a s l and the highest elevations at 1545 m a s l in the northern part of the area the mean annual precipitation sums range from around 1050 mm in the north to around 750 mm in the southeast agriculture 42 and forest areas 40 dominate the land use of the catchment loam represents the main soil texture due to its location in a transition zone between the sensitive alpine and mediterranean climate regions the catchment of the styrian raab has been a key focus of climate change studies in austria schürz et al 2019 piringer et al 2019 hohmann et al 2018 the raab exhibits a pluvio nival discharge regime type c f mader et al 1996 in which the discharge is relatively evenly distributed over the year 2 2 data several different hydro meteorological datasets have been incorporated in this study table 1 station temperature and precipitation data have been provided by the austrian central institution for meteorology and geodynamics zamg and the austrian hydrographic service ahyd whereby the latter also provided discharge data in the alpine wölzerbach catchment a total of 18 temperature and 22 precipitation stations were used as direct data sources and as the basis for the spatial internal interpolation by the hydrological model section 2 3 2 in the raab catchment measurements were available from 27 temperature and 70 precipitation stations stations which underwent a relocation were considered as separate stations in the analysis and interpolation procedure in order to compare station values and gridpoint values potential elevation differences which are particularly prevalent in mountainous parts of the study region were corrected by applying a simple annual average lapse rate approach 0 5 k per 100 m c f prettenthaler et al 2010 in addition to the station data we used gridded observational datasets for precipitation gpard1 hofstätter et al 2015 and temperature spartacus hiebl and frei 2016 which are based on some but not all of the station data examined within this study gridded high resolution climate datasets were provided by the öks15 project leuprecht et al 2017 the öks15 dataset is based on the results of 13 rcms 12 5 km grid spacing by downscaling and bias correcting simulations from the euro cordex ensemble jacob et al 2014 to a 1 km grid over the entire region of austria bias correction with scaled distribution mapping switanek et al 2017 was performed for the period 1961 2005 with reference datasets gpard1 and spartacus data from only 1971 and on are available however in five out of the thirteen öks15 datasets all of which are combinations with the regional climate model rca a detailed description of the öks15 data is given in chimani et al 2016 and an overview of the gcm rcm combinations is listed in the appendix table a 1 in addition to the bias corrected öks15 data we also investigated the raw euro cordex model data regridded bilinearly to the 1 km x 1 km grid of the öks15 data an overview of the datasets and parameters used in our study is given in table 1 2 3 methodology fig 2 provides an overview of the applied methodological steps to find out how the different input data affect hydrological simulations we first analyzed the meteorological station grid öks15 and raw data step 1 in the context of our study we define uncertainty as differences between the different meteorological input datasets 1a grid to station uncertainties associated with the interpolation method the inclusion exclusion of different stations and measurement errors associated with those 1b grid to öks15 uncertainty related to the bias correction 1c grid to raw uncertainty related to the gcm rcm climate model realization we then calibrated the hydrological model with one of the observed datasets station in the raab catchment grid in the wölzerbach catchment see section 2 3 2 and forced the calibrated model with the remaining other dataset grid station öks15 and raw step 2 in step 3 we analyzed the influence of this input uncertainty on discharge and simulated hydro meteorological indicators the uncertainty associated with the hydrological model is assessed within the station to observed comparison grid to station uncertainty is originating in uncertainty of station interpolation comparisons station grid to öks15 assess the performance of the model chain using bias corrected input whereas comparisons station grid to raw analyze the uncertainty originating in the climate models analyzing differences of öks15 and raw finally allows to assess the difference between uncorrected and corrected model input this methodology is similar to the one described in hakala et al 2019 who give a detailed introduction to hydrological modeling of climate change impacts including a discussion on the different sources of uncertainty 2 3 1 evaluation methods and criteria we examine the meteorological station grid öks15 and raw data at the gridpoint and catchment levels to evaluate station data at the gridpoint level we contrast station time series with the collocated data matching the station location in addition to visually examining the distribution functions of the identified differences i e of gridpoint minus station statistics and their temporal evolution we inter compare cumulative distribution functions cdfs and statistics derived from these that serve to indicate performance for the variables of interest in particular mean absolute error mae bias bias percent bias pbias and pearson s correlation coefficient corr respectively serve as the main evaluation indicators to acknowledge the fact that the nominal 1 km spatial data sampling method used for the gridded datasets does not need to correspond to the actually resolved spatial patterns skillful scale or to the effective resolution of the station network on average approximately 10 km inter station distance we apply the same evaluation procedure for temperature and precipitation at the sub catchment and catchment scales in this context it should be noted that chimani et al 2019 recommend a meaningful interpretation of spatial precipitation patterns for a resolution coarser than 40 km x 40 km particularly for extreme precipitation over short time scales to validate the hydrological variables a similar approach in terms of efficiency criteria is chosen discharges simulated by wasim using the different input datasets are compared with each other and contrasted with the observed discharges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog c f krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used for evaluation in addition mean annual hydrographs and long term flow duration curves fdcs are assessed which describe the variability of the flow and thereby provide information about the water regime c f ridolfi et al 2020 table 2 presents an overview of the different spatial scales at which the evaluation of meteorological and hydrological variables is performed finally we investigate the impact of the various input datasets on simulated hydro climatic conditions by analyzing different hydro meteorological indicators table 3 which have been suggested as relevant by a variety of studies with a hydrological impact focus ekström et al 2018 we perform our evaluation for different climate reference periods i e 1961 2005 1971 2000 or where observational records are shorter for the longest possible period 2 3 2 hydrological simulations with the wasim model in order to quantify impacts from the use of the öks15 data on simulated hydrological variables and to extend the discharge timeseries beyond observations we used the richards 10 02 04 version of the hydrological model wasim schulla 2017 the spatially distributed deterministic model incorporates physical based as well as conceptual approaches and is widely used in climate change studies e g rössler et al 2019 smiatek and kunstmann 2019 willkofer et al 2018 gädeke et al 2014 the wasim model was previously applied in the raab region by hohmann et al 2018 2021 and the same model setting of hohmann et al 2018 is used in this study except for minor modifications due to an altered time frame a slightly changed digital elevation model to assure conformity with the grid input data and data availability for both catchments we chose a reasonably simple model setup with temperature index snowmelt and hamon evapotranspiration hamon 1961 a daily time step and a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km in accordance with data availability to perform precipitation interpolation in the station runs we used inverse distance weighting idw in the pre alpine raab and a combination of idw 70 and altitude dependent regression 30 in the alpine wölzerbach temperature was interpolated using a combination of idw 75 and nearest neighbor combined with a constant lapse rate 25 in the raab and nearest neighbor combined with a constant lapse rate 0 5 k per 100 m c f prettenthaler et al 2010 in the wölzerbach catchment snow accumulation is modelled by wasim using a threshold temperature t r s at which 50 of the precipitation falls as snow and a transitional range t trans within which both liquid and solid precipitation occur the values of t r s 2 1 c t trans 0 35 c were determined from calibration for the wölzerbach and these values were set to t r s 0 75 c t trans 1 c by default for the raab catchment we chose two different calibration validation strategies a combination of manual calibration and the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1994 was used for both catchments to choose optimal parameter sets by maximizing the linear combination of the ordinary and the logarithmic nse c f moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 section 2 3 2 both measures were weighted with 0 5 using a split sample approach appendix table a 2 although the model was calibrated using meteorological input from station data internally interpolated in wasim for the raab catchment the model was calibrated for the wölzerbach catchment by using the externally interpolated grid datasets the performance based on the respective alternative input datasets i e those not used in the calibration procedure then serves as indicator for the model robustness and reveals differences strengths and weaknesses in the various input datasets 3 results the hydrological models for the raab and the wölzerbach catchments were driven by observational uncorrected and bias corrected climate model data to assess the utility of the high resolution öks15 datasets in hydrological applications therefore the uncertainties in the forcing data from climate models were compared with the uncertainties in the observational data our results are presented separately for atmospheric drivers structured by separate comparisons at point and catchment scale and hydrological characteristics 3 1 uncertainty in atmospheric driving data observational data vs model based datasets 3 1 1 temperature data consistency at gridpoint level we found an average mae of 1 3 c between the station and grid daily temperature values for gridpoints in the alpine catchment for the period 1961 2005 with a positive bias for grid temperatures observed in 12 out of 17 locations statistics for individual gridpoints stations are found in the appendix table a 3 elevation differences between station and grid pixel height are particularly pronounced in the partly steep wölzerbach the grid dataset can be used to capture inversions which the simple annual lapse rate correction section 2 2 does not consider thus temperatures in autumn and winter often exhibit larger differences between station and grid data in the alpine catchment the smaller overall mae of 0 5 c for the pre alpine raab catchment is believed to be an effect of the gentler orography and the higher number of stations used in the creation of the grid dataset more than half of the stations show a negative bias appendix table a 3 but this remains predominantly small average bias 0 1 c whereas the majority of raw models underestimate temperature the cumulative distribution functions of the bias corrected öks15 models align well with the function of the grid temperatures for almost all the gridpoint locations models and temperature ranges data not shown fig 3 compares cdfs of modelled and observed temperatures at one location in each catchment öks15 historic cdfs solid lines agree closely with the corresponding grid distribution functions the two stations demonstrate locations with over represented colder than observed temperature ranges in the grid dataset i e a negative temperature bias although future scenarios are not the subject of this paper we would like to point out that the temperature bias affects simulated future temperature distributions the simulated average daily temperatures of the two stations for the near future i e 2021 2050 at station stolzalpe and 2021 2040 at station lassnitzhöhe remain below those of the recent reference period when comparing the annual cycles of temperatures between öks15 and grid data not shown correspondence is best for the reference period that is also used for the bias correction i e 1961 2005 for periods shorter than that the level of agreement decreases this results in temperature differences of up to 0 5 c for long term monthly averages for specific models and months as described in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 temperature data consistency at the catchment level table 4 compares the seasonal mean temperatures of grid station raw and bias corrected öks15 models with each other for two different periods positive values indicate warmer grid temperatures the grid temperatures are higher than station temperatures for most locations in the wölzerbach catchment resulting in a catchment wide overestimation of about 1 c for the period of 1961 2005 the raw models generally underestimate temperatures in autumn winter and spring in the wölzerbach catchment as compared to the bias corrected öks15 models this effect is less pronounced for the raab catchment where only the minority of the raw models overestimates summer and winter temperatures the rather high level of agreement seen between grid and öks15 data at the gridpoint level is also reflected at the catchment level the differences between the raw multi model median and grid data for the wölzerbach catchment are much larger than those for the raab catchment both catchments show the lowest level of agreement in spring one caveat is that for reference periods different from the one used for bias correction both the multi model spread and differences between the öks15 multi model median and grid data increase however these differences remain below the range of temperature differences between the grid and station datasets overestimation by grid temperatures as discussed previously this finding is valid for all seasons and both catchments except for the winter season in the pre alpine raab catchment table 4 3 1 3 precipitation data consistency at gridpoint level precipitation is overestimated by the grid data 70 of all station gridpoint locations see appendix table a 4 this is more pronounced for the wölzerbach catchment where the average pbias is 14 period 1961 2005 for gridpoints located in the center of the catchment corresponding to stations not included in the creation of the grid dataset with a correlation of 0 92 between the station and grid timeseries the mae is smaller equal to 2 0 mm day the raab catchment shows a more similar picture mae of 0 7 mm day corr 0 93 but displays a smaller station average pbias of 3 over the same period of 1961 2005 interestingly the station introducing the largest positive bias in the raab catchment as well as the two stations introducing the largest negative bias in the wölzerbach catchment are the ones on the opposite sides of the catchment delineating mountain ridge we argue that the different precipitation climate north of the mountain ridge explains this finding in general datasets from the zamg stations correspond more closely with the grid dataset although not all of the stations were used for the creation of grid data than stations from ahyd differences between station and grid data are largest in summer when the major precipitation events heavy convective precipitation usually occur in the study catchments 3 1 4 precipitation data consistency at the catchment level while the grid exceeds station precipitation in all months and sub catchments over the period of 1961 2005 more apparent for larger monthly precipitation for the alpine wölzerbach catchment as would be expected from the station level results the findings are more spatially and temporally diverse for the raab catchment fig 4 and appendix fig a 1 an overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation in the upper part of the raab catchment opposes the underestimation of precipitation seen in the middle part for both the reference period 1961 2005 and the period of 1971 2000 in the lower part grid precipitation underestimates precipitation in the long term and slightly overestimates it for the period of 1971 2000 this is a result of the accrual and discontinuation of individual stations as well as the partially alternating positive and negative biases for individual years interestingly these spatial and temporal features of under overestimation result in an almost perfect fit between grid and station precipitation for the entire raab catchment in the period of 1961 2005 as shown in fig 4 the bias corrected öks15 precipitation also agrees closely with that of the grid data which is also justified by the use of the grid data in the creation of the öks15 data however almost all raw models serving as the base data for the bias correction of öks15 significantly overestimate precipitation in both catchments except for the summer period comparing the bias corrected öks15 model data appendix table a 1 with their reference grid dataset for the reference period of 1961 2005 fig 5 upper panel the largest and generally most positive differences are found in the second half of the year july to december however the majority of the bias corrected models tend to underestimate precipitation for most months it is noteworthy that the hadgem cclm shows a much weaker seasonality than all other models in the warm period of the year and only about half of the precipitation observed in july and august chimani et al 2019 also identified and described this model behavior i e the underestimation of precipitation particularly in eastern austria together with the overestimation of cyclone frequency when considering the annual cycle of precipitation in a climate period other than the reference period used for bias correction monthly differences between the grid and the öks15 runs increase up to around 18 in august in the alpine catchment a consistent evaluation of all öks15 models however fails because data from 1971 and on is available in only five out of thirteen models 3 1 5 analysis under conditions of wet and dry spells while extended periods of consecutive dry days i e dry spells may cause droughts and water shortages long sequences of days with precipitation above 1 mm i e wet spells can influence the flood risk an accurate representation of wet and dry spells therefore is important in hydrological impact studies in the long term mean 1961 2005 the catchment average monthly dry spell duration in the wölzerbach is highest for the station run appendix figure a 2 the grid and öks15 model medians align generally well with noticeable differences in october and november when the average dry spell length is longer for the grid run as seen for the overall precipitation the wet spell durations of the grid run surpass the station run in the alpine catchment in all months the grid and öks15 model median align slightly less closely for the wet than for the dry spell duration as compared to the grid run öks15 models show a shorter wet spell duration in spring and a longer one in the summer season the raw model median displays a weaker annual cycle in terms of the dry spell duration with the lowest differences from the öks15 median seen in summer median raw wet spell lengths are overestimated in all months in the raab catchment the average dry spell length of station and grid runs align more closely than those of grid and öks15 runs where we again find the largest differences in october and november interestingly the wet spell duration in the raab catchment is similar for all analyzed input variants the largest differences between the grid and öks15 model median are found in late spring and summer and a greater deviation between raw and the bias corrected model median is observed in may 3 1 6 analysis under snowfall conditions snow accumulation and snow melt play an important role for runoff and specifically in the alpine wölzerbach catchment to assess the combined effect of temperature and precipitation we analyzed the snowfall fraction i e the percentage of snowfall on total precipitation for the mountainous wölzerbach catchment the station and grid data agree well for snowfall fractions of 31 and 32 respectively 1970 2000 catchment average the öks15 model median however adds up to only 26 of the snowfall fraction except for hadgem cclm which shows a precipitation deficit in summer the snowfall fraction is underestimated by all öks15 models for all sub catchments not shown raw models highly overestimate the snowfall fraction with a median of 46 ranging from 40 to 60 in the raab catchment the observation based datasets station and grid both give a catchment average snowfall fraction of 9 and 10 respectively reference period 1971 2000 the median öks15 model gives a share of 7 of snow with respect to total precipitation the raw model median yields a similar result with a snowfall fraction of 12 as seen with the precipitation results the raw models have a huge spread of 7 22 of snowfall fraction with respect to total precipitation 3 2 uncertainty in simulated discharge and hydrological performance 3 2 1 consistency of discharge simulations in addition to the uncertainty in the atmospheric forcing data uncertainty in the simulated discharges also results from hydrological model uncertainty a discussion on how much of the uncertainty comes from either source goes beyond the scope of this study but we consider the bulk effect for discharge and hydrological indicators that have been identified as relevant in hydrology in order to identify the effect of alternative observational input data station and grid and reference periods on simulated discharge table 5 lists discharge performance indicators for those input data and periods of analysis grid data were used for the wölzerbach and station data were used for the raab to calibrate wasim and both models show a satisfactory representation of observed discharges nse 0 6 nselog 0 65 pbias 20 for all sub catchments considered the performance increases for the wölzerbach catchment when the grid calibrated model is used with station data as the driving input data table 5 which can be explained by including stations not considered in the creation of the grid dataset however the timeseries of discharge was rather short for the wölzerbach from the hydrological year 2004 and on regarding the raab catchment the model performance in the northern upper and middle sub catchments decreases considerably when the grid input is used as driving data with nse values of 0 4 and 0 46 and pbias of more than 33 and 25 respectively in the validation period although the model still performed well in the calibration period this appears to be mainly a result of significant precipitation overestimation by grid data in the northernmost sub catchments whereas overall differences between station and grid precipitation at the pixel level are larger for the calibration period the over and underestimations counterbalance each other at the sub catchment level leading to similar discharges and efficiencies decreasing performance in the validation period for the northern part of the area is increasingly compensated in the lower parts of the raab valley leaving the lowest gauge neumarkt almost unaffected long term runs table 5 show a picture similar to that of the shorter periods although the efficiency recovers a bit for the two upper sub catchments st ruprecht takern ii whereby the precipitation over and underestimation between the grid and station inputs become more balanced due to the rather short period of measured discharge in the wölzerbach catchment we considered only simulated discharges to construct fdcs at the gauge niederwölz fig 6 overestimation in the grid precipitation as compared to station data shown in section 3 1 4 results in an overestimation of the respective modelled discharges which particularly affects medium to low discharges 50th to 100th percentile when using the raw data as the driving data wasim tends to vastly overestimate high flows bias correction improves the simulation of overall flow characteristics considerably and apart from the high end extremes the öks15 runs align quite well with the grid long term fdcs hadgem model results are slightly more disparate than the other gcm rcm combinations compared to observations the long term discharge simulations for the feldbach gauge in the raab catchment have a positive bias i e an overestimation for the high to medium 5th to 50th percentile daily average discharges for both the station and the grid runs while the low flows 75th to are 99th percentile are underestimated exceptions to this are the extreme ends exceedance probability 0 01 and 0 995 the result of the analysis using fdcs for öks15 indicates rather good agreement with the grid run for high to medium discharges however these deviate considerably in some cases for low flows fig 6 right panel the improvement from bias correcting the raw models is evident again the unrealistic behavior of the hadgem cclm model data and the related fdcs must be pointed out for the raab catchment the discharge in all probability segments simulated by hadgem cclm are more than 25 lower than those predicted by the other models and the median to low flows are 40 lower than those seen in the grid run the shape of the fdc suggests a higher variance in the daily discharge for hadgem cclm and reflects the model s vast underestimation of precipitation in the summer season if we examine these datasets at higher temporal resolution the monthly fdcs not shown already shown considerably pointing out some difficulties with runoff timing even if the öks15 models are generally able to reproduce the overall flow regimes in both catchments fig 7 the overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation results in corresponding discharge overestimation for the wölzerbach furthermore the discharge peak is shifted from may in the station run to june in the grid run this can at least partly be attributed to temperature differences between the two datasets warm bias of grid as compared to station temperatures described in section 3 1 1 which affect snow accumulation and melt keeping in mind that the wölzerbach model was calibrated with the warmer grid dataset this leads due to higher melt and accumulation temperatures to earlier snow accumulation as well as melt prevailing later in the year for the station run however these temperature effects are merged with the overestimation of grid precipitation resulting in a delayed higher discharge peak for the grid run results for the raab catchment are similar even if the impact of the slight temperature underestimation grid compared to station and precipitation overestimation remains lower than for the alpine wölzerbach generally the pluvio méridional regime of the pre alpine raab catchment is reproduced well by both input datasets but the spring and autumn peaks are overestimated by the models as compared to the observations interestingly öks15 driven models result in a clear peak in september which is neither simulated by the other forcing data nor is visible in the observations this could indicate the higher relevance of precipitation associated with cyclones coming from the south comparing the inter model spread of öks15 driven wasim simulations between raab and wölzerbach clearly indicates the higher spread for the raab catchment this finding may be related to the impact of snow melt on runoff which in turn is highly related to temperature and thus associated with a lower spread in the alpine catchment as seen for the wölzerbach the hadgem cclm vastly underestimates the discharge for the raab catchment particularly in the second half of the year when comparing different periods of time the small positive bias of discharge between station and grid runs in the reference period of 1961 2005 not shown becomes larger for the period 1971 2000 climate normal 3 2 2 hydrological performance indicators in order to inspect results beyond mean annual hydrographs and probabilities several discharge indicators were computed to show the characteristics of flow magnitude extremes and variability again this is presented for different input datasets and periods of time table 6 to acknowledge the fact that rca model runs only start in 1971 the analysis was also carried out with a smaller ensemble excluding gcm rcm combinations with rca as the rcm c f appendix table a 1 furthermore we analyzed a reduced ensemble excluding the peculiar hadgem cclm realization we find a diverse picture for the different input data indicators and catchments in the wölzerbach the overestimation of grid precipitation is reflected in the magnitude related discharge indicators with the station simulations yielding the respectively lowest values however for low flow indicators differences between the other input data grid öks15 raw are of the same order of magnitude in both catchments also in the pre alpine raab catchment the highest discharges hig01 do not differ considerably between the input datasets including raw for the other high flow indicators hig25 and hig95 in both catchments hig01 in the alpine catchment table 3 the deviation between the raw model median is more distinct and particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment whereas differences in other input data remain comparable as far as the number of days in summer which are in the top fifth percentile annual flows s95 are concerned different input datasets show a greater divergence for the number of days in summer with flows less than 10 of the mean annual flow s10 differences between öks15 and their reference grid data are higher than for other indicators in both catchments the raw models yield the lowest values zero in the wölzerbach reflecting precipitation overestimation in the uncorrected data whereas days with high flows s95 and peakfrequency table 3 as indicated by the raw models are inflated in the wölzerbach they are underrepresented in the raab catchment however when considering observations as the baseline raab catchment differences among the different input data are again of the same order of magnitude particularly for low flow indicators the reduced ensembles leave the multi model median barely unaffected and do not stand out in our analyses 4 discussion departures of climate model simulations from observations for an identical past represent a significant source of uncertainty in scenario studies and especially for precipitation the bias correction method attempts to minimize this problem with empirical methods obviously bias corrected data can only be as good as the reference data used for bias correction and these data are also prone to errors e g gampe et al 2019 prein and gobiet 2017 iizumi et al 2017 the question of how credible the bias corrected data are for the future remains to be addressed this credibility generally increases when simulations with a hydrological model forced by uncorrected model data can already represent certain basic hydrological mechanisms 4 1 uncertainty in input data our overall line of reasoning here is that if the uncertainties inherent in the observations are as large as or similar to the differences between the observational and the model data a useful application in hydrological scenario modelling should be possible however with regard to climate impact studies a significantly large climate signal is needed to move beyond the zone of uncertainty in our case the differences between the two observational datasets as well as between the model datasets öks15 and raw and observations are discussed in the following against this methodical background differences between station and grid meteorological input data at the gridpoint level we found a positive bias for grid temperatures in the alpine catchment and an overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation for two thirds both catchments of the locations the differences are particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment resulting in a grid temperature overestimation of about 1 c and precipitation overestimation of almost 20 at the catchment level calibrating the hydrological model wasim with grid data in the wölzerbach the performance increases when station input is used however driving station calibrated wasim raab with the grid dataset leads to a dramatic decline in model performance in the validation period yet differences in the pre alpine catchment spatially and temporally compensate each other leaving the simulated discharge at the most downstream outlet relatively unaffected in the long term whereas precipitation overestimation leads to continuous discharge overestimation in the alpine catchment overall timing i e inter seasonal variation of hydrological variables differs to a much lesser extent than magnitude volume differences between öks15 and grid meteorological input data seasonal cycles of wet spells and discharges of the öks15 models diverge from those of the grid input even if annual cycles of precipitation and temperature of both input data align well exception rcms driven by the hadgem gcm in the alpine catchment öks15 models with hadgem cclm as single exception significantly underestimate the snowfall fraction which is probably related to errors in the combined occurrence of temperature and precipitation for snowfall this translates to some overestimation of discharge in winter and an underestimation of the meltwater peak in may the lack of overlap between the analysis period and bias correction reference period results in deviations in the temperature and precipitation distributions their impact on hydrological quantities however is equivocal significantly shorter periods e g 10 years of analysis lead to higher discrepancies due to natural variability differences between bias corrected öks15 and raw euro cordex input data unlike the bias corrected simulations the temperatures obtained from raw models are generally underestimated while precipitation is overestimated this leads to higher snowfall fractions from the raw model input although this effect is present in both catchments it is particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment whereas discharges simulated with the raw model input are overestimated in the alpine catchment the highest discharges seen in the pre alpine catchment do not differ considerably regardless of the input data used differences in low flow discharges are of the same order of magnitude for all inputs in both catchments fig 8 compares these differences as uncertainty in the observed data with the uncertainties from the model data öks15 raw for different meteorological and hydrological variables this gives a clear picture of the robustness of the model simulations as a relative position to the uncertainty in the observed data indicators located close to the 1 1 line similar differences please note the logarithmic scaling or below the 1 1 line differences lower than those from observations indicate lower levels of uncertainty and a higher level of model robustness the differences in the temperature and precipitation indicators are generally higher in the wölzerbach catchment for both observations and models öks15 as well as raw and are presumably related to the complex orography of the catchment whereas our analyses identify the bias corrected öks15 models as suitable robust for most of the indicators the uncorrected raw models are associated with high levels of uncertainty as indicated by their location high above the 1 1 line interestingly some exceptions exist in the wölzerbach winter temperatures and summer precipitation as well as low flow indicators are reasonably captured by the raw models in the raab catchment the raw models simulate summer temperatures autumn temperatures and precipitation as well as low flows to a moderate degree thus in less complex settings and particularly when studying low flows using the raw input data might still be an interesting option 4 2 remaining uncertainty in bias corrected input data the bias corrected öks15 models do not fully capture the timing of discharge characteristics leading to slight mismatches in the simulation of past mean annual hydrographs furthermore even when the bias correction improved precipitation simulations in the alpine catchment due to precipitation overestimation in the reference data a percent bias of almost 20 persisted as seen with the snowfall fraction the univariate bias correction does not account for inter variable dependencies and the often used approach of evaluating climate model variables independently fosters overlooking disparities arising from it differences in the long term monthly average dry spell duration could further explain the temporal mismatches to some extent this highlights the fact that an adequate representation of temperature and precipitation cycles and individual flood drought related meteorological indicators of climate models do not necessarily translate into an accurate representation of average runoff conditions which might be specifically problematic when investigating possible changes in the timing of discharge in the future potential remaining biases as found in this study should be cross checked in advance and considered when interpreting results from impact assessment model chains they should be particularly acknowledged in topographically complex regions where also the grid data was created with sparse station density a related discussion on limitations of bias correction due to restricted location representativeness can be found in maraun and widmann 2015 problems arising from bias correcting climate variables independently have been acknowledged by other researchers e g meyer et al 2019 chen et al 2018 and the issue of hydrologically relevant remaining biases after bias correction was pointed out in the works of addor and seibert 2014 hakala et al 2018 and maraun et al 2019 for a general discussion on the benefits and limitations of bias correction we refer to the works of ehret et al 2012 and maraun 2016 4 3 ensemble member selection and cautionary remarks our results do not allow us to give a uniform recommendation for preferred models to use because most of the models perform better in one region than in the other in terms of discharge characteristics however cnrm cm5 cclm mpi esm cclm and ec earth cclm performed reasonably well for the period of 1961 2005 in both alpine and pre alpine catchments hadgem cclm is not able to capture the annual precipitation cycle especially in the southeastern pre alpine catchment underestimating precipitation by up to 50 however this scarcely affected multi model median discharge indicators in our study the cnrm cm5 aladin simulations did not stand out either in our analyses but were found to be erroneous at a later stage after the öks15 dataset had already been released chimani et al 2019 furthermore since the original publication of the euro cordex data errors regarding an unrealistic accumulation of snow also referred to as the snow tower issue have been discovered for the gcm rcm combinations ec earth racmo and ec earth hirham euro cordex errata 2021 frei et al 2018 showed that this unrealistic accumulation of snow can dampen the climate change signal of temperature at the locations involved we found that this issue only affects high altitude grid cells in the western part of austria and thus determined it as not relevant for our study region however projections concerned should be applied with great caution and removed from the analyzed ensemble where necessary as suggested by hakala et al 2018 both future and past periods should be considered in the decision on omitting individual gcm rcm realizations 4 4 selection of the analysis period although the results for ensemble median simulated discharges and indicators for the shorter reference period 1971 2000 did not stand out in our analyses the potential lack of overlap between the analysis period and the bias correction reference period of 45 years 1961 2005 should not be neglected discharge time series dating back to 1971 or even 1961 are rare particularly for small and medium sized catchments furthermore since five out of thirteen öks15 models are available only from 1971 and on the user can either choose a shorter analysis period the full ensemble available for 1971 2005 and accept some of the resulting discrepancies or use a reduced ensemble the idea of establishing a default database that considers the longest records possible neglects the fact that for many applications observational data of 40 years or longer simply do not exist consequently user oriented evaluation studies like the one presented here can provide further valuable insights for the climate modelling community 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the value of the high resolution climate dataset öks15 for hydrological impact studies to achieve this purpose impacts on hydrological indicators were analyzed along different spatial scales and sources of uncertainty using an alpine and a pre alpine catchment in southeastern austria as examples clearly some of our results are specific to the austrian öks15 dataset but others are common for similar high resolution climate model data in general in order to quantify the effect of uncertainty propagation from meteorological driving data to driven hydrologic indicators we used the hydrological model wasim we found that the observed hydro climatic conditions could generally be reproduced effectively when driving wasim with bias corrected climate model data contrary to the uncertainties noted when raw euro cordex models are used uncertainties arising from the use of the bias corrected öks15 are comparable to those in the observed data for most of the hydrological indicators analyzed taking due account of the limitations and assumptions inherent in bias corrected data this robustness affirms that the öks15 data are basically fit for purpose for hydrological applications our results particularly support the specific recommendation to use öks15 data in long term analyses of mean hydrological conditions at the same time hydrologically relevant limitations of the öks15 dataset do exist even for the bias corrected data some inconsistencies in timing magnitude and location persist partially leading to deviations in hydrological signatures we found that hadgem cclm was particularly striking and not able to capture the annual precipitation cycle thus this model should be applied with great caution especially for the southeast of austria however multi model median discharge indicators analyzed within this study were scarcely affected with regard to the precipitation overestimation in the reference dataset a bias of almost 20 remains for discharge in the alpine catchment nonetheless as the temperature and precipitation biases of uncorrected raw models are particularly high in complex terrain the bias correction adds value in these settings still the uncorrected raw models perform reasonably well with respect to some features leaving them as practicable options for impact studies e g related to low flows as a further cautionary remark we note that the univariate bias correction method which does not consider the combined occurrence of temperature and precipitation affects the representation of snow related processes this should be acknowledged by end users but might be of less interest in pre alpine not snow dominated settings another finding is that differences in the bias correction reference period and some of the models temporal coverage also impact meteorological signatures and confine the recommended use of öks15 data to basins with a sufficiently extensive gauging history which allows users to run an initial check for remaining biases we acknowledge uncertainties and limitations of our hydrological model setup and parameters which we tried to circumvent by partly confining our analysis to the model world comparing grid data to wasim internal station interpolation as a reference should not suggest that the latter represents the truth measurement structural parameter and interpolation uncertainty are inherent in them as well for example no precipitation correction was carried out to avoid obscuring the comparison between the grid and station data even if undercatch can be considerable particularly in the alpine catchment the fact that input differences from the lack of overlap between the analysis period and the bias correction reference period do not clearly propagate to discharges as well as mismatches in high flow indicators point to limitations in the models used which need to be addressed in future work uncertainty in the hydrological models also affect low flows for which our results indicate a good agreement among all datasets vidal et al 2016 for example found diverging low flow responses from different hydrological models in a changing climate ideally the multi model approach should thus not only be considered using an ensemble of climate models but applying multiple hydrological models e g horton et al 2021 particularly with a view to the simulation of snow related processes in a warmer future climate e g troin et al 2016 the share of the hydrological models part in overall climate change impact uncertainty has been discussed in dobler et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 and addor et al 2014 as a further constraint of our approach we note that vegetation and land use changes which have had considerable regionally occurring impacts over the past decades were not included in our models together with the consideration of changes due to other human impacts land use changes should be addressed in subsequent studies particularly when focusing on future climate change e g sivapalan and blöschl 2015 finally focusing on just two example catchments represents another limitation of our analysis and the results might somewhat differ when using the öks15 data for other regions in austria the approach taken in this study however is considered an important step in the interdisciplinary community effort to further develop climate analysis and simulation based high resolution hydrological research in austria we believe that our findings help to improve the usage of climate model datasets for hydrological applications in general while identifying the öks15 dataset generally fit for purpose in hydrological applications describing its strengths and limitations will also help users of öks15 and corresponding datasets to design and interpret hydrological

8121,study region catchments wölzerbach raab styria austria study focus the study was carried out to investigate the fitness for purpose of the high resolution austrian national climate datasets öks15 in hydrological applications provided as a standard for climate impact studies in austria in 2016 the potential of the öks15 data for hydrological impact studies has not previously been assessed to fill this research gap we evaluated the öks15 datasets for the recent climate period 1961 2005 to determine their suitability for hydrological analyses hydro meteorological indicators of the öks15 datasets as well as of the data used to obtain them by bias correcting and downscaling the euro cordex models were assessed at different spatio temporal scales and compared to the raw euro cordex data the hydrological model wasim was driven with the different datasets to generate the hydrological simulations used for validation against long term observations new hydrological insights for the region hydro meteorological indicators obtained from öks15 models are comparable to observations and associated with less uncertainty than the raw euro cordex data we thus consider the öks15 dataset basically appropriate for hydrological impact studies however despite bias correction some biases in the öks15 data remain and differences in timing magnitude and spatial characteristics lead to deviations in hydrological indicators at different scales keywords öks15 climate datasets bias correction hydrological impacts hydrological modeling 1 introduction regional climate model rcm projections provide essential information for hydrological climate change impact assessments these are commonly used as input in hydrological models e g pastén zapata et al 2020 rössler et al 2019 smiatek and kunstmann 2019 willkofer et al 2018 however the application of climate hydrology modelling chains specifically for smaller sized basins 100 km2 remains challenging for this reason such an application has been subject to numerous studies smiatek and kunstmann 2019 reszler et al 2018 olsson et al 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2010 among others maraun et al 2010 identified major gaps between dynamic climate models and the end users needs the poor representation of heavy localized convective precipitation and the spatial precipitation distribution in these models as well as problems in the correct reproduction of sub daily rainfall are particularly challenging aspects for hydrologic applications liersch et al 2018 posed a valid question when they asked if climate model simulations are the right fuel to drive hydrological models they showed that bias correction may enhance the validity of climate simulations for driving hydrological models but it can also deteriorate hydrological extremes they concluded that it might be reasonable to select a climate model subset instead of full ensembles in a regional context hakala et al 2018 confirmed the importance of bias correcting rcms driven by general circulation models gcms which improved discharge simulations in most cases in their study they proposed using hydrological models to rank gcm rcm simulations i e simulations from rcms forced by gcms according to their performance of discharge simulations before applying bias correction which would allow the user to evaluate their output in a process oriented framework although a good performance in the past does not guarantee a robust model performance in the future mendlik and gobiet 2016 huang et al 2015 reifen and toumi 2009 users must assess the fitness for purpose of climate and hydrological model data to meet stakeholders increasing demands for robust information about water availability and flood risk in austria the öks15 study austrian national climate datasets study chimani et al 2016 provided high resolution gcm rcm simulations for researchers and practitioners it was also carried out to implement a robust climate database and thus enable intervention measures and climate change adaptation strategies to achieve this goal the high resolution öks15 simulations were derived by downscaling and bias correcting projections from the euro cordex ensemble jacob et al 2014 for additional information regarding the euro cordex climate modelling initiative including numerous studies that have evaluated the euro cordex data in various settings we refer to the overview article of jacob et al 2020 the approach of the öks15 project followed a general idea of several similar projects that are being conducted to generate and provide national reference climate projections for climate change impact assessment these projects include ch2018 ch2018 2018 in switzerland ukcp18 lowe and bernie 2018 in the united kingdom and the gridded 1 km x 1 km climate and hydrological projections wong et al 2016 in norway in order to evaluate the added value for hydrology in switzerland rössler et al 2019 presented a scheme to compare two swiss climate scenario datasets ch2011 ch2011 2011 and ch2018 ch2018 2018 which are based on different climate model chains and postprocessing methods they analyzed the hydrological consequences of the different postprocessing procedures e g delta change approach quantile mapping weather generator the authors identified an added value for quantile mapping and particularly for extremes compared to averages and emphasized the benefit of using numerous realizations from a weather generator in this paper we argue that the climate scenario data that is initially available for hydrological impact research in austria can be effectively compared with data from other regions despite apparent differences in national climate projections e g from different reference datasets bias correction methods underlying model chains however as in other regions worldwide austrian researchers are still uncertain how best to use such datasets in hydrological impact studies to generate robust hydrological findings e g useful for climate adaptation in particular the spatial and temporal scales at which the climate input data provide robust hydrological information is still uncertain to address this gap we explored the potential of the austrian öks15 dataset for hydrological climate impact assessment using it as exemplary study for other regions two different catchments alpine pre alpine were defined as case study regions we applied the following sequence of data analyses we quantified the uncertainty of the meteorological dataset air temperature and precipitation that was used to construct the öks15 dataset by bias correcting and downscaling the raw euro cordex gcm rcm data using data inter comparison statistics such as mean absolute error bias and correlation coefficient we then compared the uncertainty associated with these observational data with that of the bias corrected öks15 and the raw euro cordex dataset respectively we applied the hydrological model wasim to perform discharge simulations for all meteorological input data observational and climate model data next we evaluated the robustness of the simulated hydrological output for the individual input datasets by using selected hydro meteorological indicators finally we condensed our results in order to enable their transfer to other regions and to guide the use of öks15 and similar datasets in but not limited to hydrological impact studies 2 study areas data and methods 2 1 study areas in this study we examined two hydrologically diverse basins an alpine and a pre alpine catchment located in the federal state of styria in southeastern austria styria is located in a transition zone between the alpine and the mediterranean climate regions an area characterized by specific weather patterns and related precipitation distribution due to the interaction among cyclones approaching from the west northwest and the south the warm and dry southeastern parts of styria experienced a temperature increase of near 0 7 c per decade from 1971 to 2016 hohmann et al 2018 kabas et al 2011 and thus are considered as particularly sensitive to climate change the case study catchments fig 1 differ in size orographic complexity climatic setting data availability hydro economic vulnerability and hydrological regimes this makes them ideal contrasting examples of small catchments within the greater alpine region 2 1 1 wölzerbach catchment the wölzerbach a tributary of the mur is a medium sized 227 km2 mountainous catchment located in the niedere tauern range of the central eastern alps it covers an altitudinal range of more than 1700 m from 740 m a s l at the stream gauge in the southeast to the highest peak in the northwestern part of the catchment at 2475 m a s l the wölzerbach basin is mainly covered by forest 48 alpine dwarf shrub heath and grasslands 25 as well as pastures and rock ribbed mountain tops the northern parts of the catchment are characterized by a steep mountainous topography the geology is mainly dominated by mica schist and gneiss with some enclosures of limestone dolomite and amphibolite the three main tributaries cut into highly erodible quaternary unconsolidated sediments making them vulnerable to torrential floods that carry huge amounts of bedload due to its elevation range snow accumulation and snow melt play a relevant role in the catchment hydrology major precipitation events can mainly be attributed to convective summer precipitation mean precipitation sums in the wölzerbach catchment range from around 1800 700 mm following the north south elevation gradient with snow melt as the main driver the wölzerbach is characterized by a moderate nival discharge regime with a peak in may c f mader et al 1996 2 1 2 raab catchment the raab being a typical southeastern pre alpine river flows from the eastern most alpine ridges toward the southeast through hungary and ends as a tributary of the danube the austrian part of the catchment covers an area of about 1000 km2 with the outlet at an altitude of 230 m a s l and the highest elevations at 1545 m a s l in the northern part of the area the mean annual precipitation sums range from around 1050 mm in the north to around 750 mm in the southeast agriculture 42 and forest areas 40 dominate the land use of the catchment loam represents the main soil texture due to its location in a transition zone between the sensitive alpine and mediterranean climate regions the catchment of the styrian raab has been a key focus of climate change studies in austria schürz et al 2019 piringer et al 2019 hohmann et al 2018 the raab exhibits a pluvio nival discharge regime type c f mader et al 1996 in which the discharge is relatively evenly distributed over the year 2 2 data several different hydro meteorological datasets have been incorporated in this study table 1 station temperature and precipitation data have been provided by the austrian central institution for meteorology and geodynamics zamg and the austrian hydrographic service ahyd whereby the latter also provided discharge data in the alpine wölzerbach catchment a total of 18 temperature and 22 precipitation stations were used as direct data sources and as the basis for the spatial internal interpolation by the hydrological model section 2 3 2 in the raab catchment measurements were available from 27 temperature and 70 precipitation stations stations which underwent a relocation were considered as separate stations in the analysis and interpolation procedure in order to compare station values and gridpoint values potential elevation differences which are particularly prevalent in mountainous parts of the study region were corrected by applying a simple annual average lapse rate approach 0 5 k per 100 m c f prettenthaler et al 2010 in addition to the station data we used gridded observational datasets for precipitation gpard1 hofstätter et al 2015 and temperature spartacus hiebl and frei 2016 which are based on some but not all of the station data examined within this study gridded high resolution climate datasets were provided by the öks15 project leuprecht et al 2017 the öks15 dataset is based on the results of 13 rcms 12 5 km grid spacing by downscaling and bias correcting simulations from the euro cordex ensemble jacob et al 2014 to a 1 km grid over the entire region of austria bias correction with scaled distribution mapping switanek et al 2017 was performed for the period 1961 2005 with reference datasets gpard1 and spartacus data from only 1971 and on are available however in five out of the thirteen öks15 datasets all of which are combinations with the regional climate model rca a detailed description of the öks15 data is given in chimani et al 2016 and an overview of the gcm rcm combinations is listed in the appendix table a 1 in addition to the bias corrected öks15 data we also investigated the raw euro cordex model data regridded bilinearly to the 1 km x 1 km grid of the öks15 data an overview of the datasets and parameters used in our study is given in table 1 2 3 methodology fig 2 provides an overview of the applied methodological steps to find out how the different input data affect hydrological simulations we first analyzed the meteorological station grid öks15 and raw data step 1 in the context of our study we define uncertainty as differences between the different meteorological input datasets 1a grid to station uncertainties associated with the interpolation method the inclusion exclusion of different stations and measurement errors associated with those 1b grid to öks15 uncertainty related to the bias correction 1c grid to raw uncertainty related to the gcm rcm climate model realization we then calibrated the hydrological model with one of the observed datasets station in the raab catchment grid in the wölzerbach catchment see section 2 3 2 and forced the calibrated model with the remaining other dataset grid station öks15 and raw step 2 in step 3 we analyzed the influence of this input uncertainty on discharge and simulated hydro meteorological indicators the uncertainty associated with the hydrological model is assessed within the station to observed comparison grid to station uncertainty is originating in uncertainty of station interpolation comparisons station grid to öks15 assess the performance of the model chain using bias corrected input whereas comparisons station grid to raw analyze the uncertainty originating in the climate models analyzing differences of öks15 and raw finally allows to assess the difference between uncorrected and corrected model input this methodology is similar to the one described in hakala et al 2019 who give a detailed introduction to hydrological modeling of climate change impacts including a discussion on the different sources of uncertainty 2 3 1 evaluation methods and criteria we examine the meteorological station grid öks15 and raw data at the gridpoint and catchment levels to evaluate station data at the gridpoint level we contrast station time series with the collocated data matching the station location in addition to visually examining the distribution functions of the identified differences i e of gridpoint minus station statistics and their temporal evolution we inter compare cumulative distribution functions cdfs and statistics derived from these that serve to indicate performance for the variables of interest in particular mean absolute error mae bias bias percent bias pbias and pearson s correlation coefficient corr respectively serve as the main evaluation indicators to acknowledge the fact that the nominal 1 km spatial data sampling method used for the gridded datasets does not need to correspond to the actually resolved spatial patterns skillful scale or to the effective resolution of the station network on average approximately 10 km inter station distance we apply the same evaluation procedure for temperature and precipitation at the sub catchment and catchment scales in this context it should be noted that chimani et al 2019 recommend a meaningful interpretation of spatial precipitation patterns for a resolution coarser than 40 km x 40 km particularly for extreme precipitation over short time scales to validate the hydrological variables a similar approach in terms of efficiency criteria is chosen discharges simulated by wasim using the different input datasets are compared with each other and contrasted with the observed discharges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nselog c f krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used for evaluation in addition mean annual hydrographs and long term flow duration curves fdcs are assessed which describe the variability of the flow and thereby provide information about the water regime c f ridolfi et al 2020 table 2 presents an overview of the different spatial scales at which the evaluation of meteorological and hydrological variables is performed finally we investigate the impact of the various input datasets on simulated hydro climatic conditions by analyzing different hydro meteorological indicators table 3 which have been suggested as relevant by a variety of studies with a hydrological impact focus ekström et al 2018 we perform our evaluation for different climate reference periods i e 1961 2005 1971 2000 or where observational records are shorter for the longest possible period 2 3 2 hydrological simulations with the wasim model in order to quantify impacts from the use of the öks15 data on simulated hydrological variables and to extend the discharge timeseries beyond observations we used the richards 10 02 04 version of the hydrological model wasim schulla 2017 the spatially distributed deterministic model incorporates physical based as well as conceptual approaches and is widely used in climate change studies e g rössler et al 2019 smiatek and kunstmann 2019 willkofer et al 2018 gädeke et al 2014 the wasim model was previously applied in the raab region by hohmann et al 2018 2021 and the same model setting of hohmann et al 2018 is used in this study except for minor modifications due to an altered time frame a slightly changed digital elevation model to assure conformity with the grid input data and data availability for both catchments we chose a reasonably simple model setup with temperature index snowmelt and hamon evapotranspiration hamon 1961 a daily time step and a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km in accordance with data availability to perform precipitation interpolation in the station runs we used inverse distance weighting idw in the pre alpine raab and a combination of idw 70 and altitude dependent regression 30 in the alpine wölzerbach temperature was interpolated using a combination of idw 75 and nearest neighbor combined with a constant lapse rate 25 in the raab and nearest neighbor combined with a constant lapse rate 0 5 k per 100 m c f prettenthaler et al 2010 in the wölzerbach catchment snow accumulation is modelled by wasim using a threshold temperature t r s at which 50 of the precipitation falls as snow and a transitional range t trans within which both liquid and solid precipitation occur the values of t r s 2 1 c t trans 0 35 c were determined from calibration for the wölzerbach and these values were set to t r s 0 75 c t trans 1 c by default for the raab catchment we chose two different calibration validation strategies a combination of manual calibration and the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1994 was used for both catchments to choose optimal parameter sets by maximizing the linear combination of the ordinary and the logarithmic nse c f moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 section 2 3 2 both measures were weighted with 0 5 using a split sample approach appendix table a 2 although the model was calibrated using meteorological input from station data internally interpolated in wasim for the raab catchment the model was calibrated for the wölzerbach catchment by using the externally interpolated grid datasets the performance based on the respective alternative input datasets i e those not used in the calibration procedure then serves as indicator for the model robustness and reveals differences strengths and weaknesses in the various input datasets 3 results the hydrological models for the raab and the wölzerbach catchments were driven by observational uncorrected and bias corrected climate model data to assess the utility of the high resolution öks15 datasets in hydrological applications therefore the uncertainties in the forcing data from climate models were compared with the uncertainties in the observational data our results are presented separately for atmospheric drivers structured by separate comparisons at point and catchment scale and hydrological characteristics 3 1 uncertainty in atmospheric driving data observational data vs model based datasets 3 1 1 temperature data consistency at gridpoint level we found an average mae of 1 3 c between the station and grid daily temperature values for gridpoints in the alpine catchment for the period 1961 2005 with a positive bias for grid temperatures observed in 12 out of 17 locations statistics for individual gridpoints stations are found in the appendix table a 3 elevation differences between station and grid pixel height are particularly pronounced in the partly steep wölzerbach the grid dataset can be used to capture inversions which the simple annual lapse rate correction section 2 2 does not consider thus temperatures in autumn and winter often exhibit larger differences between station and grid data in the alpine catchment the smaller overall mae of 0 5 c for the pre alpine raab catchment is believed to be an effect of the gentler orography and the higher number of stations used in the creation of the grid dataset more than half of the stations show a negative bias appendix table a 3 but this remains predominantly small average bias 0 1 c whereas the majority of raw models underestimate temperature the cumulative distribution functions of the bias corrected öks15 models align well with the function of the grid temperatures for almost all the gridpoint locations models and temperature ranges data not shown fig 3 compares cdfs of modelled and observed temperatures at one location in each catchment öks15 historic cdfs solid lines agree closely with the corresponding grid distribution functions the two stations demonstrate locations with over represented colder than observed temperature ranges in the grid dataset i e a negative temperature bias although future scenarios are not the subject of this paper we would like to point out that the temperature bias affects simulated future temperature distributions the simulated average daily temperatures of the two stations for the near future i e 2021 2050 at station stolzalpe and 2021 2040 at station lassnitzhöhe remain below those of the recent reference period when comparing the annual cycles of temperatures between öks15 and grid data not shown correspondence is best for the reference period that is also used for the bias correction i e 1961 2005 for periods shorter than that the level of agreement decreases this results in temperature differences of up to 0 5 c for long term monthly averages for specific models and months as described in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 temperature data consistency at the catchment level table 4 compares the seasonal mean temperatures of grid station raw and bias corrected öks15 models with each other for two different periods positive values indicate warmer grid temperatures the grid temperatures are higher than station temperatures for most locations in the wölzerbach catchment resulting in a catchment wide overestimation of about 1 c for the period of 1961 2005 the raw models generally underestimate temperatures in autumn winter and spring in the wölzerbach catchment as compared to the bias corrected öks15 models this effect is less pronounced for the raab catchment where only the minority of the raw models overestimates summer and winter temperatures the rather high level of agreement seen between grid and öks15 data at the gridpoint level is also reflected at the catchment level the differences between the raw multi model median and grid data for the wölzerbach catchment are much larger than those for the raab catchment both catchments show the lowest level of agreement in spring one caveat is that for reference periods different from the one used for bias correction both the multi model spread and differences between the öks15 multi model median and grid data increase however these differences remain below the range of temperature differences between the grid and station datasets overestimation by grid temperatures as discussed previously this finding is valid for all seasons and both catchments except for the winter season in the pre alpine raab catchment table 4 3 1 3 precipitation data consistency at gridpoint level precipitation is overestimated by the grid data 70 of all station gridpoint locations see appendix table a 4 this is more pronounced for the wölzerbach catchment where the average pbias is 14 period 1961 2005 for gridpoints located in the center of the catchment corresponding to stations not included in the creation of the grid dataset with a correlation of 0 92 between the station and grid timeseries the mae is smaller equal to 2 0 mm day the raab catchment shows a more similar picture mae of 0 7 mm day corr 0 93 but displays a smaller station average pbias of 3 over the same period of 1961 2005 interestingly the station introducing the largest positive bias in the raab catchment as well as the two stations introducing the largest negative bias in the wölzerbach catchment are the ones on the opposite sides of the catchment delineating mountain ridge we argue that the different precipitation climate north of the mountain ridge explains this finding in general datasets from the zamg stations correspond more closely with the grid dataset although not all of the stations were used for the creation of grid data than stations from ahyd differences between station and grid data are largest in summer when the major precipitation events heavy convective precipitation usually occur in the study catchments 3 1 4 precipitation data consistency at the catchment level while the grid exceeds station precipitation in all months and sub catchments over the period of 1961 2005 more apparent for larger monthly precipitation for the alpine wölzerbach catchment as would be expected from the station level results the findings are more spatially and temporally diverse for the raab catchment fig 4 and appendix fig a 1 an overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation in the upper part of the raab catchment opposes the underestimation of precipitation seen in the middle part for both the reference period 1961 2005 and the period of 1971 2000 in the lower part grid precipitation underestimates precipitation in the long term and slightly overestimates it for the period of 1971 2000 this is a result of the accrual and discontinuation of individual stations as well as the partially alternating positive and negative biases for individual years interestingly these spatial and temporal features of under overestimation result in an almost perfect fit between grid and station precipitation for the entire raab catchment in the period of 1961 2005 as shown in fig 4 the bias corrected öks15 precipitation also agrees closely with that of the grid data which is also justified by the use of the grid data in the creation of the öks15 data however almost all raw models serving as the base data for the bias correction of öks15 significantly overestimate precipitation in both catchments except for the summer period comparing the bias corrected öks15 model data appendix table a 1 with their reference grid dataset for the reference period of 1961 2005 fig 5 upper panel the largest and generally most positive differences are found in the second half of the year july to december however the majority of the bias corrected models tend to underestimate precipitation for most months it is noteworthy that the hadgem cclm shows a much weaker seasonality than all other models in the warm period of the year and only about half of the precipitation observed in july and august chimani et al 2019 also identified and described this model behavior i e the underestimation of precipitation particularly in eastern austria together with the overestimation of cyclone frequency when considering the annual cycle of precipitation in a climate period other than the reference period used for bias correction monthly differences between the grid and the öks15 runs increase up to around 18 in august in the alpine catchment a consistent evaluation of all öks15 models however fails because data from 1971 and on is available in only five out of thirteen models 3 1 5 analysis under conditions of wet and dry spells while extended periods of consecutive dry days i e dry spells may cause droughts and water shortages long sequences of days with precipitation above 1 mm i e wet spells can influence the flood risk an accurate representation of wet and dry spells therefore is important in hydrological impact studies in the long term mean 1961 2005 the catchment average monthly dry spell duration in the wölzerbach is highest for the station run appendix figure a 2 the grid and öks15 model medians align generally well with noticeable differences in october and november when the average dry spell length is longer for the grid run as seen for the overall precipitation the wet spell durations of the grid run surpass the station run in the alpine catchment in all months the grid and öks15 model median align slightly less closely for the wet than for the dry spell duration as compared to the grid run öks15 models show a shorter wet spell duration in spring and a longer one in the summer season the raw model median displays a weaker annual cycle in terms of the dry spell duration with the lowest differences from the öks15 median seen in summer median raw wet spell lengths are overestimated in all months in the raab catchment the average dry spell length of station and grid runs align more closely than those of grid and öks15 runs where we again find the largest differences in october and november interestingly the wet spell duration in the raab catchment is similar for all analyzed input variants the largest differences between the grid and öks15 model median are found in late spring and summer and a greater deviation between raw and the bias corrected model median is observed in may 3 1 6 analysis under snowfall conditions snow accumulation and snow melt play an important role for runoff and specifically in the alpine wölzerbach catchment to assess the combined effect of temperature and precipitation we analyzed the snowfall fraction i e the percentage of snowfall on total precipitation for the mountainous wölzerbach catchment the station and grid data agree well for snowfall fractions of 31 and 32 respectively 1970 2000 catchment average the öks15 model median however adds up to only 26 of the snowfall fraction except for hadgem cclm which shows a precipitation deficit in summer the snowfall fraction is underestimated by all öks15 models for all sub catchments not shown raw models highly overestimate the snowfall fraction with a median of 46 ranging from 40 to 60 in the raab catchment the observation based datasets station and grid both give a catchment average snowfall fraction of 9 and 10 respectively reference period 1971 2000 the median öks15 model gives a share of 7 of snow with respect to total precipitation the raw model median yields a similar result with a snowfall fraction of 12 as seen with the precipitation results the raw models have a huge spread of 7 22 of snowfall fraction with respect to total precipitation 3 2 uncertainty in simulated discharge and hydrological performance 3 2 1 consistency of discharge simulations in addition to the uncertainty in the atmospheric forcing data uncertainty in the simulated discharges also results from hydrological model uncertainty a discussion on how much of the uncertainty comes from either source goes beyond the scope of this study but we consider the bulk effect for discharge and hydrological indicators that have been identified as relevant in hydrology in order to identify the effect of alternative observational input data station and grid and reference periods on simulated discharge table 5 lists discharge performance indicators for those input data and periods of analysis grid data were used for the wölzerbach and station data were used for the raab to calibrate wasim and both models show a satisfactory representation of observed discharges nse 0 6 nselog 0 65 pbias 20 for all sub catchments considered the performance increases for the wölzerbach catchment when the grid calibrated model is used with station data as the driving input data table 5 which can be explained by including stations not considered in the creation of the grid dataset however the timeseries of discharge was rather short for the wölzerbach from the hydrological year 2004 and on regarding the raab catchment the model performance in the northern upper and middle sub catchments decreases considerably when the grid input is used as driving data with nse values of 0 4 and 0 46 and pbias of more than 33 and 25 respectively in the validation period although the model still performed well in the calibration period this appears to be mainly a result of significant precipitation overestimation by grid data in the northernmost sub catchments whereas overall differences between station and grid precipitation at the pixel level are larger for the calibration period the over and underestimations counterbalance each other at the sub catchment level leading to similar discharges and efficiencies decreasing performance in the validation period for the northern part of the area is increasingly compensated in the lower parts of the raab valley leaving the lowest gauge neumarkt almost unaffected long term runs table 5 show a picture similar to that of the shorter periods although the efficiency recovers a bit for the two upper sub catchments st ruprecht takern ii whereby the precipitation over and underestimation between the grid and station inputs become more balanced due to the rather short period of measured discharge in the wölzerbach catchment we considered only simulated discharges to construct fdcs at the gauge niederwölz fig 6 overestimation in the grid precipitation as compared to station data shown in section 3 1 4 results in an overestimation of the respective modelled discharges which particularly affects medium to low discharges 50th to 100th percentile when using the raw data as the driving data wasim tends to vastly overestimate high flows bias correction improves the simulation of overall flow characteristics considerably and apart from the high end extremes the öks15 runs align quite well with the grid long term fdcs hadgem model results are slightly more disparate than the other gcm rcm combinations compared to observations the long term discharge simulations for the feldbach gauge in the raab catchment have a positive bias i e an overestimation for the high to medium 5th to 50th percentile daily average discharges for both the station and the grid runs while the low flows 75th to are 99th percentile are underestimated exceptions to this are the extreme ends exceedance probability 0 01 and 0 995 the result of the analysis using fdcs for öks15 indicates rather good agreement with the grid run for high to medium discharges however these deviate considerably in some cases for low flows fig 6 right panel the improvement from bias correcting the raw models is evident again the unrealistic behavior of the hadgem cclm model data and the related fdcs must be pointed out for the raab catchment the discharge in all probability segments simulated by hadgem cclm are more than 25 lower than those predicted by the other models and the median to low flows are 40 lower than those seen in the grid run the shape of the fdc suggests a higher variance in the daily discharge for hadgem cclm and reflects the model s vast underestimation of precipitation in the summer season if we examine these datasets at higher temporal resolution the monthly fdcs not shown already shown considerably pointing out some difficulties with runoff timing even if the öks15 models are generally able to reproduce the overall flow regimes in both catchments fig 7 the overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation results in corresponding discharge overestimation for the wölzerbach furthermore the discharge peak is shifted from may in the station run to june in the grid run this can at least partly be attributed to temperature differences between the two datasets warm bias of grid as compared to station temperatures described in section 3 1 1 which affect snow accumulation and melt keeping in mind that the wölzerbach model was calibrated with the warmer grid dataset this leads due to higher melt and accumulation temperatures to earlier snow accumulation as well as melt prevailing later in the year for the station run however these temperature effects are merged with the overestimation of grid precipitation resulting in a delayed higher discharge peak for the grid run results for the raab catchment are similar even if the impact of the slight temperature underestimation grid compared to station and precipitation overestimation remains lower than for the alpine wölzerbach generally the pluvio méridional regime of the pre alpine raab catchment is reproduced well by both input datasets but the spring and autumn peaks are overestimated by the models as compared to the observations interestingly öks15 driven models result in a clear peak in september which is neither simulated by the other forcing data nor is visible in the observations this could indicate the higher relevance of precipitation associated with cyclones coming from the south comparing the inter model spread of öks15 driven wasim simulations between raab and wölzerbach clearly indicates the higher spread for the raab catchment this finding may be related to the impact of snow melt on runoff which in turn is highly related to temperature and thus associated with a lower spread in the alpine catchment as seen for the wölzerbach the hadgem cclm vastly underestimates the discharge for the raab catchment particularly in the second half of the year when comparing different periods of time the small positive bias of discharge between station and grid runs in the reference period of 1961 2005 not shown becomes larger for the period 1971 2000 climate normal 3 2 2 hydrological performance indicators in order to inspect results beyond mean annual hydrographs and probabilities several discharge indicators were computed to show the characteristics of flow magnitude extremes and variability again this is presented for different input datasets and periods of time table 6 to acknowledge the fact that rca model runs only start in 1971 the analysis was also carried out with a smaller ensemble excluding gcm rcm combinations with rca as the rcm c f appendix table a 1 furthermore we analyzed a reduced ensemble excluding the peculiar hadgem cclm realization we find a diverse picture for the different input data indicators and catchments in the wölzerbach the overestimation of grid precipitation is reflected in the magnitude related discharge indicators with the station simulations yielding the respectively lowest values however for low flow indicators differences between the other input data grid öks15 raw are of the same order of magnitude in both catchments also in the pre alpine raab catchment the highest discharges hig01 do not differ considerably between the input datasets including raw for the other high flow indicators hig25 and hig95 in both catchments hig01 in the alpine catchment table 3 the deviation between the raw model median is more distinct and particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment whereas differences in other input data remain comparable as far as the number of days in summer which are in the top fifth percentile annual flows s95 are concerned different input datasets show a greater divergence for the number of days in summer with flows less than 10 of the mean annual flow s10 differences between öks15 and their reference grid data are higher than for other indicators in both catchments the raw models yield the lowest values zero in the wölzerbach reflecting precipitation overestimation in the uncorrected data whereas days with high flows s95 and peakfrequency table 3 as indicated by the raw models are inflated in the wölzerbach they are underrepresented in the raab catchment however when considering observations as the baseline raab catchment differences among the different input data are again of the same order of magnitude particularly for low flow indicators the reduced ensembles leave the multi model median barely unaffected and do not stand out in our analyses 4 discussion departures of climate model simulations from observations for an identical past represent a significant source of uncertainty in scenario studies and especially for precipitation the bias correction method attempts to minimize this problem with empirical methods obviously bias corrected data can only be as good as the reference data used for bias correction and these data are also prone to errors e g gampe et al 2019 prein and gobiet 2017 iizumi et al 2017 the question of how credible the bias corrected data are for the future remains to be addressed this credibility generally increases when simulations with a hydrological model forced by uncorrected model data can already represent certain basic hydrological mechanisms 4 1 uncertainty in input data our overall line of reasoning here is that if the uncertainties inherent in the observations are as large as or similar to the differences between the observational and the model data a useful application in hydrological scenario modelling should be possible however with regard to climate impact studies a significantly large climate signal is needed to move beyond the zone of uncertainty in our case the differences between the two observational datasets as well as between the model datasets öks15 and raw and observations are discussed in the following against this methodical background differences between station and grid meteorological input data at the gridpoint level we found a positive bias for grid temperatures in the alpine catchment and an overestimation of grid as compared to station precipitation for two thirds both catchments of the locations the differences are particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment resulting in a grid temperature overestimation of about 1 c and precipitation overestimation of almost 20 at the catchment level calibrating the hydrological model wasim with grid data in the wölzerbach the performance increases when station input is used however driving station calibrated wasim raab with the grid dataset leads to a dramatic decline in model performance in the validation period yet differences in the pre alpine catchment spatially and temporally compensate each other leaving the simulated discharge at the most downstream outlet relatively unaffected in the long term whereas precipitation overestimation leads to continuous discharge overestimation in the alpine catchment overall timing i e inter seasonal variation of hydrological variables differs to a much lesser extent than magnitude volume differences between öks15 and grid meteorological input data seasonal cycles of wet spells and discharges of the öks15 models diverge from those of the grid input even if annual cycles of precipitation and temperature of both input data align well exception rcms driven by the hadgem gcm in the alpine catchment öks15 models with hadgem cclm as single exception significantly underestimate the snowfall fraction which is probably related to errors in the combined occurrence of temperature and precipitation for snowfall this translates to some overestimation of discharge in winter and an underestimation of the meltwater peak in may the lack of overlap between the analysis period and bias correction reference period results in deviations in the temperature and precipitation distributions their impact on hydrological quantities however is equivocal significantly shorter periods e g 10 years of analysis lead to higher discrepancies due to natural variability differences between bias corrected öks15 and raw euro cordex input data unlike the bias corrected simulations the temperatures obtained from raw models are generally underestimated while precipitation is overestimated this leads to higher snowfall fractions from the raw model input although this effect is present in both catchments it is particularly pronounced in the alpine catchment whereas discharges simulated with the raw model input are overestimated in the alpine catchment the highest discharges seen in the pre alpine catchment do not differ considerably regardless of the input data used differences in low flow discharges are of the same order of magnitude for all inputs in both catchments fig 8 compares these differences as uncertainty in the observed data with the uncertainties from the model data öks15 raw for different meteorological and hydrological variables this gives a clear picture of the robustness of the model simulations as a relative position to the uncertainty in the observed data indicators located close to the 1 1 line similar differences please note the logarithmic scaling or below the 1 1 line differences lower than those from observations indicate lower levels of uncertainty and a higher level of model robustness the differences in the temperature and precipitation indicators are generally higher in the wölzerbach catchment for both observations and models öks15 as well as raw and are presumably related to the complex orography of the catchment whereas our analyses identify the bias corrected öks15 models as suitable robust for most of the indicators the uncorrected raw models are associated with high levels of uncertainty as indicated by their location high above the 1 1 line interestingly some exceptions exist in the wölzerbach winter temperatures and summer precipitation as well as low flow indicators are reasonably captured by the raw models in the raab catchment the raw models simulate summer temperatures autumn temperatures and precipitation as well as low flows to a moderate degree thus in less complex settings and particularly when studying low flows using the raw input data might still be an interesting option 4 2 remaining uncertainty in bias corrected input data the bias corrected öks15 models do not fully capture the timing of discharge characteristics leading to slight mismatches in the simulation of past mean annual hydrographs furthermore even when the bias correction improved precipitation simulations in the alpine catchment due to precipitation overestimation in the reference data a percent bias of almost 20 persisted as seen with the snowfall fraction the univariate bias correction does not account for inter variable dependencies and the often used approach of evaluating climate model variables independently fosters overlooking disparities arising from it differences in the long term monthly average dry spell duration could further explain the temporal mismatches to some extent this highlights the fact that an adequate representation of temperature and precipitation cycles and individual flood drought related meteorological indicators of climate models do not necessarily translate into an accurate representation of average runoff conditions which might be specifically problematic when investigating possible changes in the timing of discharge in the future potential remaining biases as found in this study should be cross checked in advance and considered when interpreting results from impact assessment model chains they should be particularly acknowledged in topographically complex regions where also the grid data was created with sparse station density a related discussion on limitations of bias correction due to restricted location representativeness can be found in maraun and widmann 2015 problems arising from bias correcting climate variables independently have been acknowledged by other researchers e g meyer et al 2019 chen et al 2018 and the issue of hydrologically relevant remaining biases after bias correction was pointed out in the works of addor and seibert 2014 hakala et al 2018 and maraun et al 2019 for a general discussion on the benefits and limitations of bias correction we refer to the works of ehret et al 2012 and maraun 2016 4 3 ensemble member selection and cautionary remarks our results do not allow us to give a uniform recommendation for preferred models to use because most of the models perform better in one region than in the other in terms of discharge characteristics however cnrm cm5 cclm mpi esm cclm and ec earth cclm performed reasonably well for the period of 1961 2005 in both alpine and pre alpine catchments hadgem cclm is not able to capture the annual precipitation cycle especially in the southeastern pre alpine catchment underestimating precipitation by up to 50 however this scarcely affected multi model median discharge indicators in our study the cnrm cm5 aladin simulations did not stand out either in our analyses but were found to be erroneous at a later stage after the öks15 dataset had already been released chimani et al 2019 furthermore since the original publication of the euro cordex data errors regarding an unrealistic accumulation of snow also referred to as the snow tower issue have been discovered for the gcm rcm combinations ec earth racmo and ec earth hirham euro cordex errata 2021 frei et al 2018 showed that this unrealistic accumulation of snow can dampen the climate change signal of temperature at the locations involved we found that this issue only affects high altitude grid cells in the western part of austria and thus determined it as not relevant for our study region however projections concerned should be applied with great caution and removed from the analyzed ensemble where necessary as suggested by hakala et al 2018 both future and past periods should be considered in the decision on omitting individual gcm rcm realizations 4 4 selection of the analysis period although the results for ensemble median simulated discharges and indicators for the shorter reference period 1971 2000 did not stand out in our analyses the potential lack of overlap between the analysis period and the bias correction reference period of 45 years 1961 2005 should not be neglected discharge time series dating back to 1971 or even 1961 are rare particularly for small and medium sized catchments furthermore since five out of thirteen öks15 models are available only from 1971 and on the user can either choose a shorter analysis period the full ensemble available for 1971 2005 and accept some of the resulting discrepancies or use a reduced ensemble the idea of establishing a default database that considers the longest records possible neglects the fact that for many applications observational data of 40 years or longer simply do not exist consequently user oriented evaluation studies like the one presented here can provide further valuable insights for the climate modelling community 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the value of the high resolution climate dataset öks15 for hydrological impact studies to achieve this purpose impacts on hydrological indicators were analyzed along different spatial scales and sources of uncertainty using an alpine and a pre alpine catchment in southeastern austria as examples clearly some of our results are specific to the austrian öks15 dataset but others are common for similar high resolution climate model data in general in order to quantify the effect of uncertainty propagation from meteorological driving data to driven hydrologic indicators we used the hydrological model wasim we found that the observed hydro climatic conditions could generally be reproduced effectively when driving wasim with bias corrected climate model data contrary to the uncertainties noted when raw euro cordex models are used uncertainties arising from the use of the bias corrected öks15 are comparable to those in the observed data for most of the hydrological indicators analyzed taking due account of the limitations and assumptions inherent in bias corrected data this robustness affirms that the öks15 data are basically fit for purpose for hydrological applications our results particularly support the specific recommendation to use öks15 data in long term analyses of mean hydrological conditions at the same time hydrologically relevant limitations of the öks15 dataset do exist even for the bias corrected data some inconsistencies in timing magnitude and location persist partially leading to deviations in hydrological signatures we found that hadgem cclm was particularly striking and not able to capture the annual precipitation cycle thus this model should be applied with great caution especially for the southeast of austria however multi model median discharge indicators analyzed within this study were scarcely affected with regard to the precipitation overestimation in the reference dataset a bias of almost 20 remains for discharge in the alpine catchment nonetheless as the temperature and precipitation biases of uncorrected raw models are particularly high in complex terrain the bias correction adds value in these settings still the uncorrected raw models perform reasonably well with respect to some features leaving them as practicable options for impact studies e g related to low flows as a further cautionary remark we note that the univariate bias correction method which does not consider the combined occurrence of temperature and precipitation affects the representation of snow related processes this should be acknowledged by end users but might be of less interest in pre alpine not snow dominated settings another finding is that differences in the bias correction reference period and some of the models temporal coverage also impact meteorological signatures and confine the recommended use of öks15 data to basins with a sufficiently extensive gauging history which allows users to run an initial check for remaining biases we acknowledge uncertainties and limitations of our hydrological model setup and parameters which we tried to circumvent by partly confining our analysis to the model world comparing grid data to wasim internal station interpolation as a reference should not suggest that the latter represents the truth measurement structural parameter and interpolation uncertainty are inherent in them as well for example no precipitation correction was carried out to avoid obscuring the comparison between the grid and station data even if undercatch can be considerable particularly in the alpine catchment the fact that input differences from the lack of overlap between the analysis period and the bias correction reference period do not clearly propagate to discharges as well as mismatches in high flow indicators point to limitations in the models used which need to be addressed in future work uncertainty in the hydrological models also affect low flows for which our results indicate a good agreement among all datasets vidal et al 2016 for example found diverging low flow responses from different hydrological models in a changing climate ideally the multi model approach should thus not only be considered using an ensemble of climate models but applying multiple hydrological models e g horton et al 2021 particularly with a view to the simulation of snow related processes in a warmer future climate e g troin et al 2016 the share of the hydrological models part in overall climate change impact uncertainty has been discussed in dobler et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 and addor et al 2014 as a further constraint of our approach we note that vegetation and land use changes which have had considerable regionally occurring impacts over the past decades were not included in our models together with the consideration of changes due to other human impacts land use changes should be addressed in subsequent studies particularly when focusing on future climate change e g sivapalan and blöschl 2015 finally focusing on just two example catchments represents another limitation of our analysis and the results might somewhat differ when using the öks15 data for other regions in austria the approach taken in this study however is considered an important step in the interdisciplinary community effort to further develop climate analysis and simulation based high resolution hydrological research in austria we believe that our findings help to improve the usage of climate model datasets for hydrological applications in general while identifying the öks15 dataset generally fit for purpose in hydrological applications describing its strengths and limitations will also help users of öks15 and corresponding datasets to design and interpret hydrological

provided upon request 1 introduction propagation effects of rainfall errors in streamflow simulation commonly are assessed by use of in situ observed rainfall fallah et al 2020 shin and kim 2019 this also is the case for the vastly ungauged zambezi basin in southern africa winsemius et al 2006 which supports livelihoods of over 40 million inhabitants hughes and farinosi 2020 a constraint to streamflow simulation and hydrological assessments of the basin s water balance is the low number of rain gauges that hinder quantitative assessments to overcome the constraints by limited rain gauge data satellite rainfall estimates sres can be considered to supplement or to replace rain gauge data satellite rainfall products provide areal coverages and allow construction of time series since observations are consistently repeated over time over the past decade a large number of studies have reported on sre s a wider consensus has developed that sres are affected by observation error various studies report on bias error i e systematic error propagation of sres that affect specific characteristics of simulated hydrographs such as peak flows chen et al 2020 low and high flows dang et al 2017 as well as the water balance as shown in catchment modelling alemu et al 2020 a study by jiang et al 2012 in china highlights sre bias error propagation by use of the semi distributed xinanjiang model and show that relatively small bias corrected rainfall errors do not distinctly affect model behaviour mei et al 2016 showed that larger bias errors propagated to cause significant streamflow mismatch when the integrated catchment hydrological model ichymod was applied in italys s upper adige river basin pan et al 2010 showed that the climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 satellite rainfall errors cause mismatches in simulated streamflow volume using the variable infiltration capacity vic model maggioni et al 2013 used a stochastic ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d in the tar pamlico basin and showed that cmorph rainfall bias errors are significantly augmented to cause streamflow mismatch in large basin sizes artan et al 2007 showed that in the mekong river s nam ou and se done basins a slight bias in cmorph rainfall augmented into simulated streamflow mismatch using the geospatial stream flow model geosfm in hydrological modelling evaluation of sre rainfall error propagation to streamflow mismatch and to water balance closure are topics of ongoing interest propagation of rainfall error to streamflow error by hydrological modelling commonly is evaluated by analysing mismatches between observed streamflow and simulated counterparts subject to respective rainfall input data sources for that purpose objective functions may be combined and optimized by use of automated single or multi objective model calibration algorithms see de vos and rientjes 2007 yapo et al 1998 identifies a set of optimal solutions model parameter sets based on a trade off between different objective functions de vos and rientjes 2007 showed that not all differences between simulated and observed hydrograph characteristics e g peak flows or low flows can be expressed adequately by a single objective function and optimized model parameter set rientjes et al 2013 monteil et al 2020 and shahed behrouz et al 2020 show that multi objective calibration allows the simultaneous evaluation of multiple outputs from the model these applications have been on knowledge driven hydrological model approaches and thus it is likely that aspects of satellite rainfall error propagation can be assessed from such a calibration approach in this study multi objective strategies are tested for sre error propagation to cause mismatch in streamflow hydrograph shape and volume specific hydrograph characteristics and composition of simulated model water balance effects on parameter optimization for rainfall input sources is shown as well in the kabompo basin a number of spatially distributed rainfall runoff model approaches have been used that relied on use of rain gauge data and sre s omondi 2017 applied the topographic driven model topmodel to assess effectiveness of satellite rainfall estimates for water balance assessment ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to determine the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the kabompo basin matos 2014 successfully used the swat model with sres on a daily time step to forecast flows for the zambezi river basin in the above studies no attempts were made to assess effects of sre errors on streamflow mismatch ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 although there are also ample scientific studies that sre are affected by systematic errors gumindoga et al 2019c this study seeks improved understanding of propagation effects of sre rainfall errors where the state of the art representative elementary watershed modelling approach reggiani and majid hassanizadeh 2016 is selected and applied at the kabompo headwater catchment of the zambezi river this study demonstrates how systematic errors i e bias errors in cmorph sres affect simulated streamflow outcomes of a physically based rainfall runoff model the study also shows how errors affect actual evapotranspiration eta with emphasis on closure of the water balance the findings are expected to provide new insights on the hydrologic implications of satellite rainfall error and serves applications in the zambezi basin 2 methodology 2 1 description of study area the kabompo river originates in north western province of zambia between the zambezi and congo river basins the river is approximately 440 km long the streamflow gauging station for kabompo river is located at watopa pontoon which is near the basin outlet and has an upstream catchment area of 67 261 km2 fig 1 the predominant soil types are ferralsols that are deep strongly leached clayey to loamy soils covering almost 70 of the study area arenosols that are sandy soils featuring very weak or no significant soil profile development exist and are dispersed in slightly divided plateau zones which shelter the southern and western part of the basin gumindoga et al 2019a landcover entails about 60 closed broadleaved deciduous forest 22 open broadleaved deciduous forest and the remainder closed to open shrublands kabompo basin has a sub tropical climate consisting of a wet season october april and a dry season may september rainfall is affected by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the mean annual precipitation ranges from 900 mm yr in the southern part to 1500 mm yr in the northern part of the basin actual evapotranspiration is around 785 mm yr omondi 2017 2 2 in situ observed meteorological and streamflow data daily meteorological data of six stations for the period 1998 2012 were obtained from the meteorological department of zambia and from the university of zambia this period was selected because of completeness of rainfall time series it is also common to find floods and drought within one hydro meteorological season the stations are kabompo kaoma kasempa mwinilunga solwezi and zambezi fig 1 although the network of the rain gauges is sparse with two stations inside the basin and four stations with average distance of 35 km outside of the catchment boundary the network may serve the objectives of this study as stations are well distributed across the study area and since screening of rainfall data indicated that observation time series are complete and of good quality meteorological observations maximum and minimum temperature rainfall relative humidity wind speed and sunshine were used to estimate daily potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman montheith method allen et al 1998 which were then used as input to a hydrological model for the same period daily streamflow data were obtained for watopa gauging station from the department of water affairs and water resources management authority of zambia after screening watopa station has an average long term flow of 216 m3 s i e 1 9 107 m3 year with highest flows up to 1570 m3 s observed in march and lowest flows down to 36 m3 s observed in september 2 3 bias correction of cmorph based rainfall cmorph rainfall half hourly estimates is a gridded precipitation product 8 km 8 km that combines high temporal resolution of infrared with the high retrieval accuracy of passive microwave satellite imagery the product obtained for the period 1998 2012 has successful applications in the zambezi basin gumindoga et al 2019a b as well as other african basins koriche rientjes 2016 haile et al 2013 hence the choice for its use in this study a detailed description of the product is found in joyce et al 2004 cmorph satellite rainfall images were downloaded from the noaa repository ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov prep cmorph v1 0 crt 8 km 0 30 m and aggregated to daily totals via the geonetcast isod toolbox of ilwis gis software http 52north org downloads bias in cmorph satellite rainfall estimate is corrected using data from six rain gauges and a space and time varying bias correction approach that was successfully applied for the zambezi basin gumindoga et al 2019a 2019b and the upper blue nile basin bhatti et al 2016 bias correction was performed from 1998 to 2012 that matches the period for error propagation assessment the bias correction factor adopted from bhatti et al 2016 and habib et al 2014 is calculated from a 7 day sequential time window that moves forward in the time domain for all days in the window an equal bias correction factor is calculated on conditions that for the window there is a minimum of five rainy days and a rainfall minimum accumulation depth of 5 mm when the above conditions are not met a bias correction factor of 1 applies to all 7 days in the window in the above approach bias factors vary in time and space since bias factors change value for each station for each 7 day window uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph rainfall estimates are compared to spatially interpolated gauged rainfall by means of the inverse distance approach by equal projection pixel to pixel comparison at 8 km 8 km pixel size and at daily time step is performed for pixels that overlay the study area to assess the match between gauge observations and uncorrected and corrected cmorph c counterparts correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae are used as statistical indicators 2 4 ɛ nsgaii for multi objective model calibration in this study multi objective calibration is performed for streamflow modelling for hydrograph shape and volume combinations of specific hydrograph characteristics and assessments of water balance composition and closure the epsilon dominance non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii ɛ nsgaii algorithm is applied yang et al 2014 to all cases to optimize model parameters of the rainfall runoff model section 2 5 the algorithm is an improved version of the nsgaii algorithm proposed by deb et al 2002 the main purpose of the genetic based search algorithm is optimisation of parameter values by fitting simulated streamflow hydrograph variables to observed counterparts such can be by single objective or multi objective functions important settings of the ɛ nsgaii that impact effectiveness of the genetic based optimization algorithm are simulated binary crossover sbx deb and agrawal 2005 and polynomial mutation pm deb and goyal 1996 occurrences of the crossover and mutation operations are complementary inputs which are controlled by the crossover rate crate jung et al 2017 notes that if the crate is 0 9 the rate of mutation is 0 1 function of ɛ nsgaii algorithm is based on a number of optimization metrics i e quality measures that assess cardinality accuracy and diversity of solutions as demonstrated in mostafaie et al 2018 the quality measures are the number of pareto solutions nps generation distance gd spacing sp and maximum spread ms 2 5 representative elementary watershed modelling in this study the representative elementary watershed rew model reggiani et al 1999 reggiani and rientjes 2005 is selected for streamflow simulation the catchment scale model is selected since the semi distributed model domain reads spatially distributed rainfall as input and since the model by means of an integrated physically based numerical approach simulates runoff production by hortonian and saturation excess overland flow and subsurface runoff contributions for shallow and deeper ground water this allows to intercompare model outcomes including water balance closure subject to selected rainfall input data sources the semi distributed model domain constitutes a set of interconnected prismatic volumes i e rew s that are organized around the stream channel network fig 2 to each flow zone in a rew conservation equations for mass momentum energy and entropy are averaged yielding global balance laws detailed descriptions on rew flow algorithms are found in reggiani et al 1999 and reggiani and rientjes 2005 whereas recent applications of the model are found in reggiani et al 2014 reggiani and hassanizadeh 2016 elgamal et al 2017 reference is made to gumindoga et al 2019a for an application of the rew model to the kabompo basin the model set up was adopted in this study as it is well suited for water balance closure assessments in this study 2 6 model calibration and benchmark for rainfall error propagation assessments hydrological modelling requires calibration that serves to optimize the model parameter set given observed rainfall and potential evapotranspiration that force the model for this study a rew model parameter set with sensitive model parameters was optimized by the ɛ nsgaii algorithm using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for the period from oct 1998 to sept 2002 the parameter set was validated for the period oct 2002 to sept 2006 by also using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for further parameter optimization cases in this study the set will be referred to as the original parameter set with best performing values for further optimization subject to selected sre rainfall input data source modelling cases and objective functions the selection of calibration and validation periods is based on data availability and completeness model performance is assessed from the y objective function akhtar et al 2009 rientjes et al 2013 that combines nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative volume error rve objective functions eqs 1 3 y becomes 1 when the model estimates perfectly match with observations and becomes 0 when nse is equal

2006 2012 that is outside periods of calibration and validation to assess effects of cmorph rainfall error propagation on hydrograph shape and volume through the y function the original parameter set was selected for all three rainfall data sources as such any difference in stream flow simulation results can be attributed to error propagation by the cmorph rainfall input data source subject to the original parameter set for simulation cases that target specific hydrograph characteristics table 1 and water balance assessments the original parameter set is optimized for respective rainfall input sources and selected objective functions as such by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm any aspect of error propagation by rainfall input data source is not affected by sub optimal model parameter values streamflow assessments for sre rainfall sources on streamflow hydrograph shape and volume y function use the original parameter set as such any mismatch in streamflow that results from respective rainfall input data sources is subject to the original parameter set similar to error assessments on rainfall input data sources for assessing mismatches on streamflow also correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae are used as statistical indicators to indicate effects of error propagation for different rainfall input data sources ratios of statistical indicators for streamflow qs and rainfall r are calculated by means of ccqs ccr maeqs maer and rmseqs rmser ratios are selected because they have different implications maeqs maer 1 and rmseqs rmser 1 implies error attenuation whereas ccqs ccr 1 implies augmentation of error whereas past studies e g hong et al 2006 employed error propagation procedures where objective function values are interpreted in this study the magnitude of the ratios was considered to indicate effects of propagation in a relative manner stream flow characteristics multi objective assessments for sre rainfall sources on specific stream flow hydrograph characteristics follow a procedure where for each set of objective functions table 2 and for each rainfall data source a best performing parameter set is used following optimization of the original parameter set by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm any difference in objective function values that indicate how well the simulated hydrographs characteristics match to observed counter parts can uniquely be attributed to the rainfall input source water balance water balance assessments imply that subject to the rainfall input data source water balance components will alter with different volumetric values for respective components the assessment consider the attribution of rainwater in actual evapotranspiration eta and streamflow qs and also accounts for rainwater storage in the model for error propagation analysis water balance ratios for actual evapotranspiration over rainfall eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and runoff over rainfall qs r runoff coefficient are computed from the rew simulation assessments for all three rainfall data sources are based on y function after rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for the assessment period besides ratios the optimized parameter values and water balance components are provided as outcome 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench mark for rainfall error propagation results of the rew model calibration october 1998 september 2002 and validation october 2002 september 2006 by use of interpolated in situ observed rainfall are shown in fig 3 for both periods model underestimation of highest flows and overestimation of low flows are observed hydrograph recession periods are also underestimated for few years observed streamflow hydrographs indicate that the kabompo basin is a slow responding system as is evident from lack of rapid changes in streamflow over short periods by high rainfall this is expected considering the large catchment size 67 261 km2 though the model shows small underestimation of highest peaks and small overestimation of baseflow the simulated streamflow successfully resembles the observed streamflow pattern during both the calibration y 0 77 and validation period y 0 71 these objective function values are appropriate to allow for error propagation analysis in this study for assessments on sre error propagation on streamflow mismatch fig 4 shows that for uncorrected cmorph the ratio ccqs ccr is 2 0 as compared to a lower ratio for corrected cmorph 1 2 any ratio greater 1 shows attenuation of error and thus a ratio close to 1 is more desirable for cc a ratio 1 shows attenuation of error and thus a ratio close to 1 indicates less propogation effect of rainfall for both maeqs maer and rveqs rver preferred ratio values are close to 1 a ratio less than 1 implies error attenuation whereas a ratio 1 shows error augmentation the ratio maeqs maer for uncorrected cmorph was 1 3 and indicates error augmentation whereas for bias corrected cmorph the ratio was 0 2 indicating error attenuation while there is no substantial difference between uncorrected and corrected cmorph for the rveqs rver ratio uncorrected cmorph however shows error augmentation 1 2 whereas bias corrected cmorph shows error attenuation 0 9 the error in uncorrected satellite rainfall is shown to amplify in streamflow simulations by the rew model when corrected cmorph is introduced there is attenuation of error in the context of error propagation and with reference to the absolute differences between corrected and uncorrected attenuation is more evident for mae followed by cc and less substantial for rve overall the ratios provide insights about the extent of error propagation from rainfall to streamflow mismatch substantial error is introduced by uncorrected cmorph whereas a small error is introduced by corrected cmorph the linear bias correction scheme indicates satisfying results in error reduction and is recommended for similar studies 3 2 streamflow for respective rainfall data sources fig 5 shows the rainfall error propagation simulated hydrograph for the period 2006 2012 except for baseflow all hydrograph characteristics show fair match between observed streamflow and the cmorph simulated streamflow time to peak of hydrograph shows that the best hydrograph simulation is indicated for rain gauge based simulation that is followed by bias corrected cmorph and uncorrected cmorph based streamflow simulation results there is consistent underestimation of baseflow there is smooth transition from recession limb to baseflow for the observed hydrograph and model simulations a drop at the start of baseflow is noted for bias corrected and uncorrected cmorph based simulations 3 3 streamflow hydrograph characteristics for respective rainfall data sources table 2 shows objective function values used to assess model performance by pairing of objective functions e g the use of nse and rmerv for high flows the approach involved further optimization of the original parameter set by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for respective rainfall sources this applies to all cases in table 2 peak flow though physical inspection of hydrographs seemingly indicate that all graphs coincide for the highest peaks in each year t hydrographs for uncorrected cmorph rainfall are not accurate on the timing of the peak flows this is based on time to peak objective function that only is applied to highest peak flow for each year for the period 2006 2012 bias corrected rainfall show better matching with observed streamflow peaks as compared to uncorrected cmorph for all three rainfall sources the multi objective calibration approach in this study improves the m4e by penalising for overestimation of peak flows there is a trade off between having good overall fit and having accurate timing to the peak flow in days so further research is suggested for a modelling approach so to improve on the trade offs de vos and rientjes 2005 note that m4e may fail to show effects of a time shift in the runoff series high flows high flows are defined as flows above the threshold of 500 m3 s that coincides with the 75th percentile value range of all observations table 2 shows that the nse values for both corrected and uncorrected cmorph are in the same order of magnitude for high flows all in range of 0 64 0 69 the multi objective parameter optimization by the ɛ nsgaii algorithm has preference towards improving hydrograph pattern higher nse and good agreement of high flows lower rmerv the combination of nse and rmerv gives satisfactory results for bias corrected cmorph rainfall simulations uncorrected cmorph indicated poor results for both nse and rmerv objective functions low flows low flows are flow discharges below the threshold of 95 m3 s that coincides with the 25th percentile value range of all observations fig 5 shows that there is match of high flows rising and falling limbs at the costs of matching low flows simulation results possibly are affected by the original parameter set which caused that low flows were over estimated throughout the entire calibration period see fig 3 simulation results in table 2 show relatively poor objective function values for rmael and msle results on magnitude of the low flows indicates satisfying results for bias corrected cmorph as compared to uncorrected cmorph the model simulation with uncorrected cmorph was successful only for flow values below 25 m3 s in table 2 a large increase in the value of rmael is observed for uncorrected cmorph compared to corrected cmorph furthermore rmael seems to be more appropriate for model calibration than msle although msle is used more often demirel and booij 2009 madsen 2000 recession limb simulation results in fig 5 with uncorrected cmorph show that the shapes of annual recession curves are not adequately matched as compared to streamflow simulated by in situ rainfall this is because of poor rainfall representation by cmorph in the dry season see gumindoga et al 2019c table 2 shows that the simulation with bias corrected cmorph rainfall results in improved simulation of the recession limb this is evidenced by r k of 2 3 for uncorrected cmorph compared to r k 1 4 for bias corrected cmorph an r k closer to 1 is preferred shape of rising limb fig 5 shows that yearly rising limbs are well simulated as compared to other hydrograph characteristics except for the recession limb there is an improved mse of 0 0018 m3 s for bias corrected cmorph as compared to mse of 0 0095 m3 s for uncorrected cmorph as shown in table 2 similarly an msde value of 6 3 e 5 m3 s is achieved for uncorrected cmorph as compared to an improved value of 4 5 e 7 m3 s for bias corrected cmorph overall there is closeness of fit between simulated and observed rising and falling limbs when bias corrected cmorph rainfall is used 3 4 effect of rainfall data source on the water balance the percentage ratios for water balance coefficients eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and qs r runoff coefficient are shown in fig 6 ratios are calculated for all three rainfall data input sources for the period 2006 2012 error assessment period highest eta r is shown for bias corrected cmorph 23 as compared to uncorrected cmorph 16 changes in eta r for the same error assessment period are not equal to changes in qs r in the model indicating that the model responds to actual water storage by rainfall the results show that the rainfall input source affect the model simulated water balance as the above mentioned differences are more evident for uncorrected than for corrected cmorph results also show that for uncorrected cmorph approximately 9 of rainfall received is converted to runoff for the period 2006 2012 evapotranspiration coefficient shows differences for uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph based simulations however the runoff coefficient does not significantly change when changing the rainfall input data source omondi 2017 noted that the low runoff coefficient also implies that most of rainwater in the catchment infiltrates into the soils causing delayed peak runoff table 2 3 5 water balance closure and parameter optimization table 3 shows a comparison of water balance components subject to optimized parameter sets for respective rainfall inputs by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for the original parameter set the y function was selected as objective function eq 1 water balance closure represents the water balance equation residual term that is expressed as percentage of rainfall a residual 1 44 is shown for rain gauge based rainfall input compared to 2 67 for bias corrected satellite rainfall estimates and 15 91 for uncorrected cmorph improved closure for corrected cmorph is also indicated by the higher y objective function after model calibration the study also assessed how model parameters are affected by error in the rainfall inputs after bias correction is applied each rainfall distribution in situ uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph represents its own amount of rain water that serves model forcing as such the rew model responds to the amount of water that it receives table 3 also shows results of water balance closure analysis and the different water balance terms that result from the model because of the change of rainfall input source respective optimized model parameter values are also indicated lee et al 2005 reggiani and rientjes 2005 2010 varado et al 2006 soil porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and water content at saturation have values within the allowable value ranges even after bias correction sensitive parameters that control the volume of the simulated hydrograph show large changes compared to the parameters using rain gauge input factors that control groundwater table depth and eventually baseflows are less affected 3 6 pareto distributions fig 7a l shows pareto distributions for sensitive parameters water content at saturation and soil porosity optimization of parameter values by running the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for respective rainfall input sources resulted in different trade offs in the y objective function assessments are made for all hydrograph characteristics but results presented only for low flows high flows and overall shape for the same forcing data and objective functions table 2 a range of optimum model parameter values result that all perform equally well subject to ɛ nsgaii parameter optimization the curve shape of the output is the actual pareto front that shows the trade off between criterion 1 x axis and 2 y axis for example if value of water content at saturation improves then for soil porosity it deteriorates and vice versa but any combination shows an equal optimal solution all the pareto plots fig 7a l multi objective optimization results in fair spread indicating consistent optimization a shift of the pareto front toward the origin of the axes indicates in a relative sense error attenuation by the selected bias correction scheme such an approach provides a useful guidance for model improvement visual inspection fig 7 and analysis of the quality measures of ɛ nsgaii algorithm for calibrating the rew model based on the y function reveal an improved performance for bias corrected cmorph rainfall input compared to uncorrected cmorph the in situ rainfall input shows much better performance in rainfall runoff modelling a greater nps number indicates that the algorithm is better suited to provide a greater number of pareto solutions whereas a better optimization algorithm provide lower gd an algorithm with a smaller sp indicates that the solutions are distributed nearly uniformly making it a good measure to evaluate diversity larger maximum spread values ms indicate a good performance of the algorithm as demonstrated in forootan 2018 a hydrograph overall shape can be thought of as representing averaged conditions of all the other hydrograph characteristic results on quality measures as presented for overall hydrograph shape show the number of pareto solutions nps 50 for rain gauge corrected and uncorrected cmorph maximum spread ms 2 9 rain gauge 2 3 corrected cmorph 0 98 uncorrected cmorph generational distance gd 0 11 rain gauge 0 19 corrected cmoprh 0 22 uncorrected cmorph and spacing sp 1

runoff model parameters of the model were optimized using the ɛ nsgaii algorithm assessments on error propagation targeted streamflow modelling for hydrograph shape and volume specific hydrograph characteristics and water balance composition from this study 4 conclusions are drawn i bench mark for rainfall error propagation the rew model successfully simulated runoff in the kabompo basin using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for calibration and validation periods although some underestimation of highest flows and overestimation of low flows is shown sources of uncertainty and error that could contribute to the mismatch are rainfall representation inaccurate representation of catchment characteristics such as land cover and stage discharge relationship ii streamflow hydrograph mismatch by rainfall error propagation ratio indicators that show streamflow error by sre error indicate that attenuation is more evident for mae followed by cc and less substantial for rve functions ratios of maeqs maer for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 1 3 and 0 2 ratios of ccqs ccr for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 2 0 and 1 2 and ratios of rveqs rver for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 1 2 and 0 9 this approach showed improved numeric evaluation of cmorph error propagation as compared to previous studies in the kabompo basin and other catchment basins of the zambezi river results of indicators are affected by use of the original i e calibrated parameter set that was applied to all three rainfall data sources potentially smaller effects of sre errors may occur when rainfall runoff simulations are repeated with optimized parameters sets for each respective rainfall input data source iii mismatch of hydrograph characteristics by rainfall error propagation multi objective parameter optimization enables a more reliable and robust evaluation procedure and error propagation assessment for specific hydrograph characteristics though physical inspection of hydrographs seemingly indicate that all graphs coincide for the highest peaks in each year the simulations with uncorrected cmorph rainfall generally are not accurate on the hydrograph characteristics for example the simulation with bias corrected cmorph rainfall results in improved simulation of the recession limb r k of 2 3 for uncorrected cmorph compared to r k 1 4 for bias corrected cmorph there is also closeness of fit between simulated and observed rising and falling limbs when bias corrected cmorph rainfall is used matching of streamflow hydrograph shows best overall fit in the simulation period for rain gauge based simulation that is followed by bias corrected cmorph and uncorrected cmorph based streamflow simulation results objective function values indicate that bias corrected cmorph sre s results in attenuation of cmorph rainfall bias error iv effect of error propagation on the water balance closure percentage ratios for water balance coefficients eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and qs r runoff coefficient show improved water balance closure for bias corrected cmorph as compared to uncorrected cmorph findings also show that water balance closure is affected by the multi objective calibration approach and optimized model parameters for respective rainfall input source this study shows that error propagation analysis for water balance assessment has great potential to improve application of satellite precipitation products in water management and decision making in the zambezi basin this study advises optimization of model parameters for each respective rainfall input data source so to identify outcomes and effects of respective rainfall data sources on the simulated water balance optimization of parameter sets by ɛ

provided upon request 1 introduction propagation effects of rainfall errors in streamflow simulation commonly are assessed by use of in situ observed rainfall fallah et al 2020 shin and kim 2019 this also is the case for the vastly ungauged zambezi basin in southern africa winsemius et al 2006 which supports livelihoods of over 40 million inhabitants hughes and farinosi 2020 a constraint to streamflow simulation and hydrological assessments of the basin s water balance is the low number of rain gauges that hinder quantitative assessments to overcome the constraints by limited rain gauge data satellite rainfall estimates sres can be considered to supplement or to replace rain gauge data satellite rainfall products provide areal coverages and allow construction of time series since observations are consistently repeated over time over the past decade a large number of studies have reported on sre s a wider consensus has developed that sres are affected by observation error various studies report on bias error i e systematic error propagation of sres that affect specific characteristics of simulated hydrographs such as peak flows chen et al 2020 low and high flows dang et al 2017 as well as the water balance as shown in catchment modelling alemu et al 2020 a study by jiang et al 2012 in china highlights sre bias error propagation by use of the semi distributed xinanjiang model and show that relatively small bias corrected rainfall errors do not distinctly affect model behaviour mei et al 2016 showed that larger bias errors propagated to cause significant streamflow mismatch when the integrated catchment hydrological model ichymod was applied in italys s upper adige river basin pan et al 2010 showed that the climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 satellite rainfall errors cause mismatches in simulated streamflow volume using the variable infiltration capacity vic model maggioni et al 2013 used a stochastic ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d in the tar pamlico basin and showed that cmorph rainfall bias errors are significantly augmented to cause streamflow mismatch in large basin sizes artan et al 2007 showed that in the mekong river s nam ou and se done basins a slight bias in cmorph rainfall augmented into simulated streamflow mismatch using the geospatial stream flow model geosfm in hydrological modelling evaluation of sre rainfall error propagation to streamflow mismatch and to water balance closure are topics of ongoing interest propagation of rainfall error to streamflow error by hydrological modelling commonly is evaluated by analysing mismatches between observed streamflow and simulated counterparts subject to respective rainfall input data sources for that purpose objective functions may be combined and optimized by use of automated single or multi objective model calibration algorithms see de vos and rientjes 2007 yapo et al 1998 identifies a set of optimal solutions model parameter sets based on a trade off between different objective functions de vos and rientjes 2007 showed that not all differences between simulated and observed hydrograph characteristics e g peak flows or low flows can be expressed adequately by a single objective function and optimized model parameter set rientjes et al 2013 monteil et al 2020 and shahed behrouz et al 2020 show that multi objective calibration allows the simultaneous evaluation of multiple outputs from the model these applications have been on knowledge driven hydrological model approaches and thus it is likely that aspects of satellite rainfall error propagation can be assessed from such a calibration approach in this study multi objective strategies are tested for sre error propagation to cause mismatch in streamflow hydrograph shape and volume specific hydrograph characteristics and composition of simulated model water balance effects on parameter optimization for rainfall input sources is shown as well in the kabompo basin a number of spatially distributed rainfall runoff model approaches have been used that relied on use of rain gauge data and sre s omondi 2017 applied the topographic driven model topmodel to assess effectiveness of satellite rainfall estimates for water balance assessment ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to determine the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the kabompo basin matos 2014 successfully used the swat model with sres on a daily time step to forecast flows for the zambezi river basin in the above studies no attempts were made to assess effects of sre errors on streamflow mismatch ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 although there are also ample scientific studies that sre are affected by systematic errors gumindoga et al 2019c this study seeks improved understanding of propagation effects of sre rainfall errors where the state of the art representative elementary watershed modelling approach reggiani and majid hassanizadeh 2016 is selected and applied at the kabompo headwater catchment of the zambezi river this study demonstrates how systematic errors i e bias errors in cmorph sres affect simulated streamflow outcomes of a physically based rainfall runoff model the study also shows how errors affect actual evapotranspiration eta with emphasis on closure of the water balance the findings are expected to provide new insights on the hydrologic implications of satellite rainfall error and serves applications in the zambezi basin 2 methodology 2 1 description of study area the kabompo river originates in north western province of zambia between the zambezi and congo river basins the river is approximately 440 km long the streamflow gauging station for kabompo river is located at watopa pontoon which is near the basin outlet and has an upstream catchment area of 67 261 km2 fig 1 the predominant soil types are ferralsols that are deep strongly leached clayey to loamy soils covering almost 70 of the study area arenosols that are sandy soils featuring very weak or no significant soil profile development exist and are dispersed in slightly divided plateau zones which shelter the southern and western part of the basin gumindoga et al 2019a landcover entails about 60 closed broadleaved deciduous forest 22 open broadleaved deciduous forest and the remainder closed to open shrublands kabompo basin has a sub tropical climate consisting of a wet season october april and a dry season may september rainfall is affected by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the mean annual precipitation ranges from 900 mm yr in the southern part to 1500 mm yr in the northern part of the basin actual evapotranspiration is around 785 mm yr omondi 2017 2 2 in situ observed meteorological and streamflow data daily meteorological data of six stations for the period 1998 2012 were obtained from the meteorological department of zambia and from the university of zambia this period was selected because of completeness of rainfall time series it is also common to find floods and drought within one hydro meteorological season the stations are kabompo kaoma kasempa mwinilunga solwezi and zambezi fig 1 although the network of the rain gauges is sparse with two stations inside the basin and four stations with average distance of 35 km outside of the catchment boundary the network may serve the objectives of this study as stations are well distributed across the study area and since screening of rainfall data indicated that observation time series are complete and of good quality meteorological observations maximum and minimum temperature rainfall relative humidity wind speed and sunshine were used to estimate daily potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman montheith method allen et al 1998 which were then used as input to a hydrological model for the same period daily streamflow data were obtained for watopa gauging station from the department of water affairs and water resources management authority of zambia after screening watopa station has an average long term flow of 216 m3 s i e 1 9 107 m3 year with highest flows up to 1570 m3 s observed in march and lowest flows down to 36 m3 s observed in september 2 3 bias correction of cmorph based rainfall cmorph rainfall half hourly estimates is a gridded precipitation product 8 km 8 km that combines high temporal resolution of infrared with the high retrieval accuracy of passive microwave satellite imagery the product obtained for the period 1998 2012 has successful applications in the zambezi basin gumindoga et al 2019a b as well as other african basins koriche rientjes 2016 haile et al 2013 hence the choice for its use in this study a detailed description of the product is found in joyce et al 2004 cmorph satellite rainfall images were downloaded from the noaa repository ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov prep cmorph v1 0 crt 8 km 0 30 m and aggregated to daily totals via the geonetcast isod toolbox of ilwis gis software http 52north org downloads bias in cmorph satellite rainfall estimate is corrected using data from six rain gauges and a space and time varying bias correction approach that was successfully applied for the zambezi basin gumindoga et al 2019a 2019b and the upper blue nile basin bhatti et al 2016 bias correction was performed from 1998 to 2012 that matches the period for error propagation assessment the bias correction factor adopted from bhatti et al 2016 and habib et al 2014 is calculated from a 7 day sequential time window that moves forward in the time domain for all days in the window an equal bias correction factor is calculated on conditions that for the window there is a minimum of five rainy days and a rainfall minimum accumulation depth of 5 mm when the above conditions are not met a bias correction factor of 1 applies to all 7 days in the window in the above approach bias factors vary in time and space since bias factors change value for each station for each 7 day window uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph rainfall estimates are compared to spatially interpolated gauged rainfall by means of the inverse distance approach by equal projection pixel to pixel comparison at 8 km 8 km pixel size and at daily time step is performed for pixels that overlay the study area to assess the match between gauge observations and uncorrected and corrected cmorph c counterparts correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae are used as statistical indicators 2 4 ɛ nsgaii for multi objective model calibration in this study multi objective calibration is performed for streamflow modelling for hydrograph shape and volume combinations of specific hydrograph characteristics and assessments of water balance composition and closure the epsilon dominance non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii ɛ nsgaii algorithm is applied yang et al 2014 to all cases to optimize model parameters of the rainfall runoff model section 2 5 the algorithm is an improved version of the nsgaii algorithm proposed by deb et al 2002 the main purpose of the genetic based search algorithm is optimisation of parameter values by fitting simulated streamflow hydrograph variables to observed counterparts such can be by single objective or multi objective functions important settings of the ɛ nsgaii that impact effectiveness of the genetic based optimization algorithm are simulated binary crossover sbx deb and agrawal 2005 and polynomial mutation pm deb and goyal 1996 occurrences of the crossover and mutation operations are complementary inputs which are controlled by the crossover rate crate jung et al 2017 notes that if the crate is 0 9 the rate of mutation is 0 1 function of ɛ nsgaii algorithm is based on a number of optimization metrics i e quality measures that assess cardinality accuracy and diversity of solutions as demonstrated in mostafaie et al 2018 the quality measures are the number of pareto solutions nps generation distance gd spacing sp and maximum spread ms 2 5 representative elementary watershed modelling in this study the representative elementary watershed rew model reggiani et al 1999 reggiani and rientjes 2005 is selected for streamflow simulation the catchment scale model is selected since the semi distributed model domain reads spatially distributed rainfall as input and since the model by means of an integrated physically based numerical approach simulates runoff production by hortonian and saturation excess overland flow and subsurface runoff contributions for shallow and deeper ground water this allows to intercompare model outcomes including water balance closure subject to selected rainfall input data sources the semi distributed model domain constitutes a set of interconnected prismatic volumes i e rew s that are organized around the stream channel network fig 2 to each flow zone in a rew conservation equations for mass momentum energy and entropy are averaged yielding global balance laws detailed descriptions on rew flow algorithms are found in reggiani et al 1999 and reggiani and rientjes 2005 whereas recent applications of the model are found in reggiani et al 2014 reggiani and hassanizadeh 2016 elgamal et al 2017 reference is made to gumindoga et al 2019a for an application of the rew model to the kabompo basin the model set up was adopted in this study as it is well suited for water balance closure assessments in this study 2 6 model calibration and benchmark for rainfall error propagation assessments hydrological modelling requires calibration that serves to optimize the model parameter set given observed rainfall and potential evapotranspiration that force the model for this study a rew model parameter set with sensitive model parameters was optimized by the ɛ nsgaii algorithm using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for the period from oct 1998 to sept 2002 the parameter set was validated for the period oct 2002 to sept 2006 by also using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for further parameter optimization cases in this study the set will be referred to as the original parameter set with best performing values for further optimization subject to selected sre rainfall input data source modelling cases and objective functions the selection of calibration and validation periods is based on data availability and completeness model performance is assessed from the y objective function akhtar et al 2009 rientjes et al 2013 that combines nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative volume error rve objective functions eqs 1 3 y becomes 1 when the model estimates perfectly match with observations and becomes 0 when nse is equal

2006 2012 that is outside periods of calibration and validation to assess effects of cmorph rainfall error propagation on hydrograph shape and volume through the y function the original parameter set was selected for all three rainfall data sources as such any difference in stream flow simulation results can be attributed to error propagation by the cmorph rainfall input data source subject to the original parameter set for simulation cases that target specific hydrograph characteristics table 1 and water balance assessments the original parameter set is optimized for respective rainfall input sources and selected objective functions as such by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm any aspect of error propagation by rainfall input data source is not affected by sub optimal model parameter values streamflow assessments for sre rainfall sources on streamflow hydrograph shape and volume y function use the original parameter set as such any mismatch in streamflow that results from respective rainfall input data sources is subject to the original parameter set similar to error assessments on rainfall input data sources for assessing mismatches on streamflow also correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae are used as statistical indicators to indicate effects of error propagation for different rainfall input data sources ratios of statistical indicators for streamflow qs and rainfall r are calculated by means of ccqs ccr maeqs maer and rmseqs rmser ratios are selected because they have different implications maeqs maer 1 and rmseqs rmser 1 implies error attenuation whereas ccqs ccr 1 implies augmentation of error whereas past studies e g hong et al 2006 employed error propagation procedures where objective function values are interpreted in this study the magnitude of the ratios was considered to indicate effects of propagation in a relative manner stream flow characteristics multi objective assessments for sre rainfall sources on specific stream flow hydrograph characteristics follow a procedure where for each set of objective functions table 2 and for each rainfall data source a best performing parameter set is used following optimization of the original parameter set by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm any difference in objective function values that indicate how well the simulated hydrographs characteristics match to observed counter parts can uniquely be attributed to the rainfall input source water balance water balance assessments imply that subject to the rainfall input data source water balance components will alter with different volumetric values for respective components the assessment consider the attribution of rainwater in actual evapotranspiration eta and streamflow qs and also accounts for rainwater storage in the model for error propagation analysis water balance ratios for actual evapotranspiration over rainfall eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and runoff over rainfall qs r runoff coefficient are computed from the rew simulation assessments for all three rainfall data sources are based on y function after rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for the assessment period besides ratios the optimized parameter values and water balance components are provided as outcome 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench mark for rainfall error propagation results of the rew model calibration october 1998 september 2002 and validation october 2002 september 2006 by use of interpolated in situ observed rainfall are shown in fig 3 for both periods model underestimation of highest flows and overestimation of low flows are observed hydrograph recession periods are also underestimated for few years observed streamflow hydrographs indicate that the kabompo basin is a slow responding system as is evident from lack of rapid changes in streamflow over short periods by high rainfall this is expected considering the large catchment size 67 261 km2 though the model shows small underestimation of highest peaks and small overestimation of baseflow the simulated streamflow successfully resembles the observed streamflow pattern during both the calibration y 0 77 and validation period y 0 71 these objective function values are appropriate to allow for error propagation analysis in this study for assessments on sre error propagation on streamflow mismatch fig 4 shows that for uncorrected cmorph the ratio ccqs ccr is 2 0 as compared to a lower ratio for corrected cmorph 1 2 any ratio greater 1 shows attenuation of error and thus a ratio close to 1 is more desirable for cc a ratio 1 shows attenuation of error and thus a ratio close to 1 indicates less propogation effect of rainfall for both maeqs maer and rveqs rver preferred ratio values are close to 1 a ratio less than 1 implies error attenuation whereas a ratio 1 shows error augmentation the ratio maeqs maer for uncorrected cmorph was 1 3 and indicates error augmentation whereas for bias corrected cmorph the ratio was 0 2 indicating error attenuation while there is no substantial difference between uncorrected and corrected cmorph for the rveqs rver ratio uncorrected cmorph however shows error augmentation 1 2 whereas bias corrected cmorph shows error attenuation 0 9 the error in uncorrected satellite rainfall is shown to amplify in streamflow simulations by the rew model when corrected cmorph is introduced there is attenuation of error in the context of error propagation and with reference to the absolute differences between corrected and uncorrected attenuation is more evident for mae followed by cc and less substantial for rve overall the ratios provide insights about the extent of error propagation from rainfall to streamflow mismatch substantial error is introduced by uncorrected cmorph whereas a small error is introduced by corrected cmorph the linear bias correction scheme indicates satisfying results in error reduction and is recommended for similar studies 3 2 streamflow for respective rainfall data sources fig 5 shows the rainfall error propagation simulated hydrograph for the period 2006 2012 except for baseflow all hydrograph characteristics show fair match between observed streamflow and the cmorph simulated streamflow time to peak of hydrograph shows that the best hydrograph simulation is indicated for rain gauge based simulation that is followed by bias corrected cmorph and uncorrected cmorph based streamflow simulation results there is consistent underestimation of baseflow there is smooth transition from recession limb to baseflow for the observed hydrograph and model simulations a drop at the start of baseflow is noted for bias corrected and uncorrected cmorph based simulations 3 3 streamflow hydrograph characteristics for respective rainfall data sources table 2 shows objective function values used to assess model performance by pairing of objective functions e g the use of nse and rmerv for high flows the approach involved further optimization of the original parameter set by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for respective rainfall sources this applies to all cases in table 2 peak flow though physical inspection of hydrographs seemingly indicate that all graphs coincide for the highest peaks in each year t hydrographs for uncorrected cmorph rainfall are not accurate on the timing of the peak flows this is based on time to peak objective function that only is applied to highest peak flow for each year for the period 2006 2012 bias corrected rainfall show better matching with observed streamflow peaks as compared to uncorrected cmorph for all three rainfall sources the multi objective calibration approach in this study improves the m4e by penalising for overestimation of peak flows there is a trade off between having good overall fit and having accurate timing to the peak flow in days so further research is suggested for a modelling approach so to improve on the trade offs de vos and rientjes 2005 note that m4e may fail to show effects of a time shift in the runoff series high flows high flows are defined as flows above the threshold of 500 m3 s that coincides with the 75th percentile value range of all observations table 2 shows that the nse values for both corrected and uncorrected cmorph are in the same order of magnitude for high flows all in range of 0 64 0 69 the multi objective parameter optimization by the ɛ nsgaii algorithm has preference towards improving hydrograph pattern higher nse and good agreement of high flows lower rmerv the combination of nse and rmerv gives satisfactory results for bias corrected cmorph rainfall simulations uncorrected cmorph indicated poor results for both nse and rmerv objective functions low flows low flows are flow discharges below the threshold of 95 m3 s that coincides with the 25th percentile value range of all observations fig 5 shows that there is match of high flows rising and falling limbs at the costs of matching low flows simulation results possibly are affected by the original parameter set which caused that low flows were over estimated throughout the entire calibration period see fig 3 simulation results in table 2 show relatively poor objective function values for rmael and msle results on magnitude of the low flows indicates satisfying results for bias corrected cmorph as compared to uncorrected cmorph the model simulation with uncorrected cmorph was successful only for flow values below 25 m3 s in table 2 a large increase in the value of rmael is observed for uncorrected cmorph compared to corrected cmorph furthermore rmael seems to be more appropriate for model calibration than msle although msle is used more often demirel and booij 2009 madsen 2000 recession limb simulation results in fig 5 with uncorrected cmorph show that the shapes of annual recession curves are not adequately matched as compared to streamflow simulated by in situ rainfall this is because of poor rainfall representation by cmorph in the dry season see gumindoga et al 2019c table 2 shows that the simulation with bias corrected cmorph rainfall results in improved simulation of the recession limb this is evidenced by r k of 2 3 for uncorrected cmorph compared to r k 1 4 for bias corrected cmorph an r k closer to 1 is preferred shape of rising limb fig 5 shows that yearly rising limbs are well simulated as compared to other hydrograph characteristics except for the recession limb there is an improved mse of 0 0018 m3 s for bias corrected cmorph as compared to mse of 0 0095 m3 s for uncorrected cmorph as shown in table 2 similarly an msde value of 6 3 e 5 m3 s is achieved for uncorrected cmorph as compared to an improved value of 4 5 e 7 m3 s for bias corrected cmorph overall there is closeness of fit between simulated and observed rising and falling limbs when bias corrected cmorph rainfall is used 3 4 effect of rainfall data source on the water balance the percentage ratios for water balance coefficients eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and qs r runoff coefficient are shown in fig 6 ratios are calculated for all three rainfall data input sources for the period 2006 2012 error assessment period highest eta r is shown for bias corrected cmorph 23 as compared to uncorrected cmorph 16 changes in eta r for the same error assessment period are not equal to changes in qs r in the model indicating that the model responds to actual water storage by rainfall the results show that the rainfall input source affect the model simulated water balance as the above mentioned differences are more evident for uncorrected than for corrected cmorph results also show that for uncorrected cmorph approximately 9 of rainfall received is converted to runoff for the period 2006 2012 evapotranspiration coefficient shows differences for uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph based simulations however the runoff coefficient does not significantly change when changing the rainfall input data source omondi 2017 noted that the low runoff coefficient also implies that most of rainwater in the catchment infiltrates into the soils causing delayed peak runoff table 2 3 5 water balance closure and parameter optimization table 3 shows a comparison of water balance components subject to optimized parameter sets for respective rainfall inputs by rerunning the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for the original parameter set the y function was selected as objective function eq 1 water balance closure represents the water balance equation residual term that is expressed as percentage of rainfall a residual 1 44 is shown for rain gauge based rainfall input compared to 2 67 for bias corrected satellite rainfall estimates and 15 91 for uncorrected cmorph improved closure for corrected cmorph is also indicated by the higher y objective function after model calibration the study also assessed how model parameters are affected by error in the rainfall inputs after bias correction is applied each rainfall distribution in situ uncorrected and bias corrected cmorph represents its own amount of rain water that serves model forcing as such the rew model responds to the amount of water that it receives table 3 also shows results of water balance closure analysis and the different water balance terms that result from the model because of the change of rainfall input source respective optimized model parameter values are also indicated lee et al 2005 reggiani and rientjes 2005 2010 varado et al 2006 soil porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and water content at saturation have values within the allowable value ranges even after bias correction sensitive parameters that control the volume of the simulated hydrograph show large changes compared to the parameters using rain gauge input factors that control groundwater table depth and eventually baseflows are less affected 3 6 pareto distributions fig 7a l shows pareto distributions for sensitive parameters water content at saturation and soil porosity optimization of parameter values by running the ɛ nsgaii algorithm for respective rainfall input sources resulted in different trade offs in the y objective function assessments are made for all hydrograph characteristics but results presented only for low flows high flows and overall shape for the same forcing data and objective functions table 2 a range of optimum model parameter values result that all perform equally well subject to ɛ nsgaii parameter optimization the curve shape of the output is the actual pareto front that shows the trade off between criterion 1 x axis and 2 y axis for example if value of water content at saturation improves then for soil porosity it deteriorates and vice versa but any combination shows an equal optimal solution all the pareto plots fig 7a l multi objective optimization results in fair spread indicating consistent optimization a shift of the pareto front toward the origin of the axes indicates in a relative sense error attenuation by the selected bias correction scheme such an approach provides a useful guidance for model improvement visual inspection fig 7 and analysis of the quality measures of ɛ nsgaii algorithm for calibrating the rew model based on the y function reveal an improved performance for bias corrected cmorph rainfall input compared to uncorrected cmorph the in situ rainfall input shows much better performance in rainfall runoff modelling a greater nps number indicates that the algorithm is better suited to provide a greater number of pareto solutions whereas a better optimization algorithm provide lower gd an algorithm with a smaller sp indicates that the solutions are distributed nearly uniformly making it a good measure to evaluate diversity larger maximum spread values ms indicate a good performance of the algorithm as demonstrated in forootan 2018 a hydrograph overall shape can be thought of as representing averaged conditions of all the other hydrograph characteristic results on quality measures as presented for overall hydrograph shape show the number of pareto solutions nps 50 for rain gauge corrected and uncorrected cmorph maximum spread ms 2 9 rain gauge 2 3 corrected cmorph 0 98 uncorrected cmorph generational distance gd 0 11 rain gauge 0 19 corrected cmoprh 0 22 uncorrected cmorph and spacing sp 1

runoff model parameters of the model were optimized using the ɛ nsgaii algorithm assessments on error propagation targeted streamflow modelling for hydrograph shape and volume specific hydrograph characteristics and water balance composition from this study 4 conclusions are drawn i bench mark for rainfall error propagation the rew model successfully simulated runoff in the kabompo basin using interpolated in situ observed rainfall for calibration and validation periods although some underestimation of highest flows and overestimation of low flows is shown sources of uncertainty and error that could contribute to the mismatch are rainfall representation inaccurate representation of catchment characteristics such as land cover and stage discharge relationship ii streamflow hydrograph mismatch by rainfall error propagation ratio indicators that show streamflow error by sre error indicate that attenuation is more evident for mae followed by cc and less substantial for rve functions ratios of maeqs maer for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 1 3 and 0 2 ratios of ccqs ccr for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 2 0 and 1 2 and ratios of rveqs rver for uncorrected and corrected cmorph are 1 2 and 0 9 this approach showed improved numeric evaluation of cmorph error propagation as compared to previous studies in the kabompo basin and other catchment basins of the zambezi river results of indicators are affected by use of the original i e calibrated parameter set that was applied to all three rainfall data sources potentially smaller effects of sre errors may occur when rainfall runoff simulations are repeated with optimized parameters sets for each respective rainfall input data source iii mismatch of hydrograph characteristics by rainfall error propagation multi objective parameter optimization enables a more reliable and robust evaluation procedure and error propagation assessment for specific hydrograph characteristics though physical inspection of hydrographs seemingly indicate that all graphs coincide for the highest peaks in each year the simulations with uncorrected cmorph rainfall generally are not accurate on the hydrograph characteristics for example the simulation with bias corrected cmorph rainfall results in improved simulation of the recession limb r k of 2 3 for uncorrected cmorph compared to r k 1 4 for bias corrected cmorph there is also closeness of fit between simulated and observed rising and falling limbs when bias corrected cmorph rainfall is used matching of streamflow hydrograph shows best overall fit in the simulation period for rain gauge based simulation that is followed by bias corrected cmorph and uncorrected cmorph based streamflow simulation results objective function values indicate that bias corrected cmorph sre s results in attenuation of cmorph rainfall bias error iv effect of error propagation on the water balance closure percentage ratios for water balance coefficients eta r evapotranspiration coefficient and qs r runoff coefficient show improved water balance closure for bias corrected cmorph as compared to uncorrected cmorph findings also show that water balance closure is affected by the multi objective calibration approach and optimized model parameters for respective rainfall input source this study shows that error propagation analysis for water balance assessment has great potential to improve application of satellite precipitation products in water management and decision making in the zambezi basin this study advises optimization of model parameters for each respective rainfall input data source so to identify outcomes and effects of respective rainfall data sources on the simulated water balance optimization of parameter sets by ɛ

8123,study region lake como watershed between northern italy and switzerland europe study focus we analyse the potential vulnerabilities of existing water management practice in sub alpine regulated lakes we comparatively explore a wide range of inflow scenarios using a bottom up approach relying on synthetic alteration of observed climate drivers and a top down procedure working with both cmip5 and cmip6 projections we then run an anova to backtrack components of variability in the projected lake inflows to key uncertainty sources new hydrological insights for the region results show a general worsening of lake management performance under the top down projections with respect to the equivalent bottom up scenarios with the cmip6 ensemble yielding worst conditions than cmip5 moreover the top down physically based scenarios highlight non linear patterns of climatic hydrological variability that challenge historical management while bottom up projections overlook these trends the results of the anova demonstrate that at mid century the choice of the general circulation model is the dominant factor influencing the variability while climate patterns become more relevant toward the end of the century overall our study provides numerical evidence of the ongoing and projected impact of climate change on sub alpine regions and outlines how different inflow scenarios generation approaches result in different inflow variability and associated risk assessment keywords hydro climatic variability lake operation hydrological modelling climate change sixth assessment report data availability available under request 1 introduction water from the alps is paramount for sustaining many european rivers and lakes as it supports a variety of water related activities alpine hydropower contributes about 13 of the italian national production gaudard et al 2014 gse gestore servizi energetici 2021 water from the alps mostly reaches the po valley which is the most productive agricultural area of europe where farming areas cover 45 of the catchment bocchiola et al 2013 giuliani et al 2016a and contribute to 35 of italian agricultural production zullo et al 2019 besides the po valley hosts 21 m people and 48 of italian industries ibidem recent fallout of climate change on the cryosphere driven hydrology of the alps is widely acknowledged bocchiola 2014 fatichi et al 2015 gobiet et al 2014 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 with increasing evidence of higher runoff during fall due to more liquid than solid precipitation and of decreasing summer inflow due to reduced snow cover earlier thaw and glaciers down wasting aili et al 2019 beniston and stoffel 2014 confortola et al 2014 these alterations of the alpine hydrological regime will substantially negatively impact a wide range of water users calling for timely adaptation of existing water management strategies anghileri et al 2018 brekke et al 2009 haguma et al 2014 climate change adaptation is emerging as a key challenge for the complex infrastructure system controlling water distribution to a variety of multisectoral and often competing water demands including hydropower production irrigation supply flood control ecological flows and tourism galelli et al 2010 in this paper we analyse the potential vulnerabilities of existing water management strategies in the po valley when exposed to changing climate conditions in particular the proposed approach is applied to the lake como system one of the most important multi purpose regulated lakes in northern italy to quantify the impacts of climate change in the lake como system we implement two different but complementary methods namely i a bottom up approach i e a set of scenarios generated by independently re sampling the main climatic variables over predefined ranges of variability ii a top down approach i e a simulation based analysis relying upon an ensemble of ipcc scenarios simulated by global circulation models gcms and properly downscaled to represent the local conditions of the study area through the first method we evaluate the robustness of the system against a wide range of potential changes in a single or in few climatic drivers however such method explores first order i e changes of the mean values variability and does not consider i mutual interactions between climate variables such as temperature and precipitation nor ii higher order e g changes in variance effects changing seasonal patterns or frequency of extreme events storms wet dry spells heat waves thus they do not represent physically consistent patterns of climate and do not explore full potential variability thereby brown and wilby 2012 culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2010 the second method instead considers physically based plausible scenarios including interconnection between weather variables and higher order variability changes in the variance seasonal behaviour frequency distribution etc they are however less useful to identify sensitivity to single drivers and they need local downscaling especially for precipitation groppelli et al 2011a to pursue our top down approach we consider here ipcc climate change scenarios relative to the fifth assessment report ar5 and the sixth assessment report ar6 ar6 couples shared socio economic pathways ssps that consider e g investments in education health and energy development with updated representative concentration pathways rcps already used in the ar5 relative to greenhouse gases ghg emissions and land use changes scenarios fuso et al 2021 the use of different ar5 ar6 ipcc scenarios rcps ssps as input to different climate and hydrological models may broaden the projection range and uncertainty thereby herman et al 2020 finally to evaluate the main sources of variability of our projected scenarios we carry out an uncertainty analysis using the anova method since the choice of a specific hydrological model may bias the analysis of the projected hydrologic regimes in our analysis we use two hydrological models namely topkapi fatichi et al 2015 and poli hydro aili et al 2019 soncini et al 2017 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section we introduce the case study area and the data used then the methodology is explained in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 and in section 5 main findings and conclusions are given 2 case study the case study area is the lake como system fig 1 located between the central italian alps and the agricultural districts of the po valley the lake has an estimated volume of ca 23 4 km3 and it is operated at the olginate dam under multiple constraints anghileri et al 2011 denaro et al 2017 giuliani et al 2016b giuliani and castelletti 2016 the lake release supplies downstream water demand to hydroelectric plants and to four irrigation districts over an area of 1400 km2 with maxima in june and july ca 226 m3s 1 and minima in winter nearby 90 m3s 1 these values correspond to the water rights negotiated by the different negotiation consortia main cultivated crops are maize grassland rice wheat sugar beets with production comparable to the most productive areas of europe east flanders alsace noord bradant and schleswig holstein bocchiola et al 2013 bocchiola 2015 the second objective of the lake management is to avoid shoreline floods i e by maintaining lake level below the lowest point on the lake shores in the city of como corresponding to a water stage of 1 24 m referred to hydrometric zero 197 37 m asl giuliani et al 2016b management of the lake is constrained with a downstream ecological flow of 5 m3s 1 denaro et al 2017 operation therein aims at minimizing the irrigation deficit with respect to demand and the yearly number of days with shoreline floods considering a small regulation capacity average inflow to capacity ratio of 6 anghileri et al 2011 lake como collects water from the large adda river catchment draining an area of 4438 km2 between italy and switzerland 90 and 10 respectively and with an altitude range between 255 m asl and 4000 m asl the lake is laid within a temperate region but the catchment has a cold climate in the mountain areas and largely cryosphere driven hydrology aili et al 2019 bombelli et al 2019 peel et al 2007 2 1 data meteorological data are used as input to the hydrological models poli hydro ph and topkapi eth tpk the driving variables are temperature t precipitation p and geographic topographically corrected radiation rad these data were collected for a control run cr period 2009 2018 as made available from the automatic weather stations aws grid of arpa lombardia the regional protection agency for the environment daily data are available from 13 awss homogeneously distributed in the case study area for model tuning daily inlet discharges to lake como are used such data were provided by the consorzio dell adda a consortium managing the lake outlet and obtained using inverse flow routing starting from collected data at the hydrometer in malgrate moreover satellite images of snow covered area sca were collected for the entire cr period every two weeks from march 14th to june 18th these images were acquired by the sensor modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on board the satellite terra 3 methodology we focus upon the impact of hydrological changes driven by prospective climate change upon lake operation such impact was quantified using indexes of operation failure for this purpose we set up two hydrological models poli hydro and topkapi eth to simulate the inlet discharge to the lake necessary for benchmarking against future hydrological scenarios also obtained using these hydrological models an operational model of the lake is tuned against the historical operational data to closely mimicking historical operation patterns subsequently we benchmark operation efficiency against prospective climate and hydrology under the proposed two fold approach namely by i bottom up b u obtained by making incremental changes to climate variables δt δp i e with a step wise approach providing a reference exposure space and ii top down t d using physically based climate scenarios e g under the ipcc framework locally downscaled we calculate the failures in terms of irrigation deficit and the number of floods under the b u approach and then benchmark against those under the t d approach climate scenarios are taken from the outputs of global circulation models gcms under the ar5 ar6 of ipcc we use three gcms for each ar three representative concentration pathways rcps for ar5 and four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps for ar6 for a total of 21 scenarios for each of these 21 scenarios two reference periods with length of thirty years as often required in hydro climatological analysis are considered 2041 2070 half century p1 and 2071 2100 end of century p2 for a total of 42 projected periods each of such climate scenarios is then operated using the two hydrological models to obtain projected hydrological input to the lake 84 flow series the methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 bottom up and top down approaches for each hydrological model a control run inflow series i e based upon climate during 2009 2018 is generated from outflow discharge and lake level it is possible to verify the fulfilment of ecological flow always fulfilled in practice in our simulations irrigation demand changing with the season and available daily and flood protection i e days of flooding at a daily scale the incremental step b u used for temperature is δts 1 c and a range of δt from 2 c to 8 c is considered for precipitation a multiplicative correction is applied consistently with the inherently positive nature of rainfall values in the range of δp from 15 to 20 is used with an incremental step of δps 5 the range of variation for t p is chosen after a preliminary screening based upon the ipcc scenarios for consistency the inlet discharge to lake como is simulated for each b u scenario i e each combination of δt and δp with the two hydrological models previously tuned ph and tpk see below then the same calculation is pursued for the top down t d approach i e using climate scenarios as obtained from the gcms processed by the hydrological models ph tpk here 3 rcps of the ar5 and 4 ssps of the ar6 are used series of temperature and precipitation are obtained from 3 gcms for the ar5 and from the corresponding 3 gcms for the ar6 specifically we use ec earth hazeleger et al 2012 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 and echam6 stevens et al 2013 from ar5 and ec earth3 0 ec earth consortium ec earth 2019 cesm2 danabasoglu et al 2020 and echam6 3 mauritsen et al 2019 for the ar6 the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are used for the ar5 and ssp 2 6 ssp 4 5 ssp 7 0 and ssp 8 5 are used for the ar6 the daily series of t p are downscaled locally groppelli et al 2011a 2011b to obtain series of weather variables consistent with the hydrological model spatial resolution precipitation is downscaled with a stochastic space random cascade model which reproduces the mean and the variance of the observed data whereas temperature is downscaled using a correction with a mean monthly δt approach eventually 21 scenarios are obtained and simulated with each hydrological model to derive inlet discharges then lake outflow and level are simulated via operation the simulation is carried out for the period 2019 2100 but two representative periods are examined for each scenario namely 2041 2070 p1 and 2071 2100 p2 then the so obtained 42 t d scenarios 21 climate scenarios 2 periods are overlapped to the 2 exposure spaces i e regular grid for b u approach for ph tpk based upon their average temperature and precipitation variation with respect to the cr period 3 2 hydrological models poli hydro and topkapi eth two hydrological models poli hydro ph and topkapi tpk were previously tuned in this area giudici et al 2020 fuso et al 2021 respectively ph and tpk use a regular grid for the simulation of the water budget and for each cell they need information on land cover and elevation both ph and tpk simulate snow and ice melt using a mixed degree day approach based on average daily temperature and short wave radiation aili et al 2019 while tpk considers glacier melt basing on a temperature index method pellicciotti et al 2005 ph also simulates the dynamics of glaciers calculating ice flow and mass balance and updating glacier volume and area aili et al 2019 bombelli et al 2019 ph uses a single soil layer with isotropic conductivity changing with soil saturation whereas tpk considers three layers and a vertical horizontal conductivity potential evapotranspiration in ph is assessed via hargreaves formula whereas tpk uses priestley taylor s equation to increase the reliability of future projections it was important to attain a good calibration of the hydrological models and to properly represent the main flow components in the area especially as given by seasonal snow melt krysanova et al 2020 accordingly we pursue model tuning i e for degree day of snow also based upon observed snow melt dynamics we use seasonal snow cover area sca as estimated using modis images multi targeted model tuning in cryospheric areas results in an accurate description of hydrological processes thereby so better capturing the impacts of climate changes especially with respect to temperature which is the main driver of seasonal cryospheric melting e g soncini et al 2017 in table 1 we report the results of calibration of ph and tpk in the control period 2009 2018 3 3 operational model the operational model simulates lake operation i e daily releases and by solving a mass balance equation with the net inflow to lake como the daily storages and generates a set of pareto optimal operations diversely balancing the two targets of flood control and water supply downstream as a reference policy we select the one more closely mimicking historical operation patterns as observed from discharge data at the downstream hydrometer in malgrate li 2016 this is done to benchmark future operation performance against the presently adopted strategies rather than against theoretically optimal ones that are not implemented in practice the set of optimal operating policies p at the daily scale is 1 p arg min p j j flo j irr where p is a closed loop control policy that for each time step day determines water release over the next 24 h based on the day of the year and lake level parameterized as a gaussian radial basis function the term p describes alternative regulation of the lake over the historical climate conditions j flo and j irr are the annual average number of floods d y 1 and the average squared daily water irrigation deficit m3s 2d 1 castelletti et al 2010 2008 denaro et al 2017 giuliani et al 2015 2016c giuliani and castelletti 2016 then using the operational model for each year of simulation of the cr period the number of days with shoreline flooding and the irrigation deficit are calculated the value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the deficit flood distribution i e exceedance in one year out of ten is used as a reference threshold to benchmark performance success failure under both b u and t d approaches kasprzyk et al 2013 the simulation with the operational model is also carried out for each scenario under the b u approach to define areas of failure of the system in the exposure space in terms of irrigation deficit or flood failure j flo and j irr are calculated also for the t d scenarios to define the differences in failure between the b u approach and the t d one 3 4 analysis of variance we explore possible sources of uncertainty in projections of climate change impacts upon the hydrology of the lake como catchment using a large number of climate scenarios and a multi hydrological model approach enlarges the potential range of future projections thereby increasing uncertainty krysanova et al 2020 to quantify the share of variability uncertainty brought by each of these components into the hydrological scenarios we perform a three way anova analysis of variance aryal et al 2019 we analyse monthly flows to exploit seasonal differences within flow formation processes and future projections thereby total flow process variance was expressed as 2 sst s s hydro s s gcm s s rcp ssp s s res therein sst is the total sum of squares ss hydro ss gcm and ss rcp ssp are the sum of squares referred to the main effects of the hydrological model gcm and ipcc scenario respectively the interaction effects and the sum of squares of residues are quantified into ss res which correspond to the intrinsic variability of the flow variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological projections under ipcc climate change scenarios ar5 ar6 in figs 3 5 we report the quantitative link between changes in precipitation and discharge distributed seasonally an increase in total yearly precipitation results in an increase in total discharge and vice versa a decrease in precipitation leads to a reduction in inflows however almost all values are laid below the sector s diagonal i e discharge increases less or decreases more than precipitation fig 3 this results from a growth in evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures e g groppelli et al 2011b although some scenarios show an increase in annual discharge summer discharge always decreases fig 4 and more consistently so under ar6 scenarios than under ar5 scenarios fig 5 shows that for a raise in annual discharge fall discharge increases more than proportionally and mainly so under ar5 scenarios instead for a decrease in the total discharge some scenarios still exhibit a positive variation of fall discharge and others display a little decrease in the latter in response to a precipitation increase of 10 15 total annual discharge increases fig 3 however such an increase of 12 13 does not imply an increase in summer discharge fig 4 under negative changes in precipitation lower yearly discharge is foreseen fig 3 however some scenarios still show fall discharge rising due to an increase of precipitation in fall fig 5 and tables 2 3 looking at the results of the anova fig 6 in relative form under both ar5 ar6 and in both periods p1 p2 uncertainty in flow projection is governed more by climate projections and internal variability than by the choice of the hydrological model under ar5 the main source of uncertainty is due to the choice of the gcms and to the inner meteo hydrological variability both in p1 and p2 fig 6 a and c the projected precipitation under ar5 displays somewhat higher variability than under ar6 fig 3 accordingly inflows thereby are more largely variable under ar6 less variability of precipitation amount is detected with respect to ar5 mainly in p2 so in the rainy season the uncertainty resulting from the gcm is smaller than those deriving from the internal variability of the meteo hydrological process intrinsically variable by nature fig 6d especially at the end of the century in spring and summer uncertainty is largely governed by the choice of the ipcc scenarios rcps ssps fig 6 c and d at mid century temperature increases similarly for all scenarios while at the end of the century temperature changes are very different across scenarios and so the choice of a given scenario is crucial and choice of gcm becomes less important anova results in absolute terms also indicate seasonal uncertainty of inflow projection fig 7 globally the total uncertainty increases between p1 and p2 both for ar5 and ar6 october november and june august show the highest variance uncertainty likely due to the influence of the variability of precipitation and temperature range respectively 4 2 vulnerability analysis figs 8 and 9 show the exposure space b u approach and the results of the t d approach using ph and tpk b u scenarios circles and t d scenarios ar5 and ar6 for two representative periods p1 2041 2070 and p2 2071 2100 are reported the b u scenarios cover the entire exposure space and define the failure regions for number of floods red region and irrigation deficit yellow region the purple region includes the b u scenarios where both objectives display failure and the blue points represent the region of success combination of δt and δp with no failure t d scenarios are overlapped with the same colours with their proper values of δt and δp against the cr period in the future overall operation performance declines in terms of irrigation flood for seasonal precipitation decrease increase considering the b u scenarios some differences between ph and tpk can be seen ph provides increasing vs the cr irrigation deficit for any temperature increase and precipitation reduction whereas tpk keeps an acceptable performance for a small decrease of precipitation and increase of temperature focusing upon differences between the b u scenarios and t d scenarios two main differences can be pointed out for poli hydro ar5 scenarios with an increase of precipitation between 10 and 15 provide also increased irrigation deficit in contrast with the b u scenarios for topkapi likewise the failure in both objectives is observed mainly with a precipitation increase between 5 and 10 both under ar5 and ar6 scenarios looking at figs 3 and 4 while annual precipitation and annual discharge increase summer discharge decreases thus larger irrigation deficits may still be expected which were not highlighted in the b u scenario moreover for ph flood failures are observed under ar6 scenarios even with a temperature change of ca 6 c and a decrease in precipitation down to 10 which does not occur under the b u scenarios flood failures under temperature increase higher than 5 c figs 8 9 could derive from an increase in liquid precipitation at the expense of snowfall indeed an increase in fall discharge is seen in response to increasing liquid precipitation in fall fig 5 and tables 2 3 such results come as a consequence of the seasonal variability of climate supplementary material p and t as projected by the adopted gcms under the t d approach such circumstances could bring criticalities in lake operation undetected when using a b u approach to evaluate the link between climatic variables seasonal discharges and operation performance a correlation analysis is performed table 2 for ph and table 3 for tpk we consider seasonal climate for cr p1 and p2 for each gcm and rcp ssp and the corresponding inflows and the final performance indexes irrigation flood in the tables the significant correlations significance level of 95 reported in the supplementary material that are larger than 0 6 or smaller than 0 6 are highlighted in bold looking at climate variables as expected seasonal temperatures are highly correlated with yearly temperature for both ph and tpk similarly seasonal precipitation affects seasonal discharge to assess the degree of correlation between climatic hydrological variables and flood failure we use the daily flooding volume during floods δh more linked to weather and hydrological conditions rain stream flows than the number of days with flood our results show that irrigation deficit mainly correlates to summer discharge 0 62 for ph 0 84 for tpk and less to summer temperature and spring summer precipitation whereas floods are mostly affected by fall flows especially for ph 0 62 ph 0 57 tpk figs 10 and 11 display the magnitude of failure in terms of irrigation deficit and number of floods for ph and tpk for the 42t d scenarios here processed for both ph and tpk the light blue circles display failure thresholds for the two objectives calculated as the 90th percentile on the cr period series 2009 2018 as reported above the threshold values are q t 801 3 m3s 1 for ph and q t 1768 87 m3s 1 for tpk and 52 days for ph and 56 days for tpk for irrigation deficit and flood respectively results show that the most critical condition in terms of irrigation deficit is given under ar6 scenarios with δt of approx 6 c with the highest values for tpk than for ph concerning flood failure ph and tpk provide similar outcomes with respect to the ar5 scenarios the main differences occur between ar5 and ar6 since tpk exhibits flood failure mainly under ar5 scenarios the threshold values for the two objectives are calculated also considering the observed inflow data during cr 2009 2018 resulting in q t 1212 25 m3s 1 for irrigation deficit and 51 days of shoreline flood thresholds for flood failure days is almost the same for ph tpk instead the irrigation failure threshold q t is quite different for ph and tpk and the value from observations is an average between the two which depends clearly upon the different flow dynamics as depicted by the two models inflow values and flow volumes in time affecting reservoir s management however under future climate projections we detected large failures not comparable with the historical ones accordingly the disturbance given by using hydrologically modelled flows is lower than the changes resulting from climatic scenarios e g the loss of effectiveness of the current operation policies in the future is higher than the perturbation caused by the choice of the hydrological model 5 conclusions the bottom up approach pursued here relatively easy to implement is largely used in climate change impact assessment exercise brown et al 2012 culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2010 namely to provide the sensitivity of a system to the changing climate and possibly to propose a simplified range of future projections to decision makers the use of physically based scenarios t d approach implies larger work to collect gcms projections and subsequently downscale them a large number of t d scenarios is necessary and as a consequence one also needs to carry out time consuming hydrological simulations for each scenario however several simulations are necessary also for the b u approach moreover the choice of the gcms ensembles may influence the results of the assessment brown et al 2012 in this work we demonstrate that the results of a t d approach highlights some criticalities of the system that the b u approach does not display this is due to the non linear influence of climate change as projected upon seasonality and amount of precipitation snow accumulation and melt thereby also mediated by temperature and modified frequency extent of flood drought events for instance changing in timing and seasonality of precipitation is an important aspect to consider in hydrological projections for its effect on discharge that homogeneous linear changes in the average values cannot identify christensen and lettenmaier 2007 ecmwf 2019 quinn et al 2018 in the supplementary material to this paper seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation and the effect upon inflow at lake como is reported the use of a t d scenario allows to explore physically based complex scenarios of climate variability and the impact upon hydrological systems manning et al 2009 and therefore the gain of information obtained by considering ipcc or anyway physically based scenarios for proper climate change impact assessment and decision making can be highlighted the results of our anova test are coherent with other studies see e g wiley and palmer 2008 anghileri et al 2011 aryal et al 2019 in that they identify in the choice of any given gcm the largest source of uncertainty in the short term fig 6 here however shows that the influence of gcm choice is less relevant under ar6 than under ar5 this may indicate that the increased consistency of global circulation modelling under ar6 may result in less spreading of climate hydrological projections under the same ssp this is a desirable feature when it comes to the reduction of uncertainty in the assessment of hydrological projections and subsequent operation performance to further improve this work one may consider using more climate models including e g regional models and more hydrological models albeit using only two models does not provide a full multi model analysis it may increase our confidence in the projected hydrological conditions and highlight the contribution of the model s choice to the uncertainty of projections krysanova et al 2020 also in pursuing the t d approach different downscaling approaches may be explored especially critical for precipitation the downscaling method adopted here is statistical see groppelli et al 2011b 2011a but other methods may be considered on the other side the b u approach may be revised as well to include non linearity of the system also a refined evaluation of the future potential irrigation demand may be done in the future under climate change scenarios an increase of evapotranspiration as driven by the increase of temperature and a reduction of summer precipitation in the irrigated area of po valley is expected with a consequent potential increase of water demand for crop irrigation bocchiola 2015 for this reason the irrigation deficit from lake como could be higher eventually one potential solution could be a change of crop from a high water demanding to a less water demanding species on the other hand re optimization of the lake como dam operation could help to reduce this problem culley et al 2016 and further effort may be devoted thereby our results here albeit preliminary and amenable to improvement notwithstanding provide a possibly dependable tool to assess vulnerable lake operation under climate change during the xxi century especially when adopting a t d approach as we did here and to support the implementation of adaptation strategies from policy makers also the template we propose may be applied to other lakes reservoirs within the alps and other areas to preliminarily assess water management under climate

8123,study region lake como watershed between northern italy and switzerland europe study focus we analyse the potential vulnerabilities of existing water management practice in sub alpine regulated lakes we comparatively explore a wide range of inflow scenarios using a bottom up approach relying on synthetic alteration of observed climate drivers and a top down procedure working with both cmip5 and cmip6 projections we then run an anova to backtrack components of variability in the projected lake inflows to key uncertainty sources new hydrological insights for the region results show a general worsening of lake management performance under the top down projections with respect to the equivalent bottom up scenarios with the cmip6 ensemble yielding worst conditions than cmip5 moreover the top down physically based scenarios highlight non linear patterns of climatic hydrological variability that challenge historical management while bottom up projections overlook these trends the results of the anova demonstrate that at mid century the choice of the general circulation model is the dominant factor influencing the variability while climate patterns become more relevant toward the end of the century overall our study provides numerical evidence of the ongoing and projected impact of climate change on sub alpine regions and outlines how different inflow scenarios generation approaches result in different inflow variability and associated risk assessment keywords hydro climatic variability lake operation hydrological modelling climate change sixth assessment report data availability available under request 1 introduction water from the alps is paramount for sustaining many european rivers and lakes as it supports a variety of water related activities alpine hydropower contributes about 13 of the italian national production gaudard et al 2014 gse gestore servizi energetici 2021 water from the alps mostly reaches the po valley which is the most productive agricultural area of europe where farming areas cover 45 of the catchment bocchiola et al 2013 giuliani et al 2016a and contribute to 35 of italian agricultural production zullo et al 2019 besides the po valley hosts 21 m people and 48 of italian industries ibidem recent fallout of climate change on the cryosphere driven hydrology of the alps is widely acknowledged bocchiola 2014 fatichi et al 2015 gobiet et al 2014 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 with increasing evidence of higher runoff during fall due to more liquid than solid precipitation and of decreasing summer inflow due to reduced snow cover earlier thaw and glaciers down wasting aili et al 2019 beniston and stoffel 2014 confortola et al 2014 these alterations of the alpine hydrological regime will substantially negatively impact a wide range of water users calling for timely adaptation of existing water management strategies anghileri et al 2018 brekke et al 2009 haguma et al 2014 climate change adaptation is emerging as a key challenge for the complex infrastructure system controlling water distribution to a variety of multisectoral and often competing water demands including hydropower production irrigation supply flood control ecological flows and tourism galelli et al 2010 in this paper we analyse the potential vulnerabilities of existing water management strategies in the po valley when exposed to changing climate conditions in particular the proposed approach is applied to the lake como system one of the most important multi purpose regulated lakes in northern italy to quantify the impacts of climate change in the lake como system we implement two different but complementary methods namely i a bottom up approach i e a set of scenarios generated by independently re sampling the main climatic variables over predefined ranges of variability ii a top down approach i e a simulation based analysis relying upon an ensemble of ipcc scenarios simulated by global circulation models gcms and properly downscaled to represent the local conditions of the study area through the first method we evaluate the robustness of the system against a wide range of potential changes in a single or in few climatic drivers however such method explores first order i e changes of the mean values variability and does not consider i mutual interactions between climate variables such as temperature and precipitation nor ii higher order e g changes in variance effects changing seasonal patterns or frequency of extreme events storms wet dry spells heat waves thus they do not represent physically consistent patterns of climate and do not explore full potential variability thereby brown and wilby 2012 culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2010 the second method instead considers physically based plausible scenarios including interconnection between weather variables and higher order variability changes in the variance seasonal behaviour frequency distribution etc they are however less useful to identify sensitivity to single drivers and they need local downscaling especially for precipitation groppelli et al 2011a to pursue our top down approach we consider here ipcc climate change scenarios relative to the fifth assessment report ar5 and the sixth assessment report ar6 ar6 couples shared socio economic pathways ssps that consider e g investments in education health and energy development with updated representative concentration pathways rcps already used in the ar5 relative to greenhouse gases ghg emissions and land use changes scenarios fuso et al 2021 the use of different ar5 ar6 ipcc scenarios rcps ssps as input to different climate and hydrological models may broaden the projection range and uncertainty thereby herman et al 2020 finally to evaluate the main sources of variability of our projected scenarios we carry out an uncertainty analysis using the anova method since the choice of a specific hydrological model may bias the analysis of the projected hydrologic regimes in our analysis we use two hydrological models namely topkapi fatichi et al 2015 and poli hydro aili et al 2019 soncini et al 2017 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section we introduce the case study area and the data used then the methodology is explained in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 and in section 5 main findings and conclusions are given 2 case study the case study area is the lake como system fig 1 located between the central italian alps and the agricultural districts of the po valley the lake has an estimated volume of ca 23 4 km3 and it is operated at the olginate dam under multiple constraints anghileri et al 2011 denaro et al 2017 giuliani et al 2016b giuliani and castelletti 2016 the lake release supplies downstream water demand to hydroelectric plants and to four irrigation districts over an area of 1400 km2 with maxima in june and july ca 226 m3s 1 and minima in winter nearby 90 m3s 1 these values correspond to the water rights negotiated by the different negotiation consortia main cultivated crops are maize grassland rice wheat sugar beets with production comparable to the most productive areas of europe east flanders alsace noord bradant and schleswig holstein bocchiola et al 2013 bocchiola 2015 the second objective of the lake management is to avoid shoreline floods i e by maintaining lake level below the lowest point on the lake shores in the city of como corresponding to a water stage of 1 24 m referred to hydrometric zero 197 37 m asl giuliani et al 2016b management of the lake is constrained with a downstream ecological flow of 5 m3s 1 denaro et al 2017 operation therein aims at minimizing the irrigation deficit with respect to demand and the yearly number of days with shoreline floods considering a small regulation capacity average inflow to capacity ratio of 6 anghileri et al 2011 lake como collects water from the large adda river catchment draining an area of 4438 km2 between italy and switzerland 90 and 10 respectively and with an altitude range between 255 m asl and 4000 m asl the lake is laid within a temperate region but the catchment has a cold climate in the mountain areas and largely cryosphere driven hydrology aili et al 2019 bombelli et al 2019 peel et al 2007 2 1 data meteorological data are used as input to the hydrological models poli hydro ph and topkapi eth tpk the driving variables are temperature t precipitation p and geographic topographically corrected radiation rad these data were collected for a control run cr period 2009 2018 as made available from the automatic weather stations aws grid of arpa lombardia the regional protection agency for the environment daily data are available from 13 awss homogeneously distributed in the case study area for model tuning daily inlet discharges to lake como are used such data were provided by the consorzio dell adda a consortium managing the lake outlet and obtained using inverse flow routing starting from collected data at the hydrometer in malgrate moreover satellite images of snow covered area sca were collected for the entire cr period every two weeks from march 14th to june 18th these images were acquired by the sensor modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on board the satellite terra 3 methodology we focus upon the impact of hydrological changes driven by prospective climate change upon lake operation such impact was quantified using indexes of operation failure for this purpose we set up two hydrological models poli hydro and topkapi eth to simulate the inlet discharge to the lake necessary for benchmarking against future hydrological scenarios also obtained using these hydrological models an operational model of the lake is tuned against the historical operational data to closely mimicking historical operation patterns subsequently we benchmark operation efficiency against prospective climate and hydrology under the proposed two fold approach namely by i bottom up b u obtained by making incremental changes to climate variables δt δp i e with a step wise approach providing a reference exposure space and ii top down t d using physically based climate scenarios e g under the ipcc framework locally downscaled we calculate the failures in terms of irrigation deficit and the number of floods under the b u approach and then benchmark against those under the t d approach climate scenarios are taken from the outputs of global circulation models gcms under the ar5 ar6 of ipcc we use three gcms for each ar three representative concentration pathways rcps for ar5 and four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps for ar6 for a total of 21 scenarios for each of these 21 scenarios two reference periods with length of thirty years as often required in hydro climatological analysis are considered 2041 2070 half century p1 and 2071 2100 end of century p2 for a total of 42 projected periods each of such climate scenarios is then operated using the two hydrological models to obtain projected hydrological input to the lake 84 flow series the methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 bottom up and top down approaches for each hydrological model a control run inflow series i e based upon climate during 2009 2018 is generated from outflow discharge and lake level it is possible to verify the fulfilment of ecological flow always fulfilled in practice in our simulations irrigation demand changing with the season and available daily and flood protection i e days of flooding at a daily scale the incremental step b u used for temperature is δts 1 c and a range of δt from 2 c to 8 c is considered for precipitation a multiplicative correction is applied consistently with the inherently positive nature of rainfall values in the range of δp from 15 to 20 is used with an incremental step of δps 5 the range of variation for t p is chosen after a preliminary screening based upon the ipcc scenarios for consistency the inlet discharge to lake como is simulated for each b u scenario i e each combination of δt and δp with the two hydrological models previously tuned ph and tpk see below then the same calculation is pursued for the top down t d approach i e using climate scenarios as obtained from the gcms processed by the hydrological models ph tpk here 3 rcps of the ar5 and 4 ssps of the ar6 are used series of temperature and precipitation are obtained from 3 gcms for the ar5 and from the corresponding 3 gcms for the ar6 specifically we use ec earth hazeleger et al 2012 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 and echam6 stevens et al 2013 from ar5 and ec earth3 0 ec earth consortium ec earth 2019 cesm2 danabasoglu et al 2020 and echam6 3 mauritsen et al 2019 for the ar6 the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are used for the ar5 and ssp 2 6 ssp 4 5 ssp 7 0 and ssp 8 5 are used for the ar6 the daily series of t p are downscaled locally groppelli et al 2011a 2011b to obtain series of weather variables consistent with the hydrological model spatial resolution precipitation is downscaled with a stochastic space random cascade model which reproduces the mean and the variance of the observed data whereas temperature is downscaled using a correction with a mean monthly δt approach eventually 21 scenarios are obtained and simulated with each hydrological model to derive inlet discharges then lake outflow and level are simulated via operation the simulation is carried out for the period 2019 2100 but two representative periods are examined for each scenario namely 2041 2070 p1 and 2071 2100 p2 then the so obtained 42 t d scenarios 21 climate scenarios 2 periods are overlapped to the 2 exposure spaces i e regular grid for b u approach for ph tpk based upon their average temperature and precipitation variation with respect to the cr period 3 2 hydrological models poli hydro and topkapi eth two hydrological models poli hydro ph and topkapi tpk were previously tuned in this area giudici et al 2020 fuso et al 2021 respectively ph and tpk use a regular grid for the simulation of the water budget and for each cell they need information on land cover and elevation both ph and tpk simulate snow and ice melt using a mixed degree day approach based on average daily temperature and short wave radiation aili et al 2019 while tpk considers glacier melt basing on a temperature index method pellicciotti et al 2005 ph also simulates the dynamics of glaciers calculating ice flow and mass balance and updating glacier volume and area aili et al 2019 bombelli et al 2019 ph uses a single soil layer with isotropic conductivity changing with soil saturation whereas tpk considers three layers and a vertical horizontal conductivity potential evapotranspiration in ph is assessed via hargreaves formula whereas tpk uses priestley taylor s equation to increase the reliability of future projections it was important to attain a good calibration of the hydrological models and to properly represent the main flow components in the area especially as given by seasonal snow melt krysanova et al 2020 accordingly we pursue model tuning i e for degree day of snow also based upon observed snow melt dynamics we use seasonal snow cover area sca as estimated using modis images multi targeted model tuning in cryospheric areas results in an accurate description of hydrological processes thereby so better capturing the impacts of climate changes especially with respect to temperature which is the main driver of seasonal cryospheric melting e g soncini et al 2017 in table 1 we report the results of calibration of ph and tpk in the control period 2009 2018 3 3 operational model the operational model simulates lake operation i e daily releases and by solving a mass balance equation with the net inflow to lake como the daily storages and generates a set of pareto optimal operations diversely balancing the two targets of flood control and water supply downstream as a reference policy we select the one more closely mimicking historical operation patterns as observed from discharge data at the downstream hydrometer in malgrate li 2016 this is done to benchmark future operation performance against the presently adopted strategies rather than against theoretically optimal ones that are not implemented in practice the set of optimal operating policies p at the daily scale is 1 p arg min p j j flo j irr where p is a closed loop control policy that for each time step day determines water release over the next 24 h based on the day of the year and lake level parameterized as a gaussian radial basis function the term p describes alternative regulation of the lake over the historical climate conditions j flo and j irr are the annual average number of floods d y 1 and the average squared daily water irrigation deficit m3s 2d 1 castelletti et al 2010 2008 denaro et al 2017 giuliani et al 2015 2016c giuliani and castelletti 2016 then using the operational model for each year of simulation of the cr period the number of days with shoreline flooding and the irrigation deficit are calculated the value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the deficit flood distribution i e exceedance in one year out of ten is used as a reference threshold to benchmark performance success failure under both b u and t d approaches kasprzyk et al 2013 the simulation with the operational model is also carried out for each scenario under the b u approach to define areas of failure of the system in the exposure space in terms of irrigation deficit or flood failure j flo and j irr are calculated also for the t d scenarios to define the differences in failure between the b u approach and the t d one 3 4 analysis of variance we explore possible sources of uncertainty in projections of climate change impacts upon the hydrology of the lake como catchment using a large number of climate scenarios and a multi hydrological model approach enlarges the potential range of future projections thereby increasing uncertainty krysanova et al 2020 to quantify the share of variability uncertainty brought by each of these components into the hydrological scenarios we perform a three way anova analysis of variance aryal et al 2019 we analyse monthly flows to exploit seasonal differences within flow formation processes and future projections thereby total flow process variance was expressed as 2 sst s s hydro s s gcm s s rcp ssp s s res therein sst is the total sum of squares ss hydro ss gcm and ss rcp ssp are the sum of squares referred to the main effects of the hydrological model gcm and ipcc scenario respectively the interaction effects and the sum of squares of residues are quantified into ss res which correspond to the intrinsic variability of the flow variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological projections under ipcc climate change scenarios ar5 ar6 in figs 3 5 we report the quantitative link between changes in precipitation and discharge distributed seasonally an increase in total yearly precipitation results in an increase in total discharge and vice versa a decrease in precipitation leads to a reduction in inflows however almost all values are laid below the sector s diagonal i e discharge increases less or decreases more than precipitation fig 3 this results from a growth in evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures e g groppelli et al 2011b although some scenarios show an increase in annual discharge summer discharge always decreases fig 4 and more consistently so under ar6 scenarios than under ar5 scenarios fig 5 shows that for a raise in annual discharge fall discharge increases more than proportionally and mainly so under ar5 scenarios instead for a decrease in the total discharge some scenarios still exhibit a positive variation of fall discharge and others display a little decrease in the latter in response to a precipitation increase of 10 15 total annual discharge increases fig 3 however such an increase of 12 13 does not imply an increase in summer discharge fig 4 under negative changes in precipitation lower yearly discharge is foreseen fig 3 however some scenarios still show fall discharge rising due to an increase of precipitation in fall fig 5 and tables 2 3 looking at the results of the anova fig 6 in relative form under both ar5 ar6 and in both periods p1 p2 uncertainty in flow projection is governed more by climate projections and internal variability than by the choice of the hydrological model under ar5 the main source of uncertainty is due to the choice of the gcms and to the inner meteo hydrological variability both in p1 and p2 fig 6 a and c the projected precipitation under ar5 displays somewhat higher variability than under ar6 fig 3 accordingly inflows thereby are more largely variable under ar6 less variability of precipitation amount is detected with respect to ar5 mainly in p2 so in the rainy season the uncertainty resulting from the gcm is smaller than those deriving from the internal variability of the meteo hydrological process intrinsically variable by nature fig 6d especially at the end of the century in spring and summer uncertainty is largely governed by the choice of the ipcc scenarios rcps ssps fig 6 c and d at mid century temperature increases similarly for all scenarios while at the end of the century temperature changes are very different across scenarios and so the choice of a given scenario is crucial and choice of gcm becomes less important anova results in absolute terms also indicate seasonal uncertainty of inflow projection fig 7 globally the total uncertainty increases between p1 and p2 both for ar5 and ar6 october november and june august show the highest variance uncertainty likely due to the influence of the variability of precipitation and temperature range respectively 4 2 vulnerability analysis figs 8 and 9 show the exposure space b u approach and the results of the t d approach using ph and tpk b u scenarios circles and t d scenarios ar5 and ar6 for two representative periods p1 2041 2070 and p2 2071 2100 are reported the b u scenarios cover the entire exposure space and define the failure regions for number of floods red region and irrigation deficit yellow region the purple region includes the b u scenarios where both objectives display failure and the blue points represent the region of success combination of δt and δp with no failure t d scenarios are overlapped with the same colours with their proper values of δt and δp against the cr period in the future overall operation performance declines in terms of irrigation flood for seasonal precipitation decrease increase considering the b u scenarios some differences between ph and tpk can be seen ph provides increasing vs the cr irrigation deficit for any temperature increase and precipitation reduction whereas tpk keeps an acceptable performance for a small decrease of precipitation and increase of temperature focusing upon differences between the b u scenarios and t d scenarios two main differences can be pointed out for poli hydro ar5 scenarios with an increase of precipitation between 10 and 15 provide also increased irrigation deficit in contrast with the b u scenarios for topkapi likewise the failure in both objectives is observed mainly with a precipitation increase between 5 and 10 both under ar5 and ar6 scenarios looking at figs 3 and 4 while annual precipitation and annual discharge increase summer discharge decreases thus larger irrigation deficits may still be expected which were not highlighted in the b u scenario moreover for ph flood failures are observed under ar6 scenarios even with a temperature change of ca 6 c and a decrease in precipitation down to 10 which does not occur under the b u scenarios flood failures under temperature increase higher than 5 c figs 8 9 could derive from an increase in liquid precipitation at the expense of snowfall indeed an increase in fall discharge is seen in response to increasing liquid precipitation in fall fig 5 and tables 2 3 such results come as a consequence of the seasonal variability of climate supplementary material p and t as projected by the adopted gcms under the t d approach such circumstances could bring criticalities in lake operation undetected when using a b u approach to evaluate the link between climatic variables seasonal discharges and operation performance a correlation analysis is performed table 2 for ph and table 3 for tpk we consider seasonal climate for cr p1 and p2 for each gcm and rcp ssp and the corresponding inflows and the final performance indexes irrigation flood in the tables the significant correlations significance level of 95 reported in the supplementary material that are larger than 0 6 or smaller than 0 6 are highlighted in bold looking at climate variables as expected seasonal temperatures are highly correlated with yearly temperature for both ph and tpk similarly seasonal precipitation affects seasonal discharge to assess the degree of correlation between climatic hydrological variables and flood failure we use the daily flooding volume during floods δh more linked to weather and hydrological conditions rain stream flows than the number of days with flood our results show that irrigation deficit mainly correlates to summer discharge 0 62 for ph 0 84 for tpk and less to summer temperature and spring summer precipitation whereas floods are mostly affected by fall flows especially for ph 0 62 ph 0 57 tpk figs 10 and 11 display the magnitude of failure in terms of irrigation deficit and number of floods for ph and tpk for the 42t d scenarios here processed for both ph and tpk the light blue circles display failure thresholds for the two objectives calculated as the 90th percentile on the cr period series 2009 2018 as reported above the threshold values are q t 801 3 m3s 1 for ph and q t 1768 87 m3s 1 for tpk and 52 days for ph and 56 days for tpk for irrigation deficit and flood respectively results show that the most critical condition in terms of irrigation deficit is given under ar6 scenarios with δt of approx 6 c with the highest values for tpk than for ph concerning flood failure ph and tpk provide similar outcomes with respect to the ar5 scenarios the main differences occur between ar5 and ar6 since tpk exhibits flood failure mainly under ar5 scenarios the threshold values for the two objectives are calculated also considering the observed inflow data during cr 2009 2018 resulting in q t 1212 25 m3s 1 for irrigation deficit and 51 days of shoreline flood thresholds for flood failure days is almost the same for ph tpk instead the irrigation failure threshold q t is quite different for ph and tpk and the value from observations is an average between the two which depends clearly upon the different flow dynamics as depicted by the two models inflow values and flow volumes in time affecting reservoir s management however under future climate projections we detected large failures not comparable with the historical ones accordingly the disturbance given by using hydrologically modelled flows is lower than the changes resulting from climatic scenarios e g the loss of effectiveness of the current operation policies in the future is higher than the perturbation caused by the choice of the hydrological model 5 conclusions the bottom up approach pursued here relatively easy to implement is largely used in climate change impact assessment exercise brown et al 2012 culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2010 namely to provide the sensitivity of a system to the changing climate and possibly to propose a simplified range of future projections to decision makers the use of physically based scenarios t d approach implies larger work to collect gcms projections and subsequently downscale them a large number of t d scenarios is necessary and as a consequence one also needs to carry out time consuming hydrological simulations for each scenario however several simulations are necessary also for the b u approach moreover the choice of the gcms ensembles may influence the results of the assessment brown et al 2012 in this work we demonstrate that the results of a t d approach highlights some criticalities of the system that the b u approach does not display this is due to the non linear influence of climate change as projected upon seasonality and amount of precipitation snow accumulation and melt thereby also mediated by temperature and modified frequency extent of flood drought events for instance changing in timing and seasonality of precipitation is an important aspect to consider in hydrological projections for its effect on discharge that homogeneous linear changes in the average values cannot identify christensen and lettenmaier 2007 ecmwf 2019 quinn et al 2018 in the supplementary material to this paper seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation and the effect upon inflow at lake como is reported the use of a t d scenario allows to explore physically based complex scenarios of climate variability and the impact upon hydrological systems manning et al 2009 and therefore the gain of information obtained by considering ipcc or anyway physically based scenarios for proper climate change impact assessment and decision making can be highlighted the results of our anova test are coherent with other studies see e g wiley and palmer 2008 anghileri et al 2011 aryal et al 2019 in that they identify in the choice of any given gcm the largest source of uncertainty in the short term fig 6 here however shows that the influence of gcm choice is less relevant under ar6 than under ar5 this may indicate that the increased consistency of global circulation modelling under ar6 may result in less spreading of climate hydrological projections under the same ssp this is a desirable feature when it comes to the reduction of uncertainty in the assessment of hydrological projections and subsequent operation performance to further improve this work one may consider using more climate models including e g regional models and more hydrological models albeit using only two models does not provide a full multi model analysis it may increase our confidence in the projected hydrological conditions and highlight the contribution of the model s choice to the uncertainty of projections krysanova et al 2020 also in pursuing the t d approach different downscaling approaches may be explored especially critical for precipitation the downscaling method adopted here is statistical see groppelli et al 2011b 2011a but other methods may be considered on the other side the b u approach may be revised as well to include non linearity of the system also a refined evaluation of the future potential irrigation demand may be done in the future under climate change scenarios an increase of evapotranspiration as driven by the increase of temperature and a reduction of summer precipitation in the irrigated area of po valley is expected with a consequent potential increase of water demand for crop irrigation bocchiola 2015 for this reason the irrigation deficit from lake como could be higher eventually one potential solution could be a change of crop from a high water demanding to a less water demanding species on the other hand re optimization of the lake como dam operation could help to reduce this problem culley et al 2016 and further effort may be devoted thereby our results here albeit preliminary and amenable to improvement notwithstanding provide a possibly dependable tool to assess vulnerable lake operation under climate change during the xxi century especially when adopting a t d approach as we did here and to support the implementation of adaptation strategies from policy makers also the template we propose may be applied to other lakes reservoirs within the alps and other areas to preliminarily assess water management under climate

8124,study region the mesoscale thur catchment located in the north eastern part of switzerland is a study site in which a range of hydrological research has been conducted study focus groundwater recharge is challenging to quantify due to the complexity of hydrogeological processes and limited observations because of its spatiotemporal availability remotely sensed data present an attractive water management tool its application in mesoscale catchments 10 104 km2 however remains limited this study investigated the use of satellite products used in conjunction with ground based data to determine spatiotemporal variations in water available for groundwater recharge gridded components from readily available precipitation evapotranspiration and hydrological discharge data were used to generate spatiotemporal maps over a 20 year period new hydrological insights for the region closure of the water balance found that monthly data displayed a moderate correlation with improved correlations of obtained seasonal and annual intervals suggesting that over the long term the thur catchment is in a steady state maps were generated and trends for the 20 year period assessed examination of the gridded water balance components for different hydrological years emphasized the limiting effect of precipitation on recharge this study highlights the value of remotely sensed data in groundwater recharge estimates but emphasises the importance of continued ground based monitoring the lack of which is a limiting factor in water management where mesoscale catchments are concerned graphical abstract ga1 keywords mesoscale catchments groundwater recharge spatiotemporal evapotranspiration water balance 1 introduction one of the most important functions of a catchment is its ability to store and release water a characteristic that can buffer against severe weather events seasonal changes and climate variability berghuijs et al 2016 datry et al 2017 staudinger et al 2017 groundwater recharge indicates the existence of renewable groundwater resources and is therefore an important component of a catchment s hydrological functioning döll and fiedler 2008 jasechko et al 2014 mohan et al 2018 groundwater recharge varies in space and time making it difficult to measure directly minnig et al 2018 scanlon et al 2002 von freyberg et al 2015 climate change evolving land utilization abstraction and anthropogenic impacts are a growing concern when characterizing groundwater bodies and predicting their sustainability burri et al 2019 condon and maxwell 2019 han et al 2017 oki and kanae 2006 sridhar et al 2014 in most places groundwater recharge is an integral part of a catchment s water balance therefore monitoring and understanding a catchment s water input and output or water balance is essential to the sustainable management of water resources however both where field and model based estimates are concerned groundwater recharge is often considered a residual product of the water balance assessment accumulating the uncertainties of all other components of the budget reinecke et al 2021 thus reliable estimates are important in a steady state system where net water input equals net water output the components of a catchment s water balance can be related through an equation which can vary in its complexity healy and scanlon 2010 the dominant components which make up a catchment s water balance include precipitation p as primary input and evapotranspiration et as predominant output crosbie et al 2015 dhungel and fiedler 2016 reitz et al 2017 however in mountainous regions stream or river discharge q which can be further divided into quick event based surface flow or quickflow q q and typically slow subsurface flow or baseflow q b contributions often makes up the majority of water output spreafico and weingartner 2005 viviroli et al 2007a zappa et al 2017 discharge q an approximated value of river flow and velocity typically represents high resolution measurements at a specific point however quantifying subsurface contributions of q is often problematic as knowledge of hydraulic parameters is compromised due to subsurface heterogeneity and the limited number and depths of measuring locations alley et al 2002 the water balance components vary in space and time and although linked through large scale interrelationships have very different spatiotemporal characteristics creutzfeldt et al 2014 however according to healy and scanlon 2010 the universal concept of mass conservation of water implies that water balance methods are applicable over any space and time scale pp 15 the major net loss component from a catchment s water balance is generally et the sum of evaporation from ground surface and transpiration from plant surfaces the complex interacting components which result in et are difficult to quantify whether via field based measurements or via remotely sensed technology zhang et al 2016 as a result et typically has the greatest uncertainty of the water balance components velpuri et al 2013 and remains one of the most difficult components to measure accurately ferguson et al 2010 hirschi et al 2017 over longer time scales changes in a catchment s water storage s are often assumed to be small relative to the volumes of the other water balance components han et al 2020 for catchments with no additional inflow from or outflow to adjacent catchments via transfer schemes or sub surface flows s would equal zero and the catchment s water balance can be assumed to be in a steady state healy and scanlon 2010 subsequently both within the fields of research and water resource management it is common to estimate recharge using some form of a water balance equation dages et al 2009 healy et al 2007 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 tilahun and merkel 2009 wfd cis 2016 in the past the measurement of water balance components was traditionally limited to point or plot scales 10 2 m2 to 101 m2 measurements of single components ruth et al 2018 currently remotely sensed products including et derived from computational surface energy balance models that stem from multispectral satellite sensed characteristics i e net radiation surface temperature and vegetation properties offer perhaps one of the most attractive global estimates of water balance measurements as a result this type of data has been used to improve model predictions and to close the water balance leading to a significant reduction in uncertainty anderson et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 1998 irmak et al 2012 nishida et al 2003 tang et al 2010 wang and xie 2018 although comprehensive the available remotely sensed et data are not without their limitations and performance of the products can be adversely affected by factors such as topography vegetation type input datasets estimation methods spatiotemporal scales etc e g li et al 2018 lu et al 2019 zhao and liu 2014 while temporal and spatial scaling whether up or down scaling presents an additional challenge in estimating a catchment s water balance anderson et al 2007 cui et al 2018 hong et al 2009 kalma et al 2008 when coupled with ground based data remotely sensed observations have been shown to provide a more complete understanding of the hydrological system becker 2006 gleason and durand 2020 pavelsky 2014 vereecken et al 2015 both surface and subsurface movement and storage of water are dependent on precipitation temperature fluctuations vegetation type and distribution anthropogenic land and water utilization as well as topographic lithological and soil characteristics moeck et al 2020 sophocleous 2002 wada et al 2010 as such remotely sensed rs data provides an attractive tool in hydrological studies particularly because of the long temporal and large spatial availability of many rs products alem et al 2021 becker and nemec 1987 falalakis and gemitzi 2020 jódar et al 2018 martín arias et al 2020 ollivier et al 2021 2020 sarrazin et al 2018 however due to the pixel resolution of most rs products the use of rs data in hydrological studies of mesoscale catchments typically 10 104 km2 or smaller is limited armanios and fisher 2014 sun et al 2018 in addition although rs components for an entire water budget calculation are readily available reproducible methods for handling the necessary data are not prominent in the literature e g rajib et al 2018 hampering the ease of data application this study investigates the application of satellite derived et products used in conjunction with ground based discharge data using open source software to determine spatiotemporal water distribution and estimate the volumes of water available for potential groundwater recharge hereon referred to as groundwater recharge or r within the mesoscale thur river catchment in switzerland the thur river represents a dynamic system free of any major natural or artificial reservoirs and with its mesoscale catchment 1700 km2 provides a unique opportunity to explore the potential of using readily available rs data to evaluate monthly seasonal and annual r for the years 2000 2019 previous research in the thur catchment focused either on localized field based studies chittoor viswanathan et al 2016 kurth et al 2015 kurth and schirmer 2014 paillex et al 2017 2005 schirmer et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 vogt et al 2011 or involved the use of lumped modelling approaches to simulate its large scale processes abbaspour et al 2007 dal molin et al 2020 doulatyari et al 2017 rössler et al 2019 viviroli et al 2009 the aims of this study were as follows i assess the spatiotemporal variability of gridded water balance components in the thur catchment for the years 2000 2019 using open source software and readily available rs et data in combination with ground based data ii identify variability in environmental processes during different hydrological years e g wet vs dry years in the mesoscale thur catchment iii determine water availability in the thur catchment for potential groundwater recharge iv explore the results in terms of spatiotemporal distribution in the thur catchment and examine method uncertainties 2 study area and its hydrogeological setting the thur river located in the north eastern part of switzerland fig 1 has an approximate catchment size of 1700 km2 the thur river a tributary to the rhine is the longest river in switzerland free of any major natural or artificial reservoirs along the length of its course 130 km resulting in preannounced seasonality streamflow variability three major tributaries the murg the necker and the sitter flow into the thur river and based on available data from active stream discharge stations the thur catchment can be divided into nine 9 sub catchments fig 1a the headwaters of the thur river arise in the southern glacier free limestone dominated pre alpine region of the catchment near mount säntis where vegetation is sparse and soils are generally shallow here productive groundwater occurrences are confined largely to small fluvio glacial gravel and sand deposits hosted largely within valley bottoms and fractured rock gurtz et al 1999 average depth to groundwater in this southern region is 3 5 m moreover karstic units can represent complex groundwater flow path schürch et al 2007 the pleistocene molass sandstones marls and conglomerates located predominantly in the northern region of the thur catchment are highly productive in terms of groundwater and host one of the largest groundwater systems in switzerland where average depth to groundwater is 1 4 m abbaspour et al 2007 keller 1992 abstraction rate estimates from the largest aquifer in the thur catchment are in the order of 16 million m3 y https umwelt tg ch wasser wassernutzungen zahlen und fakten html 2158 last accessed 11 september 2020 which amounts to approximately 9 4 mm of water abstracted from the groundwater annually although it is important to monitor the local effects of groundwater abstraction which can have strong impacts on groundwater flow data is often limited or completely lacking creutzfeldt et al 2014 when compared to the mean annual precipitation values see below the abstracted groundwater from the largest aquifer amounts to 1 of the annual water input into the thur catchment land use in the thur basin is dominated by agriculture 60 with large areas of pasture forests make up 30 of the land surface and the remaining 10 includes barren land surface waters and urban areas elevation in the thur catchment varies from 2502 to 363 m asl fig 1b with an average slope inclination of 7 9º melsen et al 2016 the hydrological regime of the thur catchment with its warm summer humid continental or sub montane climate gurtz et al 1999 peel et al 2007 is characterized by its variable morphological and climatic elements streamflow in the thur river can fluctuate by up to two orders of magnitude in the space of a few hours with recorded discharge rates at the andelfingen an discharge station ranging from 3 to 1130 m3 s mean discharge of 47 m3 s doulatyari et al 2017 gurtz et al 1999 on average precipitation in the thur catchment varies from 700 mm y in the low elevation northern region to 2700 mm y in the southern mountainous region fig 1c the lowest average evapotranspiration rates 400 mm y are found in regions of high elevation with higher average et is associated with the lower reaches of the thur valley 500 mm y fig 1d the highest average evapotranspiration rates over 1000 mm y are associated with the central region of the thur catchment 700 m asl here land use is associated with mixed pasture agriculture and forestry 3 data and methods this section describes in detail the gridded and ground based data employed in this study as well as the methods applied to calculate groundwater recharge in the thur catchment through employing open source software for the gridded water balance computations the presented workflow is anticipated to be readily transferrable and applicable to other catchments 3 1 precipitation product precipitation being the primary flux in most hydrological cycles requires high resolution data in order to reliably estimate water availability and distribution within a catchment although an array of remotely sensed rainfall data is available e g global precipitation climatology project gpcp tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm global precipitation measurement gpm etc these all have a relatively low resolution 10 250 km2 when considering a mesoscale catchment with a high topographic variability sun et al 2018 thus long term gridded precipitation data interpolated from 73 swiss national stations located within or close to the thur catchment was used for this study meteoswiss 2016 the meteoswiss product consists of continuous high quality measurements interpolated from a network of ground based radar and gauge data using the reduced space optimal interpolation rsoi method specifically developed for regions with a complex orography begert et al 2007 schiemann et al 2010 the interpolation errors for the swiss plateau region has a relative standard error of 20 meteoswiss 2013 and the resulting gridded data has a 2 3 km x 2 3 km resolution the gridded meteoswiss annual january december and monthly rainfall data rhiresy v1 0 and rhiresm v1 0 represents accumulated precipitation including both rainfall and snowfall equivalent in mm the meteoswiss data was resampled using bilinear interpolation to match the resolution of the modis data and used as input in the water budget calculation refer to section 3 4 although a substantial portion of the thur catchment is under agriculture high annual precipitation rates resulting in wet environmental conditions in the catchment renders the irrigated amounts as relatively insignificant when compared to the relatively high surface water availability kanton thurgau amt für umwelt et al 2008 therefore although seasonal water shortage e g summer drought periods are recorded locally discussed in section 4 3 it is assumed that the effect of irrigation is negligible in the sense of the thur catchment s total water balance additionally relatively little variation in precipitation characteristics such as season frequency and duration of dry and wet days appears across the thur s different sub catchments dal molin et al 2020 3 2 evapotranspiration product calculations of aet are generally local measures from eddy covariance ec towers large aperture scintillometers las or lysimeters these methods are often regarded as the most accurate and reliable determination of aet baldocchi 2003 brotzge and crawford 2003 rana and katerji 2000 schrader et al 2013 xu and chen 2005 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of aet upscaling of point information to a regional scale is challenging and models have been employed to compensate for the lack of observations and fill spatial gaps de graaf et al 2017 döll and fiedler 2008 orth and seneviratne 2015 wada et al 2016 remotely sensed products offer feasible alternatives to obtaining aet measurements at regional scales

since december 1999 https terra nasa gov about mission the modis sensor was designed to detect electromagnetic bands which include spectral signatures of atmospheric water vapour as well as vegetation and land cover from which continuous biophysical variable including land surface temperature albedo soil moisture running et al 2019 1994 from these variables a regional composite et product is estimated at a 500 m x 500 m resolution using the mu et al 2011 improved et algorithm which is based the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 when dealing with et values it must be noted that through the process of hydraulic redistribution hr by plant roots groundwater itself may be contributing to the determined value according to luo et al 2016 where depth to water table ranges between 3 and 6 m the percentage water redistributed may range between 14 5 and 23 for coniferous forests depending on the soil type however were depth to water table is relatively shallow between 1 m and 2 m the effect of groundwater transpirated via hr is often not evident as a roots would be in constant contact with water at this depth luo et al 2016 although remotely sensed et products are currently available with higher pixel resolutions e g guzinski et al 2020 the time series for these products are currently still limited sen et from esa is available as of 2016 the modis et product has well documented quality assessment protocols reproduces basin scale aet response with acceptable uncertainty khan et al 2018 velpuri et al 2013 has good temporal resolution and is freely and easily accessible in light of this the improved gap filled annual january december and 8 day mod16a3gf and mod16a2gf respectively modis hereon referred to as mod16 et data was used as the evapotranspiration

image tiles were pre processed and clipped to the thur catchment for ease of use refer to section 3 4 3 3 discharge product while the meteoswiss precipitation and mod16 et products are in gridded spatiotemporally varying quantities discharge q is measured at a point as a flux through a stream channel tang et al 2010 ten 10 federally operated gauging stations are located in the thur catchment fig 1a table 1 all stations are located along free flowing systems and have continuous data for the period 2000 2019 with the exception of the halden ha station where october december 2019 was absent refer to section 1 2 in supplementary information for details available stream discharge time series were obtained from the swiss federal office for the environment foen and quality checked prior to use the andelfingen an site represents the discharge for the entire thur catchment with 9 sub catchments located upstream of it the next biggest sub catchment is represented by the halden ha site which drains approximately half of the thur catchment for the 2000 2019 period the high elevation sub catchment appenzell ap displayed the highest average q value 1375 5 mm while the low elevation

summer june july and august and autumn september october and november aggregates 3 4 methodology 3 4 1 correction of modis data the mosnang mos sub catchment fig 1a also known as the rietholzbach research catchment is a well instrumented catchment with a long history of both atmospheric and hydraulic data collection readily available long term aet data from studies conducted in the mos sub catchment for the years 1976 2015 hirschi et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2012 were used in this study to evaluate the accuracy of mod16 et data used in calculating the thur catchment s water budget a large weighing lysimeter setup fig 1a in the mos sub catchment is the only independent long term aet data available for the thur catchment the weighting lysimeter with a depth of 2 5 m and a diameter of 2 m is located in a grassland setting next to the valley bottom of the rietholzbach in the upper part of the mos catchment hirschi et al 2017 the lysimeter is mainly filled with gley brown cambisol soil type from the same location including a gravel filter layer at the bottom gurtz et al 2003 moeck et al 2018 at the bottom of the lysimeter water outflow is measured with a tipping bucket as groundwater is shallow at the site and the average rooting depth is around 0 3 m germann 1981 lysimeter seepage can be assumed to be a reliable indicator of actual vertical groundwater recharge ghasemizade et al 2015 seneviratne et al 2012 von freyberg et al 2015 despite scale discrepancy and uncertainties due to the setup of the lysimeter seneviratne et al 2012 show that the rietholzbach lysimeter seepage and catchment runoff display very similar monthly dynamics which suggests that the lysimeter is representative for the water balance of entire mos catchment the largest discrepancies between lysimeter seepage and catchment runoff values were found during march most likely linked to the higher spatial variability of hydrological processes taking place in that month e g snowmelt and the onset of the growing season seneviratne et al 2012 at the surface the lysimeter is covered with a grass species composition which imitates the surrounding conditions including the same cutting scheme hirschi et al 2017 the manner in which the lysimeter is setup i e the weighing of the lysimeter also allows for the estimation of aet a well established technique gebler et al 2015 ghasemizade et al 2015 goss and ehlers 2009 rana and katerji 2000 schrader et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2012 among many others hirschi et al 2017 demonstrated that for the mos sub catchment the lysimeter and eddy covariance ec measurements are in good agreement in particular where the annual timescale is concerned moreover a good agreement was seen when comparing the lysimeter aet values with the mos catchment s long term water balance values hirschi et al 2017 these findings emphasize the representativeness of the site level lysimeter for the entire mos catchment despite its comparatively small source area here we follow vereecken et al 2015 who argued that improved description of soil hydrological fluxes at the local scale are fundamental to reduce large uncertainties which are still present in large scale models or remote sensed data used to predict these fluxes as such and in spite of this area representing only a fraction of the entire thur catchment mod16 et values for the entire thur catchment were bias corrected using the mos sub catchment lysimeter values taking into account that seneviratne et al 2012 found that the rietholzbach catchment is representative of a number of hydroclimatic regions in the swiss eastern plateau in particular for the thur river basin it seems to be reasonable to make the bias correction based on the lysimeter values a more detailed discussion about this assumption and the possible implications for the water balance calculation can be found in section 5 1 when comparing the original mod16 et values for the mos sub catchment to lysimeter values an overestimate in the mod16 et data was evident fig 2a where the lysimeter aet values ranged between 1 20 and 134 20 mm month for the period from 2000 and 2015 the mod16 et values ranged from 15 52 to 132 79 mm month for the same period in order to account for this the mod16 et values were adjusted hereon referred to as aet corr by a correction factor of 0 71 this factor was estimated by inversely fitting the original mod16 et data to the measured lysimeter values while seeking to reduce the daily mismatch overall fitted results are in good agreement with the observed lysimeter data fig 2b furthermore a comparison between the aet corr values and modelled aet values after zappa et al 2017 show a very strong positive after evans 1996 correlation pearson correlation 0 97 refer to the supplementary fig s1 although the pearson s correlation coefficient r can be overly sensitive to outliers in light of the large data set the method was deemed suitable as a basic comparison between the original mod16 and the aet corr values dessu et al 2018 legates and mccabe 1999 in addition when looking at the expected mod16 et values as described by mu et al 2011 at a latitude of approximately 47 5⁰ the latitude of the thur catchment these values are in line with the lysimeter values and subsequently the aet corr additionally p values from the meteoswiss data were compared to precipitation data from the meteorological station büel located at the outlet of the mos sub catchment and in close proximity of the above described lysimeter located in the mos sub catchment data available from https iac ethz ch group land climate dynamics research rietholzbach data html findings show a very strong positive correlation after evans 1996 between the gridded p values from the meteoswiss data with those from the büel station pearson correlation 0 93 refer to fig s2 in the supplementary information 3 4 2 baseflow from total discharge values baseflow separation is a method whereby total stream discharge q is separated into precipitation event based surface discharge components often referred to as quickflow q q and baseflow components q b eq 1 baseflow q b is usually associated with subsurface processes cannot be attributed to a single precipitation event and has been taken as a quantitative variable of groundwater discharge to rivers by many authors blume et al 2007 duncan 2019 fendeková and fendek 2012 hall 1968 healy and scanlon 2010 hellwig and stahl 2018 nathan and mcmahon 1990 reitz et al 2017 sutcliffe et al 1981 baseflow represents a part of the groundwater which returns to the surface water a process through which many rivers and lakes are fed and aquatic ecosystems are maintained during dry periods aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gurdak 2017 infiltration to recharge subsurface storage increases baseflow but due to aet baseflow can also be reduced as temperature gradients and trees absorb water from the ground using a digital filter method available in the ecohydrology r package r core team 2018 with three passes and filter parameter set to 0 925 as proposed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 base and quickflow was estimated from the available q data in order to estimate baseflow from total streamflow in the thur catchment 1 q q q q b a baseflow index was generated for each sub catchment refer to supplementary table s1 and fig s3 in addition a baseflow separation method comparison was conducted after zomlot et al 2015 using the free online automated web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2010 2005 to compare three separation methods 1 the eckhardt recursive digital filter eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2005 with filter parameter set to 0 98 and 0 925 2 the local minimum method and 3 the one parameter method on average the ammount of baseflow contribution derived from the different methods varied by up to 22 refer to supplementary fig s4 using a recursive digital filter method with the filter parameter set to 0 925 was the most conservative approach resulting in an average monthly baseflow contribution of 43 in order not to over estimate recharge values in this study q q was deterimined using the method most conservative with respect to q b 3 4 3 spatially gridded discharge in order to evaluate the discharge volumes in mm in the thur catchment on a spatial basis as part of the water balance point measurements of stream volumes weighted based on a topographically based top down flow accumulation fa algorithm generated using saga gis were used conrad et al 2015 refer to supplementary fig s5 for a comparison of fa weight ranking methods the fa raster was based on a flow routing algorithm after seibert and mcglynn 2007 tarboron 1997 generated from a 25 m raster dem source federal office of topography which was pre processed using wang and liu s 2006 fill sink process wang and liu 2006 the fa raster was resampled using bilinear interpolation to match the 500 m x 500 m raster resolution of the mod16 et data and then normalized and inverted fa norm after de lavenne et al 2019 to create a weighting factor between 0 and 1 with the greater part of the q q volume weighted to the upstream reaches of the thur river 2 fa norm 1 fa fa min fa max fa min before being multiplied by the temporally aggregated quickflow q q values of each sub catchment in order to represent spatially distributed quickflow q q dis for the thur catchment 3 q q dis q q fa norm a comparison of the fa values with the inverted fa values is presented in fig s5 which indicates that the inverted fa fa norm more closely represent the measured baseflow values q b the resulting product although based on an algorithm which laterally connects adjoining downstream pixels was used purely to represent discharge volumes spatially as input into the water budget calculation eq 6 fig 3 as such each pixel value does not represent actual measured q q at the pixel location but rather each q q dis pixel merely represents a portion of the precipitation into that cell which ultimately produces the measured downstream q q response however results show a very strong positive correlation pearson correlation 0 94 after evans 1996 with modelled results viviroli et al 2007b 2007c refer to supplementary fig s6 3 4 4 recharge estimates from the water balance equation in cases where a catchment represents a steady state system the terrestrial water budget is equal to all inputs into minus all outputs out of the system this implies that over long time periods e g annual catchment storage change s calculated from eq 4 does not vary and baseflow can be defined as representative of effective groundwater recharge reitz et al 2017 schilling et al 2021 wolock 2003 4 p et q s 0 where p represents input in the form of precipitation et and q represent output in the form of evapotranspiration and discharge as a sum of q q and q b and s is the change of storage discharge q was separated into its quick and baseflow components using a q b conservative digital filter method refer to section 3 4 4 where q b would represent the minimum effective groundwater recharge 5 q b p aet corr q q bearing in mind the inherent uncertainty in all of these variables e g coxon et al 2015 li et al 2018 lu et al 2019 meteoswiss 2013 zhao and liu 2014 and assuming acceptable or constant component errors refer to section 3 5 the water available for recharge referred to here as potential recharge r in the thur catchment was described using the independent gridded water balance component aet corr and q q dis values as follows 6 r q b p aet corr q q dis where the gridded spatiotemporal r values represent the value of water which would result in the modelled q b response after eq 1 derived from measured q values according to creutzfeldt et al 2014 the spatiotemporal variability and availability of water in a catchment is controlled by underlying processes e g spatially changing boundary conditions and temporal fluxes in catchment parameters any change in trend representing both the direction and rate of change can be determined by the slope of a linear regression model de jong et al 2011 gridded values of r were assessed using a pixel wise ordinary least squares linear regression for the 20 years from 2000 to 2019 at the 95 significance level determining changes in recharge characteristics in the thur catchment additionally the difference in mean r values estimated over the first 10 years 2000 2009 was compared to the mean r values estimated over the second 10 years 2010 2019 of the total study period refer to section 4 3 1 3 4 5 workflow using the open source statistical program r r core team 2018 grid based computations were conducted for the thur catchment at the 500 m x 500 m resolution with each independently estimated input variable representing a water balance component in rates per unit area for the years 2000 2019 the work process for the data processing is illustrated as a flow diagram in fig 3 this method relates the water balance components p aet corr and q q dis in a spatiotemporal manner to estimate catchment wide r over time no lateral transfer was considered between the individual pixels but rather mapping the vertical exchange of water entering via precipitation and leaving via evapotranspiration and discharge each pixel to estimate the potential recharge component of each cell 3 5 sensitivity of gridded water balance components although using independent water balance components reduces the propagation of errors healy and scanlon 2010 the accuracy of recharge derived from a water budget calculation depends entirely on the uncertainties of each component used as input into the calculation for example previous studies including our study see section 3 4 1 have shown that in some cases mod16 et products result in an over estimation when compared to ground based values miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 zhao and liu 2014 also see section 3 4 1 terrain complexity the distribution and number of measuring stations along with time series availability and measurement frequency can affect the precision and representativity of measurements taken coxon et al 2015 schiemann et al 2010 turnipseed and sauer 2010 this is particularly true when measuring precipitation where amounts can vary greatly in both seasonal and spatial distribution especially over complex terrain schiemann et al 2010 sun et al 2018 although the input components stem from independent sources they are by nature highly inter dependant however in assuming that they are unbiased and normally distributed the variance σ2 of the individual components can be calculated and the degree of error stemming from each component estimated 7 σ 2 ε σ 2 p σ 2 aetcorr σ 2 q q dis here confidence intervals ci were calculated and explored for recharge estimate using 100 000 random component values generated within a realistic range within which each component was varied by a fixed amount based on estimated data errors the range of precipitation value error was based on a 20 relative standard error suggested by meteoswiss 2013 while the error range for aet was set at 25 based on the findings of miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 and zhao and liu 2014 as well as our own assessment refer to section 3 4 1 the specified error for measured q values is 3 2 after spreafico and weingartner 2005 with higher errors indicated during peak flows in order to account for the high streamflow variability of the thur river and its tributaries the relative standard of error for q q dis was increased to 5 for this study however the error stemming from the gridded distribution of q q dis after section 3 4 3 was not considered in this study and thus q q dis related errors should be considered as being conservative and only related to measurement errors 4 results this section evaluates the individual water balance components some of which were derived from ground based data and presents results from the thur catchment s gridded water balance spatiotemporal recharge over a 20 year period was investigated and the monthly seasonal and annual variability in the water balance components in the thur catchment were examined 4 1 baseflow from total streamflow the results of the digital filter baseflow separation were plotted as monthly data at seasonal intervals fig 4a when considering the ratio of q b to total streamflow q the significance of q b becomes evident for all of the sub catchments in the thur catchment with average contributions of q b ranging from 31 to 57 refer to supplementary table 1 for baseflow ratios along steeper slopes flow velocities are higher and recharge capacity is generally limited favouring surface runoff and instream discharge resulting in elevated q q values whereas gentler slopes experience both slower flow velocities as well as greater storage capacities resulting in a higher contribution of q b to total streamflow anderson et al 1978 lavenne et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 van loon and laaha 2015 the high elevation sub catchments of ap he mos mog and stg displayed a greater proportion of q q relative to q b while the sub catchments wae and fr located in the lowland region of the thur catchment displayed a relatively high proportion of q b in relation to q q although the entire thur catchment experienced a predominance of q q during the winter summer and autumn months with the highest q q values occurring during the summer on average q b continued to make up 45 of the total discharge value and displayed a predominance of 53 of the total streamflow during the spring months when lumping seasonal q q and q b values on a yearly basis elevated contributions of q b during the dry summers of 2003 2015 and 2018 are highlighted making up as much as 55 65 and 60 respectively of total flow recorded at the end of the dry summer months in the thur river fig 4b please refer to supplementary fig s3 for monthly q q and q b values from all of the sub catchments twenty years of hourly quickflow values were fed into the gridded workflow refer to section 3 4 5 in order to evaluate the spatiotemporal r values after eq 6 in the thur catchment and its sub catchments a very strong correlation between the modelled discharge values after viviroli et al 2007c 2007b and q q dis and q b values as used in this study was found refer to supplementary fig s6 4 2 water balance with water balance components used in this study derived from independent sources the extent of water balance closure in the thur catchment after eq 6 was determined using mean monthly seasonal and annual values of input component p correlated with the sum of output components aet corr and the observed q values separated into q q and qb after eq 1 monthly values indicated a very strong correlation with pearson correlation r equal to 0 81 fig 5a the correlations improved further were seasonal fig 5b and annual fig 5c data was used with pearson correlation r equal to 0 89 and 0 94 respectively this suggests that over longer time periods e g seasonal to annual the assumption that the thur catchment is in a steady state and s negligible becomes more valid please refer to table s2 of the supplementary information for a comparison of goodness of fit measures the lack of complete closure might be attributed either to time lags in groundwater to surface water or to measurement errors and uncertainties in the water balance components for instance precipitation can have a relative standard error of 20 as suggested by meteoswiss 2013 moreover in the high elevation reaches of the catchment uncorrected solid precipitation amounts e g snow can have a strong impact dal molin et al 2020 schmucki et al 2014 zappa et al 2003 and potentially limit the complete closure of the water balance for example although some grouping was evident in the monthly data fig 5a with spring and summer values plotting predominantly above and autumn and winter values predominantly below the input vs output correlation line an improved grouping was evident in the seasonal values fig 5b the impact of snow storage and melt is further advocated with most spring and summer data plotting predominantly above the correlation line franz et al 2010 meeks et al 2017 however a more systematic investigation is required to understand this process in detail and thus this outcome should not be over interpreted in the context of this study 4 3 spatiotemporal recharge in the thur catchment 4 3 1 variation in gridded water balance components the spatial distribution of mean monthly p values over the 20 year period from 2000 to 2019 were highest in the high elevation regions to the south of the thur catchment and lowest in the northern reaches of the catchment fig 6a left monthly p values fig 6a bottom right ranged between 1 and 282 mm month over the 20 year period with a monthly mean of 115 mm annual values fig 6a top right show high 1500 mm year p values for 2001 and 2002 nationally recorded wet years and low 1250 mm year p values in 2003 which experienced record breaking heatwaves throughout europe casty et al 2005 schär et al 2004 2015 and 2018 which are also nationally recorded drought years bafu et al 2020 additional dry years in the swiss north eastern pre alps were experienced during 2005 and 2011 meteoswiss 2011 2005 from 2003 2009 and again in 2011 mean annual p values remained at or below the 20 year average of 1371 mm low 40 mm monthly aet corr values were associated with exposed high elevation regions to the south of the thur catchment as well as with the lowland regions to the north where land use is more intense while the highest aet values were associated with the mid latitude reaches of the thur catchment fig 6b left annual aet corr values showed relatively little variation with a maximum value of 544 mm year for the year 2011 a minimum of 486 mm year for 2001 and an overall mean of 514 mm year for the 20 year period fig 6b top right monthly aet corr values oscillated between 15 and 90 mm month with a mean monthly value of 60 mm fig 6b bottom right the distributed mean monthly q q dis values were greatest in association with the valley bottoms where water accumulates with minimum q q dis associated with the narrow alpine valleys to the south of the catchment fig 6c left over the 20 year period monthly q q dis values ranged between 1 53 and 135 mm with a mean value of 40 mm month fig 6c bottom right mean annual q q dis values were highest in 2002 693 mm which is in line with a nationally recorded wet year bafu et al 2020 while the years 2012 and 2013 also presented relatively high 530 mm q q dis values fig 6c top right low q q dis values were associated with the drought years of 2003 2015 and 2018 302 417 and 363 mm respectively with the 2005 2009 2014 and 2017 q q dis values also falling below the 20 year average of 480 mm the water budget components p aet corr and q q dis appear to be influenced by the catchment s topographic variations refer to fig 1b 4 3 2 spatiotemporal groundwater recharge over a 20 year period gridded recharge maps were generated by closing the water balance after eq 6 the mean r values for the thur catchment between the years 2000 2019 ranged from smaller values 500 mm in the central and northern regions to large values 1000 mm in the southern regions fig 7a this is strongly controlled by a difference in precipitation gradient between north and south the standard deviation of the estimated r for the 20 year period indicated a slightly higher degree of deviation in absolute values associated with the mountainous southern regions fig 7b the gridded r values are a conservative spatial estimate of water available for recharge in the thur catchment area while the net spatial change of r values assessed using a pixel wise linear regression is a measure of how much r in mm has changed per pixel over the 20 year period long term change in r was calculated using annual values fig 7c at the 95th percentile level areas within the thur catchment experiencing significant change in r values over the 20 year period comprised 4 4 or 74 98 km2 of the total area and all significant change observed was negative these r changes were restricted to the lower reaches of the thur catchment parts of the fr wae sub catchments and the lower reaches of the jon sub catchment refer to fig 1a for sub catchment locations potential masking of the actual areas experiencing change in r values may result from the use of annual data as in fig 7c moreover comparing the difference in pixel values from the first ten years 2000 2009 with those from the second ten years 2010 2019 of estimated r shows areas that have changed without the constraint of a calculated trend with the pixel wise regression fig 7d areas shown to have experienced negative r rates over the 10 year period fig 7d correspond well with areas of significant change in r using a pixel wise linear regression fig 7c over the 20 year study period the mean temporal recharge values for the entire thur catchment displayed an average monthly short term mean r value of 34 mm month fig 8a while annual long term mean r pixel values ranged between 208 and 578 mm year with a 20 year mean of 410 mm year fig 8b seasonal medium term values displayed a mean r of 121 mm during the winter months 85 mm during spring 93 mm during summer and 110 mm during the autumn months fig 8c it must be noted that due to the use of a conservative baseflow separation method with respect to q b refer to section 3 4 2 and supplementary fig s4 where differences of up to 22 are indicated depending on the separation method resulting r values are conservative and it is likely that the study area is capable of experiencing greater recharge rates as discussed by immerzeel et al 2020 and viviroli et al 2007 mountains can be described as the world s water towers where precipitation and subsequent surface runoff and discharge potentials are high although monthly data suggests that over short periods the thur catchment did on occasion experience water shortage especially during the spring and early summer months as indicated by the negative values 14 6 of the monthly data values were 0 over medium seasonal to long term annual periods a sustained net surplus of r was evident in the thur catchment over the 20 years period fig 8a and b show short monthly and long term annual temporal trends in r where above average blue or below average red r values are indicated with respect to monthly and annual mean values for the 20 year period although short term monthly r values were on occasion negative fig 8a in particular during the spring of 2007 2009 and 2018 a mean value of 34 mm month suggests that on average r is positive in the thur catchment medium term seasonal intervals show that mean seasonal r values were at their lowest during spring while the highest mean seasonal r values occurred during the winter months fig 8c although r values were never negative over medium and long term intervals fig 8b indicates that periods of notably smaller annual r values values below the long term annual mean of 410 mm year in the thur catchment are in line with national drought years 2003 2015 and 2018 while the years 2001 and 2002 display r values of above long term mean potential recharge 410 mm year comparing the intensity of r values below the long term average across the different national drought years the below long term r values of the 2003 drought is seen as having being the least extreme 307 mm and the 2018 drought the most extreme 208 mm highlighting the importance of the initial condition this point is further discussed in section 5 from 2003 until 2011 mean annual r values remained continuously below the long term mean concerning soil moisture variations orth and seneviratne 2012 showed that rather than evapotranspiration or runoff soil moisture memory effects depend on both the initial soil moisture state and the subsequent accumulation of precipitation considering the above average precipitation values spanning the duration from 2001 to 2002 refer to fig 6a initial soil moisture would likely have been elevated prior to 2003 a possible explanation for the lowered r values displaying a relative mildness in spite of the intensity of the 2003 drought the subsequent droughts of 2015 and 2018 followed a period of continued r deficit e g from 2003 to 2011 during which average or below average precipitation rates were experienced and display and increasing severity in terms of below average r values similar findings by van loon and laaha 2015 suggest that both drought duration and deficit is governed by average catchment wetness via precipitation and catchment storage capacity 4 4 sensitivity assessment of water balance components uncertainties in input components to the thur catchment s water balance were assessed and the variance of each component compared after eq 7 annual values of both p and q q dis were approximately normally distributed while aet corr was bimodal and displayed the highest degree of variance fig 9a a stochastic perturbation was added to the variance of the individual variables p aet corr and q q dis variables combined via the introduction of noise which was then compared to the variance of r tendencies show that p although having a lower variance than aet corr displays the greatest spread in values over the period from 2000 to 2019 fig 9b subsequently p represents the component to which r is most sensitive the spread of aet corr was smaller followed by q q dis suggesting greater certainty in these data sets particularly in q q dis these results highlight some of the primary uncertainties and sensitvities in the water budget calculation 5 discussion this study investigated the feasibility of estimating spatiotemporal variations in r using a combination of satellite image products in conjunction with ground based discharge data in a mesoscale catchment over a 20 year period the use of rs data is of particular interest in regions where the availability of direct measurements are either limited or non existent 5 1 actual evapotranspiration although the mod16 et product reproduces basin scale aet response with acceptable uncertainty when compared to expected annual values from mu et al 2011 mean aet 410 mm year zappa et al 2017 mean aet 558 mm year and seneviratne et al 2012 mean aet 577 mm year original mod16 et values for the thur catchment were high with mean pixel values ranging between 685 and 766 mm year previous studies have shown that the mod16 et product may result in an over estimation when compared to ground based values miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 zhao and liu 2014 a few reasons may lead to the mod16 et product overestimating aet values in the thur catchment including a lack of any topographic correction of the product see zhao and liu 2014 in addition to other factors such as spatiotemporal scale etc lu et al 2019 in light of both the mesoscale size of the thur catchment and its variable topography a correction of the mod16 et values was deemed necessary where the monthly values are concerned inversely fitting the mod16 et data to the measured lysimeter values resulted in a very strong significant positive correlation pearson correlation 0 95 p 0 05 see section 3 4 1 concerning the correction if more sophisticated statistical techniques were used and or a different strategy to weight the values individually were applied slight variations in the satellite data may have been better quantified however this could also have resulted in an overfitting of the data zhao et al 2019 as the lysimeter data only represents a single point scale measurement this study did not seek to achieve a perfect match between mod16 et and lysimeter aet as mentioned previously seneviratne et al 2012 show that the rietholzbach lysimeter seepage and catchment runoffs display very similar monthly dynamics suggesting that the lysimeter is representative for the water balance of entire mos and many eastern swiss catchments in particular the thur river catchment moreover hirschi et al 2017 demonstrated that for the mos sub catchment the lysimeter and eddy covariance ec measurements are in good agreement with the mos sub catchment s long term water balance values all of the mentioned findings emphasize the representativeness of the site level lysimeter for the entire thur catchment despite its comparatively small source area however additional ground based et data might be required to up scale and validate the correction of the mod16 et using observed values although the lysimeter dynamics and rates has been shown to be in good agreement with measurement for a wide range of hydroclimatic region in eastern switzerland and in particular for the thur river basin seneviratne et al 2012 without additional ground based aet data the correction of the mod16 et and subsequent upscaling remains uncertain notwithstanding this simple approach aet corr values compare very strongly with previous aet studies conducted in the thur catchment seneviratne et al 2012 zappa et al 2017 spreafico and weingartner 2005 thus a simple single correction factor for mod16 et data was deemed suitable in scaling the mod16 et values to within a suitable range for the thur catchment 5 2 baseflow separation although a well studied concept baseflow remains difficult to define as demonstrated in this study see section 3 4 2 and supplementary fig s4 and elsewhere duncan 2019 healy and scanlon 2010 nathan and mcmahon 1990 significant errors may be introduced where baseflow is used as a primary indicator of recharge as this represents only a portion of a catchment s total drainage sophocleous 2002 however this study assumes little or no groundwater loss via inter catchment exchange from abstraction or via evapotranspiration in addition the baseflow separation method is also often only appropriate in humid and sub humid conditions healy and scanlon 2010 at larger spatiotemporal scales q b characteristics can provide information on groundwater status and seasonal low flows which are integral to instream ecology duncan 2019 furthermore q b has been ascribed as an integrated characteristic of a catchment s storage potential and response time van loon and laaha 2015 and studies have equated both q b and baseflow index values as being equal to recharge e g lee et al 2006 reitz et al 2017 with average contributions of baseflow ranging from 31 to 57 of total streamflow the importance of subsurface discharge is highlighted a process which is often neglected in studies solely based on surface data hoffmann 2002 in particular during the dry summers of 2003 2015 and 2018 elevated baseflow would have made an important contribution to the thur river and its tributaries highlighting the importance of groundwater in maintaining aquatic ecosystems during dry periods moeck et al 2020 5 3 closing the water balance input p values over seasonal and annual time scales correlated very strongly with aggregated output values of aet corr q q and q b indicating a trend towards total closure of the thur catchment s water balance and supporting the assumption that over longer timescales the thur catchment represents a steady state system spreafico and weingartner 2005 zappa et al 2017 although minor fluctuations might occur in the thur s s value as shown in zappa et al 2017 over longer time scales 10 years and considering the humid climatic conditions prevalent in the thur catchment s variability would generally be very small relative to the volumes of the other water balance components han et al 2020 reitz et al 2017 however the lack of complete water balance closure might be attributed to both small fluctuations in s especially over shorter time intervals 5 4 spatiotemporal recharge over the 20 year period the thur catchment experienced a total of eleven years with below average r values refer to fig 8b nine of which were consecutively lower than the annual mean in spite of this a linear pixel wise regression indicated that only 4 4 of the thur catchment experienced significant overall change in r at the 95th percentile spatially significant change assessed over the 20 year period indicated a predominantly negative trend in r values primarily in association with the lower reaches of the thur catchment and in regions associated with the fr wae and lower jon sub catchments located in middle reaches of the catchment fig 7c this negative trend could be attributed to the lower average p values associated with the affected regions refer to fig 6a as well as the total 11 years of below average r values experienced in the thur catchment between 2003 and 2011 the years 2003 2015 and 2018 were national drought years in switzerland and the impact thereof is evident in the long term temporal p q q dis and r values while fluctuations in the aet corr values showed relatively little response to changes in p over the 20 year period the limiting effect of p on r is evident from the spatiotemporal assessment which is in line with other findings in the thur catchment dal molin et al 2020 the relationship between p and et has been shown to be one of long term equilibrium dependent on larger scale climate fluctuations e g el nino rather than the monthly seasonal yearly time steps investigated here zhang et al 2013 although 2003 is known as a year of record breaking heatwave throughout europe compared to the 2015 and 2018 drought years the extremity of the below average r values in 2003 appears to have been positively buffered by higher than average precipitation during 2001 and 2002 this suggests that the long term r behaviour in the thur catchment is in line with findings by orth and seneviratne 2012 concerning soil moisture variations concerning the increasing extremity of below average r values from the 2003 to the 2015 and finally the 2018 drought years in this study highlights the effects of hydrological wet years preceding hydrological drought years in terms of r values as such average catchment wetness and soil moisture effects and memories could be an important factor to consider as part of a water management strategy within the thur catchment advances in remotely sensed soil moisture studies may aid in this endeavour dorigo et al 2016 nicolai shaw et al 2015 and further investigation along this line is recommended for the thur catchment as mentioned in section 4 3 2 over short time intervals r values were occasionally negative this might be as a result of a time lag in the r and q q dis values or due to the inherrent errors in the input components refer to section 4 4 in other studies where the sum of the aet corr and q q dis values were greater than corresponding p values a common approach has been to adjust one of the components to ensure water balance closure for example reitz et al 2017 estimated gridded annual recharge quickflow and et for the contiguous u s but in 15 of all map pixels the sum of et and quickflow were higher than precipitation and adjustments were made to close the water balance the majority of these adjustments are made to the et values as et is the most difficult water balance component to accurately quantify bhattarai et al 2016 hulsman et al 2020 reitz et al 2017 zhao and liu 2014 to draw attention to the difficulties of estimating recharge from a relatively simple water budget calculation no attempt was made to close the balance in this study see section 4 2 as such estimated spatiotemporal r values determined in this study serve to gauge the minimum rate at which the groundwater table should be re supplied in the thur catchment on average when considering the total water balance of the thur catchment and assuming negligible change in subsurface storage recharge r accounted for 29 quick flow q q dis for 34 and aet aet corr for 37 of total precipitation groundwater r estimates are in line with modelled values for the region after studies from abbaspour et al 2007 in light of the method uncertainties in estimating quick and baseflow from total discharge value a maximum difference of 22 was observed between the different methods refer to supplementary fig s4 the recharge estimates for the thur catchment may in fact be greater and consequently quick flow smaller however this potential for greater recharge may again be negated in regions where the groundwater table intersects rooting depth a study by von freyberg et al 2015 reported recharge in the mos sub catchment as 71 of precipitation however these recharge estimates were lysimeter based where no or only little surface run occurred due to the lysimeter setup the sum of r and q q dis values comprise 63 of precipitation in the thur catchment increased recharge estimates depending on the baseflow separation method used when comparing water balance components for the different sub catchments of the thur catchment the amount of r was seen to increase only slightly with higher the elevation sub catchments fig 10a and greater changes were observed in the proportion of decreasing evapotranspiration with respect to increasing quickflow fig 10b refer to supplementary fig s7 and table s2 for percentage error compared to total available water in terms of p in the thur catchment although not considered in detail in this study the geological setting and lithological variances along with anthropogenic alterations might also further control the baseflow contribution dal molin et al 2020 weatherl et al 2021 the aforementioned available seepage data from the lysimeter located in the mos sub catchment hirschi et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2012 was compared to the gridded r values determined in this study refer to supplementary fig s8 it was assumed that no overland flow forms on the top of the lysimeter and that all the rainfall infiltrates into the lysimeter storage due to the existence of a 10 cm steel edge surrounding the top of the lysimeter ghasemizade et al 2015 moreover the lysimeter is located in the grassland setting next to the valley bottom thus a substraction of q q was seen to be necessary to make a comparision between gridded r values and lysimeter seepage when the quickflow q q values were subtracted from the lysimeter seepage values lysimeter q q a strong correlation after evans 1996 was found between the lysimeter seepage values and the gridded r values pearson correlation 0 55 more importantly the lysimeter q q values show a stronger 1 1 relation to r values representative of effective recharge in the mos sub catchment supplementary fig s8 refer to table s4 of the supplementary information for an evaluation of goodness of fit measurements of lysimeter values vs gridded r values 5 5 limitations although long term changes in subsurface storage are possible assuming that storage change is small relative to the volumes of p aet corr and q q dis 100 closure constraint was used for time span 20 years of this study no attempt was made in this work to describe interpixel transfer of groundwater flow rather the contributing factor of p entering a pixel cell to become the potential recharge component r as expressed by a conservative q b value at the discharge station was mapped previous studies indicated a groundwater residence time of 20 days or more for groundwater sources located at distances 300 m from the thur river hoehn and scholtis 2011 moreover flowpaths associated to karstic structures cannot be identified with our approach and might bias locally the obtained results however closer of the water balance for each sub catchment indicate that this has likely only a smaller impact although knowledge concerning the lateral connection between pixels could improve the temporal understanding of groundwater recharge in the thur catchment considering the relatively short residence time in the major valley bottoms temporal groundwater travel time knowledge would likely only be applicable over monthly or shorter time periods even though the approach used in this study disregards the lag time from groundwater recharge to discharge in view of the monthly seasonal and annual scales considered in this study recharge values after eq 6 are believed to represent reliable average estimates in line with findings by the likes of abbaspour et al 2007 and von freyberg et al 2015 chemical and isotope data can provide further insight into specific recharge areas surface groundwater interactions and groundwater ages associated with the thur catchment cirpka et al 2007 hoehn and scholtis 2011 moeck 2021 moeck et al 2017 while it is important to monitor the local effects of groundwater abstraction considering the volumes abstracted relative to the error of p in the thur catchment 20 refer to section 3 5 the current groundwater abstraction rates of 0 65 of total input fall well below the estimated input error and were therefore omitted from this study furthermore any groundwater abstracted is utilized locally within the thur catchment predominantly for the production of potable water and in parts for irrigation and industry abstracted water used for irrigation would flow directly back into the aquifer minus the losses incurred via evapotranspiration while the industrial and drinking water portions would flow back to the rivers via the wastewater treatment plants ultimately contributing to the thur catchment s baseflow and quickflow han et al 2017 further discrepancies in the water budget may arise from errors or uncertainties in the calculated components refer to section 3 5 and or inadequate spatial and temporal accounting of these components coxon et al 2015 healy and scanlon 2010 khan et al 2018 sun et al 2018 although the use of satellite image products in conjunction with ground based discharge data provides evidence of closure of the thur catchment s water balance comparing spatial data over time as binary plots although a common practice is reductionist in that a single value e g mean pixel value is meant to represent characteristics of an entire region this is potentially reductionist especially in catchments with variable terrain the propagation of data and method error although not considered in this study leads to further uncertainty however good closure of the water budge refer to fig 10 along with good correlations with modelled findings please refer to the supplementary figs s1 s2 s6 and s8 suggests that in spite of these uncertainties values in this study are representative of the thur catchment s water balance terrain complexity spatial resolution the distribution and number of measuring stations along with time series availability and measurement frequency can affect the quality and representativity of measurements taken coxon et al 2015 schiemann et al 2010 turnipseed and sauer 2010 for example in spite of the meteoswiss product being of a high standard and in spite of having a lower variance than aet corr perturbations of p displayed the greatest component sensitivity fig 9b precipitation p was the only input into the water budget calculation and therefore small variations or uncertainties in p strongly affect the output water balance components including discharge and recharge the uncertainty of aet corr although smaller may also be affected by errors which arise as a result of terrain complexities as outlined above in addition to product specifics such as lack of terrain correction and the use of the pm equation lu et al 2019 zhao and liu 2014 discharge values used in this study represent both high quality as well as high temporal resolution data this is evident in the low variance and small spread of perturbed q q dis values fig 9a and b the conservative approach used in this study to determine q b implies that resulting values from eq 6 represent minimum possible r values in spite of the uncertainty in the values the use of independent data sets remotely sensed and ground based resulted in a good closure of the thur catchment s long term water balance refer to supplementary fig s7 and table s2 overall the results of this study are in line with findings by schädler and weingartner 2002 highlighting the effect of terrain complexity on major contributing components when calculating a water budget uncertainties in the mod16 et product where within range 10 30 of the reported et uncertainties and studies have shown that the pm based mod16 et product is suitable for regions with spatially heterogeneous land cover such as those found in the thur catchment cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 however the pm based method only applies to active vegetation which may result in skewed values in regions where snow cover is present during the winter months mdaghri alaoui and eugster 2001 due to errors relating to leaf and cloud shadowing effects srivastava et al 2017 recommend a regional scale standardization of the mod16 et product which was done by correcting the mod16 et product by a factor of 0 71 additionally the spatiotemporal resolution of the mod16 et product although suitable for characterizing processes in mesoscale catchments such as the entire thur catchment might be too coarse for use in small catchments such as the mos and he sub catchments both of which are smaller than 17 km2 this could further explain the uncertainty in the aet corr values as these were derived from the mod16 et product corrected to the lysimeter data collected in the mos sub catchment lastly it must also be noted that 20 years provide a relatively small window of observation where the thur s long term water balance is concerned 6 conclusion this study demonstrates that the approach of remote sensing products used in conjunction with ground based data to estimate spatiotemporal groundwater recharge has the potential to be useful both for local and regional water availability assessments as well as long term water resource planning the use of remotely sensed data as presented here offers a method of determining a basin s water balance at the mesoscale through the integration and analysis of observed data reconciled within the water budget equation gridded water balance components p aet corr and q q dis were able to adequately capture the spatiotemporal variability of potential groundwater recharge in the thur catchment over a 20 year period the pixel wise linear regression suggests a decline in r from 2000 to 2019 in particular within the lower reaches of the thur catchment however knowledge of spatiotemporal characteristics remains a factor and full comprehension of the intrinsic heterogeneities and complexities of specific basins may never be entirely possible temporal data of the water balance components emphasized the limiting effect of p on r and stressed the importance of hydrological wet years preceding hydrological drought years in terms of long term below average recharge potential in light of this the inclusion of soil moisture data is recommended in future studies to provide additional insight into spatiotemporal groundwater recharger behaviour in the thur catchment or other mesoscale catchments although reductionist a remotely sensed water budget calculation may go some way towards a holistic starting point for monitoring recharge in mesoscale catchments especially in poorly monitored or remote catchments where the lack of ground based observations could be augmented for example although the 500 m x 500 m gridded resolution used in this study was found to be a limiting factor when dealing with the thur s smaller sub catchments freely available mod16 et data was corrected locally using long term ground based lysimeter measurements from a single site within the thur catchment by comparing variance with other modelled water budged terms it was shown that although the mod16 et product tended to overestimate aet the overestimation was consistent and larger uncertainties were associated precipitation values the use of the mod16 et data was shown to be valuable in determining aet for the mesoscale thur catchment and it is believed that it is applicable to regions with relatively little or no ground based aet measurements remaining cognisant of potential over or under estimation for many catchments long term observations are either completely missing or where monitoring networks do exists these are often falling into disrepair due to a lack of finances and or upkeep montanari et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 spatiotemporal groundwater recharge estimates are useful for water resource managers who want to estimate trends in the water balance and track these changes over time remotely sensed data can be a useful asset in the advancement of hydrological understanding even where gauged basins are concerned this provides significant advantages when dealing with poorly gauged basins and establishing long term data records for such basins in terms of their water availability gleason and durand 2020 however even with additional methodological innovation in the field of rs this study underscores the current need for continued and in some places new ground based monitoring of hydrogeological

8124,study region the mesoscale thur catchment located in the north eastern part of switzerland is a study site in which a range of hydrological research has been conducted study focus groundwater recharge is challenging to quantify due to the complexity of hydrogeological processes and limited observations because of its spatiotemporal availability remotely sensed data present an attractive water management tool its application in mesoscale catchments 10 104 km2 however remains limited this study investigated the use of satellite products used in conjunction with ground based data to determine spatiotemporal variations in water available for groundwater recharge gridded components from readily available precipitation evapotranspiration and hydrological discharge data were used to generate spatiotemporal maps over a 20 year period new hydrological insights for the region closure of the water balance found that monthly data displayed a moderate correlation with improved correlations of obtained seasonal and annual intervals suggesting that over the long term the thur catchment is in a steady state maps were generated and trends for the 20 year period assessed examination of the gridded water balance components for different hydrological years emphasized the limiting effect of precipitation on recharge this study highlights the value of remotely sensed data in groundwater recharge estimates but emphasises the importance of continued ground based monitoring the lack of which is a limiting factor in water management where mesoscale catchments are concerned graphical abstract ga1 keywords mesoscale catchments groundwater recharge spatiotemporal evapotranspiration water balance 1 introduction one of the most important functions of a catchment is its ability to store and release water a characteristic that can buffer against severe weather events seasonal changes and climate variability berghuijs et al 2016 datry et al 2017 staudinger et al 2017 groundwater recharge indicates the existence of renewable groundwater resources and is therefore an important component of a catchment s hydrological functioning döll and fiedler 2008 jasechko et al 2014 mohan et al 2018 groundwater recharge varies in space and time making it difficult to measure directly minnig et al 2018 scanlon et al 2002 von freyberg et al 2015 climate change evolving land utilization abstraction and anthropogenic impacts are a growing concern when characterizing groundwater bodies and predicting their sustainability burri et al 2019 condon and maxwell 2019 han et al 2017 oki and kanae 2006 sridhar et al 2014 in most places groundwater recharge is an integral part of a catchment s water balance therefore monitoring and understanding a catchment s water input and output or water balance is essential to the sustainable management of water resources however both where field and model based estimates are concerned groundwater recharge is often considered a residual product of the water balance assessment accumulating the uncertainties of all other components of the budget reinecke et al 2021 thus reliable estimates are important in a steady state system where net water input equals net water output the components of a catchment s water balance can be related through an equation which can vary in its complexity healy and scanlon 2010 the dominant components which make up a catchment s water balance include precipitation p as primary input and evapotranspiration et as predominant output crosbie et al 2015 dhungel and fiedler 2016 reitz et al 2017 however in mountainous regions stream or river discharge q which can be further divided into quick event based surface flow or quickflow q q and typically slow subsurface flow or baseflow q b contributions often makes up the majority of water output spreafico and weingartner 2005 viviroli et al 2007a zappa et al 2017 discharge q an approximated value of river flow and velocity typically represents high resolution measurements at a specific point however quantifying subsurface contributions of q is often problematic as knowledge of hydraulic parameters is compromised due to subsurface heterogeneity and the limited number and depths of measuring locations alley et al 2002 the water balance components vary in space and time and although linked through large scale interrelationships have very different spatiotemporal characteristics creutzfeldt et al 2014 however according to healy and scanlon 2010 the universal concept of mass conservation of water implies that water balance methods are applicable over any space and time scale pp 15 the major net loss component from a catchment s water balance is generally et the sum of evaporation from ground surface and transpiration from plant surfaces the complex interacting components which result in et are difficult to quantify whether via field based measurements or via remotely sensed technology zhang et al 2016 as a result et typically has the greatest uncertainty of the water balance components velpuri et al 2013 and remains one of the most difficult components to measure accurately ferguson et al 2010 hirschi et al 2017 over longer time scales changes in a catchment s water storage s are often assumed to be small relative to the volumes of the other water balance components han et al 2020 for catchments with no additional inflow from or outflow to adjacent catchments via transfer schemes or sub surface flows s would equal zero and the catchment s water balance can be assumed to be in a steady state healy and scanlon 2010 subsequently both within the fields of research and water resource management it is common to estimate recharge using some form of a water balance equation dages et al 2009 healy et al 2007 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 tilahun and merkel 2009 wfd cis 2016 in the past the measurement of water balance components was traditionally limited to point or plot scales 10 2 m2 to 101 m2 measurements of single components ruth et al 2018 currently remotely sensed products including et derived from computational surface energy balance models that stem from multispectral satellite sensed characteristics i e net radiation surface temperature and vegetation properties offer perhaps one of the most attractive global estimates of water balance measurements as a result this type of data has been used to improve model predictions and to close the water balance leading to a significant reduction in uncertainty anderson et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 1998 irmak et al 2012 nishida et al 2003 tang et al 2010 wang and xie 2018 although comprehensive the available remotely sensed et data are not without their limitations and performance of the products can be adversely affected by factors such as topography vegetation type input datasets estimation methods spatiotemporal scales etc e g li et al 2018 lu et al 2019 zhao and liu 2014 while temporal and spatial scaling whether up or down scaling presents an additional challenge in estimating a catchment s water balance anderson et al 2007 cui et al 2018 hong et al 2009 kalma et al 2008 when coupled with ground based data remotely sensed observations have been shown to provide a more complete understanding of the hydrological system becker 2006 gleason and durand 2020 pavelsky 2014 vereecken et al 2015 both surface and subsurface movement and storage of water are dependent on precipitation temperature fluctuations vegetation type and distribution anthropogenic land and water utilization as well as topographic lithological and soil characteristics moeck et al 2020 sophocleous 2002 wada et al 2010 as such remotely sensed rs data provides an attractive tool in hydrological studies particularly because of the long temporal and large spatial availability of many rs products alem et al 2021 becker and nemec 1987 falalakis and gemitzi 2020 jódar et al 2018 martín arias et al 2020 ollivier et al 2021 2020 sarrazin et al 2018 however due to the pixel resolution of most rs products the use of rs data in hydrological studies of mesoscale catchments typically 10 104 km2 or smaller is limited armanios and fisher 2014 sun et al 2018 in addition although rs components for an entire water budget calculation are readily available reproducible methods for handling the necessary data are not prominent in the literature e g rajib et al 2018 hampering the ease of data application this study investigates the application of satellite derived et products used in conjunction with ground based discharge data using open source software to determine spatiotemporal water distribution and estimate the volumes of water available for potential groundwater recharge hereon referred to as groundwater recharge or r within the mesoscale thur river catchment in switzerland the thur river represents a dynamic system free of any major natural or artificial reservoirs and with its mesoscale catchment 1700 km2 provides a unique opportunity to explore the potential of using readily available rs data to evaluate monthly seasonal and annual r for the years 2000 2019 previous research in the thur catchment focused either on localized field based studies chittoor viswanathan et al 2016 kurth et al 2015 kurth and schirmer 2014 paillex et al 2017 2005 schirmer et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 vogt et al

aims of this study were as follows i assess the spatiotemporal variability of gridded water balance components in the thur catchment for the years 2000 2019 using open source software and readily available rs et data in combination with ground based data ii identify variability in environmental processes during different hydrological years e g wet vs dry years in the mesoscale thur catchment iii determine water availability in the thur catchment for potential groundwater recharge iv explore the results in terms of spatiotemporal distribution in the thur catchment and examine method uncertainties 2 study area and its hydrogeological setting the thur river located in the north eastern part of switzerland fig 1 has an approximate catchment size of 1700 km2 the thur river a tributary to the rhine is the longest river in switzerland free of any major natural or artificial reservoirs along the length of its course 130 km resulting in preannounced seasonality streamflow variability three major tributaries the murg the necker and the sitter flow into the thur river and based on available data from active stream discharge stations the thur catchment can be divided into nine 9 sub catchments fig 1a the headwaters of the thur river arise in the southern glacier free limestone dominated pre alpine region of the catchment near mount säntis where vegetation is sparse and soils are generally shallow here productive groundwater occurrences are confined largely to small fluvio glacial gravel and sand deposits hosted largely within valley bottoms and fractured rock gurtz et al 1999 average depth to groundwater in this southern region is 3 5 m moreover karstic units can represent complex groundwater flow path schürch et al 2007 the pleistocene molass sandstones marls and conglomerates located predominantly in the northern region of the thur catchment are highly productive in terms of groundwater and host one of the largest groundwater systems in switzerland where average depth to groundwater is 1 4 m abbaspour et al 2007 keller 1992 abstraction rate estimates from the largest aquifer in the thur catchment are in the order of 16 million m3 y https umwelt tg ch wasser wassernutzungen zahlen und fakten html 2158 last accessed 11 september 2020 which amounts to approximately 9 4 mm of water abstracted from the groundwater annually although it is important to monitor the local effects of groundwater abstraction which can have strong impacts on groundwater flow data is often limited or completely lacking creutzfeldt et al 2014 when compared to the mean annual precipitation values see below the abstracted groundwater from the largest aquifer amounts to 1 of the annual water input into the thur catchment land use in the thur basin is dominated by agriculture 60 with large areas of pasture forests make up 30 of the land surface and the remaining 10 includes barren land surface waters and urban areas elevation in the thur catchment varies from 2502 to 363 m asl fig 1b with an average slope inclination of 7 9º melsen et al 2016 the hydrological regime of the thur catchment with its warm summer humid continental or sub montane climate gurtz et al 1999 peel et al 2007 is characterized by its variable morphological and climatic elements streamflow in the thur river can fluctuate by up to two orders of magnitude in the space of a few hours with recorded discharge rates at the andelfingen an discharge station ranging from 3 to 1130 m3 s mean discharge of 47 m3 s doulatyari et al 2017 gurtz et al 1999 on average precipitation in the thur catchment varies from 700 mm y in the low elevation northern region to 2700 mm y in the southern mountainous region fig 1c the lowest average evapotranspiration rates 400 mm y are found in regions of high elevation with higher average et is associated with the lower reaches of the thur valley 500 mm y fig 1d the highest average evapotranspiration rates over 1000 mm y are associated with the central region of the thur catchment 700 m asl here land use is associated with mixed pasture agriculture and forestry 3 data and methods this section describes in detail the gridded and ground based data employed in this study as well as the methods applied to calculate groundwater recharge in the thur catchment through employing open source software for the gridded water balance computations the presented workflow is anticipated to be readily transferrable and applicable to other catchments 3 1 precipitation product precipitation being the primary flux in most hydrological cycles requires high resolution data in order to reliably estimate water availability and distribution within a catchment although an array of remotely sensed rainfall data is available e g global precipitation climatology project gpcp tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm global precipitation measurement gpm etc these all have a relatively low resolution 10 250 km2 when considering a mesoscale catchment with a high topographic variability sun et al 2018 thus long term gridded precipitation data interpolated from 73 swiss national stations located within or close to the thur catchment was used for this study meteoswiss 2016 the meteoswiss product consists of continuous high quality measurements interpolated from a network of ground based radar and gauge data using the reduced space optimal interpolation rsoi method specifically developed for regions with a complex orography begert et al 2007 schiemann et al 2010 the interpolation errors for the swiss plateau region has a relative standard error of 20 meteoswiss 2013 and the resulting gridded data has a 2 3 km x 2 3 km resolution the gridded meteoswiss annual january december and monthly rainfall data rhiresy v1 0 and rhiresm v1 0 represents accumulated precipitation including both rainfall and snowfall equivalent in mm the meteoswiss data was resampled using bilinear interpolation to match the resolution of the modis data and used as input in the water budget calculation refer to section 3 4 although a substantial portion of the thur catchment is under agriculture high annual precipitation rates resulting in wet environmental conditions in the catchment renders the irrigated amounts as relatively insignificant when compared to the relatively high surface water availability kanton thurgau amt für umwelt et al 2008 therefore although seasonal water shortage e g summer drought periods are recorded locally discussed in section 4 3 it is assumed that the effect of irrigation is negligible in the sense of the thur catchment s total water balance additionally relatively little variation in precipitation characteristics such as season frequency and duration of dry and wet days appears across the thur s different sub catchments dal molin et al 2020 3 2 evapotranspiration product calculations of aet are generally local measures from eddy covariance ec towers large aperture scintillometers las or lysimeters these methods are often regarded as the most accurate and reliable determination of aet baldocchi 2003 brotzge and crawford 2003 rana and katerji 2000 schrader et al 2013 xu and chen 2005 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of aet upscaling of point information to a regional scale is challenging and models have been employed to compensate for the lack of observations and fill spatial gaps de graaf et al 2017 döll and fiedler 2008 orth and seneviratne 2015 wada et al 2016 remotely sensed products offer feasible alternatives to obtaining aet measurements at regional scales

and land cover from which continuous biophysical variable including land surface temperature albedo soil moisture running et al 2019 1994 from these variables a regional composite et product is estimated at a 500 m x 500 m resolution using the mu et al 2011 improved et algorithm which is based the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 when dealing with et values it must be noted that through the process of hydraulic redistribution hr by plant roots groundwater itself may be contributing to the determined value according to luo et al 2016 where depth to water table ranges between 3 and 6 m the percentage water redistributed may range between 14 5 and 23 for coniferous forests depending on the soil type however were depth to water table is relatively shallow between 1 m and 2 m the effect of groundwater transpirated via hr is often not evident as a roots would be in constant contact with water at this depth luo et al 2016 although remotely sensed et products are currently available with higher pixel resolutions e g guzinski et al 2020 the time series for these products are currently still limited sen et from esa is available as of 2016 the modis et product has well documented quality assessment protocols reproduces basin scale aet response with acceptable uncertainty khan et al 2018 velpuri et al 2013 has good temporal resolution and is freely and easily accessible in light of this the improved gap filled annual january december and 8 day mod16a3gf and mod16a2gf respectively modis hereon referred to as mod16 et data was used as the evapotranspiration

spatiotemporally varying quantities discharge q is measured at a point as a flux through a stream channel tang et al 2010 ten 10 federally operated gauging stations are located in the thur catchment

refer to section 1 2 in supplementary information for details available stream discharge time series were obtained from the swiss federal office for the environment foen and quality checked prior to use the andelfingen an site represents the discharge for the entire thur catchment with 9 sub catchments located upstream of it the next biggest sub catchment is represented by the halden ha site

research catchment is a well instrumented catchment with a long history of both atmospheric and hydraulic data collection readily available long term aet data from studies conducted in the mos sub catchment for the years 1976 2015 hirschi et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2012 were used in this study to evaluate the accuracy of mod16 et data used in calculating the thur catchment s water budget a large weighing lysimeter setup fig 1a in the mos sub catchment is the only independent long term aet data available for the thur catchment the weighting lysimeter with a depth of 2 5 m and a diameter of 2 m is located in a grassland setting next to the valley bottom of the rietholzbach in the upper part of the mos catchment hirschi et al 2017 the lysimeter is mainly filled with gley brown cambisol soil type from the same location including a gravel filter layer at the bottom gurtz et al 2003 moeck et al 2018 at the bottom of the lysimeter water outflow is measured with a tipping bucket as groundwater is shallow at the site and the average rooting depth is around 0 3 m germann 1981 lysimeter seepage can be assumed to be a reliable indicator of actual vertical groundwater recharge ghasemizade et al 2015 seneviratne et al 2012 von freyberg et al 2015 despite scale discrepancy and uncertainties due to the setup of the lysimeter seneviratne et al 2012 show that the rietholzbach lysimeter seepage and catchment runoff display very similar monthly dynamics which suggests that the lysimeter is representative for the water balance of entire mos catchment the largest discrepancies between lysimeter seepage and catchment runoff values were found during march most likely linked to the higher spatial variability of hydrological processes taking place in that month e g snowmelt and the onset of the growing season seneviratne et al 2012 at the surface the lysimeter is covered with a grass species composition which imitates the surrounding conditions including the same cutting scheme hirschi et al 2017 the manner in which the lysimeter is setup i e the weighing of the lysimeter also allows for the estimation of aet a well established technique gebler et al 2015 ghasemizade et al 2015 goss and ehlers 2009 rana and katerji 2000 schrader et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2012 among many others hirschi et al 2017 demonstrated that for the mos sub catchment the lysimeter and eddy covariance ec measurements are in good agreement in particular where the annual timescale is concerned moreover a good agreement was seen when comparing the lysimeter aet values with the mos catchment s long term water balance values hirschi et al 2017 these findings emphasize the representativeness of the site level lysimeter for the entire mos catchment despite its comparatively small source area here we follow vereecken et al 2015 who argued that improved description of soil hydrological fluxes at the local scale are fundamental to reduce large uncertainties which are still present in large scale models or remote sensed data used to predict these fluxes as such and in spite of this area representing only a fraction of the entire thur catchment mod16 et values for the entire thur catchment were bias corrected using the mos sub catchment lysimeter values taking into account that seneviratne et al 2012 found that the rietholzbach catchment is representative of a number of hydroclimatic regions in the swiss eastern plateau in particular for the thur river basin it seems to be reasonable to make the bias correction based on the lysimeter values a more detailed discussion about this assumption and the possible implications for the water balance calculation can be found in section 5 1 when comparing the original mod16 et values for the mos sub catchment to lysimeter values an overestimate in the mod16 et data was evident fig 2a where the lysimeter aet values ranged between 1 20 and 134 20 mm month for the period from 2000 and 2015 the mod16 et values ranged from 15 52 to 132 79 mm month for the same period in order to account for this the mod16 et values were adjusted hereon referred to as aet corr by a correction factor of 0 71 this factor was estimated by inversely fitting the original mod16 et data to the measured lysimeter values while seeking to reduce the daily mismatch overall fitted results are in good agreement with the observed lysimeter data fig 2b furthermore a comparison between the aet corr values and modelled aet values after zappa et al 2017 show a very strong positive after evans 1996 correlation pearson correlation 0 97 refer to the supplementary fig s1 although the pearson s correlation coefficient r can be overly sensitive to outliers in light of the large data set the method was deemed suitable as a basic comparison between the original mod16 and the aet corr values dessu et al 2018 legates and mccabe 1999 in addition when looking at the expected mod16 et values as described by mu et al 2011 at a latitude of approximately 47 5⁰ the latitude of the thur catchment these values are in line with the lysimeter values and subsequently the aet corr additionally p values from the meteoswiss data were compared to precipitation data from the meteorological station büel located at the outlet of the mos sub catchment and in close proximity of the above described lysimeter located in the mos sub catchment data available from https iac ethz ch group land climate dynamics research rietholzbach data html findings show a very strong positive correlation after evans 1996 between the gridded p values from the meteoswiss data with those from the büel station pearson correlation 0 93 refer to fig s2 in the supplementary information 3 4 2 baseflow from total discharge values baseflow separation is a method whereby total stream discharge q is separated into precipitation event based surface discharge components often referred to as quickflow q q and baseflow components q b eq 1 baseflow q b is usually associated with subsurface processes cannot be attributed to a single precipitation event and has been taken as a quantitative variable of groundwater discharge to rivers by many authors blume et al 2007 duncan 2019 fendeková and fendek 2012 hall 1968 healy and scanlon 2010 hellwig and stahl 2018 nathan and mcmahon 1990 reitz et al 2017 sutcliffe et al 1981 baseflow represents a part of the groundwater which returns to the surface water a process through which many rivers and lakes are fed and aquatic ecosystems are maintained during dry periods aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gurdak 2017 infiltration to recharge subsurface storage increases baseflow but due to aet baseflow can also be reduced as temperature gradients and trees absorb water from the ground using a digital filter method available in the ecohydrology r package r core team 2018 with three passes and filter parameter set to 0 925 as proposed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 base and quickflow was estimated from the available q data in order to estimate baseflow from total streamflow in the thur catchment 1 q q q q b a baseflow index was generated for each sub catchment refer to supplementary table s1 and fig s3 in addition a baseflow separation method comparison was conducted after zomlot et al 2015 using the free online automated web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2010 2005 to compare three separation methods 1 the eckhardt recursive digital filter eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2005 with filter parameter set to 0 98 and 0 925 2 the local minimum method and 3 the one parameter method on average the ammount of baseflow contribution derived from the different methods varied by up to 22 refer to supplementary fig s4 using a recursive digital filter method with the filter parameter set to 0 925 was the most conservative approach resulting in an average monthly baseflow contribution of 43 in order not to over estimate recharge values in this study q q was deterimined using the method most conservative with respect to q b 3 4 3 spatially gridded discharge in order to evaluate the discharge volumes in mm in the thur catchment on a spatial basis as part of the water balance point measurements of stream volumes weighted based on a topographically based top down flow accumulation fa algorithm generated using saga gis were used conrad et al 2015 refer to supplementary fig s5 for a comparison of fa weight ranking methods the fa raster was based on a flow routing algorithm after seibert and mcglynn 2007 tarboron 1997 generated from a 25 m raster dem source federal office of topography which was pre processed using wang and liu s 2006 fill sink process wang and liu 2006 the fa raster was resampled using bilinear interpolation to match the 500 m x 500 m raster resolution of the mod16 et data and then normalized and inverted fa norm after de lavenne et al 2019 to create a weighting factor between 0 and 1 with the greater part of the q q volume weighted to the upstream reaches of the thur river 2 fa norm 1 fa fa min fa max fa min before being multiplied by the temporally aggregated quickflow q q values of each sub catchment in order to represent spatially distributed quickflow q q dis for the thur catchment 3 q q dis q q fa norm a comparison of the fa values with the inverted fa values is presented in fig s5 which indicates that the inverted fa fa norm more closely represent the measured baseflow values q b the resulting product although based on an algorithm which laterally connects adjoining downstream pixels was used purely to represent discharge volumes spatially as input into the water budget calculation eq 6 fig 3 as such each pixel value does not represent actual measured q q at the pixel location but rather each q q dis pixel merely represents a portion of the precipitation into that cell which ultimately produces the measured downstream q q response however results show a very strong positive correlation pearson correlation 0 94 after evans 1996 with modelled results viviroli et al 2007b 2007c refer to supplementary fig s6 3 4 4 recharge estimates from the water balance equation in cases where a catchment represents a steady state system the terrestrial water budget is equal to all inputs into minus all outputs out of the system this implies that over long time periods e g annual catchment storage change s calculated from eq 4 does not vary and baseflow can be defined as representative of effective groundwater recharge reitz et al 2017 schilling et al 2021 wolock 2003 4 p et q s 0 where p represents input in the form of precipitation et and q represent output in the form of evapotranspiration and discharge as a sum of q q and q b and s is the change of storage discharge q was separated into its quick and baseflow components using a q b conservative digital filter method refer to section 3 4 4 where q b would represent the minimum effective groundwater recharge 5 q b p aet corr q q bearing in mind the inherent uncertainty in all of these variables e g coxon et al 2015 li et al 2018 lu et al 2019 meteoswiss 2013 zhao and liu 2014 and assuming acceptable or constant component errors refer to section 3 5 the water available for recharge referred to here as potential recharge r in the thur catchment was described using the independent gridded water balance component aet corr and q q dis values as follows 6 r q b p aet corr q q dis where the gridded spatiotemporal r values represent the value of water which would result in the modelled q b response after eq 1 derived from measured q values according to creutzfeldt et al 2014 the spatiotemporal variability and availability of water in a catchment is controlled by underlying processes e g spatially changing boundary conditions and temporal fluxes in catchment parameters any change in trend representing both the direction and rate of change can be determined by the slope of a linear regression model de jong et al 2011 gridded values of r were assessed using a pixel wise ordinary least squares linear regression for the 20 years from 2000 to 2019 at the 95 significance level determining changes in recharge characteristics in the thur catchment additionally the difference in mean r values estimated over the first 10 years 2000 2009 was compared to the mean r values estimated over the second 10 years 2010 2019 of the total study period refer to section 4 3 1 3 4 5 workflow using the open source statistical program r r core team 2018 grid based computations were conducted for the thur catchment at the 500 m x 500 m resolution with each independently estimated input variable representing a water balance component in rates per unit area for the years 2000 2019 the work process for the data processing is illustrated as a flow diagram in fig 3 this method relates the water balance components p aet corr and q q dis in a spatiotemporal manner to estimate catchment wide r over time no lateral transfer was considered between the individual pixels but rather mapping the vertical exchange of water entering via precipitation and leaving via evapotranspiration and discharge each pixel to estimate the potential recharge component of each cell 3 5 sensitivity of gridded water balance components although using independent water balance components reduces the propagation of errors healy and scanlon 2010 the accuracy of recharge derived from a water budget calculation depends entirely on the uncertainties of each component used as input into the calculation for example previous studies including our study see section 3 4 1 have shown that in some cases mod16 et products result in an over estimation when compared to ground based values miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 zhao and liu 2014 also see section 3 4 1 terrain complexity the distribution and number of measuring stations along with time series availability and measurement frequency can affect the precision and representativity of measurements taken coxon et al 2015 schiemann et al 2010 turnipseed and sauer 2010 this is particularly true when measuring precipitation where amounts can vary greatly in both seasonal and spatial distribution especially over complex terrain schiemann et al 2010 sun et al 2018 although the input components stem from independent sources they are by nature highly inter dependant however in assuming that they are unbiased and normally distributed the variance σ2 of the individual components can be calculated and the degree of error stemming from each component estimated 7 σ 2 ε σ 2 p σ 2 aetcorr σ 2 q q dis here confidence intervals ci were calculated and explored for recharge estimate using 100 000 random component values generated within a realistic range within which each component was varied by a fixed amount based on estimated data errors the range of precipitation value error was based on a 20 relative standard error suggested by meteoswiss 2013 while the error range for aet was set at 25 based on the findings of miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 and zhao and liu 2014 as well as our own assessment refer to section 3 4 1 the specified error for measured q values is 3 2 after spreafico and weingartner 2005 with higher errors indicated during peak flows in order to account for the high streamflow variability of the thur river and its tributaries the relative standard of error for q q dis was increased to 5 for this study however the error stemming from the gridded distribution of q q dis after section 3 4 3 was not considered in this study and thus q q dis related errors should be considered as being conservative and only related to measurement errors 4 results this section evaluates the individual water balance components some of which were derived from ground based data and presents results from the thur catchment s gridded water balance spatiotemporal recharge over a 20 year period was investigated and the monthly seasonal and annual variability in the water balance components in the thur catchment were examined 4 1 baseflow from total streamflow the results of the digital filter baseflow separation were plotted as monthly data at seasonal intervals fig 4a when considering the ratio of q b to total streamflow q the significance of q b becomes evident for all of the sub catchments in the thur catchment with average contributions of q b ranging from 31 to 57 refer to supplementary table 1 for baseflow ratios along steeper slopes flow velocities are higher and recharge capacity is generally limited favouring surface runoff and instream discharge resulting in elevated q q values whereas gentler slopes experience both slower flow velocities as well as greater storage capacities resulting in a higher contribution of q b to total streamflow anderson et al 1978 lavenne et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 van loon and laaha 2015 the high elevation sub catchments of ap he mos mog and stg displayed a greater proportion of q q relative to q b while the sub catchments wae and fr located in the lowland region of the thur catchment displayed a relatively high proportion of q b in relation to q q although the entire thur catchment experienced a predominance of q q during the winter summer and autumn months with the highest q q values occurring during the summer on average q b continued to make up 45 of the total discharge value and displayed a predominance of 53 of the total streamflow during the spring months when lumping seasonal q q and q b values on a yearly basis elevated contributions of q b during the dry summers of 2003 2015 and 2018 are highlighted making up as much as 55 65 and 60 respectively of total flow recorded at the end of the dry summer months in the thur river fig 4b please refer to supplementary fig s3 for monthly q q and q b values from all of the sub catchments twenty years of hourly quickflow values were fed into the gridded workflow refer to section 3 4 5 in order to evaluate the spatiotemporal r values after eq 6 in the thur catchment and its sub catchments a very strong correlation between the modelled discharge values after viviroli et al 2007c 2007b and q q dis and q b values as used in this study was found refer to supplementary fig s6 4 2 water balance with water balance components used in this study derived from independent sources the extent of water balance closure in the thur catchment after eq 6 was determined using mean monthly seasonal and annual values of input component p correlated with the sum of output components aet corr and the observed q values separated into q q and qb after eq 1 monthly values indicated a very strong correlation with pearson correlation r equal to 0 81 fig 5a the correlations improved further were seasonal fig 5b and annual fig 5c data was used with pearson correlation r equal to 0 89 and 0 94 respectively this suggests that over longer time periods e g seasonal to annual the assumption that the thur catchment is in a steady state and s negligible becomes more valid please refer to table s2 of the supplementary information for a comparison of goodness of fit measures the lack of complete closure might be attributed either to time lags in groundwater to surface water or to measurement errors and uncertainties in the water balance components for instance precipitation can have a relative standard error of 20 as suggested by meteoswiss 2013 moreover in the high elevation reaches of the catchment uncorrected solid precipitation amounts e g snow can have a strong impact dal molin et al 2020 schmucki et al 2014 zappa et al 2003 and potentially limit the complete closure of the water balance for example although some grouping was evident in the monthly data fig 5a with spring and summer values plotting predominantly above and autumn and winter values predominantly below the input vs output correlation line an improved grouping was evident in the seasonal values fig 5b the impact of snow storage and melt is further advocated with most spring and summer data plotting predominantly above the correlation line franz et al 2010 meeks et al 2017 however a more systematic investigation is required to understand this process in detail and thus this outcome should not be over interpreted in the context of this study 4 3 spatiotemporal recharge in the thur catchment 4 3 1 variation in gridded water balance components the spatial distribution of mean monthly p values over the 20 year period from 2000 to 2019 were highest in the high elevation regions to the south of the thur catchment and lowest in the northern reaches of the catchment fig 6a left monthly p values fig 6a bottom right ranged between 1 and 282 mm month over the 20 year period with a monthly mean of 115 mm annual values fig 6a top right show high 1500 mm year p values for 2001 and 2002 nationally recorded wet years and low 1250 mm year p values in 2003 which experienced record breaking heatwaves throughout europe casty et al 2005 schär et al 2004 2015 and 2018 which are also nationally recorded drought years bafu et al 2020 additional dry years in the swiss north eastern pre alps were experienced during 2005 and 2011 meteoswiss 2011 2005 from 2003 2009 and again in 2011 mean annual p values remained at or below the 20 year average of 1371 mm low 40 mm monthly aet corr values were associated with exposed high elevation regions to the south of the thur catchment as well as with the lowland regions to the north where land use is more intense while the highest aet values were associated with the mid latitude reaches of the thur catchment fig 6b left annual aet corr values showed relatively little variation with a maximum value of 544 mm year for the year 2011 a minimum of 486 mm year for 2001 and an overall mean of 514 mm year for the 20 year period fig 6b top right monthly aet corr values oscillated between 15 and 90 mm month with a mean monthly value of 60 mm fig 6b bottom right the distributed mean monthly q q dis values were greatest in association with the valley bottoms where water accumulates with minimum q q dis associated with the narrow alpine valleys to the south of the catchment fig 6c left over the 20 year period monthly q q dis values ranged between 1 53 and 135 mm with a mean value of 40 mm month fig 6c bottom right mean annual q q dis values were highest in 2002 693 mm which is in line with a nationally recorded wet year bafu et al 2020 while the years 2012 and 2013 also presented relatively high 530 mm q q dis values fig 6c top right low q q dis values were associated with the drought years of 2003 2015 and 2018 302 417 and 363 mm respectively with the 2005 2009 2014 and 2017 q q dis values also falling below the 20 year average of 480 mm the water budget components p aet corr and q q dis appear to be influenced by the catchment s topographic variations refer to fig 1b 4 3 2 spatiotemporal groundwater recharge over a 20 year period gridded recharge maps were generated by closing the water balance after eq 6 the mean r values for the thur catchment between the years 2000 2019 ranged from smaller values 500 mm in the central and northern regions to large values 1000 mm in the southern regions fig 7a this is strongly controlled by a difference in precipitation gradient between north and south the standard deviation of the estimated r for the 20 year period indicated a slightly higher degree of deviation in absolute values associated with the mountainous southern regions fig 7b the gridded r values are a conservative spatial estimate of water available for recharge in the thur catchment area while the net spatial change of r values assessed using a pixel wise linear regression is a measure of how much r in mm has changed per pixel over the 20 year period long term change in r was calculated using annual values fig 7c at the 95th percentile level areas within the thur catchment experiencing significant change in r values over the 20 year period comprised 4 4 or 74 98 km2 of the total area and all significant change observed was negative these r changes were restricted to the lower reaches of the thur catchment parts of the fr wae sub catchments and the lower reaches of the jon sub catchment refer to fig 1a for sub catchment locations potential masking of the actual areas experiencing change in r values may result from the use of annual data as in fig 7c moreover comparing the difference in pixel values from the first ten years 2000 2009 with those from the second ten years 2010 2019 of estimated r shows areas that have changed without the constraint of a calculated trend with the pixel wise regression fig 7d areas shown to have experienced negative r rates over the 10 year period fig 7d correspond well with areas of significant change in r using a pixel wise linear regression fig 7c over the 20 year study period the mean temporal recharge values for the entire thur catchment displayed an average monthly short term mean r value of 34 mm month fig 8a while annual long term mean r pixel values ranged between 208 and 578 mm year with a 20 year mean of 410 mm year fig 8b seasonal medium term values displayed a mean r of 121 mm during the winter months 85 mm during spring 93 mm during summer and 110 mm during the autumn months fig 8c it must be noted that due to the use of a conservative baseflow separation method with respect to q b refer to section 3 4 2 and supplementary fig s4 where differences of up to 22 are indicated depending on the separation method resulting r values are conservative and it is likely that the study area is capable of experiencing greater recharge rates as discussed by immerzeel et al 2020 and viviroli et al 2007 mountains can be described as the world s water towers where precipitation and subsequent surface runoff and discharge potentials are high although monthly data suggests that over short periods the thur catchment did on occasion experience water shortage especially during the spring and early summer months as indicated by the negative values 14 6 of the monthly data values were 0 over medium seasonal to long term annual periods a sustained net surplus of r was evident in the thur catchment over the 20 years period fig 8a and b show short monthly and long term annual temporal trends in r where above average blue or below average red r values are indicated with respect to monthly and annual mean values for the 20 year period although short term monthly r values were on occasion negative fig 8a in particular during the spring of 2007 2009 and 2018 a mean value of 34 mm month suggests that on average r is positive in the thur catchment medium term seasonal intervals show that mean seasonal r values were at their lowest during spring while the highest mean seasonal r values occurred during the winter months fig 8c although r values were never negative over medium and long term intervals fig 8b indicates that periods of notably smaller annual r values values below the long term annual mean of 410 mm year in the thur catchment are in line with national drought years 2003 2015 and 2018 while the years 2001 and 2002 display r values of above long term mean potential recharge 410 mm year comparing the intensity of r values below the long term average across the different national drought years the below long term r values of the 2003 drought is seen as having being the least extreme 307 mm and the 2018 drought the most extreme 208 mm highlighting the importance of the initial condition this point is further discussed in section 5 from 2003 until 2011 mean annual r values remained continuously below the long term mean concerning soil moisture variations orth and seneviratne 2012 showed that rather than evapotranspiration or runoff soil moisture memory effects depend on both the initial soil moisture state and the subsequent accumulation of precipitation considering the above average precipitation values spanning the duration from 2001 to 2002 refer to fig 6a initial soil moisture would likely have been elevated prior to 2003 a possible explanation for the lowered r values displaying a relative mildness in spite of the intensity of the 2003 drought the subsequent droughts of 2015 and 2018 followed a period of continued r deficit e g from 2003 to 2011 during which average or below average precipitation rates were experienced and display and increasing severity in terms of below average r values similar findings by van loon and laaha 2015 suggest that both drought duration and deficit is governed by average catchment wetness via precipitation and catchment storage capacity 4 4 sensitivity assessment of water balance components uncertainties in input components to the thur catchment s water balance were assessed and the variance of each component compared after eq 7 annual values of both p and q q dis were approximately normally distributed while aet corr was bimodal and displayed the highest degree of variance fig 9a a stochastic perturbation was added to the variance of the individual variables p aet corr and q q dis variables combined via the introduction of noise which was then compared to the variance of r tendencies show that p although having a lower variance than aet corr displays the greatest spread in values over the period from 2000 to 2019 fig 9b subsequently p represents the component to which r is most sensitive the spread of aet corr was smaller followed by q q dis suggesting greater certainty in these data sets particularly in q q dis these results highlight some of the primary uncertainties and sensitvities in the water budget calculation 5 discussion this study investigated the feasibility of estimating spatiotemporal variations in r using a combination of satellite image products in conjunction with ground based discharge data in a mesoscale catchment over a 20 year period the use of rs data is of particular interest in regions where the availability of direct measurements are either limited or non existent 5 1 actual evapotranspiration although the mod16 et product reproduces basin scale aet response with acceptable uncertainty when compared to expected annual values from mu et al 2011 mean aet 410 mm year zappa et al 2017 mean aet 558 mm year and seneviratne et al 2012 mean aet 577 mm year original mod16 et values for the thur catchment were high with mean pixel values ranging between 685 and 766 mm year previous studies have shown that the mod16 et product may result in an over estimation when compared to ground based values miranda et al 2017 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 zhao and liu 2014 a few reasons may lead to the mod16 et product overestimating aet values in the thur catchment including a lack of any topographic correction of the product see zhao and liu 2014 in addition to other factors such as spatiotemporal scale etc lu et al 2019 in light of both the mesoscale size of the thur catchment and its variable topography a correction of the mod16 et values was deemed necessary where the monthly values are concerned inversely fitting the mod16 et data to the measured lysimeter values resulted in a very strong significant positive correlation pearson correlation 0 95 p 0 05 see section 3 4 1 concerning the correction if more sophisticated statistical techniques were used and or a different strategy to weight the values individually were applied slight variations in the satellite data may have been better quantified however this could also have resulted in an overfitting of the data zhao et al 2019 as the lysimeter data only represents a single point scale measurement this study did not seek to achieve a perfect match between mod16 et and lysimeter aet as mentioned previously seneviratne et al 2012 show that the rietholzbach lysimeter seepage and catchment runoffs display very similar monthly dynamics suggesting that the lysimeter is representative for the water balance of entire mos and many eastern swiss catchments in particular the thur river catchment moreover hirschi et al 2017 demonstrated that for the mos sub catchment the lysimeter and eddy covariance ec measurements are in good agreement with the mos sub catchment s long term water balance values all of the mentioned findings emphasize the representativeness of the site level lysimeter for the entire thur catchment despite its comparatively small source area however additional ground based et data might be required to up scale and validate the correction of the mod16 et using observed values although the lysimeter dynamics and rates has been shown to be in good agreement with measurement for a wide range of hydroclimatic region in eastern switzerland and in particular for the thur river basin seneviratne et al 2012 without additional ground based aet data the correction of the mod16 et and subsequent upscaling remains uncertain notwithstanding this simple approach aet corr values compare very strongly with previous aet studies conducted in the thur catchment seneviratne et al 2012 zappa et al 2017 spreafico and weingartner 2005 thus a simple single correction factor for mod16 et data was deemed suitable in scaling the mod16 et values to within a suitable range for the thur catchment 5 2 baseflow separation although a well studied concept baseflow remains difficult to define as demonstrated in this study see section 3 4 2 and supplementary fig s4 and elsewhere duncan 2019 healy and scanlon 2010 nathan and mcmahon 1990 significant errors may be introduced where baseflow is used as a primary indicator of recharge as this represents only a portion of a catchment s total drainage sophocleous 2002 however this study assumes little or no groundwater loss via inter catchment exchange from abstraction or via evapotranspiration in addition the baseflow separation method is also often only appropriate in humid and sub humid conditions healy and scanlon 2010 at larger spatiotemporal scales q b characteristics can provide information on groundwater status and seasonal low flows which are integral to instream ecology duncan 2019 furthermore q b has been ascribed as an integrated characteristic of a catchment s storage potential and response time van loon and laaha 2015 and studies have equated both q b and baseflow index values as being equal to recharge e g lee et al 2006 reitz et al 2017 with average contributions of baseflow ranging from 31 to 57 of total streamflow the importance of subsurface discharge is highlighted a process which is often neglected in studies solely based on surface data hoffmann 2002 in particular during the dry summers of 2003 2015 and 2018 elevated baseflow would have made an important contribution to the thur river and its tributaries highlighting the importance of groundwater in maintaining aquatic ecosystems during dry periods moeck et al 2020 5 3 closing the water balance input p values over seasonal and annual time scales correlated very strongly with aggregated output values of aet corr q q and q b indicating a trend towards total closure of the thur catchment s water balance and supporting the assumption that over longer timescales the thur catchment represents a steady state system spreafico and weingartner 2005 zappa et al 2017 although minor fluctuations might occur in the thur s s value as shown in zappa et al 2017 over longer time scales 10 years and considering the humid climatic conditions prevalent in the thur catchment s variability would generally be very small relative to the volumes of the other water balance components han et al 2020 reitz et al 2017 however the lack of complete water balance closure might be attributed to both small fluctuations in s especially over shorter time intervals 5 4 spatiotemporal recharge over the 20 year period the thur catchment experienced a total of eleven years with below average r values refer to fig 8b nine of which were consecutively lower than the annual mean in spite of this a linear pixel wise regression indicated that only 4 4 of the thur catchment experienced significant overall change in r at the 95th percentile spatially significant change assessed over the 20 year period indicated a predominantly negative trend in r values primarily in association with the lower reaches of the thur catchment and in regions associated with the fr wae and lower jon sub catchments located in middle reaches of the catchment fig 7c this negative trend could be attributed to the lower average p values associated with the affected regions refer to fig 6a as well as the total 11 years of below average r values experienced in the thur catchment between 2003 and 2011 the years 2003 2015 and 2018 were national drought years in switzerland and the impact thereof is evident in the long term temporal p q q dis and r values while fluctuations in the aet corr values showed relatively little response to changes in p over the 20 year period the limiting effect of p on r is evident from the spatiotemporal assessment which is in line with other findings in the thur catchment dal molin et al 2020 the relationship between p and et has been shown to be one of long term equilibrium dependent on larger scale climate fluctuations e g el nino rather than the monthly seasonal yearly time steps investigated here zhang et al 2013 although 2003 is known as a year of record breaking heatwave throughout europe compared to the 2015 and 2018 drought years the extremity of the below average r values in 2003 appears to have been positively buffered by higher than average precipitation during 2001 and 2002 this suggests that the long term r behaviour in the thur catchment is in line with findings by orth and seneviratne 2012 concerning soil moisture variations concerning the increasing extremity of below average r values from the 2003 to the 2015 and finally the 2018 drought years in this study highlights the effects of hydrological wet years preceding hydrological drought years in terms of r values as such average catchment wetness and soil moisture effects and memories could be an important factor to consider as part of a water management strategy within the thur catchment advances in remotely sensed soil moisture studies may aid in this endeavour dorigo et al 2016 nicolai shaw et al 2015 and further investigation along this line is recommended for the thur catchment as mentioned in section 4 3 2 over short time intervals r values were occasionally negative this might be as a result of a time lag in the r and q q dis values or due to the inherrent errors in the input components refer to section 4 4 in other studies where the sum of the aet corr and q q dis values were greater than corresponding p values a common approach has been to adjust one of the components to ensure water balance closure for example reitz et al 2017 estimated gridded annual recharge quickflow and et for the contiguous u s but in 15 of all map pixels the sum of et and quickflow were higher than precipitation and adjustments were made to close the water balance the majority of these adjustments are made to the et values as et is the most difficult water balance component to accurately quantify bhattarai et al 2016 hulsman et al 2020 reitz et al 2017 zhao and liu 2014 to draw attention to the difficulties of estimating recharge from a relatively simple water budget calculation no attempt was made to close the balance in this study see section 4 2 as such estimated spatiotemporal r values determined in this study serve to gauge the minimum rate at which the groundwater table should be re supplied in the thur catchment on average when considering the total water balance of the thur catchment and assuming negligible change in subsurface storage recharge r accounted for 29 quick flow q q dis for 34 and aet aet corr for 37 of total precipitation groundwater r estimates are in line with modelled values for the region after studies from abbaspour et al 2007 in light of the method uncertainties in estimating quick and baseflow from total discharge value a maximum difference of 22 was observed between the different methods refer to supplementary fig s4 the recharge estimates for the thur catchment may in fact be greater and consequently quick flow smaller however this potential for greater recharge may again be negated in regions where the groundwater table intersects rooting depth a study by von freyberg et al 2015 reported recharge in the mos sub catchment as 71 of precipitation however these recharge estimates were lysimeter based where no or only little surface run occurred due to the lysimeter setup the sum of r and q q dis values comprise 63 of precipitation in the thur catchment increased recharge estimates depending on the baseflow separation method used when comparing water balance components for the different sub catchments of the thur catchment the amount of r was seen to increase only slightly with higher the elevation sub catchments fig 10a and greater changes were observed in the proportion of decreasing evapotranspiration with respect to increasing quickflow fig 10b refer to supplementary fig s7 and table s2 for percentage error compared to total available water in terms of p in the thur catchment although not considered in detail in this study the geological setting and lithological variances along with anthropogenic alterations might also further control the baseflow contribution dal molin et al 2020 weatherl et al 2021 the aforementioned available seepage data from the lysimeter located in the mos sub catchment hirschi et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2012 was compared to the gridded r values determined in this study refer to supplementary fig s8 it was assumed that no overland flow forms on the top of the lysimeter and that all the rainfall infiltrates into the lysimeter storage due to the existence of a 10 cm steel edge surrounding the top of the lysimeter ghasemizade et al 2015 moreover the lysimeter is located in the grassland setting next to the valley bottom thus a substraction of q q was seen to be necessary to make a comparision between gridded r values and lysimeter seepage when the quickflow q q values were subtracted from the lysimeter seepage values lysimeter q q a strong correlation after evans 1996 was found between the lysimeter seepage values and the gridded r values pearson correlation 0 55 more importantly the lysimeter q q values show a stronger 1 1 relation to r values representative of effective recharge in the mos sub catchment supplementary fig s8 refer to table s4 of the supplementary information for an evaluation of goodness of fit measurements of lysimeter values vs gridded r values 5 5 limitations although long term changes in subsurface storage are possible assuming that storage change is small relative to the volumes of p aet corr and q q dis 100 closure constraint was used for time span 20 years of this study no attempt was made in this work to describe interpixel transfer of groundwater flow rather the contributing factor of p entering a pixel cell to become the potential recharge component r as expressed by a conservative q b value at the discharge station was mapped previous studies indicated a groundwater residence time of 20 days or more for groundwater sources located at distances 300 m from the thur river hoehn and scholtis 2011 moreover flowpaths associated to karstic structures cannot be identified with our approach and might bias locally the obtained results however closer of the water balance for each sub catchment indicate that this has likely only a smaller impact although knowledge concerning the lateral connection between pixels could improve the temporal understanding of groundwater recharge in the thur catchment considering the relatively short residence time in the major valley bottoms temporal groundwater travel time knowledge would likely only be applicable over monthly or shorter time periods even though the approach used in this study disregards the lag time from groundwater recharge to discharge in view of the monthly seasonal and annual scales considered in this study recharge values after eq 6 are believed to represent reliable average estimates in line with findings by the likes of abbaspour et al 2007 and von freyberg et al 2015 chemical and isotope data can provide further insight into specific recharge areas surface groundwater interactions and groundwater ages associated with the thur catchment cirpka et al 2007 hoehn and scholtis 2011 moeck 2021 moeck et al 2017 while it is important to monitor the local effects of groundwater abstraction considering the volumes abstracted relative to the error of p in the thur catchment 20 refer to section 3 5 the current groundwater abstraction rates of 0 65 of total input fall well below the estimated input error and were therefore omitted from this study furthermore any groundwater abstracted is utilized locally within the thur catchment predominantly for the production of potable water and in parts for irrigation and industry abstracted water used for irrigation would flow directly back into the aquifer minus the losses incurred via evapotranspiration while the industrial and drinking water portions would flow back to the rivers via the wastewater treatment plants ultimately contributing to the thur catchment s baseflow and quickflow han et al 2017 further discrepancies in the water budget may arise from errors or uncertainties in the calculated components refer to section 3 5 and or inadequate spatial and temporal accounting of these components coxon et al 2015 healy and scanlon 2010 khan et al 2018 sun et al 2018 although the use of satellite image products in conjunction with ground based discharge data provides evidence of closure of the thur catchment s water balance comparing spatial data over time as binary plots although a common practice is reductionist in that a single value e g mean pixel value is meant to represent characteristics of an entire region this is potentially reductionist especially in catchments with variable terrain the propagation of data and method error although not considered in this study leads to further uncertainty however good closure of the water budge refer to fig 10 along with good correlations with modelled findings please refer to the supplementary figs s1 s2 s6 and s8 suggests that in spite of these uncertainties values in this study are representative of the thur catchment s water balance terrain complexity spatial resolution the distribution and number of measuring stations along with time series availability and measurement frequency can affect the quality and representativity of measurements taken coxon et al 2015 schiemann et al 2010 turnipseed and sauer 2010 for example in spite of the meteoswiss product being of a high standard and in spite of having a lower variance than aet corr perturbations of p displayed the greatest component sensitivity fig 9b precipitation p was the only input into the water budget calculation and therefore small variations or uncertainties in p strongly affect the output water balance components including discharge and recharge the uncertainty of aet corr although smaller may also be affected by errors which arise as a result of terrain complexities as outlined above in addition to product specifics such as lack of terrain correction and the use of the pm equation lu et al 2019 zhao and liu 2014 discharge values used in this study represent both high quality as well as high temporal resolution data this is evident in the low variance and small spread of perturbed q q dis values fig 9a and b the conservative approach used in this study to determine q b implies that resulting values from eq 6 represent minimum possible r values in spite of the uncertainty in the values the use of independent data sets remotely sensed and ground based resulted in a good closure of the thur catchment s long term water balance refer to supplementary fig s7 and table s2 overall the results of this study are in line with findings by schädler and weingartner 2002 highlighting the effect of terrain complexity on major contributing components when calculating a water budget uncertainties in the mod16 et product where within range 10 30 of the reported et uncertainties and studies have shown that the pm based mod16 et product is suitable for regions with spatially heterogeneous land cover such as those found in the thur catchment cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 however the pm based method only applies to active vegetation which may result in skewed values in regions where snow cover is present during the winter months mdaghri alaoui and eugster 2001 due to errors relating to leaf and cloud shadowing effects srivastava et al 2017 recommend a regional scale standardization of the mod16 et product which was done by correcting the mod16 et product by a factor of 0 71 additionally the spatiotemporal resolution of the mod16 et product although suitable for characterizing processes in mesoscale catchments such as the entire thur catchment might be too coarse for use in small catchments such as the mos and he sub catchments both of which are smaller than 17 km2 this could further explain the uncertainty in the aet corr values as these were derived from the mod16 et product corrected to the lysimeter data collected in the mos sub catchment lastly it must also be noted that 20 years provide a relatively small window of observation where the thur s long term water balance is concerned 6 conclusion this study demonstrates that the approach of remote sensing products used in conjunction with ground based data to estimate spatiotemporal groundwater recharge has the potential to be useful both for local and regional water availability assessments as well as long term water resource planning the use of remotely sensed data as presented here offers a method of determining a basin s water balance at the mesoscale through the integration and analysis of observed data reconciled within the water budget equation gridded water balance components p aet corr and q q dis were able to adequately capture the spatiotemporal variability of potential groundwater recharge in the thur catchment over a 20 year period the pixel wise linear regression suggests a decline in r from 2000 to 2019 in particular within the lower reaches of the thur catchment however knowledge of spatiotemporal characteristics remains a factor and full comprehension of the intrinsic heterogeneities and complexities of specific basins may never be entirely possible temporal data of the water balance components emphasized the limiting effect of p on r and stressed the importance of hydrological wet years preceding hydrological drought years in terms of long term below average recharge potential in light of this the inclusion of soil moisture data is recommended in future studies to provide additional insight into spatiotemporal groundwater recharger behaviour in the thur catchment or other mesoscale catchments although reductionist a remotely sensed water budget calculation may go some way towards a holistic starting point for monitoring recharge in mesoscale catchments especially in poorly monitored or remote catchments where the lack of ground based observations could be augmented for example although the 500 m x 500 m gridded resolution used in this study was found to be a limiting factor when dealing with the thur s smaller sub catchments freely available mod16 et data was corrected locally using long term ground based lysimeter measurements from a single site within the thur catchment by comparing variance with other modelled water budged terms it was shown that although the mod16 et product tended to overestimate aet the overestimation was consistent and larger uncertainties were associated precipitation values the use of the mod16 et data was shown to be valuable in determining aet for the mesoscale thur catchment and it is believed that it is applicable to regions with relatively little or no ground based aet measurements remaining cognisant of potential over or under estimation for many catchments long term observations are either completely missing or where monitoring networks do exists these are often falling into disrepair due to a lack of finances and or upkeep montanari et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 spatiotemporal groundwater recharge estimates are useful for water resource managers who want to estimate trends in the water balance and track these changes over time remotely sensed data can be a useful asset in the advancement of hydrological understanding even where gauged basins are concerned this provides significant advantages when dealing with poorly gauged basins and establishing long term data records for such basins in terms of their water availability gleason and durand 2020 however even with additional methodological innovation in the field of rs this study underscores the current need for continued and in some places new ground based monitoring of hydrogeological components where mesoscale or smaller catchment sizes are concerned funding the work described in this paper was funded by the swiss national science foundation grant agreement no 200021 169003 credit
