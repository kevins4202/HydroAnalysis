24425,effective planning and management strategies of the manila clam ruditapes philippinarum stock in arcachon bay rely on a co management approach involving scientific advice and the fishing industry in order to strengthen this management process a specific compartmental single species model has been developed to assess different management strategies based upon a size structure of the population and built from the dynamic systems paradigm the modelling involves selected environmental and fishery related parameters for their impact on the population dynamics integration of newly available life traits data regarding the local population and better knowledge of the fishing activity and its control parameters have enabled a revision of the existing version including model parameters and integration of new formulations effect of food availability and total suspended matter on the production of newly settled juveniles natural mortality growth rates and price accounted for the bulk of the undertaken improvements model performance was evaluated by comparing simulation outputs to observed data from stock assessments 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 in addition a sensitivity analysis regarding uncertainty on parameters related to biological and environmental aspects was carried out to provide information about parameters that influence the outputs of the model the most in particular this highlighted that a deeper understanding of the processes related to the reproduction phase and its control parameters on biomass should be pursued the improvements enable the calibration of the model with parameters that are as close as possible to the specificities of the stock considered this adaptation permits use of the model to test various management strategies on the stock evolution and also to evaluate potential effects of environmental or market fluctuations it encompasses ecological and socio economic valuations of the measures of impact as long as those objectives are shared by the different entities involved at the regional scale communication and management decisions should be facilitated keywords system dynamic model co management population dynamic arcachon bay ruditapes philippinarum 1 introduction management of coastal zones is considered globally as an important issue pastres et al 2001 because it implies multiple conflicting goals involving socio economic and ecological considerations freire et al 2002 this is particularly true for areas providing bivalve resources because they frequently enable the development of flourishing activities either for fishing or farming canu and solidoro 2018 coelho et al 2021 vincenzi et al 2006 design and implementation of adaptive management system policies are vital to conciliate socio economic activities and long term sustainability of the natural environment de leo and levin 1997 especially considering resources where population dynamics are particularly sensitive to environmental variations for this purpose models constitute useful tools for guiding management of coastal waters mongruel et al 2011 including the monitoring of exploited species that generate significant income for the fishing industries in coastal zones to reinforce the management of exploited species several models have been designed these include demographic models and increasingly combined ecophysiological and economic ones bertolini et al 2021 canu et al 2011 ferreira et al 2009 grant et al 2007 solidoro et al 2003 troost et al 2010 the first model developed for manila clams by bald et al 2009 was a compartmental single species model driven by fixed parameters which were based upon the size structure of the population and several dynamics of the species this modelling approach belongs to the simulation modelling category which was built from the dynamic systems paradigm developed in the 1950s by forrester 1973 what is more the interactions among variables and the evolution over time of the level variables density and abundance expressed in numbers or mass are mathematically represented by differential equations the model being integrated continuously in time six weaknesses about this model were pointed out by bald et al 2009 since more ecological data on the manila clam are now available and on going studies in the arcachon bay are completed a revision of the first version of the model parameters can be undertaken this new information enabled an improvement of four identified weaknesses effect of food availability growth rates indirect natural predation and effect of diseases the one remaining concern is larval transport and settlement with spatial considerations in addition more realistic harvesting activities and economic considerations were integrated and the lack of consideration of socio economic drivers highlighted during working groups involving scientists and fishermen has also been taken into account in this context the present paper 1 discusses the developments implemented since the first version of the model 2 integrates a validation and a sensitivity analysis regarding uncertainty on a selection of parameters and 3 describes the evolution of the modeled biomass under various management environmental and economic scenarios in order to provide decision making guidance 2 study area and manila clam population 2 1 study area arcachon bay is a 156 km² semi sheltered lagoon in the southwest coast of france fig 1 mostly composed of intertidal flats 110 km² within the inner lagoon which are colonized by vast zoltera noltii seagrass meadows the composition of this mesotidal system ranges from mud to muddy sands the tide is semi diurnal and the bay is both influenced by oceanic external neritic waters and continental principally from the eyre river inputs dang 2009 the characteristics of these water masses as well as the slow renewal of water by tides plus et al 2009 both influence salinity and temperature within the bay variations of these two parameters are important seawater temperature ranges from 1 8 to 27 4 c mean value 15 4 c and salinity ranges from 15 4 to 35 4 mean value 30 2 caill milly 2012 according to the same database chlorophyll a concentration varies from 0 4 to 30 8 µgl 1 mean value 2 6 µgl 1 2 2 species description and stock evolution manila clam venerupis philippinarum is an infaunal species inhabiting various substrates such as sandy sandy muddy and muddy bottoms as a suspension feeding bivalve its dietary regime is dominated by phytoplankton kanaya et al 2005 kasai et al 2004 spillman et al 2008 yokoyama et al 2005 length class differentiation within the population is determined by valve length which is defined as the longest distance from front edge to back edge mm for bivalves fecundity is age related gosling 2003 and the manila clam sexual maturity is considered effective from the second year corresponding to clams above 20 mm in length holland and chew 1974 two annual spawning periods can be observed in arcachon bay between late spring and fall which are driven by increasing seawater temperatures between 15 c and 22 c dang et al 2010 metamorphosis and settlement occur generally after a two to three week period of pelagic larval stage then the spatial distribution is of an aggregative type and the limited lateral displacements of individuals are reported to reach six meters per month tamura 1970 in le treut 1986 manila clam maximum lifespan is unknown dee boersma et al 2006 gillespie et al 1999 indicated that it rarely exceeds 10 years of age in fished populations factors influencing natural mortality include natural predation carcinus maenas ocenebra erinacea birds diseases among others brown muscle disease one of the most important and aging pollution may also have an unfavorable role in the evolution of mortality paul pont 2010 the manila clam resource in arcachon bay has been monitored through stock assessment campaigns surveys considering the total distribution area of manila clam 47 km2 began in 2003 and have been carried out as much as possible every other year since 2006 during late spring the 2016 survey could not take place for financial reasons seven years of monitoring data 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 are currently available these surveys provide a dataset of indicators such as abundance indices length frequency histograms total abundance and biomass fraction of juveniles individuals measuring less than 17 mm spawners individuals measuring more than 25 mm and exploitable stock individuals measuring more than 35 mm as well as their abundance and maps of clam densities sanchez et al 2018 caill milly et al 2021 the stock assessments of these campaigns show a decrease of the population biomass until 2008 and then a recovery to a high level toward the end of the series fig 2 3 fishing activity and management fishermen access fishing areas by boat and exploitation occurs at low tide clams are extracted by hand the sediment is scraped using a small tool catch fishing data from national and regional databases are utilized to account for the exploitation sources crts la rochelle sih ifremer crpmem nouvelle aquitaine the first catch declarations were recorded in 1992 with 1 ton production then grew quickly from 2001 after a peak in 2007 with 1000 tons landed the production decreased to reach values comprised between 300 and 400 tons annually in recent years caill milly et al 2021 whereas the minimum legal harvest size 40 mm prior to 2008 35 mm since then is set by european legislation ec regulation ce n 40 2008 in addition specific local legislation may be applied such as protected areas limited fishing periods and a fixed number of licenses they vary over time in terms of location duration number allocation rules and are considered in the next sections of this paper the local regulations are under the responsibility of industry organisations like comité régional des pêches maritimes et des élevages marins de nouvelle aquitaine and involve regional administration frangoudes et al 2020 4 existing model structure and components the existing model applied to manila clam in arcachon bay was developed at the end of the 2000s the model and all the simulations are performed using the object oriented modelling framework vensim dss this software is widely used to construct simulation models of business scientific environmental and social systems specific dynamic models regarding exploited marine resources by fishing and aquaculture have been developed under various softwares such as vensim extendsim stella simile etc canu et al 2011 hawkins et al 2002 grant et al 2007 for arcachon bay the processes are modelled at the bay scale not spatialized at a finer scale and the time frame is monthly with the exception of temperature daily the model is structured into basic component parts corresponding to four interrelated so called blocks production stock maturation mortality environmental parameters and fishery see fig 3 and bald et al 2009 for details including structuration and equations of the first version the production of juveniles production block is controlled by the quantity of spat arriving in the system after the spawning period the larval development and the settlement after a pelagic phase of three weeks le treut 1986 because those phases of the life cycle are well known to be highly influenced by the environment holland and chew 1974 mann 1979 ohba 1959 park and choi 2004 robinson and breese 1984 and emmett et al 1991 a control block integrating environment drivers environment parameters block acts on the production block in the environment parameters block seawater temperature was simulated using the sinusoidal function proposed by melià et al 2004 and adjusted to arcachon bay conditions by bald et al 2009 in the stock maturation mortality block the manila clam population in arcachon bay is divided into four sub populations according to their length for the population dynamics model several authors de leo and gatto 2000 solidoro et al 2003 underlined the importance of length class differentiation to take into account differences in vital rates such as fertility mortality and respiration flye sainte marie et al 2007 therefore they correspond to juvenile size class from 0 to 20 mm adult under the minimum current harvest size class from 21 to 34 mm and two adult size classes above the minimum current harvest size from 35 to 39 mm and upper 40 mm thereby the chosen endpoints of those classes depend on biological and exploitation considerations the rules of evolution over time of the number of clams in each class are controlled by specific growth natural and fishing mortality parameters and are described in detail in bald et al 2009 in addition the initial condition is controlled by the production of juveniles in the first class this compartment gives at the end the main result which is the total biomass the fishery block includes the parameters that control the fishing mortality required for the stock maturation mortality block e g fishing effort per clam length class capture duration season number of delivered fishing licenses catches volume per license protected area surface to convert the volume of catches per length class to effective per length class a length weight relationship for the manila clam population was established using the 2003 survey campaign see appendix 1 all the formulations of this existing model are detailed in bald et al 2009 starting from this existing version both the integration of newly and specific available life traits data and the adjustment of the fishing activity and its control parameters allow for a revision of the model which includes model parameters and the integration of new formulations 5 model revision 5 1 integration of real data to simulate seawater temperature in the first version of the model seawater temperature t environment parameters block was simulated using the sinusoidal function bald et al 2009 in order to be closer to the real variations of temperature inside the bay this equation was replaced by real weekly temperature data coming from the archyd network 2 2 the hydrological network of observation and monitoring dedicated to arcachon bay https sextant ifremer fr record dde63586 6a51 4e9b 8630 b7648cda86a0 regarding the manila clam distribution two stations comprian and les jacquets see fig 1 for location were selected to calculate mean temperature treal per month from 2003 to 2019 for subsequent years the attributed value per month m is equal to the average mean over three years for a given month tam with the addition of a parameter temperature variation δt to have the possibility to test the hypothesis of an increase or decrease of the monthly temperature t m t r e a l m f r o m 2003 t o 2019 t a m m δ t f r o m 2020 t o 2029 due to this modification the time frame for the seawater parameter changed from daily to monthly using real data is considered preferable notably to work on hindcasts 5 2 integration of specific available life traits data 5 2 1 recruitment production and environmental parameters blocks in the first version of the model an iterative modeling was used to fix the recruitment level and the period of arrival of juveniles in the stock maturation mortality block was controlled by the seawater temperature conditions environment parameters block bald et al 2009 regarding manila clam temperature photoperiod and food availability are the three main factors contributing to the reproduction phase from gametogenesis to spawning delgado and pérez camacho 2007 devauchelle 1990 holland and chew 1974 le pennec and benninger 2000 mann 1979 ohba 1959 soudant et al 2004 toba and miyama 1995 to a lesser extent a possible effect of salinity has also been described by park and choi 2004 and dang et al 2010 for the arcachon bay population and using stock status indicators and environmental parameters caill milly 2012 highlighted both the importance of temperature during the reproduction phase interaction already taken into account in the model and the trophic conditions associated to total suspended matter tsm for young stages high proportions of juveniles were related to high chlorophyll a and low tsm values graphically mean chlorophyll a concentration is the lowest in 2004 and tsm concentration is lowest in 2005 conversely mean chlorophyll a concentration and tsm concentration are highest in 2012 and in 2019 respectively regarding the trends of these two data sets over the 2002 2019 period they seem to display a break in the data series between 2009 and 2010 with significant differences for tsm fig 4 current understanding of the impact of these two conditions on recruitment suggests a positive effect of high chlorophyll a and low tsm as these two factors show a break between 2009 and 2010 the recruitment level proposed by bald et al 2009 jpm was modulated from 2010 using a combination of evolution rates of those two factors acting with opposite effects to do so chlorophyll a and tsm evolution rates were calculated between 2002 2009 and 2010 2019 and combined considering positive effect for chlorophyll a and negative effect for tsm to estimate the δjpm m from 2010 table 1 δjpm m is thus set at 0 between 2003 and 2009 and at 25 from 2010 as a result from 2003 to 2009 jpm is 3 3 ind m ² month 1 and 2 5 ind m ² month 1 from 2010 due to this reformulation the juvenile production per surface unit and per month jp m is j p m j p m m x 1 δ j p m m s p m with jpm the juvenile production per spawning month fixed by bald et al 2009 δjpm combined chlorophyll a and tsm effects on juveniles production and sp spawning occurrence for a given month the model now includes not only the effect of temperature spawning triggering but also of chlorophyll a and tsm on recruitment 5 2 2 growth stock maturation mortality block in the first version of the model the growth rates were calculated following the growth model developed by melià et al 2004 for the sacca di goro lagoon italy bald et al 2009 between 2005 and 2007 dang et al 2010 undertook enclosure field experiments within arcachon bay that allow defining the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf parameters related to the bay these ecological data led to the reassessment of realistic growth rate estimates namely 0 361 0 245 and 0 227 dimensionless for length classes 0 20 21 34 and 35 39 mm respectively for example this means that each month the number of clams entering the 21 34 mm class from the previous class 0 20 mm is obtained by multiplying the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class from the previous month by 0 361 5 2 3 natural mortality stock maturation mortality block in the first version of the model natural mortality was defined by the relationship established by solidoro et al 2000 and solidoro et al 2003 it integrated sea water temperature and was based on studies on northern adriatic lagoons also in this case the enclosure field experiments undertaken by dang et al 2010 were useful to integrate more realistic values related to arcachon to adjust the model they allow to draw a direct assessment of this source of mortality they were established at 6 9 3 9 1 8 and 1 2 respectively for length classes 0 20 21 34 35 39 and 40 mm deduced from dang et al 2010 on the same principle as for growth this means for example that each month the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class that died of natural causes is obtained by multiplying the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class in the previous month by 6 9 a feedback loop was also added from the stock variable in order to model a trophic competition effect on natural mortality the rule applied is if the stock is higher than 20000 t natural mortality is doubled for each size class for equation see fig 5 the updated information regarding growth and natural mortality enables describing the clam effective evolution per month m and per class i 1 to 4 and due to natural processes only as f o r i 1 j p m z 1 m g 1 m i f s 20000 t j p m z 1 m 2 g 1 m

on the model was an opportunity to review some of the fishery related parameters and to take into account other economic factors this information includes annual fishing declarations of manila clam within arcachon bay and was extracted from two complementary databases the national statistic database of the système d informations halieutiques for data between 2003 and 2008 the regional database the base pêche aquitaine crpmem unpublished data for data subsequent to 2009 combined with the annual number of active fishing licenses coded nfl values in table 2 the total annual volumes of catches declared by fishermen allow the calculation of mean catches volume per fishing license each month coded cvl with respect to the fishing mortality per length class and because clams below the legal harvest size are known to be exploited anonymous catch reports and authority controls the fishing effort fe was reallocated on the whole length classes 21 34 mm 35 39 mm and 40 mm length classes which were estimated at 40 50 and 10 respectively this took into account higher fishing pressure on clams below the minimum legal size which is more realistic in regard to the impact of the protected areas on catches the bald et al 2009 model considered the percentage of exploitable stock and the percentage of reserve area to parametrize this variable dang 2009 in the last version of the model a reformulation was undertaken the exploitable stock was considered using the fishing effort applied to each class above the minimum legal size and the total applicable protected area s surface expressed in m² according to local legislation became a control variable in addition a price effect was included as a control parameter of the fishing activity this aims to fill a gap in the model regarding socio economic drivers which was picked up on by stakeholders following interviews with professionals the applied rules follow a linear response of catches to any price increase from a reference price pref fixed at 3 5 euros per kilogram considered by fishermen as a mean selling price for manila clam from arcachon bay in other words if the difference between the effective price pr and the reference price pref is one euro the catches increase by 10 if the difference is two euros the catches increase by 20 and so on all this updated information mentioned above led to the reformulation of the temporal fishing catches evolution per month m and per class i 1 to 4 denoted fm m x capti m which was expressed in effective per surface unit each month ind m 2 month 1 according to the following equations f m m 1 i f o f m m o f m c d s 0 e l s e with fm fishing month ofm open fishing month month number cds capture duration season in month c a p t i m n f l m c v l m 10 6 f e

effective price each month kg 1 pref reference price fixed at 3 5 euros per kg 1 the first fraction of the last equation reported the catch as a function of the number of licenses the catch per license and the mortality of the class considered in arcachon bay the second fraction accounts for the fishing reserve effect when the selling price was greater than 3 5 kg 1 the third fraction reflected a price effect with a linear response equation formulations for each process including those not modified from the bald et al 2009 version and their parametrization are presented in detail in fig 5 and table 2 fig 5 distinguishes the known parameters or fixed by the user from those estimated by equations within the model table 2 provides details regarding the latest parametrization the output variable is the total biomass s since it constitutes the current indicator shared between scientists and managers to discuss the responses of the system to different scenarios 6 validation and sensitivity analysis 6 1 goodness of fit of the model the first available dataset on size distribution of the population within the bay caill milly et al 2003 determines the initial time of the model and is available for july 2003 starting from this date the model was calibrated with the aforementioned recent population ecological and fishery data this historical reconstitution ended in december 2019 it traced the stock evolution before testing new management strategies model validation was performed on this hindcast using the subsequent stock assessments 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 those observed data learning samples were compared to the predicted data given by the model the model efficiency which is the calibration step was evaluated by the percentage of deviation between observed and predicted data sets the criterion of a maximum deviation percentage set to 10 was retained according to previous works bald et al 2006 2009 the model output for the july 2003 to december 2019 period is illustrated in fig 6 and presents a first period characterized by a global decrease of the total biomass up to 4 83 tons mid 2008 and a second period displaying a recovery of the stock with a maximum at 9188 tons early 2018 at the end of the period the total biomass is around 8000 tons for this historical reconstitution the model outputs fits quite well with the real data since the percentage of deviation in absolute terms between observed and predicted data were respectively 4 in 2003 10 in 2006 11 in 2008 3 in 2010 6 in 2012 1 in 2014 and 3 in 2018 fig 6 average of the absolute values of this percentage equal to 5 3 those values meet the criterion of a maximum deviation percentage set at 10 except for 2008 with 11 6 2 model sensitivity 6 2 1 retained methodology parameters of system dynamics models are subject to uncertainty which propagates throughout the model and lead to variability of its outputs in this context sensitivity analysis can provide an answer to various issues such as improvement of the model formulation including simplification by eliminating non essential components model robustness assessment identification of the parameters that have the greatest influence of chosen target variables etc banos gonzalez et al 2018 norton 2015 pianosi and wagener 2018 in this paper the effect of variations in assumed information on the model output is considered it enables identification of the most influential parameters in this context uncertainty of the control parameters used in the model were considered they are related to biological and environmental aspects for each parameter an arbitrarily selected range of 25 variation around the default parameter value was applied banos gonzalez et al 2018 unless available assessment of uncertainty was already available this was the case for natural mortality spawning minimum and maximum temperature mean length weight for natural mortality the standard deviation of calculated values established from dang 2009 was employed as the uncertainty measure 3 3 1 5 and 1 1 for the 0 20 mm 20 35 mm and 35 40 mm length classes respectively in the case of spawning minimum and maximum temperature few works established a threshold delgado and pérez camacho 2007 holland and chew 1974 mann 1979 ohba 1959 toba and miyama 1995 which challenged us to consider a possible difference of 0 5 c for mean length weight the standard deviation calculated by bald et al 2009 was used as the uncertainty measure 0 67 0 21 0 41 and 1 12 for the 0 20 mm 20 35 mm 35 39 mm and above 40 mm length classes respectively table 3 on a first step each parameter was studied separately to test for the variability of the estimated biomass s using thousand monte carlo simulations univariate sensitivity analysis with a random uniform distribution of probability this approach corresponded to the one factor at a time analysis where the initial values of the parameters were modified in a range that account for ecological reality or in a range of 25 for december 2029 a sensitivity index banos gonzalez et al 2018 was calculated for each parameter s e n s i i s m a x s m i n s v a l p m a x p m i n p v a l 100 where sensii represents the sensitivity index of the biomass in relation to the parameter i smax and smin are the maximum and minimum values respectively of the biomass at time december 2029 sval represents the status quo model value of the biomass at time december 2029 pmax and pmin represent the maximum and minimum values of the ith parameter respectively and pval is the status quo model value of the jth parameter the sensitivity index values are visualized on an ordered bar chart pianosi et al 2016 using this index the parameters can be classified into five categories insensitive si 0 low sensitivity si 10 moderate sensitivity 10 si 50 high sensitivity 50 si 100 and very high sensitivity si 100 in addition confidence bounds of the biomass were plotted for the variation of each parameter in relation to the corresponding relative variation of the input parameter the index and the graphical representation provided information about the parameters which influenced the system the most in a second step the sensitive parameters si 50 were considered together general sensitivity analysis to quantify the effects of their simultaneous variations on the biomass in this case one thousand monte carlo simulations were generated with latin hypercube sampling for this it is common practice to constrain the parameter variations to acceptable ranges in order to have realistic levels banos gonzalez et al 2018 in the absence of additional information the percentages of variation were here identical to those of step one with latin hypercube sampling the full range of each parameter was thus explored using a reasonable number of runs banos gonzalez et al 2018 and provided sufficient information about the distribution in the outcome ford and flynn 2005 it can be efficient in order to reveal non linearities principally if one or two parameters dominate manache and melching 2008 a variation coefficient vc banos gonzalez et al 2018 of the biomass shown by the monte carlo simulations was calculated for december 2029 v c s m a x 95 s m i n 95 s 100 where vc is the relative variation of the biomass s with respect to its mean value using 95 confidence bounds smax95 and smin95 are the maximum and minimum values of the biomass in december 2029 using the 95 confidence bound and s is the mean value of biomass this coefficient was set in one of the three following categories low response vc 50 moderate response 50 vc 100 and high response vc 100 for the two steps monte carlo simulation is appropriate since the model may generate interactions between factors or have non linear outputs as stated by lesnoff et al 2012 the time frame has two parts from july 2003 to december 2019 historical reconstitution from january 2020 to december 2029 projection with historical trends of environmental data and application of the same management measures as for 2019 6 2 2 sensitivity analysis results for the control parameters tested the values of the sensitivity index are comprised between 1 and 399 which means that the model is from low sensitive to high sensitive regarding those parameters the highest indexes are obtained with parameters regarding or influencing young stages of the population spawning maximum temperature recruitment and spawning minimum temperature fig 7 the following are related to mean length weight 21 34 mm mean length weight above 40 mm and to a lesser extent natural mortality above 40 mm the lowest indexes are related to mean length weight for 0 20 mm to natural mortality of 35 40 mm to growth rate 21 34 mm and to natural mortality 21 34 mm ten out of fourteen parameters are associated to the sensitive index the confidence bounds of the biomass according to their respective variation are plotted for each of those parameters appendix 2 those ten parameters were used to run one thousand monte carlo simulations with latin hypercube sampling the variation coefficient is 173 which means that the model displays a high response of the biomass to those parameters 7 application of various scenarios 7 1 simulations of several management strategies since the outcome of the model was to be used as a decision making tool case studies were defined to observe the simulated evolution of the total biomass according to various strategies relying on different types of measures reducing fishing effort technical measures and limitation of catches table 4 forecasts from january 2020 to december 2029 resulting from the introduction of different management options were undertaken the eight scenarios related to management strategies and retained for this paper were the following scenario 1 status quo corresponded to maintenance of the management measures in similar levels than those applied in 2019 cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 2 doubled the protected area surface the other parameters remaining the same as for status quo cvl 0 74 t month 1 license

decrease of the number of fishing licenses cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 40 scenario 5 simulated a decrease of the catches per fishing licenses cvl 0 6 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 6 combined three measures slight decrease of the catches per fishing licenses decrease of the capture duration season and increase of the protected area surface cvl 0 70 t month 1 license 1 cds 11 months pas 7 35 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 7 also combined three measures slight decrease of the catches per fishing licenses decrease of the capture duration season and of the number of fishing licenses cvl 0 70 t month 1 license 1 cds 11 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 40 finally scenario 8 combined two measures decrease of the catches per fishing license and decrease of the capture duration season cvl 0 60 t month 1 license 1 cds 10 3 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 when a parameter was not listed above it means that the applied value was the same as for the last year of the historical reconstitution to undertake comparisons between these management scenarios evolution of the total biomass trend was compared between the chosen scenarios and the continuation of the active management measures in 2019 scenario 1 status quo table 4 the total biomass according to the eight management strategies from january 2020 to december 2029 displayed in any case an improvement in the stock level the results were summarized in the two following categories single measures and multiple measures see table 5 among the single measures the gain between the scenarios 2 to 5 and scenario 1 status quo is comprised between 25 and 46 at the end of 2029 the lowest gain is obtained with technical measures pas the highest gain is obtained with the limitation of catches cvl among the multiple measures the gain between the scenarios 6 to 8 and scenario 1 status quo is comprised between 42 and 84 at the end 2029 the highest gain is obtained with the limitation of catches cvl combined with technical measures cds these results highlighted the relevance of combining selected management measures to improve the stock level 7 2 simulations of environmental and market modifications two other scenarios were defined to consider the potential effects of environmental or market modifications to the stock evolution in addition to status quo management measures for these scenarios the management measures applied were the same as those selected for scenario 1 status quo on which the additional hypotheses were applied from 2020 scenario 9 simulated an increase of the seawater temperature to define this augmentation the last report of the giecc ipcc 2019 was used considering the projected change in sea surface temperature between the recent past 1986 2005 and the near term 2031 2050 under scenario rcp8 5 an increase of 0 04 c per year was tested it was applied to all the months of the same year this value is consistent with regional forecasts given by chust et al 2014 for the bay of biscay for the end of the century this modification was applied between 2020 and 2029 scenario 10 considered the increase of the selling price from 3 5 euros per kg to 4 5 euros per kg as mentioned above this resulted in an increase in catches of 10 regarding scenario 9 slight increase of temperature applied in addition to status quo management measures the total biomass exhibited the same evolution as for the status quo scenario table 5 over the period 2020 2029 the number of months favorable to the realization of spawning was not modified when modelling is continued with the same assumption 0 04 c per year a change is observed in 2037 all other things being equal at the end of 2040 the biomass would be 24 higher than with scenario 1 appendix 3 for scenario 10 the simulated price per kilo increase results in a gradual decrease in the total biomass over the period 2020 2029 table 5 at the end of the period the difference reaches 21 compared to the level obtained for the status quo 8 discussion and conclusion considering the initial assumptions listed in bald et al 2009 major developments and improvements have been undertaken those recent improvements are in bold italics in fig 3 integration of specific available life traits data the parameterization of bald et al s 2009 model relied mainly on different bibliographic sources related to population dynamics of the manila clam beninger and lucas 1984 melià et al 2004 rodríguez moscoso et al 1992 solidoro et al 2000 2003 together with data related to arcachon bay caill milly et al 2003 and g trut unpublished data recent ecological data available at the bay scale led to the revision of the previous model s assumptions first environmental drivers on key processes of the population dynamics have been reinforced thanks to integration of real data or to new formulations this evolution mainly regarded the reproduction phase until now this phase which is one of the key processes of population dynamics flye saint marie 2007 was only controlled by seawater temperature a preliminary modulation relying on food availability expressed by chlorophyll a levels and on total suspended matter concentrations was undertaken measurement of photosynthetic pigment water concentration remains relatively easy to acquire and appears to be the most common indicator used for food availability e g shibata et al 1999 unlike the older stages flye sainte marie et al 2003 we have not identified any work questioning the validity of this descriptor as an adequate substitute for food availability in young manila clams nevertheless it is always interesting to consider other trophic resource proxies when available in the case of arcachon the evolution of the monthly average of phytoplankton abundance also showed a change consistent with the hypothesis adopted for this work phytoplankton and phycotoxin monitoring network rephy ifremer unpublished data in those conditions the retained formulation corresponded to a more realistic hypothesis since those modelled environmental parameters temperature food supply and total suspended matter are well known for influencing the reproductive phase delgado and pérez camacho 2007 devauchelle 1990 holland and chew 1974 le pennec and benninger 2000 mann 1979 ohba 1959 soudant et al 2004 toba and miyama 1995 or described as driving factors for arcachon bay caill milly 2012 however the applied modulation does not take into account the observation of a phenomenal number of juveniles in 2014 sanchez et al 2014 moreover the sensitivity analysis highlighted that the target variable the biomass was very sensitive to the uncertainty of the parameter recruitment such results advocate for deeper analysis of the processes related to the younger stages including data collection efforts as recommended by sterman 2000 this encourages the implementation of a monitoring of the number of clam larvae just as it is already practiced for the intra basin oysters but for the moment not carried out on manila clam for lack of means in the meanwhile as long as such an episode remains exceptional and the current conditions on chlorophyll a and tsm do not exhibit major changes the applied rules should be maintained a second important process for population dynamics i e growth could also have been determined by this integration of specific environmental drivers the reason is that numerous authors agree with the main role played by the temperature on venerupis species beiras et al 1994 fan et al 2007 laing et al 1987 toba 1987 in nakamura et al 2002 but also food supply maître allain 1982 yamamoto et al 1956 and even duration of immersion goulletquer et al 1987 nevertheless two reasons led to the application of minor changes in the formulation of the growth process first the highlighted interrelations between the studied stock status and temperature did not consider growth but mainly the reproductive phase caill milly et al 2012 secondly the possible effects involved directly and indirectly via the link between temperature and trophic resources were highly complex and the current constitution of the model did not allow their consideration numerous references have already addressed the problem of model complexity costanza and sklar 1985 håkanson 1999 jørgensen 1988 since the right balance must be struck between simplicity and complexity on one hand a simplistic model may not account for important ecological processes and may reduce descriptive and realistic model properties cetin 2007 on the other hand a highly complex model may reduce predictive accuracy be difficult to run and produce a high number of errors håkanson 1999 tsang 1991 high dependence on assumptions parameter values and environmental forcing functions was also mentioned by murray and parslow 1999 it was assumed that ecological processes involved in the growth phase were insufficiently controlled with respect to growth and natural mortality the previous formulations relied on growth model developed for the sacca di goro lagoon italy bald et al 2009 or on an empirical equation proposed by solidoro et al 2000 2003 for northern adriatic lagoons direct assessments of growth and of this source of mortality were drawn from enclosure field experiments undertaken by dang et al 2010 within arcachon bay between december 2005 and november 2007 in addition to being reliable data for the considered stock their variations with age related to mean size were coherent with the models proposed by caddy 1991 and appeldoorn 1988 notably to reproduce mortality at age moreover those values were used to account for the natural predation of manila clams which was considered to be important in arcachon bay robert and deltreil unpublished results they also included the effect of diseases regarding ecological processes not treated until now future improvements could mainly concern the question of linkage between the stock and the recruitment the current biomass surveys led every two years indicated high variability of the recruitment levels at the bay scale sanchez et al 2018 that was in accordance with the work undertaken by tezuka et al 2012 nevertheless they did not allow the validation of any intraspecific stock recruitment relationship for the investigated population to identify this relationship for coastal species freire and garcía allut 2000 reported the importance of scale considerations or the occurrence of low stock levels to be detected moreover processes involved are complicated because a stronger effect of interspecific stock recruitment relationship can also occur as demonstrated for donax hanleyanus by defeo 1998 in the absence of evidence recruitment fluctuations in response to environmental parameters were deemed much stronger than those linked to density dependent mechanisms intra and interspecific if this hypothesis were to be revised the model structure would allow for example in considering fertility rates according to size classes since reproductive effort and fecundity are age related gosling 2003 for the lagoon of venice solidoro et al 2003 considered that each parental class minimum length required 18 mm enabled the successful implantation of one hundred juveniles for arcachon bay a first approach could be undertaken by using the age related gonadal production established by urrutia et al 1999 for venerupis decussatus adjustment of the realized fishing activity and its control parameters reformulations of the monthly catches volume per fishing license using data from two databases système d informations halieutiques and base pêche aquitaine was integrated and is considered as the most reliable parameter for professional fishing activities in addition the fishing effort according to the different length classes was reallocated based on more realistic field information those improvements permitted a reformulation of the temporal fishing catches evolution expressed in effective per surface unit for each length class units ind m 2 month 1 the fishery block was also amended by a first option to simulate a price effect on the fishing strategies socio economic objectives are generally poorly defined so a price effect has been recently integrated into the model to enrich it and to take into account human behavior such relationships could be more precisely established as well as the relationship between biomass availability effort and profitability of the fishery for instance it would be interesting to introduce modification of cvl level in response to strong decrease of total biomass as well a reflection on the desired breakdown of the licenses between full time and part time activities could be set in addition the current fishing activity modelled within the model remained the commercial one manila clams are also caught by recreational fishermen but their impact is considered negligible in comparison to commercial fishing fmpaa unpublished results under those conditions it did not seem useful to include this factor in the modeled parameters performance of the model sensitivity and used framework the adequacy of the model with regards to reality was considered by using the acceptable limit of deviation percentage between observed and predicted data sets bald et al 2006 2009 the obtained average of the absolute values of the deviation percentage considering years 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 is equal to 5 3 this level reflects a slightly better performance than that described by bald et al 2009 and over a larger number of years in the future it would be worth considering the model performance with new indices of performance such as those implemented by anastácio et al 2009 for scrobicularia plana the implementation of the loague and green s modeling efficiency ef would also provide an overall indication of the goodness of fit mayer and butler 1993 ef is a dimensionless statistic based on the coefficient of determination and directly compares predictions with real world observations this paper proposed a first sensibility analysis of biological and environmental control parameters the temperature conditions related to spawning periods and recruitment appear to give the highest sensitivity for determining the total biomass this highlights the importance of selecting the right parameters that control the number of recruits on the modelled dynamics a first modulation according to chlorophyll a and tsm concentrations was undertaken for this work it is clearly an area for future work to improve the model the sensitivity analysis was mainly local and to a lesser extent global it remains an elementary sensitivity analysis realized with the available module in vensim faivre et al 2013 another avenue for improvement in this work would be to fully implement the method proposed by pianosi et al 2016 by implementing the packages for gsua 3 3 https www safetoolbox info info and documentation another possible avenue would be to extend the sensitivity analysis to resource exploitation parameters the improvement of the model was conducted step by step and the formulations both reinforced environmental and socio economic considerations within the model cumulative effects of those drivers could therefore be considered scenarios 9 to 10 although limitations on the modeling of biological processes were identified by the sensitivity analysis bearing these limitations in mind we are convinced that this model remains reliable to investigate different management strategies under current environmental conditions but is not well suited to consider strong environmental shifts such as those considered in the worst climate change case scenarios for the accompaniment of a co management approach for this local exploited stock from the start the model specifically intended to strengthen the management of the stock by enabling a robust and well informed decision making process based on science this tool was used for the first time in 2008 2009 the simulations were presented and discussed in the framework of working groups associating scientists fishermen and administration representatives caill milly et al 2021 when the results of the last stock assessment campaign will be presented to professionals the model can again be used to support management decision making the different management scenarios tested with this last version of the model should help in this context in the coming months the results argue for the choice of a management strategy involving several management measures as opposed to one strong measure modification such combinations are part of the arsenal of measures that are implemented on manila clam resource in other european coastal systems coelho et al 2021 different combinations are possible and additional ones may stem from discussion the acceptability dimension will have to be considered in this context most of the existing management models dealing with clams necessitate the assessment of a large number of parameters cossarini et al 2009 pastres et al 2001 solidoro et al 2000 conversely our present model necessitates fewer parameters and relies on a system dynamic approach implemented to understand and conceptualize the complex system regarding both the surrounding environment and human activity costanza and ruth 1998 similar approaches based on models were conducted inter alia on the gooseneck barnacle bald et al 2006 and the peruvian scallop ortiz et al 2002 in our situation its implementation complemented the existing collaborations between scientists and fishermen who have both conducted field surveys since 2003 this type of functioning is in line with the directions of oregon s development fisheries program see harte et al 2008 because it aims at incorporating design of science and management plans for small scale fisheries integration of different kinds of operational management measures and institutional structures for governance was highlighted by defeo 2011 as a key issue in successful management of sandy beach fisheries this approach is considered by the coastal galician fisheries freire and garcía allut 2000 freire et al 2002 and has been applied in southeast asia coastal fisheries since the 1960s pomeroy 1995 management of numerous other local french resources such as bivalves manila clam scallop mussel crustaceans spiny lobster or algae mainly in brittany and in normandy picault et al 2014 d hardivillé and bouché 2018 ices 2018 rely on close collaborations between scientists and commercial industries however none of them has used such a dynamic model before in our case this approach has proven its effectiveness in selecting management measures for the sustainability of the neonatural resource however the environment and design of the software should be enhanced in order to be used more systematically indeed it is very difficult to change tack midway through a period and currently lacks an interface which can also easily be used by managers caill milly et al 2021 moreover the license restricts the use of the software in an easily accessible web type form elsawah et al 2017 recent publications garcia 2021a 2021b should make it possible to solve some of the aforementioned points in the near future such developments are in accordance with the four main uses of a model as reported by del granado 2007 increasing the human understanding of the considered system communicating visually making predictions and supporting decision making this last use was also described by other authors felleman 1999 hannon and ruth 1994 shenk and franklin 2001 opening science to society becomes a significant subject at a national level since a dedicated charter was revised and signed at the end of 2020 by eight french institutes public establishments for research

24425,effective planning and management strategies of the manila clam ruditapes philippinarum stock in arcachon bay rely on a co management approach involving scientific advice and the fishing industry in order to strengthen this management process a specific compartmental single species model has been developed to assess different management strategies based upon a size structure of the population and built from the dynamic systems paradigm the modelling involves selected environmental and fishery related parameters for their impact on the population dynamics integration of newly available life traits data regarding the local population and better knowledge of the fishing activity and its control parameters have enabled a revision of the existing version including model parameters and integration of new formulations effect of food availability and total suspended matter on the production of newly settled juveniles natural mortality growth rates and price accounted for the bulk of the undertaken improvements model performance was evaluated by comparing simulation outputs to observed data from stock assessments 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 in addition a sensitivity analysis regarding uncertainty on parameters related to biological and environmental aspects was carried out to provide information about parameters that influence the outputs of the model the most in particular this highlighted that a deeper understanding of the processes related to the reproduction phase and its control parameters on biomass should be pursued the improvements enable the calibration of the model with parameters that are as close as possible to the specificities of the stock considered this adaptation permits use of the model to test various management strategies on the stock evolution and also to evaluate potential effects of environmental or market fluctuations it encompasses ecological and socio economic valuations of the measures of impact as long as those objectives are shared by the different entities involved at the regional scale communication and management decisions should be facilitated keywords system dynamic model co management population dynamic arcachon bay ruditapes philippinarum 1 introduction management of coastal zones is considered globally as an important issue pastres et al 2001 because it implies multiple conflicting goals involving socio economic and ecological considerations freire et al 2002 this is particularly true for areas providing bivalve resources because they frequently enable the development of flourishing activities either for fishing or farming canu and solidoro 2018 coelho et al 2021 vincenzi et al 2006 design and implementation of adaptive management system policies are vital to conciliate socio economic activities and long term sustainability of the natural environment de leo and levin 1997 especially considering resources where population dynamics are particularly sensitive to environmental variations for this purpose models constitute useful tools for guiding management of coastal waters mongruel et al 2011 including the monitoring of exploited species that generate significant income for the fishing industries in coastal zones to reinforce the management of exploited species several models have been designed these include demographic models and increasingly combined ecophysiological and economic ones bertolini et al 2021 canu et al 2011 ferreira et al 2009 grant et al 2007 solidoro et al 2003 troost et al 2010 the first model developed for manila clams by bald et al 2009 was a compartmental single species model driven by fixed parameters which were based upon the size structure of the population and several dynamics of the species this modelling approach belongs to the simulation modelling category which was built from the dynamic systems paradigm developed in the 1950s by forrester 1973 what is more the interactions among variables and the evolution over time of the level variables density and abundance expressed in numbers or mass are mathematically represented by differential equations the model being integrated continuously in time six weaknesses about this model were pointed out by bald et al 2009 since more ecological data on the manila clam are now available and on going studies in the arcachon bay are completed a revision of the first version of the model parameters can be undertaken this new information enabled an improvement of four identified weaknesses effect of food availability growth rates indirect natural predation and effect of diseases the one remaining concern is larval transport and settlement with spatial considerations in addition more realistic harvesting activities and economic considerations were integrated and the lack of consideration of socio economic drivers highlighted during working groups involving scientists and fishermen has also been taken into account in this context the present paper 1 discusses the developments implemented since the first version of the model 2 integrates a validation and a sensitivity analysis regarding uncertainty on a selection of parameters and 3 describes the evolution of the modeled biomass under various management environmental and economic scenarios in order to provide decision making guidance 2 study area and manila clam population 2 1 study area arcachon bay is a 156 km² semi sheltered lagoon in the southwest coast of france fig 1 mostly composed of intertidal flats 110 km² within the inner lagoon which are colonized by vast zoltera noltii seagrass meadows the composition of this mesotidal system ranges from mud to muddy sands the tide is semi diurnal and the bay is both influenced by oceanic external neritic waters and continental principally from the eyre river inputs dang 2009 the characteristics of these water masses as well as the slow renewal of water by tides plus et al 2009 both influence salinity and temperature within the bay variations of these two parameters are important seawater temperature ranges from 1 8 to 27 4 c mean value 15 4 c and salinity ranges from 15 4 to 35 4 mean value 30 2 caill milly 2012 according to the same database chlorophyll a concentration varies from 0 4 to 30 8 µgl 1 mean value 2 6 µgl 1 2 2 species description and stock evolution manila clam venerupis philippinarum is an infaunal species inhabiting various substrates such as sandy sandy muddy and muddy bottoms as a suspension feeding bivalve its dietary regime is dominated by phytoplankton kanaya et al 2005 kasai et al 2004 spillman et al 2008 yokoyama et al 2005 length class differentiation within the population is determined by valve length which is defined as the longest distance from front edge to back edge mm for bivalves fecundity is age related gosling 2003 and the manila clam sexual maturity is considered effective from the second year corresponding to clams above 20 mm in length holland and chew 1974 two annual spawning periods can be observed in arcachon bay between late spring and fall which are driven by increasing seawater temperatures between 15 c and 22 c dang et al 2010 metamorphosis and settlement occur generally after a two to three week period of pelagic larval stage then the spatial distribution is of an aggregative type and the limited lateral displacements of individuals are reported to reach six meters per month tamura 1970 in le treut 1986 manila clam maximum lifespan is unknown dee boersma et al 2006 gillespie et al 1999 indicated that it rarely exceeds 10 years of age in fished populations factors influencing natural mortality include natural predation carcinus maenas ocenebra erinacea birds diseases among others brown muscle disease one of the most important and aging pollution may also have an unfavorable role in the evolution of mortality paul pont 2010 the manila clam resource in arcachon bay has been monitored through stock assessment campaigns surveys considering the total distribution area of manila clam 47 km2 began in 2003 and have been carried out as much as possible every other year since 2006 during late spring the 2016 survey could not take place for financial reasons seven years of monitoring data 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 are currently available these surveys provide a dataset of indicators such as abundance indices length frequency histograms total abundance and biomass fraction of juveniles individuals measuring less than 17 mm spawners individuals measuring more than 25 mm and exploitable stock individuals measuring more than 35 mm as well as their abundance and maps of clam densities sanchez et al 2018 caill milly et al 2021 the stock assessments of these campaigns show a decrease of the population biomass until 2008 and then a recovery to a high level toward the end of the series fig 2 3 fishing activity and management fishermen access fishing areas by boat and exploitation occurs at low tide clams are extracted by hand the sediment is scraped using a small tool catch fishing data from national and regional databases are utilized to account for the exploitation sources crts la rochelle sih ifremer crpmem nouvelle aquitaine the first catch declarations were recorded in 1992 with 1 ton production then grew quickly from 2001 after a peak in 2007 with 1000 tons landed the production decreased to reach values comprised between 300 and 400 tons annually in recent years caill milly et al 2021 whereas the minimum legal harvest size 40 mm prior to 2008 35 mm since then is set by european legislation ec regulation ce n 40 2008 in addition specific local legislation may be applied such as protected areas limited fishing periods and a fixed number of licenses they vary over time in terms of location duration number allocation rules and are considered in the next sections of this paper the local regulations are under the responsibility of industry organisations like comité régional des pêches maritimes et des élevages marins de nouvelle aquitaine and involve regional administration frangoudes et al 2020 4 existing model structure and components the existing model applied to manila clam in arcachon bay was developed at the end of the 2000s the model and all the simulations are performed using the object oriented modelling framework vensim dss this software is widely used to construct simulation models of business scientific environmental and social systems specific dynamic models regarding exploited marine resources by fishing and aquaculture have been developed under various softwares such as vensim extendsim stella simile etc canu et al 2011 hawkins et al 2002 grant et al 2007 for arcachon bay the processes are modelled at the bay scale not spatialized at a finer scale and the time frame is monthly with the exception of temperature daily the model is structured into basic component parts corresponding to four interrelated so called blocks production stock maturation mortality environmental parameters and fishery see fig 3 and bald et al 2009 for details including structuration and equations of the first version the production of juveniles production block is controlled by the quantity of spat arriving in the system after the spawning period the larval development and the settlement after a pelagic phase of three weeks le treut 1986 because those phases of the life cycle are well known to be highly influenced by the environment holland and chew 1974 mann 1979 ohba 1959 park and choi 2004 robinson and breese 1984 and emmett et al 1991 a control block integrating environment drivers environment parameters block acts on the production block in the environment parameters block seawater temperature was simulated using the sinusoidal function proposed by melià et al 2004 and adjusted to arcachon bay conditions by bald et al 2009 in the stock maturation mortality block the manila clam population in arcachon bay is divided into four sub populations according to their length for the population dynamics model several authors de leo and gatto 2000 solidoro et al 2003 underlined the importance of length class differentiation to take into account differences in vital rates such as fertility mortality and respiration flye sainte marie et al 2007 therefore they correspond to juvenile size class from 0 to 20 mm adult under the minimum current harvest size class from 21 to 34 mm and two adult size classes above the minimum current harvest size from 35 to 39 mm and upper 40 mm thereby the chosen endpoints of those classes depend on biological and exploitation considerations the rules of evolution over time of the number of clams in each class are controlled by specific growth natural and fishing mortality parameters and are described in detail in bald et al 2009 in addition the initial condition is controlled by the production of juveniles in the first class this compartment gives at the end the main result which is the total biomass the fishery block includes the parameters that control the fishing mortality required for the stock maturation mortality block e g fishing effort per clam length class capture duration season number of delivered fishing licenses catches volume per license protected area surface to convert the volume of catches per length class to effective per length class a length weight relationship for the manila clam population was established using the 2003 survey campaign see appendix 1 all the formulations of this existing model are detailed in bald et al 2009 starting from this existing version both the integration of newly and specific available life traits data and the adjustment of the fishing activity and its control parameters allow for a revision of the model which includes model parameters and the integration of new formulations 5 model revision 5 1 integration of real data to simulate seawater temperature in the first version of the model seawater temperature t environment parameters block was simulated using the sinusoidal function bald et al 2009 in order to be closer to the real variations of temperature inside the bay this equation was replaced by real weekly temperature data coming from the archyd network 2 2 the hydrological network of observation and monitoring dedicated to arcachon bay https sextant ifremer fr record dde63586 6a51 4e9b 8630 b7648cda86a0 regarding the manila clam distribution two stations comprian and les jacquets see fig 1 for location were selected to calculate mean temperature treal per month from 2003 to 2019 for subsequent years the attributed value per month m is equal to the average mean over three years for a given month tam with the addition of a parameter temperature variation

the time frame for the seawater parameter changed from daily to monthly using real data is considered preferable notably to work on hindcasts 5 2 integration of specific available life traits data 5 2 1 recruitment production and environmental parameters blocks in the first version of the model an iterative modeling was used to fix the recruitment level and the period of arrival of juveniles in the stock maturation mortality block was controlled by the seawater temperature conditions environment parameters block bald et al 2009 regarding manila clam temperature photoperiod and food availability are the three main factors contributing to the reproduction phase from gametogenesis to spawning delgado and pérez camacho 2007 devauchelle 1990 holland and chew 1974 le pennec and benninger 2000 mann 1979 ohba 1959 soudant et al 2004 toba and miyama 1995 to a lesser extent a possible effect of salinity has also been described by park and choi 2004 and dang et al 2010 for the arcachon bay population and using stock status indicators and environmental parameters caill milly 2012 highlighted both the importance of temperature during the reproduction phase interaction already taken into account in the model and the trophic conditions associated to total suspended matter tsm for young stages high proportions of juveniles were related to high chlorophyll a and low tsm values graphically mean chlorophyll a concentration is the lowest in 2004 and tsm concentration is lowest in 2005 conversely mean chlorophyll a concentration and tsm concentration are highest in 2012 and in 2019 respectively regarding the trends of these two data sets over the 2002 2019 period they seem to display a break in the data series between 2009 and 2010 with significant differences for tsm fig 4 current understanding of the impact of these two conditions on recruitment suggests a positive effect of high chlorophyll a and low tsm as these two factors show a break between 2009 and 2010 the recruitment level proposed by bald et al 2009 jpm was modulated from 2010 using a combination of evolution rates of those two factors acting with opposite effects to do so chlorophyll a and tsm evolution rates were calculated between 2002 2009 and 2010 2019 and combined considering positive effect for chlorophyll a and negative effect for tsm to estimate the δjpm m from 2010 table 1 δjpm m is thus set at 0 between 2003 and 2009 and at 25 from 2010 as a result from 2003 to 2009 jpm is 3 3 ind m ² month 1 and 2 5 ind m ² month 1 from 2010 due to this reformulation the juvenile production per surface unit and per month jp m is j p m j p m m x 1 δ j p m m s p m with jpm the juvenile production per spawning month fixed by bald et al 2009 δjpm combined chlorophyll a and tsm effects on juveniles production and sp spawning occurrence for a given month the model now includes not only the effect of temperature spawning triggering but also of chlorophyll a and tsm on recruitment 5 2 2 growth stock maturation mortality block in the first version of the model the growth rates were calculated following the growth model developed by melià et al 2004 for the sacca di goro lagoon italy bald et al 2009 between 2005 and 2007 dang et al 2010 undertook enclosure field experiments within arcachon bay that allow defining the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf parameters related to the bay these ecological data led to the reassessment of realistic growth rate estimates namely 0 361 0 245 and 0 227 dimensionless for length classes 0 20 21 34 and 35 39 mm respectively for example this means that each month the number of clams entering the 21 34 mm class from the previous class 0 20 mm is obtained by multiplying the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class from the previous month by 0 361 5 2 3 natural mortality stock maturation mortality block in the first version of the model natural mortality was defined by the relationship established by solidoro et al 2000 and solidoro et al 2003 it integrated sea water temperature and was based on studies on northern adriatic lagoons also in this case the enclosure field experiments undertaken by dang et al 2010 were useful to integrate more realistic values related to arcachon to adjust the model they allow to draw a direct assessment of this source of mortality they were established at 6 9 3 9 1 8 and 1 2 respectively for length classes 0 20 21 34 35 39 and 40 mm deduced from dang et al 2010 on the same principle as for growth this means for example that each month the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class that died of natural causes is obtained by multiplying the number of clams in the 0 20 mm class in the previous month by 6 9 a feedback loop was also added from the stock variable in order to model a trophic competition effect on natural mortality the rule applied is if the stock is higher than 20000 t natural mortality is doubled for each size class for equation see fig 5 the updated information regarding growth and natural mortality enables describing the clam effective evolution per month m and per class i 1 to 4 and due to natural processes only as f o r i 1 j p m z 1 m g 1 m i f s 20000 t j p m z 1 m 2 g 1 m

on the model was an opportunity to review some of the fishery related parameters and to take into account other economic factors this information includes annual fishing declarations of manila clam within arcachon bay and was extracted from two complementary databases the national statistic database of the système d informations halieutiques for data between 2003 and 2008 the regional database the base pêche aquitaine crpmem unpublished data for data subsequent to 2009 combined with the annual number of active fishing licenses coded nfl values in table 2 the total annual volumes of catches declared by fishermen allow the calculation of mean catches volume per fishing license each month coded cvl with respect to the fishing mortality per length class and because clams below the legal harvest size are known to be exploited anonymous catch reports and authority controls the fishing effort fe was reallocated on the whole length classes 21 34 mm 35 39 mm and 40 mm length classes which were estimated at 40 50 and 10 respectively this took into account higher fishing pressure on clams below the minimum legal size which is more realistic in regard to the impact of the protected areas on catches the bald et al 2009 model considered the percentage of exploitable stock and the percentage of reserve area to parametrize this variable dang 2009 in the last version of the model a reformulation was undertaken the exploitable stock was considered using the fishing effort applied to each class above the minimum legal size and the total applicable protected area s surface expressed in m² according to local legislation became a control variable in addition a price effect was included as a control parameter of the fishing activity this aims to fill a gap in the model regarding socio economic drivers which was picked up on by stakeholders following interviews with professionals the applied rules follow a linear response of catches to any price increase from a reference price pref fixed at 3 5 euros per kilogram considered by fishermen as a mean selling price for manila clam from arcachon bay in other words if the difference between the effective price pr and the reference price pref is one euro the catches increase by 10 if the difference is two euros the catches increase by 20 and so on all this updated information mentioned above led to the reformulation of the temporal fishing catches evolution per month m and per class i 1 to 4 denoted fm m x capti m which was expressed in effective per surface unit each month ind m 2 month 1 according to the following equations f m m 1 i f o f m m o f m c d s 0 e l s e with fm fishing month ofm open fishing month month number cds capture duration season in month c a p t i m n f l m c v l m 10 6 f e

effective price each month kg 1 pref reference price fixed at 3 5 euros per kg 1 the first fraction of the last equation reported the catch as a function of the number of licenses the catch per

reflected a price effect with a linear response equation formulations for each process including those not modified from the bald et al 2009 version and their parametrization are presented in detail in fig 5 and table 2 fig 5 distinguishes the known parameters or fixed by the user from those estimated by equations within the model table 2 provides details regarding the latest parametrization the output variable is the total biomass s since it constitutes the current indicator shared between scientists and managers to discuss the responses of the system to different scenarios 6 validation and sensitivity analysis 6 1 goodness of fit of the model the first available dataset on size distribution of the population within the bay caill milly et al 2003 determines the initial time of the model and is available for july 2003 starting from this date the model was calibrated with the aforementioned recent population ecological and fishery data this historical reconstitution ended in december 2019 it traced the stock evolution before testing new management strategies model validation was performed on this hindcast using the subsequent stock assessments 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 those observed data learning samples were compared to the predicted data given by the model the model efficiency which is the calibration step was evaluated by the percentage of deviation between observed and predicted data sets the criterion of a maximum deviation percentage set to 10 was retained according to previous works bald et al 2006 2009 the model output for the july 2003 to december 2019 period is illustrated in fig 6 and presents a first period characterized by a global decrease of the total biomass up to 4 83 tons mid 2008 and a second period displaying a recovery of the stock with a maximum at 9188 tons early 2018 at the end of the period the total biomass is around 8000 tons for this historical reconstitution the model outputs fits quite well with the real data since the percentage of deviation in absolute terms between observed and predicted data were respectively 4 in 2003 10 in 2006 11 in 2008 3 in 2010 6 in 2012 1 in 2014 and 3 in 2018 fig 6 average of the absolute values of this percentage equal to 5 3 those values meet the criterion of a maximum deviation percentage set at 10 except for 2008 with 11 6 2 model sensitivity 6 2 1 retained methodology parameters of system dynamics models are subject to uncertainty which propagates throughout the model and lead to variability of its outputs in this context sensitivity analysis can provide an answer to various issues such as improvement of the model formulation including simplification by eliminating non essential components model robustness assessment identification of the parameters that have the greatest influence of chosen target variables etc banos gonzalez et al 2018 norton 2015 pianosi and wagener 2018 in this paper the effect of variations in assumed information on the model output is considered it enables identification of the most influential parameters in this context uncertainty of the control parameters used in the model were considered they are related to biological and environmental aspects for each parameter an arbitrarily selected range of 25 variation around the default parameter value was applied banos gonzalez et al 2018 unless available assessment of uncertainty was already available this was the case for natural mortality spawning minimum and maximum temperature mean length weight for natural mortality the standard deviation of calculated values established from dang 2009 was employed as the uncertainty measure 3 3 1 5 and 1 1 for the 0 20 mm 20 35 mm and 35 40 mm length classes respectively in the case of spawning minimum and maximum temperature few works established a threshold delgado and pérez camacho 2007 holland and chew 1974 mann 1979 ohba 1959 toba and miyama 1995 which challenged us to consider a possible difference of 0 5 c for mean length weight the standard deviation calculated by bald et al 2009 was used as the uncertainty measure 0 67 0 21 0 41 and 1 12 for the 0 20 mm 20 35 mm 35 39 mm and above 40 mm length classes respectively table 3 on a first step each parameter was studied separately to test for the variability of the estimated biomass s using thousand monte carlo simulations univariate sensitivity analysis with a random uniform distribution of probability this approach corresponded to the one factor at a time analysis where the initial values of the parameters were modified in a range that account for ecological reality or in a range of 25 for december 2029 a sensitivity index banos gonzalez et al 2018 was calculated for each parameter s e n s i i s m a x s m i n s v a l p m a x p m i n p v a l 100 where sensii represents the sensitivity index of the biomass in relation to the parameter i smax and smin are the maximum and minimum values respectively of the biomass at time december 2029 sval represents the status quo model value of the biomass at time december 2029 pmax and pmin represent the maximum and minimum values of the ith parameter respectively and pval is the status quo model value of the jth parameter the sensitivity index values are visualized on an ordered bar chart pianosi et al 2016 using this index the parameters can be classified into five categories insensitive si 0 low sensitivity si 10 moderate sensitivity 10 si 50 high sensitivity 50 si 100 and very high sensitivity si 100 in addition confidence bounds of the biomass were plotted for the variation of each parameter in relation to the corresponding relative variation of the input parameter the index and the graphical representation provided information about the parameters which influenced the system the most in a second step the sensitive parameters si 50 were considered together general sensitivity analysis to quantify the effects of their simultaneous variations on the biomass in this case one thousand monte carlo simulations were generated with latin hypercube sampling for this it is common practice to constrain the parameter variations to acceptable ranges in order to have realistic levels banos gonzalez et al 2018 in the absence of additional information the percentages of variation were here identical to those of step one with latin hypercube sampling the full range of each parameter was thus explored using a reasonable number of runs banos gonzalez et al 2018 and provided sufficient information about the distribution in the outcome ford and flynn 2005 it can be efficient in order to reveal non linearities principally if one or two parameters dominate manache and melching 2008 a variation coefficient vc banos gonzalez et al 2018 of the biomass shown by the monte carlo simulations was calculated for december 2029 v c s m a x 95 s m i n 95 s 100 where vc is the relative variation of the biomass s with respect to its mean value using 95 confidence bounds smax95 and smin95 are the maximum and minimum values of the biomass in december 2029 using the 95 confidence bound and s is the mean value of biomass this coefficient was set in one of the three following categories low response vc 50 moderate response 50 vc 100 and high response vc 100 for the two steps monte carlo simulation is appropriate since the model may generate interactions between factors or have non linear outputs as stated by lesnoff et al 2012 the time frame has two parts from july 2003 to december 2019 historical reconstitution from january 2020 to december 2029 projection with historical trends of environmental data and application of the same management measures as for 2019 6 2 2 sensitivity analysis results for the control parameters tested the values of the sensitivity index are comprised between 1 and 399 which means that the model is from low sensitive to high sensitive regarding those parameters the highest indexes are obtained with parameters regarding or influencing young stages of the population spawning maximum temperature recruitment and spawning minimum temperature fig 7 the following are related to mean length weight 21 34 mm mean length weight above 40 mm and to a lesser extent natural mortality above 40 mm the lowest indexes are related to mean length weight for 0 20 mm to natural mortality of 35 40 mm to growth rate 21 34 mm and to natural mortality 21 34 mm ten out of fourteen parameters are associated to the sensitive index the confidence bounds of the biomass according to their respective variation are plotted for each of those parameters appendix 2 those ten parameters were used to run one thousand monte carlo simulations with latin hypercube sampling the variation coefficient is 173 which means that the model displays a high response of the biomass to those parameters 7 application of various scenarios 7 1 simulations of several management strategies since the outcome of the model was to be used as a decision making tool case studies were defined to observe the simulated evolution of the total biomass according to various strategies relying on different types of measures reducing fishing effort technical measures and limitation of catches table 4 forecasts from january 2020 to december 2029 resulting from the introduction of different management options were undertaken the eight scenarios related to management strategies and retained for this paper were the following scenario 1 status quo corresponded to maintenance of the management measures in similar levels than those applied in 2019 cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 2 doubled the protected area surface the other parameters remaining the same as for status quo cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 9 8 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 3 reduced the fishing period equivalent to one day per week off cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 10 3 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 4 simulated a decrease of the number of fishing licenses cvl 0 74 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 40 scenario 5 simulated a decrease of the catches per fishing licenses cvl 0 6 t month 1 license 1 cds 12 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 6 combined three measures slight decrease of the catches per fishing licenses decrease of the capture duration season and increase of the protected area surface cvl 0 70 t month 1 license 1 cds 11 months pas 7 35 106 m² nfl 46 scenario 7 also combined three measures slight decrease of the catches per fishing licenses decrease of the capture duration season and of the number of fishing licenses cvl 0 70 t month 1 license 1 cds 11 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 40 finally scenario 8 combined two measures decrease of the catches per fishing license and decrease of the capture duration season cvl 0 60 t month 1 license 1 cds 10 3 months pas 4 9 106 m² nfl 46 when a parameter was not listed above it means that the applied value was the same as for the last year of the historical reconstitution to undertake comparisons between these management scenarios evolution of the total biomass trend was compared between the chosen scenarios and the continuation of the active management measures in 2019 scenario 1 status quo table 4 the total biomass according to the eight management strategies from january 2020 to december 2029 displayed in any case an improvement in the stock level the results were summarized in the two following categories single measures and multiple measures see table 5 among the single measures the gain between the scenarios 2 to 5 and scenario 1 status quo is comprised between 25 and 46 at the end of 2029 the lowest gain is obtained with technical measures pas the highest gain is obtained with the limitation of catches cvl among the multiple measures the gain between the scenarios 6 to 8 and scenario 1 status quo is comprised between 42 and 84 at the end 2029 the highest gain is obtained with the limitation of catches cvl combined with technical measures cds these results highlighted the relevance of combining selected management measures to improve the stock level 7 2 simulations of environmental and market modifications two other scenarios were defined to consider the potential effects of environmental or market modifications to the stock evolution in addition to status quo management measures for these scenarios the management measures applied were the same as those selected for scenario 1 status quo on which the additional hypotheses were applied from 2020 scenario 9 simulated an increase of the seawater temperature to define this augmentation the last report of the giecc ipcc 2019 was used considering the projected change in sea surface temperature between the recent past 1986 2005 and the near term 2031 2050 under scenario rcp8 5 an increase of 0 04 c per year was tested it was applied to all the months of the same year this value is consistent with regional forecasts given by chust et al 2014 for the bay of biscay for the end of the century this modification was applied between 2020 and 2029 scenario 10 considered the increase of the selling price from 3 5 euros per kg to 4 5 euros per kg as mentioned above this resulted in an increase in catches of 10 regarding scenario 9 slight increase of temperature applied in addition to status quo management measures the total biomass exhibited the same evolution as for the status quo scenario table 5 over the period 2020 2029 the number of months favorable to the realization of spawning was not modified when modelling is continued with the same assumption 0 04 c per year a change is observed in 2037 all other things being equal at the end of 2040 the biomass would be 24 higher than with scenario 1 appendix 3 for scenario 10 the simulated price per kilo increase results in a gradual decrease in the total biomass over the period 2020 2029 table 5 at the end of the period the difference reaches 21 compared to the level obtained for the status quo 8 discussion and conclusion considering the initial assumptions listed in bald et al 2009 major developments and improvements have been undertaken those recent improvements are in bold italics in fig 3 integration of specific available life traits data the parameterization of bald et al s 2009 model relied mainly on different bibliographic sources related to population dynamics of the manila clam beninger and lucas 1984 melià et al 2004 rodríguez moscoso et al 1992 solidoro et al 2000 2003 together with data related to arcachon bay caill milly et al 2003 and g trut unpublished data recent ecological data available at the bay scale led to the revision of the previous model s assumptions first environmental drivers on key processes of the population dynamics have been reinforced thanks to integration of real data or to new formulations this evolution mainly regarded the reproduction phase until now this phase which is one of the key processes of population dynamics flye saint marie 2007 was only controlled by seawater temperature a preliminary modulation relying on food availability expressed by chlorophyll a levels and on total suspended matter concentrations was undertaken measurement of photosynthetic pigment water concentration remains relatively easy to acquire and appears to be the most common indicator used for food availability e g shibata et al 1999 unlike the older stages flye sainte marie et al 2003 we have not identified any work questioning the validity of this descriptor as an adequate substitute for food availability in young manila clams nevertheless it is always interesting to consider other trophic resource proxies when available in the case of arcachon the evolution of the monthly average of phytoplankton abundance also showed a change consistent with the hypothesis adopted for this work phytoplankton and phycotoxin monitoring network rephy ifremer unpublished data in those conditions the retained formulation corresponded to a more realistic hypothesis since those modelled environmental parameters temperature food supply and total suspended matter are well known for influencing the reproductive phase delgado and pérez camacho 2007 devauchelle 1990 holland and chew 1974 le pennec and benninger 2000 mann 1979 ohba 1959 soudant et al 2004 toba and miyama 1995 or described as driving factors for arcachon bay caill milly 2012 however the applied modulation does not take into account the observation of a phenomenal number of juveniles in 2014 sanchez et al 2014 moreover the sensitivity analysis highlighted that the target variable the biomass was very sensitive to the uncertainty of the parameter recruitment such results advocate for deeper analysis of the processes related to the younger stages including data collection efforts as recommended by sterman 2000 this encourages the implementation of a monitoring of the number of clam larvae just as it is already practiced for the intra basin oysters but for the moment not carried out on manila clam for lack of means in the meanwhile as long as such an episode remains exceptional and the current conditions on chlorophyll a and tsm do not exhibit major changes the applied rules should be maintained a second important process for population dynamics i e growth could also have been determined by this integration of specific environmental drivers the reason is that numerous authors agree with the main role played by the temperature on venerupis species beiras et al 1994 fan et al 2007 laing et al 1987 toba 1987 in nakamura et al 2002 but also food supply maître allain 1982 yamamoto et al 1956 and even duration of immersion goulletquer et al 1987 nevertheless two reasons led to the application of minor changes in the formulation of the growth process first the highlighted interrelations between the studied stock status and temperature did not consider growth but mainly the reproductive phase caill milly et al 2012 secondly the possible effects involved directly and indirectly via the link between temperature and trophic resources were highly complex and the current constitution of the model did not allow their consideration numerous references have already addressed the problem of model complexity costanza and sklar 1985 håkanson 1999 jørgensen 1988 since the right balance must be struck between simplicity and complexity on one hand a simplistic model may not account for important ecological processes and may reduce descriptive and realistic model properties cetin 2007 on the other hand a highly complex model may reduce predictive accuracy be difficult to run and produce a high number of errors håkanson 1999 tsang 1991 high dependence on assumptions parameter values and environmental forcing functions was also mentioned by murray and parslow 1999 it was assumed that ecological processes involved in the growth phase were insufficiently controlled with respect to growth and natural mortality the previous formulations relied on growth model developed for the sacca di goro lagoon italy bald et al 2009 or on an empirical equation proposed by solidoro et al 2000 2003 for northern adriatic lagoons direct assessments of growth and of this source of mortality were drawn from enclosure field experiments undertaken by dang et al 2010 within arcachon bay between december 2005 and november 2007 in addition to being reliable data for the considered stock their variations with age related to mean size were coherent with the models proposed by caddy 1991 and appeldoorn 1988 notably to reproduce mortality at age moreover those values were used to account for the natural predation of manila clams which was considered to be important in arcachon bay robert and deltreil unpublished results they also included the effect of diseases regarding ecological processes not treated until now future improvements could mainly concern the question of linkage between the stock and the recruitment the current biomass surveys led every two years indicated high variability of the recruitment levels at the bay scale sanchez et al 2018 that was in accordance with the work undertaken by tezuka et al 2012 nevertheless they did not allow the validation of any intraspecific stock recruitment relationship for the investigated population to identify this relationship for coastal species freire and garcía allut 2000 reported the importance of scale considerations or the occurrence of low stock levels to be detected moreover processes involved are complicated because a stronger effect of interspecific stock recruitment relationship can also occur as demonstrated for donax hanleyanus by defeo 1998 in the absence of evidence recruitment fluctuations in response to environmental parameters were deemed much stronger than those linked to density dependent mechanisms intra and interspecific if this hypothesis were to be revised the model structure would allow for example in considering fertility rates according to size classes since reproductive effort and fecundity are age related gosling 2003 for the lagoon of venice solidoro et al 2003 considered that each parental class minimum length required 18 mm enabled the successful implantation of one hundred juveniles for arcachon bay a first approach could be undertaken by using the age related gonadal production established by urrutia et al 1999 for venerupis decussatus adjustment of the realized fishing activity and its control parameters reformulations of the monthly catches volume per fishing license using data from two databases système d informations halieutiques and base pêche aquitaine was integrated and is considered as the most reliable parameter for professional fishing activities in addition the fishing effort according to the different length classes was reallocated based on more realistic field information those improvements permitted a reformulation of the temporal fishing catches evolution expressed in effective per surface unit for each length class units ind m 2 month 1 the fishery block was also amended by a first option to simulate a price effect on the fishing strategies socio economic objectives are generally poorly defined so a price effect has been recently integrated into the model to enrich it and to take into account human behavior such relationships could be more precisely established as well as the relationship between biomass availability effort and profitability of the fishery for instance it would be interesting to introduce modification of cvl level in response to strong decrease of total biomass as well a reflection on the desired breakdown of the licenses between full time and part time activities could be set in addition the current fishing activity modelled within the model remained the commercial one manila clams are also caught by recreational fishermen but their impact is considered negligible in comparison to commercial fishing fmpaa unpublished results under those conditions it did not seem useful to include this factor in the modeled parameters performance of the model sensitivity and used framework the adequacy of the model with regards to reality was considered by using the acceptable limit of deviation percentage between observed and predicted data sets bald et al 2006 2009 the obtained average of the absolute values of the deviation percentage considering years 2003 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 is equal to 5 3 this level reflects a slightly better performance than that described by bald et al 2009 and over a larger number of years in the future it would be worth considering the model performance with new indices of performance such as those implemented by anastácio et al 2009 for scrobicularia plana the implementation of the loague and green s modeling efficiency ef would also provide an overall indication of the goodness of fit mayer and butler 1993 ef is a dimensionless statistic based on the coefficient of determination and directly compares predictions with real world observations this paper proposed a first sensibility analysis of biological and environmental control parameters the temperature conditions related to spawning periods and recruitment appear to give the highest sensitivity for determining the total biomass this highlights the importance of selecting the right parameters that control the number of recruits on the modelled dynamics a first modulation according to chlorophyll a and tsm concentrations was undertaken for this work it is clearly an area for future work to improve the model the sensitivity analysis was mainly local and to a lesser extent global it remains an elementary sensitivity analysis realized with the available module in vensim faivre et al 2013 another avenue for improvement in this work would be to fully implement the method proposed by pianosi et al 2016 by implementing the packages for gsua 3 3 https www safetoolbox info info and documentation another possible avenue would be to extend the sensitivity analysis to resource exploitation parameters the improvement of the model was conducted step by step and the formulations both reinforced environmental and socio economic considerations within the model cumulative effects of those drivers could therefore be considered scenarios 9 to 10 although limitations on the modeling of biological processes were identified by the sensitivity analysis bearing these limitations in mind we are convinced that this model remains reliable to investigate different management strategies under current environmental conditions but is not well suited to consider strong environmental shifts such as those considered in the worst climate change case scenarios for the accompaniment of a co management approach for this local exploited stock from the start the model specifically intended to strengthen the management of the stock by enabling a robust and well informed decision making process based on science this tool was used for the first time in 2008 2009 the simulations were presented and discussed in the framework of working groups associating scientists fishermen and administration representatives caill milly et al 2021 when the results of the last stock assessment campaign will be presented to professionals the model can again be used to support management decision making the different management scenarios tested with this last version of the model should help in this context in the coming months the results argue for the choice of a management strategy involving several management measures as opposed to one strong measure modification such combinations are part of the arsenal of measures that are implemented on manila clam resource in other european coastal systems coelho et al 2021 different combinations are possible and additional ones may stem from discussion the acceptability dimension will have to be considered in this context most of the existing management models dealing with clams necessitate the assessment of a large number of parameters cossarini et al 2009 pastres et al 2001 solidoro et al 2000 conversely our present model necessitates fewer parameters and relies on a system dynamic approach implemented to understand and conceptualize the complex system regarding both the surrounding environment and human activity costanza and ruth 1998 similar approaches based on models were conducted inter alia on the gooseneck barnacle bald et al 2006 and the peruvian scallop ortiz et al 2002 in our situation its implementation complemented the existing collaborations between scientists and fishermen who have both conducted field surveys since 2003 this type of functioning is in line with the directions of oregon s development fisheries program see harte et al 2008 because it aims at incorporating design of science and management plans for small scale fisheries integration of different kinds of operational management measures and institutional structures for governance was highlighted by defeo 2011 as a key issue in successful management of sandy beach fisheries this approach is considered by the coastal galician fisheries freire and garcía allut 2000 freire et al 2002 and has been applied in southeast asia coastal fisheries since the 1960s pomeroy 1995 management of numerous other local french resources such as bivalves manila clam scallop mussel crustaceans spiny lobster or algae mainly in brittany and in normandy picault et al 2014 d hardivillé and bouché 2018 ices 2018 rely on close collaborations between scientists and commercial industries however none of them has used such a dynamic model before in our case this approach has proven its effectiveness in selecting management measures for the sustainability of the neonatural resource however the environment and design of the software should be enhanced in order to be used more systematically indeed it is very difficult to change tack midway through a period and currently lacks an interface which can also easily be used by managers caill milly et al 2021 moreover the license restricts the use of the software in an easily accessible web type form elsawah et al 2017 recent publications garcia 2021a 2021b should make it possible to solve some of the aforementioned points in the near future such developments are in accordance with the four main uses of a model as reported by del granado 2007 increasing the human understanding of the considered system communicating visually making predictions and supporting decision making this last use was also described by other authors felleman 1999 hannon and ruth 1994 shenk and franklin 2001 opening science to society becomes a significant subject at a national level since a dedicated charter was revised and signed at the end of 2020 by eight french institutes public establishments for research expertise and or risk assessment in the fields of health and the environment caill milly et al 2021 regarding the improvements of the model identified this recent context militates for a rapid

24426,to satisfy a rising demand agricultural practices have shifted from the organic fertilization of soils to intensive and highly specialized farming that uses chemical fertilization the resulting short term increase in soil productivity has lead to serious ecological drawbacks over time e g degradation of soil quality pollution of water and air and loss of biodiversity given this state of affairs it is urgent to find alternative practices that preserve soil quality and at the same time ensure farmers receive acceptable revenues in this work we rely on viability theory to determine a set of policies that make it possible to reach this dual objective the proposed multi parcel land model is applied to data from the archipelago of guadeloupe located in the french west indies keywords viability theory agriculture system mixed integer programming multi parcel farm french west indies 1 introduction this paper deals with the long term management of farms and their ability to restore and maintain the quality of their soil while maintaining its economic viability the evolution over time of this quality depends on numerous factors some being controllable by the farmer e g the choice of crops and farming method and others not such as climatic events our main research question can be framed as follows given a farm of a certain size and a planning horizon what choices should the farmer make to simultaneously achieve an ecological objective and an economic sustainability one roughly speaking the ecological objective corresponds to soil quality while the economic one refers to revenues to answer our question we rely on the mathematical theory of viability aubin 1990 in a nutshell a viability problem involves a dynamical system whose evolution depends on state and control variables and possibly on some random events given a set of constraints and an initial state of the system one looks for viable solutions that is evolutions or trajectories of these variables that satisfy the constraints viability theory vt has been successfully used to determine sustainable policies in the management of ecosystems and renewable resources e g fisheries and forests see oubraham and zaccour 2018 for a literature review in the specific context of farming and agroecological systems most applications of vt dealt with herd and grassland management problems farming land uses and land use related biodiversity see e g tichit et al 2004 sabatier et al 2010 2012 mouysset et al 2013 tichit et al 2007 baumgärtner and quaas 2009 martin et al 2011 sabatier et al 2015 durand et al 2017 very few have addressed soil quality management problems durand et al 2017 proposed a deterministic model describing the evolution of a single land parcel and looked for agricultural strategies and crop planting sequences that restore soil quality to an acceptable level while preserving the farm s economic profitability oubraham et al 2020 extended the model to a stochastic environment to account for major climatic events that affect the evolution of the dynamical system describing the farm s state in this paper we extend the deterministic model in durand et al 2017 to a multi parcel case to assess the potential advantages of a multi crop strategy our empirical study concerns the archipelago of guadeloupe located in the french west indies it is well established that soil has been poorly protected and overexploited for decades which has resulted in its deterioration worldwide see fig 1 one of the most important human induced factors in soil s deterioration is modern agriculture indeed to meet the ever growing demand agronomic systems have had to drastically change during the last decades and have migrated to agricultural practices based on the chemical fertilization of soil and intensive and specialized farming practices this has increased soil productivity in the short term but in the long term has caused serious ecological drawbacks degradation of soil quality pollution of water and air loss of biodiversity erosion etc and even reversed the trend of agricultural productivity in contrast to traditional agricultural systems based on natural fertilization and diversified crop production modern agriculture relies on intensive single crop production that progressively degrades soil quality and reduces its productivity by changing its physical chemical and biological composition fertilization and irrigation with low quality water unbalance the chemical composition of the soil plowing tillage removal of vegetative cover and overgrazing make it more vulnerable to wind and water erosion intensive and specialized cultivation leaches minerals and water from it and damages its microfauna blanco and lal 2010 in fact modern agricultural systems have now fallen into a vicious cycle where the use of chemical fertilizers is increased to compensate for the loss of productivity causing more damage to the soil and more water and air pollution fao fao 2021 kellner et al 2011 roesch et al 2017 given the state of affairs just described it is urgent to take action to replace current agricultural practices with more ecoresponsible ones based on crop rotation and mixed crop livestock associations which are healthier for the soil we need to establish an agroecological transition that would in the medium term allow a return to more environmentally friendly agricultural practices and restore soil quality to an acceptable level while taking into account the socioeconomic aspects of that sector this is particularly true for island regions given the importance of agriculture in their economies angeon et al 2015 a survey of farmers in the french west indies revealed that the population is aware of the problem and that farmers are now placing soil quality at the center of their concerns and are willing to make efforts and even to sacrifice some of their financial benefits to restore the quality of their land angeon et al 2013 in our study we consider a series of cases representing different farming systems practiced in the french west indies then we analyze the impact of each one of these cases on the soil quality and the economic well being of the farmer also we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on the results of main parameters namely initial soil quality planning horizon and various costs our contribution is threefold first to the best of our knowledge our paper is the first one to consider a multi parcel land in the viability framework to analyze a soil quality restoration problem clearly such a framework provides additional flexibility in the search for sustainable ecological and economical solutions second extending the single parcel model in durand et al 2017 to multiple parcels adds a huge complexity in determining viable solutions in this paper we design an algorithmic approach that is not only drastically novel with respect to durand et al 2017 but also to the whole literature in viability theory we believe that this approach could be helpful in other applications of viability theory finally we contribute empirically by answering questions that are on the agenda of farmers and decision makers in the french west indies our results show that parcelization of land of a given area is always beneficial even if there is no physical or spacial interaction between the parcels the intuition behind this result is as follows having a multi parcel land allows to split the restoration effort over time between the different parcels for instance one can mix fallow on some parcels while the other parcels continue generating revenues needed by the farmer in fact parcelization enlarges the set of feasible controls to satisfy the farm s constraints we also find that the benefits of parcelization depend on some parameter values e g the duration of the planning horizon and available crops the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we extend the single parcel model in durand et al 2017 to multiple parcels in section 3 we present the approach for obtaining viable solutions in section 4 we present our empirical results and we briefly conclude in section 5 2 a multi parcel bioeconomic model in this section we extend the model in durand et al 2017 to a multi parcel piece of land consider a farm with n p land parcels managed over time by a single agent the planning horizon is t and the current time is denoted by τ t 0 t t δ where t δ is an extra time period by which the planning horizon can be extended to complete an ongoing agricultural cycle 1 1 to illustrate suppose that 59 months are left until the end of the time horizon and it is beneficial to plant a crop having a cycle length of 60 months then we allow this planting by extending the time horizon by 1 month to allow the completion of this cycle however we limit the time by which we can exceed the time horizon through the parameter t δ each parcel p 1 n p is characterized by its area α p in ha and its soil quality which is an agronomic measure evaluating a soil s quality is a complex operating involving a series of physical chemical and biological characteristics here we adopt the general indicator of soil quality gisq which have already been used in durand et al 2017 velásquez et al 2012 cécillon et al 2009 marichal et al 2014 and obriot et al 2016 among others the gisq has values in the interval 0 1 and is based on 54 variables measuring these characteristics velásquez et al 2007 camacho et al 2009 let i p be the gisq value of parcel p with i p ℐ i 0 i n i 1 2 2 i 0 0 and i n i 1 1 that is i can take a finite number of values the main variables describing the farm s state are i the cash flow treasury w r a continuous variable characterizing the financial situation and ii the soil quality of all its parcels i i 1 i n p the evolution of the soil quality of parcel p 1 n p depends on its current quality i p and the following two control variables i the crop σ p grown on the parcel with σ p σ p and ii the agricultural practice π p π p in the rest of the paper we consider the crop and practice possibilities to be the same for all parcels that is σ p σ σ 1 σ n σ and π p π π 1 π n π p 1 n p 3 3 differences within the choices sets can be due to geographical or physical variations between parcels for instance slope or wind exposure can make it impossible to grow certain crops and parcel accessibility can make it impossible to use some types of equipment to clarify in the case studies to follow the set of crops includes either all or some of the following crop types plantain export banana sugar cane yam yellow yam grosse caille tomato eggplant lettuce carrot green bean cabbage cassava melon cucumber and turban squash the set of agricultural practices only includes two elements i e conventional or agroecological practices let the evolution of the soil quality on one land parcel be described by the following function ϕ ℐ σ π i i σ π ϕ i σ π this is a discrete transition function that evolves at each change of the crop the function ϕ used in our application is defined in eq 13 in appendix e 1 2 the revenue from each harvest on that land parcel depends on the crop and the agricultural practice as well as on the soil quality at the beginning of the cycle formally the revenue function ℓ is defined by ℓ ℐ σ π r i σ π ℓ i σ π denote by δ σ π the duration of the whole agricultural cycle of a crop σ using agricultural practice π then to each pair σ π we can associate production cycle ψ defined as follows ψ σ π 0 δ σ π σ π ψ σ π moreover to each crop and practice σ π we associate its first harvest time f c σ π and the amount of time between two successive harvests p c σ π the duration of the first harvest is f c σ π and the following harvests last p c σ π 4 4 these parameters are used to capture the fact that most of the harvest crops take a certain time to grow time from the moment they were sown or planted to their first harvest this is the first harvest time and then gives yield on a regular basis time between successive harvests this distinction is needed for a precise calculation of the farm s treasury over time if a crop only has a single harvest then f c σ π δ σ π and p c σ π 0 for example the plantain banana produces multiple harvests with an agricultural cycle duration of 60 months the first harvest can be made 6 months after the crop is planted f c 6 after that a harvest takes place every 3 months p c 3 until the crop s life cycle ends lettuce on the other hand produces only one harvest that takes place at the end of its whole agricultural cycle i e 2 months after it is planted f c δ 2 and p c 0 also we suppose that the produce is sold immediately after the harvest denote by s s 1 12 the current month this discrete variable is needed to deal with the seasonality of crops that can be planted or sown only at specific times of the year let σ s σ be the set of all crops that can be planted or sown during season s in the single parcel case studied in durand et al 2017 the only event that must be accounted for over time is the beginning end of a production cycle if we refer by n to a step a state change and by τ n to its timing then the next step will happen at 1 τ n 1 τ n ψ σ π this formulation does not hold when we have multiple parcels as each one has its own crop sequence and agricultural practice this implies that at any time there are as many production cycles independent simultaneous and potentially of different durations as there are parcels in the farm and the next evolution of the system should coincide with the nearest event on the parcels consequently 1 needs to be modified to account for such events to do so we introduce the following new variables e p p 1 n p the remaining time before the next event on parcel p 1 n p ε min p 1 n p e p the remaining time before the next change in the system s state the remaining time before the nearest event on the parcels denote by e the vector of events e e 1 e n p ε let a p n be the age of the crop on parcel p at step n and b p n the state of the soil at the beginning of the agricultural cycle of σ n the control variable on parcel p at that step is v p n σ p n π p n a p n b p n σ π 0 δ σ p π p ℐ the new parcel s gisq value is given by i p n 1 ζ i p n v p n ε n and the earnings generated by control v n on a one hectare parcel during the time lapse ε n is defined by l i v n ε n g σ n π n a n b n ε n that is the earnings depend on the type of crop σ n its age a n the state of the soil when it was planted b n the agricultural practice π n and the time elapsed since the last event ε n the cash flow of the farm is updated at each step n we suppose here that the earning generated by a parcel p is proportional to its area α p thus the cash flow treasury w of the farm evolves according to the following equation w n 1 w n p 1 n p α p l i p n v p n ε n 2 1 dynamical system denote by v v 1 v n p v n p the control vector with v p n u p n a p n b p n for p 1 n p with u p σ p π p u σ π to account for crop seasonality we define by u s u u s σ s π the set of possible controls on parcels during a particular season s denote by x i w e s τ the state vector the evolution of the farm is then governed by the following discrete time dynamical system f 2 f τ n 1 τ n ε n a

g the initial state is given by x 0 i 1 0 i n p 0 w 0 e 0 s 0 τ 0 where i p 0 p 1 n p w 0 and s 0 are given parameters ε 0 min p 1 n p e p 0 τ 0 e p 0 0 and b p 0 i p 0 for all p 1 n p eq 2 a sets the clock at each step n 1 advancing it by ε n the time that elapsed between steps n and n 1 eq 2 b does the same thing with the season while taking into account its cyclicality eq 2 g serves to update the event vector at each step the update of the other variables depends on where current events take place at any step n if the remaining time until the next event on a certain parcel p is equal to the remaining time until the next event on the whole system e p n ε n then this means the event in question at step n 1 will occur on that parcel indicating the end of a production cycle on it and leading to the modification of the soil quality at that place see 2 c if the production cycle that just ended on the parcel is not the final one a p n δ σ p n π p n then the crop and practice applied on that parcel remain the same we only update the age of the crop in the control variable see 2 e and a new production cycle starts right away with the remaining time until the next event on that same parcel being p c σ p n π p n see 2 f otherwise if the whole agricultural cycle ended a p n δ σ p n π p n then a new crop and agricultural practice v n 1 have to be chosen from the set u s n 1 for this parcel as expressed in 2 e the new time until the next event on that parcel is equal to the length of the first production cycle of the new crop that is f c σ p n 1 π p n 1 see 2 f now if the event does not occur on that parcel e p n ε n then the cycle already in progress cannot be interrupted consequently the control and the soil quality of this parcel remain the same and only the age of the crop is updated see 2 c and e the remaining time until the next event just has to be reduced by the time that elapsed between steps n and n 1 see 2 f finally eq 2 d updates the economic state of the farm by accumulating at each step the earnings generated by the parcels where a production cycle has ended 2 2 a viability problem when choosing crops and agricultural practices on the different parcels the farmer seeks to achieve the following two objectives 1 ensuring an acceptable amount of income throughout the whole planning horizon 2 restoring the quality of the soil to a desired level by the terminal date of the planning horizon the first objective is economic and can clearly take different forms depending on how one defines acceptable income one practical option is to define a minimum threshold w m i n below which cash flow should not fall at any step consequently we have the following admissible set 3 k i w e s τ τ t w w m i n 0 in the numerical applications we set w m i n 0 and then require a nonnegative treasury w over time the second objective is bioecological and embeds the long term concern to maintain the resource land in an acceptable state for instance the objective may consist in restoring the quality of all farm parcels to a certain desired level i by the end of the time horizon this can then be translated into a target to reach within a prescribed timeframe i e 4 c i 1 i n p w e s τ τ t i p i p 1 n p restoring the quality of all parcels to a desired level may be too ambitious in some situations especially when the initial quality of each parcel varies greatly and when the time horizon is not long enough in such cases one can adopt a less demanding target to improve the quality of all parcels by a certain level percentage d the target set is then defined as follows 5 c d i 1 i n p w e s τ τ t i p min d 100 i p 0 1 p 1 n p finding the controls that satisfy some constraints taking into account the evolution of the dynamical system can be framed as a viability problem more specifically we aim to determine the initial states x 0 i 1 0 i n p 0 w 0 e 0 s 0 τ 0 of system f for which there exists at least one viable evolution i e one that remains in k 3 during the entire planning horizon and reaches the target c 4 or c d 5 at the end of that time horizon this set is the viability kernel and is formally defined as follows 6 k e r f k c x 0 k x s t x 0 x 0 t 0 s t x t c n 0 t x n k 3 solution method to compute the viability kernel defined in 6 we exploit the following property established in proposition 1 and corollary 1 if it is possible not possible to reach the target with a certain initial treasury then it is possible not possible to reach it with a higher lower treasury as τ 0 0 s 0 1 and e 0 0 are given data we can characterize any initial state x 0 only by i 0 i 1 0 i n p 0 and w 0 values and write x 0 i 0 w 0 proposition 1 let i w be an initial state from the viability kernel k e r f k c then any initial state i w with w w belongs to k e r f k c formally i w k e r f k c i w k e r f k c w w proof let b x i be the minimum budget needed for the evolution x to be viable i e b x i min w x 0 i w t 0 s t x t c n 0 t x n k we have i w k e r f k c x s t b x i w therefore w w b x i w and consequently i w k e r f k c corollary 1 if it is not possible to reach the target from an initial state i w then it is not possible to reach it with less initial treasury i w k e r f k c i w k e r f k c w w the results in proposition 1 and corollary 1 imply that in order to completely characterize the viability kernel it is sufficient to identify its border or in other words to find for each initial gisq vector i the minimum initial treasury w i n f i needed for the restoration i e w i n f i inf i w k e r f k c w min x b x i therefore the problem amounts to finding a viable evolution of the system x with the minimum possible restoration budget b x i this problem can be formulated as a shortest path problem where the objective is to minimize the restoration budget and which can be solved by mixed integer programming mip since the problem of finding the minimum initial treasury needed for the restoration of a soil s quality from i to i can be formulated as a mip and consequently by solving such a mip for every possible initial gisq i we identify the border of the viability kernel and this allows us to completely characterize the viability kernel following the conclusion driven from proposition 1 and corollary 1 in appendix a we introduce the network describing the system and the mip modeling we use cplex software with a column generation approach to solve the mip 4 numerical results and discussion in this section we illustrate our model and the solution approach with a series of farming systems to which we will refer as cases table 1 lists the crops considered in these cases each crop can be used with either a conventional or an agroecological practice also farmers can choose to leave their land fallow coupled with an agroecological practice short fallow and free long fallow or a conventional practice improved short fallow and improved long fallow each of the listed cases represents a type of farming system practiced in the french west indies the export sector is specialized in banana and sugar cane cases c1 and c2 the local market oriented sector is based on diversified vegetable farming c3 and c4 and finally c5 is a theoretical case that combines all the crops in order to analyze the effect of each parameter the computations have been made for different parcels areas initial gisq levels and time horizons we always require that the farm remain self sufficient i e we set the economic constraint to 0 w m i n 0 and we impose that the retained solution s allow for a positive treasury all the case studies concern the archipelago of guadeloupe for the common elements we use the data and parameter values in durand et al 2017 and oubraham et al 2020 the other required data and parameter values have been estimated and are displayed in appendix e for the executions we considered two cases regarding the number of parcels the single parcel case where the whole land is considered one parcel over which the farmer should apply one control at a time and the multi parcel case where the land is divided into two independent parcels on which the farmer can apply different controls to have comprehensive comparisons we impose that the total area in the multi parcel case equal the area in the single parcel one in the executions we considered a 3 ha parcel in the single parcel case and two parcels of 1 ha and 2 ha respectively in the multi parcel case with the same initial gisq the rest of the section is divided into two parts in the first section 4 1 we focus on the viability kernel and the minimum restoration budgets in particular we analyze the impact of the time horizon in section 4 1 1 the impact of the initial gisq in section 4 1 2 and the impact of crop diversification in section 4 1 3 in the second part section 4 2 we look at viable evolutions more specifically we discuss the main characteristics of such evolutions and how they are affected by such features as time horizon and gisq improvement level 4 1 the viability kernels denote by k e r c i t i n the viability kernel of case i for a time horizon t in years with i being the gisq target and n the number of parcels it represents the set of all pairs of initial gisq i 0 and budget initial treasury that make it possible to reach the target while respecting the imposed constraints in fig 2 each panel represents a superposition of viability kernels of the same problem case for different time horizons with one or two parcels each color represents a particular time horizon the ones with the dark dotted borders represent the two parcels setting whereas the ones with light solid border represents the single parcel one 5 5 since the figure shows a superposition of different viability kernels we chose to represent them in transparency in order to be able to see the borders of the kernels underneath this transparency along with the superposition of kernels might slightly change the colors so we used solid and dotted borders to distinguish them areas whose borders are solid represent the single parcel setting and those with the dotted borders represent the multi parcel one in all cases and for all time horizons the viability kernel with a single parcel is always included in the two parcel case that is k e r c i t i 1 k e r c i t i 2 this result can be generalized to any number of parcels formally we have k e r c i t i n 1 k e r c i t i n 2 n 1 n 2 the reason for the above inclusion is as follows first we note that splitting the land into multiple parcels does not involve any additional costs second let us suppose that the farm is managed as a single parcel and identify a viable policy clearly this policy can be applied to a multi parcel farm by repeating on each parcel the single parcel solution assuming of course that the single parcel is of the same size as the sum of parcels and have the same characteristics in terms of location soil quality etc put differently by enlarging the set of feasible solutions parcelization only brings additional benefits and no incremental cost therefore the minimum restoration budget in the multi parcel case will be at most equal to the one in the single parcel case now the size of the benefits induced by parcelization depends on the parameter values e g the time horizon the initial gisq value and the crops available which are considered in the next subsections 4 1 1 impact of the time horizon fig 2 shows the viability kernels for different planning horizons 40 20 10 and 5 years in all cases and for any number of parcels the viability kernels shrink and slide to the right as the time horizon gets shorter this indicates that the shorter time is the more difficult and expensive it gets to restore soil quality further restoring soil with a very low initial quality to a given desired level may be impossible to achieve intuitively one expects the cost of soil restoration to be higher when the horizon is shorter this is observed in the results but not when the initial gisq is very close to the target or is higher than the target indeed in case c1 the kernel s border for t 5 is lower than that for t 10 similarly in cases c2 and c4 the borders of the kernels for t 5 and t 10 are below that at t 20 with a single parcel and in case c3 the frontier of the kernel for t 5 is lower than those for t 10 and t 20 one explanation is that when the difference in initial and target values of the gisq is large it requires a significant effort to improve the gisq and this is more difficult and pricy when the time horizon is short however when we start from a gisq that is sufficiently close to or greater than the target the effort is not to improve the gisq but to maintain it over time maintaining the gisq at a certain level over a short period of time is easier and cheaper than doing so over a long period further we notice that the gap between the viability kernel of the single parcel case and the multi parcel case gets bigger as the time horizon expands to obtain some insight into this result consider fig 3 which represents the minimum budget needed for the restoration of soil with initial gisq of 0 6 to a gisq target of 0 8 for various planning horizons the solid lines represent the budgets for the multi parcel case whereas the dotted lines show those for the single parcel case fig 3 shows that in all cases and for any number of parcels the restoration budget first decreases with t and next stabilizes when the time horizon reaches a certain value moreover the restoration budget in the multi parcel case is always less than or equal to the budget in the single parcel case confirming the result established previously with the gap widening with the time horizon until it stabilizes after a certain value of time horizon this result indicates that having multiple parcels never increases the restoration costs with the benefits being larger when the time horizon is longer to wrap up for each initial data set problem case and initial and target gisq we can determine a threshold terminal date after which the benefits of having multiple parcels are significant note that we assumed away any additional costs e g management fees induced by dividing a land into parcels if such costs have to be paid then the threshold will be farther away in terms of computation effort finding a solution in a single parcel setting is much easier and faster than in the multi parcel scenario 4 1 2 impact of the initial gisq fig 4 displays the evolution of the total cost of a gisq improvement by 0 2 for various initial gisq values for all cases in a single parcel setting dotted lines and in a multi parcel setting solid lines with t 40 years the cost of improving the soil quality by given level depends on the initial gisq value fig 4 shows that in general the cost is lower when the initial gisq is higher the reason is that a crop planted in higher quality soil generates a higher income consequently a lower minimum budget is needed as the income covers a larger portion of the operating costs however we observe a different behavior for gisq values close to 0 and 1 for instance in cases c1 and c4 the restoration cost curve is increasing near initial the gisq values of 0 and 1 for a single parcel this result is even more visible in the representations of the viability kernels of cases c1 and c3 in fig 2 where we observe that the costs increase a little for certain values of the initial gisq close to 0 before decreasing one explanation is that when the gisq is too low the degradation caused by a crop or a harmful agricultural practice cannot be too high on the other hand starting with a soil of medium quality leaves room for improvements that exceed the target in anticipation of future damage caused by more profitable crops however if the initial gisq is too high then such an opportunity is not available which increases the restoration cost in some cases to illustrate the above findings we report in fig 5 the evolution in gisq induced by the same control sequence starting from different initial gisq values 0 0 in orange 0 3 in blue 0 5 in gray and 0 7 in green over 480 months we can see that this strategy leads to a 0 3 improvement in the gisq from 0 3 to 0 6 and from 0 5 to 0 8 when starting from an average initial gisq level 0 3 and 0 5 however if we start from a higher initial gisq level 0 7 the improvement is only 0 23 units from 0 7 to 9 3 on the other hand the same strategy is more efficient when the initial gisq is lowest indeed here the improvement is equal to 0 37 units from 0 0 to 0 37 finally we note that when the initial gisq is low the gisq values over time can exceed the target which provides a buffer against possible future degradation finally we note that the results are independent of the number of parcels as no significant difference is observed between single and multiple parcels moreover the cost gap between the single parcel and multi parcel settings is more or less the same regardless of the initial gisq therefore the benefits of having multiple parcels are invariable with respect to the initial gisq level 4 1 3 impact of crop diversification from figs 2 3 and 4 we observe that the viability kernel of a case with fewer crop options is always included in any viability kernel corresponding to a scenario with more crops that is if the set of possible controls u i in case c i is included in the set u j in case c j then the viability kernel of c i is contained in that of c j for any planning horizon i e u i u j k e r c i t i n k e r c j t i n t and n furthermore fig 4 indicates that the restoration budget in a case with a larger number of crops is at most equal to the budget for a lower number of crops formally u i u j b u d g e t c i t i n b u d g e t c j t i n t and n in fact adding a control can only help in meeting the objective however adding new crops to the set of possible controls does not necessarily enlarge the viability kernel or decrease the restoration budget indeed if the initial set already contains the right mix of crops adding new crops will certainly not deteriorate the solution but will not improve it either for example in almost all instances the performance of c5 is identical to that of c4 even if it has more crop choices finally figs 4 and 3 reveal that the lower is the number of crops the more beneficial is the use of multiple parcels indeed if we define by g a p i the gap between the solid and dotted lines in case c i then we clearly have u i u j g a p i g a p j for instance the gap between the red solid and dotted lines in these figures representing case c1 is larger than the gap between the blue solid and dotted lines representing problem case c2 which contains more crops the intuition behind this result is that when the number of crops is low there is no much room for crop diversification in the single parcel setting and thus splitting the land into multiple parcels brings an important reduction of the restoration budget whereas more crop choices already brings a significative improvement in the single parcel setting through crop diversification so the budget reduction brought by switching to a multi parcel setting is less important therefore the advantages of opting for a multi parcel setting are much more noticeable when the number of crops is small than when it is large 4 2 viable evolutions in this section we present the viable solutions with a minimum initial budget that lie on the boundary of the viability kernels figs 6 7 8 and 9 display the solutions for cases c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively for a single parcel and for multiple parcels the time horizon is t 40 480 months the initial gisq is i 0 0 6 and the gisq target is i 0 8 the upper part of each figure shows the treasury and gisq evolutions over time and the lower part displays the crop recommendations a first result is that in almost all cases the initial treasury i e the restoration budget is lower and the final treasury significantly higher for multiple parcels then for the corresponding values for a single parcel also in most cases the gisq evolution for one of the multiple parcels is quite similar to the one obtained for a single parcel in terms of gisq trajectories we often observe that the gisq of at least one of the parcels in a multiple parcel scenario exceeds the target value at some intermediate date before decreasing towards the target value at terminal date t in the single parcel case we see the opposite behavior that is in most cases the gisq level first drops and then increases towards the target value at t when the farm is a single parcel then the whole land is initially used to boost the treasury needed for the soil restoration before investing the accumulated amount to reach the gisq target similarly to what emerges from the land sparing vs sharing debate in the biodiversity protection context green et al 2005 in the multi parcel setting the farmer can dedicate one parcel to generate revenues while the other parcel is restored a portfolio of assets parcels allows for more flexibility than a single asset finally we make the following remarks on the viable evolutions and the effect of some parameters crop recommendations in all viable evolutions there is a prevalence of fallow as a recommended control this is mainly due to two reasons the first one is ecological fallow is very efficient in improving the soil quality contrary to most agricultural crops that reduce the soil quality except for some crops when associated with the right agricultural practice so fallow is suitable to enhance the soil quality and brings it to the minimum desired level the second reason is economical and results from the fact that the solutions lie on the boundary of the viability kernel once the minimum gisq target is reached even if investing a bit more could make it possible to obtain a higher revenue the returned solution remains the one with the minimum budget as the cheapest option is to fallow this is most likely solution to be chosen however we notice that in the multi parcel setting more controls other than fallow are recommended this result is due to the above mentioned flexibility of parcelization time horizon when the time horizon is short fallow becomes the prevalent recommended control except when the initial gisq is very close to or higher than the target gisq further the recommended controls for both parcels in the multi parcel setting are almost the same as the ones for a single parcel as the time horizon gets longer more non fallow controls are recommended and the differences between the two scenarios multiple parcels and one parcel become more pronounced level of improvement increasing the level of improvement in the gisq has two main effects first it calls for a more frequent implementation of fallow controls second the differences between the two scenarios one and multiple parcels are less visible the reason for this is that a small level of improvement in the gisq requires less effort and time to achieve leaving more possible paths open to achieve it and more time to improve the treasury however a higher level of improvement considerably reduces the number of possible paths to achieve that improvement generally only paths involving many fallow periods are left which makes the recommendations in both settings quite similar the initial budget being high and the final treasury low 5 conclusion the main qualitative results obtained in our study are as follows 1 the export oriented sector cases c1 and c2 is globally more sensitive to the number of parcels the local market oriented sector also benefits from parcelization but the gap between the results for one and two parcels is larger in the export oriented sector 2 having multiple parcels leads to better results than having one parcel in all cases however the benefit is only noticeable when the time horizon is long enough 3 parcelization s benefits are higher when the number of crop choices is lower 4 if we take into consideration the final treasury generated the multi parcel setting is globally much better than the single parcel one although we are not optimizing a specific performance index in this study and in viability theory in general this result can be used as a guideline for making a choice even if there is no physical or spacial interaction between the parcels they are still interacting at the economic level this interaction alone induces all the advantages brought by the use of multiple parcels this follows directly from the conflicting nature of the economic and ecologic constraints objectives indeed the controls that improve the soil s quality are costly and generate low income whereas those that generate a greater income are harmful to the soil thus having a multi parcel land allows to split the restoration effort over time by alternating the focus on the ecological and economic aspects on the different parcels instead of providing enough monetary resources for the restoration of the entire land having multi plots allows the use of one portion of the land some parcels to improve the economic state of the farm by favoring productive crops with conventional practices while restoring the other portion of a land by mainly favoring fallow and some less harmful crops with agroecological practices which reduces the initial budget needed for restoration at the same time this also explains the fact that the benefits of multi parcel are only noticeable when the horizon is sufficiently long note that even if the results are based on a particular choice of crops they confirm the intuition that alternating fallow between two plots can be beneficial and more profitable moreover these calculations open up the possibility of using other more judicious crop choices rather than fallow indeed intuition may help predict that parcelization would be advantageous but it does not allow for any conclusions regarding what crop sequence or alternation would be better future developments include collecting additional data and refining the estimations in particular the additional costs generated by parcelization management fees for example and other agricultural aspects like the effects of monoculture a second extension would be to run executions on different cutouts of the land varying the number of parcels and their areas finally it would be interesting and challenging to take into consideration uncertainties

detail our solution approach to determine the viability kernel we introduce the network describing the problem the mixed integer program mip and the column generation to solve the mip respectively a 1 the network the network representing the possible viable evolutions of a parcel p 1 n p is an oriented graph g p v p a p where v p is the set of vertices each vertex v p t i u e v p is identified by its time t v p t its gisq i v p i its control u v p u σ v p π v p σ π its type e v p e α β γ s n t n where α start of an agricultural cycle start of the first production cycle β intermediate harvest start end of an intermediate production cycle γ final harvest end of the agricultural cycle i e last production cycle s n source node t n sink node remark 1 there is no need to identify the γ vertices by their control they are common to all cycles ending at the same time with the same gisq the source and sink nodes are particular vertices that do not have any of the characteristics of the other vertices a p is the set of arcs each arc a i j p a p links the vertex v i p v p to v j p v p and has the following characteristics b i j p t 1 t 2 cost on arc a i j p a p over the time period t 1 t 2 m i j p t 1 t 2 wealth generated by arc a i j p a p over the time period t 1 t 2 d i j p t 1 t 2 change in the gisq induced by arc a i j p a p over the time period t 1 t 2 the network g p v p a p is constructed as follows step 1 initialize v p v 0 i p 0 u α such that u σ π σ 1 π step 2 for each vertex i v p create its outgoing arcs a i j an arc a i j is created if it satisfies one of the following conditions c1 i v p with e i α and p c u i 0 and e j γ t j t i f c u i and i j min max i i d i j t i t j 0 1 c2 i v p with e i α and p c u i 0 and e j β t j t i f c u i i j min max i i d i j

v p and go to step 2 step 4 the source and sink nodes are added to v p the source node is linked with arcs to all the initial vertices v v p s t t v 0 i v i p 0 and e v α all terminal vertices reaching the target are linked with arcs to the sink node v v p s t t v t i v i p and e v γ step 5 delete from the network all vertices from which there exists no path to the sink node and also their incoming and outgoing arcs step 1 ensures that the evolution of a parcel starts at the beginning of an agricultural cycle at time t 0 with initial gisq i p 0 steps 2 and 3 build the network forward to include all the possible evolutions of the parcel viable and nonviable conditions c1 c3 ensure the proper functioning of the process a transition from an agricultural cycle start vertex of type α goes to an intermediate harvest vertex of type β if the crop has multiple harvests or to a cycle end vertex of type γ if the control has a single harvest see conditions c1 and c2 if it is the final harvest the transition from an intermediate harvest node goes to a cycle end otherwise the transition is to another intermediate harvest node see conditions c3 and c4 finally at the end of a production cycle if the time horizon is reached then the process stops otherwise a transition to any cycle start is possible provided that the crop can be planted at that point and that the remaining time including the extension time t δ is sufficient to complete the new production cycle to illustrate the network building process we consider a simple example of a parcel with an initial gisq of 0 5 and a time horizon of one year t 12 months and t δ 1 month suppose we have the choice between two possible controls u 1 can be planted at any time except s 7 and s 8 δ u 1 3 f c u 1 2 p c u 1 1 and it improves the gisq by 0 2 0 1 after the first harvest and 0 1 after the second one u 2 can be planted at any time δ u 2 2 f c u 2 2 p c u 2 0 and it deteriorates the gisq by 0 1 in the figures below the graphs are represented on a grid where the columns represent time and the rows the gisq thus representing a vertex v at the intersection of column t and row i means that i v i and t v t vertices of type α start of an agricultural cycle are represented by circles those of type β intermediate harvests are represented by triangles and finally those of type γ end of an agricultural cycle are represented by squares orange if the time horizon is reached and gray otherwise we use the color red to represent the control u 1 and green to represent the control u 2 fig 10 displays the result of applying steps 1 to 3 of the network building process the first vertices one for control u 1 and one for control u 2 are located at t 0 and gisq i 0 0 5 and they represent agricultural cycle starts type α the node of u 1 goes to an intermediate harvest node located two units of time later f c 2 and one unit of gisq up u 1 improves the gisq by 0 1 after the first harvest then the intermediate harvest transits to a cycle end one unit of time later p c 1 and improves the gisq by 0 1 the same thing is repeated for all the agricultural cycle start vertices of control u 1 vertices of control u 2 transit directly to a cycle end vertex two time units later and deteriorates the gisq by 0 1 all the cycle end vertices that did not reach the time horizon transit to cycle start vertices of both controls u 1 and u 2 with no change in time or gisq the only exceptions are for times t 6 t 7 and t 11 because u 1 cannot be planted in seasons s 6 7 or s 7 8 and the remaining time horizon at t 11 is not sufficient to grow control u 1 t δ u 1 11 3 14 13 t t δ 12 1 fig 11 displays the result of applying step 4 the source node is linked to the vertices of t 0 and the end nodes that reached the target t t and g i s q

the column generation problem cgp is as follows 8 here we generate paths j p i that respect the flow conservation constraints from the source node to the sink node in each parcel i and minimize the initial budget required to reach the sink on all parcels note that p j i is a binary variable which is equal to 1 if the path j on parcel i is chosen and 0 otherwise m t represents the state of the treasury at time t its evolution depends on the cost and revenue contributions c j i and m j i respectively on the active arcs at any time we want this treasury to be nonnegative at any time t appendix b assumptions we made the following assumptions in our study a1 the sum of the parcels areas in the multi parcel setting is equal to the area of the single parcel a2 parcelization does not add any costs management fees or others a3 the different parcels in the multi parcel setting are completely independent the only thing they have in common is the treasury which concerns the whole farm

for improved management of agroecosystems wezel et al 2014 fallow leaving land fallow consists in leaving it unsown for a certain period of time we considered two types of fallow one coupled with conventional practices conventional fallow and one coupled with agroecological practices agroecological fallow agroecological fallow short fallow and free long fallow the land is simply left fallow conventional fallow improved short fallow and improved long fallow the fallow is improved with chemical additives and fertilizers appendix d notations chart table 2 contains the list of the most

24426,to satisfy a rising demand agricultural practices have shifted from the organic fertilization of soils to intensive and highly specialized farming that uses chemical fertilization the resulting short term increase in soil productivity has lead to serious ecological drawbacks over time e g degradation of soil quality pollution of water and air and loss of biodiversity given this state of affairs it is urgent to find alternative practices that preserve soil quality and at the same time ensure farmers receive acceptable revenues in this work we rely on viability theory to determine a set of policies that make it possible to reach this dual objective the proposed multi parcel land model is applied to data from the archipelago of guadeloupe located in the french west indies keywords viability theory agriculture system mixed integer programming multi parcel farm french west indies 1 introduction this paper deals with the long term management of farms and their ability to restore and maintain the quality of their soil while maintaining its economic viability the evolution over time of this quality depends on numerous factors some being controllable by the farmer e g the choice of crops and farming method and others not such as climatic events our main research question can be framed as follows given a farm of a certain size and a planning horizon what choices should the farmer make to simultaneously achieve an ecological objective and an economic sustainability one roughly speaking the ecological objective corresponds to soil quality while the economic one refers to revenues to answer our question we rely on the mathematical theory of viability aubin 1990 in a nutshell a viability problem involves a dynamical system whose evolution depends on state and control variables and possibly on some random events given a set of constraints and an initial state of the system one looks for viable solutions that is evolutions or trajectories of these variables that satisfy the constraints viability theory vt has been successfully used to determine sustainable policies in the management of ecosystems and renewable resources e g fisheries and forests see oubraham and zaccour 2018 for a literature review in the specific context of farming and agroecological systems most applications of vt dealt with herd and grassland management problems farming land uses and land use related biodiversity see e g tichit et al 2004 sabatier et al 2010 2012 mouysset et al 2013 tichit et al 2007 baumgärtner and quaas 2009 martin et al 2011 sabatier et al 2015 durand et al 2017 very few have addressed soil quality management problems durand et al 2017 proposed a deterministic model describing the evolution of a single land parcel and looked for agricultural strategies and crop planting sequences that restore soil quality to an acceptable level while preserving the farm s economic profitability oubraham et al 2020 extended the model to a stochastic environment to account for major climatic events that affect the evolution of the dynamical system describing the farm s state in this paper we extend the deterministic model in durand et al 2017 to a multi parcel case to assess the potential advantages of a multi crop strategy our empirical study concerns the archipelago of guadeloupe located in the french west indies it is well established that soil has been poorly protected and overexploited for decades which has resulted in its deterioration worldwide see fig 1 one of the most important human induced factors in soil s deterioration is modern agriculture indeed to meet the ever growing demand agronomic systems have had to drastically change during the last decades and have migrated to agricultural practices based on the chemical fertilization of soil and intensive and specialized farming practices this has increased soil productivity in the short term but in the long term has caused serious ecological drawbacks degradation of soil quality pollution of water and air loss of biodiversity erosion etc and even reversed the trend of agricultural productivity in contrast to traditional agricultural systems based on natural fertilization and diversified crop production modern agriculture relies on intensive single crop production that progressively degrades soil quality and reduces its productivity by changing its physical chemical and biological composition fertilization and irrigation with low quality water unbalance the chemical composition of the soil plowing tillage removal of vegetative cover and overgrazing make it more vulnerable to wind and water erosion intensive and specialized cultivation leaches minerals and water from it and damages its microfauna blanco and lal 2010 in fact modern agricultural systems have now fallen into a vicious cycle where the use of chemical fertilizers is increased to compensate for the loss of productivity causing more damage to the soil and more water and air pollution fao fao 2021 kellner et al 2011 roesch et al 2017 given the state of affairs just described it is urgent to take action to replace current agricultural practices with more ecoresponsible ones based on crop rotation and mixed crop livestock associations which are healthier for the soil we need to establish an agroecological transition that would in the medium term allow a return to more environmentally friendly agricultural practices and restore soil quality to an acceptable level while taking into account the socioeconomic aspects of that sector this is particularly true for island regions given the importance of agriculture in their economies angeon et al 2015 a survey of farmers in the french west indies revealed that the population is aware of the problem and that farmers are now placing soil quality at the center of their concerns and are willing to make efforts and even to sacrifice some of their financial benefits to restore the quality of their land angeon et al 2013 in our study we consider a series of cases representing different farming systems practiced in the french west indies then we analyze the impact of each one of these cases on the soil quality and the economic well being of the farmer also we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on the results of main parameters namely initial soil quality planning horizon and various costs our contribution is threefold first to the best of our knowledge our paper is the first one to consider a multi parcel land in the viability framework to analyze a soil quality restoration problem clearly such a framework provides additional flexibility in the search for sustainable ecological and economical solutions second extending the single parcel model in durand et al 2017 to multiple parcels adds a huge complexity in determining viable solutions in this paper we design an algorithmic approach that is not only drastically novel with respect to durand et al 2017 but also to the whole literature in viability theory we believe that this approach could be helpful in other applications of viability theory finally we contribute empirically by answering questions that are on the agenda of farmers and decision makers in the french west indies our results show that parcelization of land of a given area is always beneficial even if there is no physical or spacial interaction between the parcels the intuition behind this result is as follows having a multi parcel land allows to split the restoration effort over time between the different parcels for instance one can mix fallow on some parcels while the other parcels continue generating revenues needed by the farmer in fact parcelization enlarges the set of feasible controls to satisfy the farm s constraints we also find that the benefits of parcelization depend on some parameter values e g the duration of the planning horizon and available crops the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we extend the single parcel model in durand et al 2017 to multiple parcels in section 3 we present the approach for obtaining viable solutions in section 4 we present our empirical results and we briefly conclude in section 5 2 a multi parcel bioeconomic model in this section we extend the model in durand et al 2017 to a multi parcel piece of land consider a farm with n p land parcels managed over time by a single agent the planning horizon is t and the current time is denoted by τ t 0 t t δ where t δ is an extra time period by which the planning horizon can be extended to complete an ongoing agricultural cycle 1 1 to illustrate suppose that 59 months are left until the end of the time horizon and it is beneficial to plant a crop having a cycle length of 60 months then we allow this planting by extending the time horizon by 1 month to allow the completion of this cycle however we limit the time by which we can exceed the time horizon through the parameter t δ each parcel p 1 n p is characterized by its area α p in ha and its soil quality which is an agronomic measure evaluating a soil s quality is a complex operating involving a series of physical chemical and biological characteristics here we adopt the general indicator of soil quality gisq which have already been used in durand et al 2017 velásquez et al 2012 cécillon et al 2009 marichal et al 2014 and obriot et al 2016 among others the gisq has values in the interval 0 1 and is based on 54 variables measuring these characteristics velásquez et al 2007 camacho et al 2009 let i p be the gisq value of parcel p with i p ℐ i 0 i n i 1 2 2 i 0 0 and i n i 1 1 that is i can take a finite number of values the main variables describing the farm s state are i the cash flow treasury w r a continuous variable characterizing the financial situation and ii the soil quality of all its parcels i i 1 i n p the evolution of the soil quality of parcel p 1 n p depends on its current quality i p and the following two control variables i the crop σ p grown on the parcel with σ p σ p and ii the agricultural practice π p π p in the rest of the paper we consider the crop and practice possibilities to be the same for all parcels that is σ p σ σ 1 σ n σ and π p π π 1 π n π p 1 n p 3 3 differences within the choices sets can be due to geographical or physical variations between parcels for instance slope or wind exposure can make it impossible to grow certain crops and parcel accessibility can make it impossible to use some types of equipment to clarify in the case studies to follow the set of crops includes either all or some of the following crop types plantain export banana sugar cane yam yellow yam grosse caille tomato eggplant lettuce carrot green bean cabbage cassava melon cucumber and turban squash the set of agricultural practices only includes two elements i e conventional or agroecological practices let the evolution of the soil quality on one land parcel be described by the following function ϕ ℐ σ π i i σ π ϕ i σ π this is a discrete transition function that evolves at each change of the crop the function ϕ used in our application is defined in eq 13 in appendix e 1 2 the revenue from each harvest on that land parcel depends on the crop and the agricultural practice as well as on the soil quality at the beginning of the cycle formally the revenue function ℓ is defined by ℓ ℐ σ π r i σ π ℓ i σ π denote by δ σ π the duration of the whole agricultural cycle of a crop σ using agricultural practice π then to each pair σ π we can associate production cycle ψ defined as follows ψ σ π 0 δ σ π σ π ψ σ π moreover to each crop and practice σ π we associate its first harvest time f c σ π and the amount of time between two successive harvests p c σ π the duration of the first harvest is f c σ π and the following harvests last p c σ π 4 4 these parameters are used to capture the fact that most of the harvest crops take a certain time to grow time from the moment they were sown or planted to their first harvest this is the first harvest time and then gives yield on a regular basis time between successive harvests this distinction is needed for a precise calculation of the farm s treasury over time if a crop only has a single harvest then f c σ π δ σ π and p c σ π 0 for example the plantain banana produces multiple harvests with an agricultural cycle duration of 60 months the first harvest can be made 6 months after the crop is planted f c 6 after that a harvest takes place every 3 months p c 3 until the crop s life cycle ends lettuce on the other hand produces only one harvest that takes place at the end of its whole agricultural cycle i e 2 months after it is planted f c δ 2 and p c 0 also we suppose that the produce is sold immediately after the harvest denote by s s 1 12 the current month this discrete variable is needed to deal with the seasonality of crops that can be planted or sown only at specific times of the year let σ s σ be the set of all crops that can be planted or sown during season s in the single parcel case studied in durand et al 2017 the only event that must be accounted for over time is the beginning end of a production cycle if we refer by n to a step a state change and by τ n to its timing then the next step will happen at 1 τ n 1 τ n ψ σ π this formulation does not hold when we have multiple parcels as each one has its own crop sequence and agricultural practice this implies that at any time there are as many production cycles independent simultaneous and potentially of different durations as there are parcels in the farm and the next evolution of the system should coincide with the nearest event on the parcels consequently 1 needs to be modified to account for such events to do so we introduce the following new variables e p p 1 n p the remaining time before the next event on parcel p 1 n p ε min p 1 n p e p the remaining time before the next change in the system s state the remaining time before the nearest event on the parcels denote by e the vector of events e e 1 e n p ε let a p n be the age of the crop on parcel p at step n and b p n the state of the soil at the beginning of the agricultural

the soil when it was planted b n the agricultural practice π n and the time elapsed since the last event ε n the cash flow of the farm is updated at each step n we suppose here that the earning

farm by accumulating at each step the earnings generated by the parcels where a production cycle has ended 2 2 a viability problem when choosing crops and agricultural practices on the different parcels the farmer seeks to achieve the following two objectives 1 ensuring an acceptable amount of income throughout the whole planning horizon 2 restoring the quality of the soil to a desired level by the terminal date of the planning horizon the first objective is economic and can clearly take different forms depending on how one defines acceptable income one practical option is to define a minimum threshold w m i n below which cash flow should not fall at any step consequently we have the following admissible set 3 k i w e s τ τ t w w m i n 0 in the numerical applications we set w m i n 0 and then require a nonnegative treasury w over time the second objective is bioecological and embeds the long term concern to maintain the resource land in an acceptable state for instance the objective may consist in restoring the quality of all farm parcels to a certain desired level i by the end of the time horizon this can then be translated into a target to reach within a prescribed timeframe i e 4 c i 1 i n p w e s τ τ t i p i p 1 n p restoring the quality of all parcels to a desired level may be too ambitious in some situations especially when the initial quality of each parcel varies greatly and when the time horizon is not long enough in such cases one can adopt a less demanding target to improve the quality of all parcels by a certain level percentage d the target set is then defined as follows 5 c d i 1 i n p w e s τ τ t i p min d 100 i p 0 1 p 1 n p finding the controls that satisfy some constraints taking into account the evolution of the dynamical system can be framed as a viability problem more specifically we aim to determine the initial states x 0 i 1 0 i n p 0 w 0 e 0 s 0 τ 0 of system f for which there exists at least one viable evolution i e one that remains in k 3 during the entire planning horizon and reaches the target c 4 or c d 5 at the end of that time horizon this set is the viability kernel and is formally defined as follows 6 k e r f k c x 0 k x s t x 0 x 0 t 0 s t x t c n 0 t x n k 3 solution method to compute the viability kernel defined in 6 we exploit the following property established in proposition 1 and corollary 1 if it is possible not possible to reach the target with a certain initial treasury then it is possible not possible to reach it with a higher lower treasury as τ 0 0 s 0 1 and e 0 0 are given data we can characterize any initial state x 0 only by i 0 i 1 0 i n p 0 and w 0 values and write x 0 i 0 w 0 proposition 1 let i w be an initial state from the viability kernel k e r f k c then any initial state i w with w w belongs to k e r f k c formally i w k e r f k c i w k e r f k c w w proof let b x i be the minimum budget needed for the evolution x to be viable i e b x i min w x 0 i w t 0 s t x t c n 0 t x n k we have i w k e r f k c x s t b x i w therefore w w b x i w and consequently i w k e r f k c corollary 1 if it is not possible to reach the target from an initial state i w then it is not possible to reach it with less initial treasury i w k e r f k c i w k e r f k c w w the results in proposition 1 and corollary 1 imply that in order to completely characterize the viability kernel it is sufficient to identify its border or in other words to find for each initial gisq vector i the minimum initial treasury w i n f i needed for the restoration i e w i n f i inf i w k e r f k c w min x b x i therefore the problem amounts to finding a viable evolution of the system x with the minimum possible restoration budget b x i this problem can be formulated as a shortest path problem where the objective is to minimize the restoration budget and which can be solved by mixed integer programming mip since the problem of finding the minimum initial treasury needed for the restoration of a soil s quality from i to i can be formulated as a mip and consequently by solving such a mip for every possible initial gisq i we identify the border of the viability kernel and this allows us to completely characterize the viability kernel following the conclusion driven from proposition 1 and corollary 1 in appendix a we introduce the network describing the system and the mip modeling we use cplex software with a column generation approach to solve the mip 4 numerical results and discussion in this section we illustrate our model and the solution approach with a series of farming systems to which we will refer as cases table 1 lists the crops considered in these cases each crop can be used with either a conventional or an agroecological practice also farmers can choose to leave their land fallow coupled with an agroecological practice short fallow and free long fallow or a conventional practice improved short fallow and improved long fallow each of the listed cases represents a type of farming system practiced in the french west indies the export sector is specialized in banana and sugar cane cases c1 and c2 the local market oriented sector is based on diversified vegetable farming c3 and c4 and finally c5 is a theoretical case that combines all the crops in order to analyze the effect of each parameter the computations have been made for different parcels areas initial gisq levels and time horizons we always require that the farm remain self sufficient i e we set the economic constraint to 0 w m i n 0 and we impose that the retained solution s allow for a positive treasury all the case studies concern the archipelago of guadeloupe for the common elements we use the data and parameter values in durand et al 2017 and oubraham et al 2020 the other required data and parameter values have been estimated and are displayed in appendix e for the executions we considered two cases regarding the number of parcels the single parcel case where the whole land is considered one parcel over which the farmer should apply one control at a time and the multi parcel case where the land is divided into two independent parcels on which the farmer can apply different controls to have comprehensive comparisons we impose that the total area in the multi parcel case equal the area in the single parcel one in the executions we considered a 3 ha parcel in the single parcel case and two parcels of 1 ha and 2 ha respectively in the multi parcel case with the same initial gisq the rest of the section is divided into two parts in the first section 4 1 we focus on the viability kernel and the minimum restoration budgets in particular we analyze the impact of the time horizon in section 4 1 1 the impact of the initial gisq in section 4 1 2 and the impact of crop diversification in section 4 1 3 in the second part section 4 2 we look at viable evolutions more specifically we discuss the main characteristics of such evolutions and how they are affected by such features as time horizon and gisq improvement level 4 1 the viability kernels denote by k e r c i t i n the viability kernel of case i for a time horizon t in years with i being the gisq target and n the number of parcels it represents the set of all pairs of initial gisq i 0 and budget initial treasury that make it possible to reach the target while respecting the imposed constraints in fig 2 each panel represents a superposition of viability kernels of the same problem case for different time horizons with one or two parcels each color represents a particular time horizon the ones with the dark dotted borders represent the two parcels setting whereas the ones with light solid border represents the single parcel one 5 5 since the figure shows a superposition of different viability kernels we chose to represent them in transparency in order to be able to see the borders of the kernels underneath this transparency along with the superposition of kernels might slightly change the colors so we used solid and dotted borders to distinguish them areas whose borders are solid represent the single parcel setting and those with the dotted borders represent the multi parcel one in all cases and for all time horizons the viability kernel with a single parcel is always included in the two parcel case that is k e r c i t i 1 k e r c i t i 2 this result can be generalized to any number of parcels formally we have k e r c i t i n 1 k e r c i t i n 2 n 1 n 2 the reason for the above inclusion is as follows first we note that splitting the land into multiple parcels does not involve any additional costs second let us suppose that the farm is managed as a single parcel and identify a viable policy clearly this policy can be applied to a multi parcel farm by repeating on each parcel the single parcel solution assuming of course that the single parcel is of the same size as the sum of parcels and have the same characteristics in terms of location soil quality etc put differently by enlarging the set of feasible solutions parcelization only brings additional benefits and no incremental cost therefore the minimum restoration budget in the multi parcel case will be at most equal to the one in the single parcel case now the size of the benefits induced by parcelization depends on the parameter values e g the time horizon the initial gisq value and the crops available which are considered in the next subsections 4 1 1 impact of the time horizon fig 2 shows the viability kernels for different planning horizons 40 20 10 and 5 years in all cases and for any number of parcels the viability kernels shrink and slide to the right as the time horizon gets shorter this indicates that the shorter time is the more difficult and expensive it gets to restore soil quality further restoring soil with a very low initial quality to a given desired level may be impossible to achieve intuitively one expects the cost of soil restoration to be higher when the horizon is shorter this is observed in the results but not when the initial gisq is very close to the target or is higher than the target indeed in case c1 the kernel s border for t 5 is lower than that for t 10 similarly in cases c2 and c4 the borders of the kernels for t 5 and t 10 are below that at t 20 with a single parcel and in case c3 the frontier of the kernel for t 5 is lower than those for t 10 and t 20 one explanation is that when the difference in initial and target values of the gisq is large it requires a significant effort to improve the gisq and this is more difficult and pricy when the time horizon is short however when we start from a gisq that is sufficiently close to or greater than the target the effort is not to improve the gisq but to maintain it over time maintaining the gisq at a certain level over a short period of time is easier and cheaper than doing so over a long period further we notice that the gap between the viability kernel of the single parcel case and the multi parcel case gets bigger as the time horizon expands to obtain some insight into this result consider fig 3 which represents the minimum budget needed for the restoration of soil with initial gisq of 0 6 to a gisq target of 0 8 for various planning horizons the solid lines represent the budgets for the multi parcel case whereas the dotted lines show those for the single parcel case fig 3 shows that in all cases and for any number of parcels the restoration budget first decreases with t and next stabilizes when the time horizon reaches a certain value moreover the restoration budget in the multi parcel case is always less than or equal to the budget in the single parcel case confirming the result established previously with the gap widening with the time horizon until it stabilizes after a certain value of time horizon this result indicates that having multiple parcels never increases the restoration costs with the benefits being larger when the time horizon is longer to wrap up for each initial data set problem case and initial and target gisq we can determine a threshold terminal date after which the benefits of having multiple parcels are significant note that we assumed away any additional costs e g management fees induced by dividing a land into parcels if such costs have to be paid then the threshold will be farther away in terms of computation effort finding a solution in a single parcel setting is much easier and faster than in the multi parcel scenario 4 1 2 impact of the initial gisq fig 4 displays the evolution of the total cost of a gisq improvement by 0 2 for various initial gisq values for all cases in a single parcel setting dotted lines and in a multi parcel setting solid lines with t 40 years the cost of improving the soil quality by given level depends on the initial gisq value fig 4 shows that in general the cost is lower when the initial gisq is higher the reason is that a crop planted in higher quality soil generates a higher income consequently a lower minimum budget is needed as the income covers a larger portion of the operating costs however we observe a different behavior for gisq values close to 0 and 1 for instance in cases c1 and c4 the restoration cost curve is increasing near initial the gisq values of 0 and 1 for a single parcel this result is even more visible in the representations of the viability kernels of cases c1 and c3 in fig 2 where we observe that the costs increase a little for certain values of the initial gisq close to 0 before decreasing one explanation is that when the gisq is too low the degradation caused by a crop or a harmful agricultural practice cannot be too high on the other hand starting with a soil of medium quality leaves room for improvements that exceed the target in anticipation of future damage caused by more profitable crops however if the initial gisq is too high then such an opportunity is not available which increases the restoration cost in some cases to illustrate the above findings we report in fig 5 the evolution in gisq induced by the same control sequence starting from different initial gisq values 0 0 in orange 0 3 in blue 0 5 in gray and 0 7 in green over 480 months we can see that this strategy leads to a 0 3 improvement in the gisq from 0 3 to 0 6 and from 0 5 to 0 8 when starting from an average initial gisq level 0 3 and 0 5 however if we start from a higher initial gisq level 0 7 the improvement is only 0 23 units from 0 7 to 9 3 on the other hand the same strategy is more efficient when the initial gisq is lowest indeed here the improvement is equal to 0 37 units from 0 0 to 0 37 finally we note that when the initial gisq is low the gisq values over time can exceed the target which provides a buffer against possible future degradation finally we note that the results are independent of the number of parcels as no significant difference is observed between single and multiple parcels moreover the cost gap between the single parcel and multi parcel settings is more or less the same regardless of the initial gisq therefore the benefits of having multiple parcels are invariable with respect to the initial gisq level 4 1 3 impact of crop diversification from figs 2 3 and 4 we observe that the viability kernel of a case with fewer crop options is always included in any viability kernel corresponding to a scenario with more crops that is if the set of possible controls u i in case c i is included in the set u j in case c j then the viability kernel of c i is contained in that of c j for any planning horizon i e u i u j k e r c i t i n k e r c j t i n t and n furthermore fig 4 indicates that the restoration budget in a case with a larger number of crops is at most equal to the budget for a lower number of crops formally u i u j b u d g e t c i t i n b u d g e t c j t i n t and n in fact adding a control can only help in meeting the objective however adding new crops to the set of possible controls does not necessarily enlarge the viability kernel or decrease the restoration budget indeed if the initial set already contains the right mix of crops adding new crops will certainly not deteriorate the solution but will not improve it either for example in almost all instances the performance of c5 is identical to that of c4 even if it has more crop choices finally figs 4 and 3 reveal that the lower is the number of crops the more beneficial is the use of multiple parcels indeed if we define by g a p i the gap between the solid and dotted lines in case c i then we clearly have u i u j g a p i g a p j for instance the gap between the red solid and dotted lines in these figures representing case c1 is larger than the gap between the blue solid and dotted lines representing problem case c2 which contains more crops the intuition behind this result is that when the number of crops is low there is no much room for crop diversification in the single parcel setting and thus splitting the land into multiple parcels brings an important reduction of the restoration budget whereas more crop choices already brings a significative improvement in the single parcel setting through crop diversification so the budget reduction brought by switching to a multi parcel setting is less important therefore the advantages of opting for a multi parcel setting are much more noticeable when the number of crops is small than when it is large 4 2 viable evolutions in this section we present the viable solutions with a minimum initial budget that lie on the boundary of the viability kernels figs 6 7 8 and 9 display the solutions for cases c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively for a single parcel and for multiple parcels the time horizon is t 40 480 months the initial gisq is i 0 0 6 and the gisq target is i 0 8 the upper part of each figure shows the treasury and gisq evolutions over time and the lower part displays the crop recommendations a first result is that in almost all cases the initial treasury i e the restoration budget is lower and the final treasury significantly higher for multiple parcels then for the corresponding values for a single parcel also in most cases the gisq evolution for one of the multiple parcels is quite similar to the one obtained for a single parcel in terms of gisq trajectories we often observe that the gisq of at least one of the parcels in a multiple parcel scenario exceeds the target value at some intermediate date before decreasing towards the target value at terminal date t in the single parcel case we see the opposite behavior that is in most cases the gisq level first drops and then increases towards the target value at t when the farm is a single parcel then the whole land is initially used to boost the treasury needed for the soil restoration before investing the accumulated amount to reach the gisq target similarly to what emerges from the land sparing vs sharing debate in the biodiversity protection context green et al 2005 in the multi parcel setting the farmer can dedicate one parcel to generate revenues while the other parcel is restored a portfolio of assets parcels allows for more flexibility than a single asset finally we make the following remarks on the viable evolutions and the effect of some parameters crop recommendations in all viable evolutions there is a prevalence of fallow as a recommended control this is mainly due to two reasons the first one is ecological fallow is very efficient in improving the soil quality contrary to most agricultural crops that reduce the soil quality except for some crops when associated with the right agricultural practice so fallow is suitable to enhance the soil quality and brings it to the minimum desired level the second reason is economical and results from the fact that the solutions lie on the boundary of the viability kernel once the minimum gisq target is reached even if investing a bit more could make it possible to obtain a higher revenue the returned solution remains the one with the minimum budget as the cheapest option is to fallow this is most likely solution to be chosen however we notice that in the multi parcel setting more controls other than fallow are recommended this result is due to the above mentioned flexibility of parcelization time horizon when the time horizon is short fallow becomes the prevalent recommended control except when the initial gisq is very close to or higher than the target gisq further the recommended controls for both parcels in the multi parcel setting are almost the same as the ones for a single parcel as the time horizon gets longer more non fallow controls are recommended and the differences between the two scenarios multiple parcels and one parcel become more pronounced level of improvement increasing the level of improvement in the gisq has two main effects first it calls for a more frequent implementation of fallow controls second the differences between the two scenarios one and multiple parcels are less visible the reason for this is that a small level of improvement in the gisq requires less effort and time to achieve leaving more possible paths open to achieve it and more time to improve the treasury however a higher level of improvement considerably reduces the number of possible paths to achieve that improvement generally only paths involving many fallow periods are left which makes the recommendations in both settings quite similar the initial budget being high and the final treasury low 5 conclusion the main qualitative results obtained in our study are as follows 1 the export oriented sector cases c1 and c2 is globally more sensitive to the number of parcels the local market oriented sector also benefits from parcelization but the gap between the results for one and two parcels is larger in the export oriented sector 2 having multiple parcels leads to better results than having one parcel in all cases however the benefit is only noticeable when the time horizon is long enough 3 parcelization s benefits are higher when the number of crop choices is lower 4 if we take into consideration the final treasury generated the multi parcel setting is globally much better than the single parcel one although we are not optimizing a specific performance index in this study and in viability theory in general this result can be used as a guideline for making a choice even if there is no physical or spacial interaction between the parcels they are still interacting at the economic level this interaction alone induces all the advantages brought by the use of multiple parcels this follows directly from the conflicting nature of the economic and ecologic constraints objectives indeed the controls that improve the soil s quality are costly and generate low income whereas those that generate a greater income are harmful to the soil thus having a multi parcel land allows to split the restoration effort over time by alternating the focus on the ecological and economic aspects on the different parcels instead of providing enough monetary resources for the restoration of the entire land having multi plots allows the use of one portion of the land some parcels to improve the economic state of the farm by favoring productive crops with conventional practices while restoring the other portion of a land by mainly favoring fallow and some less harmful crops with agroecological practices which reduces the initial budget needed for restoration at the same time this also explains the fact that the benefits of multi parcel are only noticeable when the horizon is sufficiently long note that even if the results are based on a particular choice of crops they confirm the intuition that alternating fallow between two plots can be beneficial and more profitable moreover these calculations open up the possibility of using other more judicious crop choices rather than fallow indeed intuition may help predict that parcelization would be advantageous but it does not allow for any conclusions regarding what crop sequence or alternation would be better future developments include collecting additional data and refining the estimations in particular the additional costs generated by parcelization management fees for example and other agricultural aspects like the effects of monoculture a second extension would be to run executions on different cutouts of the land varying the number of parcels and their areas finally it would be interesting and challenging to take into consideration uncertainties

its time t v p t its gisq i v p i its control u v p u σ v p π v p σ π its type e v p e α β γ s n t n where α start of an agricultural cycle start of the first production cycle β intermediate harvest

by their control they are common to all cycles ending at the same time with the same gisq the source and sink nodes are particular vertices that do not have any of the characteristics of the other vertices a p is the set of arcs each arc a i j p a p links the vertex v i p v p to v j p v p and has the following characteristics b i j p t 1 t 2 cost on arc a i j p a p over the time period t 1 t 2

incoming and outgoing arcs step 1 ensures that the evolution of a parcel starts at the beginning of an agricultural cycle at time t 0 with initial gisq i p 0 steps 2 and 3 build the network forward to include all the possible evolutions of the parcel viable and nonviable conditions c1 c3 ensure the proper functioning of the process a transition from an agricultural cycle start vertex of type α goes to an intermediate harvest vertex of type β if the crop has multiple harvests or to a cycle end vertex of type γ if the control has a single harvest see conditions c1 and c2 if it is the final harvest the transition from an intermediate harvest node goes to a cycle end otherwise the transition is to another intermediate harvest node see conditions c3 and c4 finally at the end of a production cycle if the time horizon is reached then the process stops otherwise a transition to any cycle start is possible provided that the crop can be planted at that point and that the remaining time including the extension time t δ is sufficient to complete the new production cycle to illustrate the network building process we consider a simple example of a parcel with an initial gisq of 0 5 and a time

are represented on a grid where the columns represent time and the rows the gisq thus representing a vertex v at the intersection of column t and row i means that i v i and t v t vertices of type α start of an agricultural cycle are represented by circles those of type β intermediate harvests are represented by triangles and finally those of type γ end of an agricultural cycle are represented by squares orange if the time horizon is reached and gray otherwise we use the color red to represent the control u 1 and green to represent the control u 2 fig 10 displays the result of applying steps 1 to 3 of the network building process the first vertices one for control u 1 and one for control u 2 are located at t 0 and gisq i 0 0 5 and they represent agricultural cycle starts type α the node of

a cycle end vertex two time units later and deteriorates the gisq by 0 1 all the cycle end vertices that did not reach the time horizon transit to cycle start vertices of both controls u 1 and u 2 with no change in time or gisq the only exceptions are for times t 6 t 7 and t 11 because u 1 cannot be planted in seasons s 6 7 or s 7 8 and the remaining time horizon at t 11 is not sufficient to grow control u 1 t δ u 1 11 3 14 13 t t δ 12 1 fig 11 displays the result of applying step 4 the source node is linked to the vertices of t 0 and the end nodes that reached the target t t and g i s q

24427,agriculture is an important sector of the moroccan economy employing a huge portion of the moroccan population and contributing about 14 20 to the country s gdp unfortunately agricultural production in morocco is impacted by climatic non climatic biophysical and non biophysical stressors researchers have employed various crop models to understand how different crops respond to different environmental conditions such as temperature precipitation soil properties fertilization and irrigation unfortunately there are no studies that provide a summary and a holistic perspective of the most frequently used models and their calibration inputs in morocco this work therefore seeks to fill these knowledge gaps by providing a summary of the most calibrated crop models their calibration input data the most frequently studied crops how the studies are published peer review or grey literature and the affiliations of the lead authors this is achieved through a systematic review of the primary peer review and grey literature a total of 68 relevant peer review and grey literature papers were considered the results show that most of the authors are affiliated with moroccan universities organizations while wheat is the most studied crop in addition the aquacrop and the regression based models are the most used crop models additionally most of the models are calibrated in order of importance with variables such as temperature precipitation soil properties irrigation and fertilizers on the other hand there is an observed increase in the use of non climatic indicators such as poverty farm income and literacy levels to fit empirical models it is still unclear how process based models will integrate socio economic indicators this work has implications for future research as it provides a holistic picture of the key models that are currently used and their calibration this information can be used by other projects to select methods to use and crops to study based on the available data when working on crop models in morocco and north africa these results underscore the leading role in research funding offered by the government of morocco and other organizations such as um6p and ocp africa in research valorization in morocco and africa keywords agriculture wheat crop models peer reviewed grey literature morocco 1 introduction the veracity of global warming is unequivocal mainly due to the persistent anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases ghgs in the earth s atmosphere ipcc 2022 the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change report released at the end of february 2022 observes that even if climate warming is limited to the 1 5 c pathway the effects are likely to be daunting as environmental systems are likely to continue to be vulnerable and this will be reflected in persistent droughts floods extreme events inter alia ipcc 2022 if global warming transiently exceeds 1 5 c during the next decade or later overshoots many human and natural systems will be at risk of additional severe risks when compared to warming below 1 5 c agrawal et al 2015 ipcc 2022 also depending on the duration and magnitude of the overshoot some impacts will cause additional ghg emissions ipcc 2022 all the predictions show that for most of north africa temperatures will continue to rise at 1 5 c 2 c and 4 c projections while precipitation will continue to decline under these projections ipcc 2022 morocco is situated on the north western edge of the african continent located within latitudes 21 n and 36 n and longitudes 1 w and 17 w the country has a total surface area of about 711 000 km2 which includes about 2 934 km of atlantic coastline and about 512 km of coastline along the mediterranean sea according to 2022 projections morocco has a population of about 37 686 472 people world population review wpr 2022 morocco is characterized by a varied topography which includes mountains plateaux plains oasis and saharan dunes its topography is partly responsible for the country s diverse climate characterized by high inter and intra annual precipitation variability the climate is further characterized by irregular precipitation and rising temperatures which have devastating impacts on agriculture in the atlas mountains and the mediterranean coast of morocco observations of a decline in the amount of rainfall received in winter and spring have been recorded there were more than 330 dry days with less than 1 mm of precipitation daily for the period 1997 to 2007 niang et al 2014 benkenstein 2017 according to pala 2012 the mean annual rainfall in morocco declines from 600 mm in the northwest of the country to 250 mm in the south of the country that is the western sahara in morocco the agricultural sector is very important as it contributes about 14 20 to the country s gdp and represents 43 of all employment and 78 of employment in rural areas saidi diouri 2017 unfortunately more than 80 of arable lands in the country are located within semi arid and arid areas and only about 15 of the land is irrigated saidi diouri 2017 in morocco traditional agriculture is made of small rainfed farms which cultivate essentially cereals legumes and livestock smallholder farmers carry out cultivation that is highly driven by annual rainfall and the economic benefits of the agricultural sector therefore rainfall deficits have a strong impact on the economy of morocco saidi diouri 2017 on the other hand market agriculture is centered on irrigation and represents only about 15 of agricultural land the latter contributes about 45 to the gdp and 75 to agricultural export earnings overall moroccan agriculture consists of mixed and integrated livestock and crop systems representing the main source of income for rural households most range and arable lands receive less than 400 mm of rainfall bregaglio et al 2015 within this cereals and ruminants such as sheep are an integral part of the production systems saidi diouri 2017 despite morocco s rich agricultural potential it faces unmeasured yield and growing season rainfall gaps in key crops such as wheat barley and maize payne 1986 observed crop yields for these crops often fall short of the projected estimates pala et al 2012 bregaglio et al 2015 achli et al 2022 these gaps are judged by huge food imports under the green morocco plan gmp and are expected to continue under the gmp s next phase the generation green strategy saidi diouri 2017 the latter s replacement with the generation green strategy heralds implications for food security through a better understanding of the interplay between varying drivers such as climate crop nutrient deficiency and water management payne 1986 achli et al 2022 however these gaps have not been estimated for most of these crops and there is a lack of understanding of the most calibrated crop models as a result of these uncertainties this work aims at contributing to knowledge by performing a systematic review of the peer reviewed and grey literature to identify the various process based and empirical crop models that have been used in estimating yield gaps in addition the work aims at highlighting the most studied crops the affiliations of the lead authors and the commonly used calibration variables this approach will provide an understanding of the most used models their calibration input data whether they are published in both peer review or grey literature and the affiliations of lead authors as well as the key crops covered by such studies this work is therefore unique in that it provides a holistic snapshot of crop models in morocco that no single study has been able to offer this work will be a reference point for scholars researchers and other stakeholders wishing to test the response of various crops to different environmental conditions based on process based and or empirical crop models at a catchment area scale and a national scale by having a good knowledge of what already exists it becomes easier to define research paths for the future it will save researchers time by serving as a glossary of the most frequently used crop models in morocco this approach is relevant as it fills a major knowledge gap in crop models likely relevant thematic of the green moroccan plan gmp and its replacement for the next decade the generation green strategy and therefore constitutes part of the national agricultural priorities established under the auspices of the gmp faysse 2015 the relevance of this work is further galvanized by the objective of the gmp which aims to position the development of the agricultural sector as a driving force for economic growth montanari bergh 2019 despite the fact that agricultural production of most african countries including morocco is dominated by smallholder farmers who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other stressors the lack of adequate and accurate yield rainfall and planting calendar data information to be able to adjust their planting dates to changes in the growing season rainfall continues to undermind food security prospects zhang et al 2016 the effects of these have been persistent crop yield gaps and crop failures access to such pertinent information will empower farmers in crop planting decision making regarding shifting planting dates based on the available data selecting higher yielding varieties and making irrigation and nutrient use decisions the pan moroccan yield and precipitation gaps project pamocpp contributes to enhancing the resilience of cropping systems in morocco through yield gap studies synthesis and information sharing at the grassroot level by providing a systematic review of all that has been researched so far this work sets the pace in fitting a puzzle in the general process of making cropping systems resilient by making it easier for this current and future research projects to identify crops models and input variables that can be used to calibrate future models and make improvements 2 methods 2 1 systematic crop model tracking approach systematic reviews provide a summary and assessment of the state of knowledge on a topic or research question and rigorously summarize existing knowledge systematic reviews differ from traditional scoping literature reviews in several ways firstly a systematic review is based on clearly framed research questions secondly the systematic review approach outlines explicit methods and criteria to select relevant studies further the systematic review also includes providing information on the search terms used and the inclusion and exclusion criteria finally the systematic review approach easily subjects the collected database of studies to the use of qualitative and quantitative analysis ford and pearce 2010 this current systematic review is focused on the english and french peer review and grey literature documenting process based and empirical crop models used in morocco between 2000 and 2022 therefore this work serves as a proxy database for the country level crop models used in morocco this approach of including both peer review and grey literature in both languages helps to overcome the limitation of only using english peer review and grey literature and underscores this work as developing a general outline of crop models used in morocco the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting relevant articles in the peer reviewed and grey literature are listed in table 1 below the articles used in this work were acquired through scopus and google scholar search engines these search engines were used because they have been known to provide easy access to the primary peer review and grey literature on crop models and ensure wide coverage of crop models the articles considered were searched based on the following terms crop models in morocco empirical crop models in morocco and process based crop models in morocco to enhance our search we used the names of various crop models and blended them into our search terms aquacrop epic dssat wofost cropsyst apsim ceres machine learning regression based models pearson correlation anova and vulnerability indexes fig 1 a total of 189 studies that are relevant to our stated criteria were selected from the initial search march 2022 manual screening of the titles of the remaining articles resulted in the removal of duplicates and more irrelevant papers the abstracts of the remaining papers were read in relation to the inclusion criteria from which a final count of relevant papers was obtained a final count of 68 relevant studies 47 process based crop models table 1 and 21 empirical crop models table 2 see supplementary materials for all the 68 studies were selected for a more detailed review and were imported into endnote to ensure that we are not missing any relevant studies we conducted ground truthing using the web of science over morocco and searched for relevant peer review and grey literature profiling crop models in morocco and did a more detailed search of the peer reviewed and grey literature to verify if our database was missing any relevant studies this process resulted in no new relevant studies that matched our inclusion criteria 2 2 data analysis the more detailed analysis of each paper included was based on the following specific research questions that constitute the coding scheme in what year was the paper published is the paper peer reviewed or grey what is the country of affiliation of the lead author what specific crop models does the paper use what crop types does the paper focus on and what variables are used to calibrate the model this coding scheme is like those used in previous systematic review studies by lesnikowski et al 2013 berrang ford et al 2014 austin et al 2015 ford et al 2015 araos et al 2016a 2016 labbe et al 2017 studies reporting the use of several crops and several crop models and calibration inputs were included it is for this reason that even though there were 68 relevant studies the frequencies of most of the responses obtained exceeded 68 because some studies treated more than one model and more than one crop from these the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to identify major trends descriptive statistics frequencies and percentages were then used to establish the dominant trends all calculations were done in excel and spss while arc map 14 was used to spatially represent the spatial distribution of the affiliations of the lead authors for a summary of the methodology see fig 1 below 3 results 3 1 study types and affiliations of lead authors from this systematic review a total of 68 relevant studies were collected and analyzed fig 1 this number is based on all crop model studies from the peer review and grey literature published between 2000 and 2022 in terms of distribution 47 69 12 and 21 30 88 of these studies were process based and empirically based crop model studies respectively fig 2 from these results it is evident that most crop model studies in morocco use process based models process based crop models exceed empirical based crop models by 26 38 25 in terms of affiliations of the 47 process based crop model studies 25 53 2 were from authors who are affiliated with moroccan institutions this is represented in green on the map fig 3 a further 4 8 6 of the authors who published using process based crop models were from france and italy which is represented by brown on the map fig 3a switzerland the usa and syria each recorded 2 4 3 blue on the map while egypt tunisia china netherlands belgium and australia recorded 1 2 3 of process based crop model studies in morocco fig 3a yellow on the map it can be observed here that most of the authors who published process based crop model studies in morocco are affiliated with moroccan institutions regarding the use of empirical crop models 17 80 of the 21 studies collected have their lead authors affiliated with moroccan institutions represented by green on the map fig 3b france is second with 2 9 5 yellow on the map while netherland and the united kingdom record 1 4 8 dark green on the map fig 3b here also it is observed that a bigger proportion of the authors are affiliated with moroccan institutions 3 2 distribution of peer review and grey literature out of the 47 relevant empirical crop model studies included in this work 38 80 9 are peer review studies on the other hand 9 19 1 of the studies included were grey literature based studies fig 4 a these results show that a majority of the process based crop model studies in morocco have undergone standardization through the peer review process concerning the use of empirical crop models it has been found that of the 21 relevant studies 18 85 7 are peer review studies while 3 14 3 are grey literature based studies fig 4b just as with process based crop models most of the empirical model studies are peer reviewed in the context of the evolution of process based peer review and grey literature studies over time it can be observed that the year 2021 recorded the highest number of studies 5 7 4 while the years 2019 2017 and 2016 recorded 4 5 9 in 2013 3 4 4 studies were recorded fig 5 a in terms of process based grey literature crop models 2020 recorded 3 4 4 studies while 2014 recorded 2 2 9 fig 5a when peer review empirical crop models are considered it is observed that 6 8 8 studies were recorded in 2020 4 5 9 in 2021 and 2 2 9 in 2019 and 2018 fig 5b on the other hand grey literature based empirical crop models recorded 1 1 5 study in 2021 2020 and 2013 fig 5b these results show that there has been an increase in the number of studies with more recent years recording higher frequencies over the years 3 3 distribution of process based and empirical crop model studies this review has found that several process based crop models are used in morocco findings show that 14 key process based crop models are frequently used in morocco fig 6 a this work has also found that the most used process based crop model is the aquacrop model which records 20 the second most used model is cropsyst 14 followed by apsim 12 and epic 12 in terms of empirical crop models a total of 13 most used empirical crop models were identified fig 6a within this this work has also found that regression based empirical crop models scored the highest at about 21 7 followed by machine learning models which scored 17 4 three empirical models occupy the third position with a score of 8 7 these empirical crop models are pearson correlation data mining algorithms and modified penman fig 6b in terms of temporal variations this work has also found that the years 2013 and 2016 recorded the highest number of cropsyst and aquacrop related studies fig 7 a these models are closely followed by saltmed and the simple simulation models with studies published in 2015 and 2021 respectively in the context of empirical crop models machine learning techniques record the single highest number of publications in 2021 fig 7b furthermore critical point and regression based crop models recorded the second highest number of publications in the years 2003 and 2020 respectively fig 7b 3 4 key crops and input variables used in crop model calibration in the context of process based crop models the most studied crop in the scientific peer review and grey literature is wheat which recorded 33 70 2 sunflower and quinoa came second with frequencies of 4 5 9 each while maize recorded a frequency of 3 6 4 fig 8 a these results in the context of process based crop models underscore the prominence of wheat in morocco as an economic crop that sustains the livelihoods of several families these findings are consistent with those performed in the context of empirical crop models for example in terms of empirical crop models wheat recorded the highest frequency of 15 71 4 while barley and apple recorded low frequencies of 2 9 5 fig 8b the general observation that can be drawn from here is that much more emphasis has been placed on wheat in morocco because of its economic value in terms of process based crop model inputs the temperature recorded the highest occurrence or frequency of 38 80 9 while soil properties and precipitation recorded frequencies of 36 76 6 and 34 72 3 respectively management options such as irrigation and fertilization recorded frequencies of 9 19 1 fig 9 a these findings underscore the importance of climatic indicators such as temperature and precipitation in driving crop production in morocco as well as the role of soil properties and land management visibly absent in the calibration of process based models are socio economic drivers of yield the evidently play an important role in farm level decision making concerning empirical crop models the key variables or inputs are very consistent with those used in calibrating process based crop models for example in the context of empirical crop models temperature records the highest frequency of 17 80 9 followed by precipitation with a frequency of 12 57 1 irrigation and soil properties recorded frequencies of 4 19 0 fig 9b it is evident that for both process based and empirical crop models these variables are frequently used in calibration however an interesting observation of the empirical crop models is the fact that in addition to the integration of climatic and biophysical drivers other non climatic and non biophysical drivers such as demography poverty agricultural income and literacy are increasingly being used fig 9b table 3 4 discussion this work has found that of the 68 crop model studies published between 2000 and 2022 most of the studies are peer reviewed this huge proliferation of peer review papers over grey literature is an indication of the efforts by moroccan scholars to standardize research and increase its acceptability in fact this proliferation of peer reviewed studies is a good way of rendering knowledge acceptable through the peer review process which subjects any work to rigor and standardization the argument that peer review literature is considered standardized knowledge has been covered by several studies berrang ford et al 2015 lesnikowski et al 2016 epule et al 2017 despite the rigor with which peer review papers are categorized it is important to note that in many countries much work is being carried out by several non academic organizations which end up publishing a lot of grey literature it is for this reason that of the 68 publications used in this work 21 were grey literature reports this is a pointer that grey literature is increasingly becoming an important source of crop model information in morocco the increase in grey literature is an indication that this type of literature should not be entirely ignored but should be assessed with caution and included in most monitoring and policy related studies this approach has been successfully adopted in systematic reviews by several researchers e g lwasa et al 2015 furthermore this work has also found that in the context of types of crop models aquacrop is the most used process based crop model followed by cropsyst in terms of empirical crop models regression based and machine learning models are more frequently used the aquacrop for example is frequently used in morocco because it is designed to simulate yield in arid and semi arid environments in fact the aquacrop model is adequate for use in environments that experience water stress and just like cropsyst it integrates parameters such as yield precipitation temperature soil characteristics irrigation and fertilization akumaga et al 2017 in addition the aquacrop model for example already has background information on the biophysical conditions of the given environment in which the model will be tested this is vital because when integrating the effects of irrigation precipitation or soil texture the model considers the soil types and textures and their ability to hold moisture and enhance yields with the water table depth determined by the user montoya et al 2016 however the background information that is integrated into the model should be handled with caution and backed by the researcher s knowledge of the study area and this includes water table depth soil properties crops irrigation fertilizers precipitation and temperature khechba et al 2021 as the most dominantly used model aquacrop was developed by the fao due to the need to assess crop response to various environmental conditions the model operates on a daily time step and is suitable for catchment area scale crop simulations the model uses a relatively small number of parameters that are explicit and mostly intuitive and attempts at creating a balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness the objective of the model is to describe plant physiological processes and soil water budgeting with widely acceptable accuracy the key parameters used in the simulation include 1 the plant soil system 2 soil properties 3 soil management irrigation and fertilization 4 weather rainfall air temperature co2 evapotranspiration upper boundary of the model 5 the water table depth and how close it is to the sub soil lower boundary however the water table is not part of the model but the model users must define the depth of the water table which has implications for soil moisture retention aquacrop like other process based models has rendered crop modeling faster as simulations can be performed fast field experimentation on the other hand usually takes two to three years for the initial results to be obtained however aquacrop model can be calibrated and validated from the outputs of field experiments as concerns empirical crop models the most frequently used crop models have some unique advantages for their easy integration in morocco firstly regression based models are easy to implement and based on priorities the users can create the ideal environment for the simulation by selecting the right combination of dependent and independent variables the models also have functionalities that enable the users to overcome overfitting by regulation li 2015 ground truthing across other regions of africa has equally shown that in the context of empirical models regression based models are the most frequently used despite these advantages when using such methods attention should be placed on the effects of outliers and collinearity from several variables reinforcing each other li 2015 regression models on their part focus on the valorization of the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable the objective is often to explain which of the independent variables best explains the dependent variable in most cases yield is the dependent variable and the independent variables are precipitation temperature co2 soil moisture groundwater depth livestock fertilization and irrigation among others the right hand side of the equation is embedded with an error term as well as the slope and intercepts of the equation fig 10 in terms of authorship this work has shown that most studies on crop models in morocco are led by authors with moroccan affiliations this underscores the increasing investments in terms of funding and scholarships that the government and international organizations are currently placing at the disposal of moroccan researchers and students this observation is different from what obtains in other parts of africa such as west center and east africa where ground truthing has shown that most of the crop model based studies and projects are led by authors from other parts of the world france on the other hand is at the second level of crop model based studies in morocco the latter is tied to the colonial history and the existing collaborations between the two countries furthermore for both process based and empirical crop models wheat stands out as the most studied crop in morocco this finding is consistent with the national importance placed on the crop due to its economic value and livelihood sustenance in 2009 wheat stood as the most economically viable crop in morocco with net production of about 6 4 million mt and a market value of 1000 bishaw et al 2019 since 1982 several varieties of bread wheat 25 and durum wheat 34 have been registered in the national catalog along with other crops to its economic importance the government of morocco has greatly subsidized the production to reduce the cost of bread the per capita consumption of cereals in morocco is one of the highest in the world placing a significant role in wheat production in the framework of national food security lehmann et al 2020 this has rendered morocco one of the greatest wheat consuming countries in the world with about 225 kgs year per capita all these developments are encompassed in the plan maroc vert green morocco plan which aimed at the modernization of agriculture and enhancing the accessibility of agricultural inputs to farmers bishaw et al 2019 despite this effort it has been argued that most of the farm inputs and support provided under this program have not often reached smallholder farmers who are at the epicenter of wheat production in morocco lehmann et al 2020 also the plan has been criticized for not being able to ensure compliance as large scale farmers have often declared smaller portions of land in attempts at presenting themselves as smallholders thus puncturing the intentions of the plan hopefully the generation green strategy that replaces the gmp will fix some of these loopholes the importance of quinoa as an upcoming crop in morocco has been outlined in this work when compared with other grains like barley wheat and corn quinoa is far more resilient to drought it is also an important source of non animal protein so increasingly popular with the growing number of vegetarians and vegans around the world evidently the crop was introduced in morocco due to its resilience to the harsh arid and semi arid conditions on the other hand the calibration of most process based and empirical crop models in morocco is based on key model inputs such as precipitation temperature soil properties and soil management the role of climatic drivers on yield trends in morocco has long been established as many of the crops such as wheat are often precipitation dependent several studies have not only calibrated their models using climatic drivers as major inputs but have equally discussed the importance of climatic drivers in impacting crop yields in morocco several studies have underscroed the role of climate in driving crop yields in morocco e g badraoui et al 2011 jarlan et al 2014 bregaglio et al 2015 hirich et al 2016 ouraich et al 2019 bouras et al 2019 bouras et al 2021 achli et al 2022 however crop production is such a complex process and cannot be entirely attributed to one set of factors it is for this reason that most of the models used here also integrate variables such as soil properties aboutayeb et al 2020 moussadek et al 2014 bouasria et al 2021 due to climate change precipitation is not often sufficient for crop production due to problems with timing and distribution as such crop production has often been based on soil management and several studies have incorporated the irrigation parameter kharrou et al 2013 benabdelouahab et al 2016 oubelkacem et al 2020 as well as fertilization ryan et al 2009 mrabet et al 2012 ou zine et al 2021 it is therefore important to understand that crop production is complex and often influenced by several variables as shown by this study however this work has shown that most of the process based models have focused on mostly climatic and biophysical drivers such as weather soil properties and soil management some empirical models are going further and currently integrating non climatic and non biophysical drivers such as poverty rates literacy rates and agricultural income achli et al 2022 the approach of integrating socio economic variables into crop models needs to be emphasized and enhanced because increasingly non climatic drivers are driving crop production systems the big question now is how can these socio economic indicators or parameters be integrated into process based models and why are they necessary firstly the socio economic parameters are important because agriculture takes place within systems that are run by humans farming decisions in the context of irrigation fertilization and what types of crops to plan are often tied to the culture the experiences of the farmers involved and maybe inter generational transfer of cultivation systems many authors are now developing socio ecological systems models that integrate the dominant role of man on the other hand socio economic parameters can be included in process based models by either using the outputs of process based models to calibrate empirical models or using the outputs of empirical models to calibrate process based models furthermore as farmers make irrigation and fertilizer use decisions a component on aspects like literacy and poverty rates and how they influence such decisions should be factored into the management components of the model the current non inclusion of the socio economic components plays on the uncertainties inherent in aquacrop it is for this reason that the fao decided to keep it simple while emphasizing accuracy and robustness through testing and validating calibrating such outputs through experimentation 5 conclusion this systematic review has found that in morocco several processed based and empirical crop models are calibrated to study yield gaps in morocco in addition most of the authors of these studies are from morocco a trend that underscores the leveraging of funding in this genre of research additionally most of the studies are published as peer review papers while wheat stands out as the most frequently studied crop due to its huge valorization economic and livelihood significance finally most of the models are calibrated using a host of climatic and biophysical variables however most process based models have not been able to integrate socio economic variables which are increasingly being used in the empirical crop models a major challenge therefore is for process based model users to figure out how to integrate socio economic variables these findings are of great importance as this work will serve as a compendium for reference from which future studies can make references when calibrating and upgrading future models in fact this work provides a state of the art in terms of the types of models where they are published the affiliations of the lead authors the key crops studied and the key variables used in calibrating such models a critique of the various models is also given to help future users seek ways to improve these models the users are advised to use this information with caution given that the findings are based on only peer review and grey literature published between 2000 and 2022 implying that valuable studies could have been published out of this range also reviews of models used beyond morocco could provide further insights and more search engines included in future reviews however through ground truthing this work has shown that the likelihood of having more studies beyond the scope of this current work is highly limited declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

24427,agriculture is an important sector of the moroccan economy employing a huge portion of the moroccan population and contributing about 14 20 to the country s gdp unfortunately agricultural production in morocco is impacted by climatic non climatic biophysical and non biophysical stressors researchers have employed various crop models to understand how different crops respond to different environmental conditions such as temperature precipitation soil properties fertilization and irrigation unfortunately there are no studies that provide a summary and a holistic perspective of the most frequently used models and their calibration inputs in morocco this work therefore seeks to fill these knowledge gaps by providing a summary of the most calibrated crop models their calibration input data the most frequently studied crops how the studies are published peer review or grey literature and the affiliations of the lead authors this is achieved through a systematic review of the primary peer review and grey literature a total of 68 relevant peer review and grey literature papers were considered the results show that most of the authors are affiliated with moroccan universities organizations while wheat is the most studied crop in addition the aquacrop and the regression based models are the most used crop models additionally most of the models are calibrated in order of importance with variables such as temperature precipitation soil properties irrigation and fertilizers on the other hand there is an observed increase in the use of non climatic indicators such as poverty farm income and literacy levels to fit empirical models it is still unclear how process based models will integrate socio economic indicators this work has implications for future research as it provides a holistic picture of the key models that are currently used and their calibration this information can be used by other projects to select methods to use and crops to study based on the available data when working on crop models in morocco and north africa these results underscore the leading role in research funding offered by the government of morocco and other organizations such as um6p and ocp africa in research valorization in morocco and africa keywords agriculture wheat crop models peer reviewed grey literature morocco 1 introduction the veracity of global warming is unequivocal mainly due to the persistent anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases ghgs in the earth s atmosphere ipcc 2022 the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change report released at the end of february 2022 observes that even if climate warming is limited to the 1 5 c pathway the effects are likely to be daunting as environmental systems are likely to continue to be vulnerable and this will be reflected in persistent droughts floods extreme events inter alia ipcc 2022 if global warming transiently exceeds 1 5 c during the next decade or later overshoots many human and natural systems will be at risk of additional severe risks when compared to warming below 1 5 c agrawal et al 2015 ipcc 2022 also depending on the duration and magnitude of the overshoot some impacts will cause additional ghg emissions ipcc 2022 all the predictions show that for most of north africa temperatures will continue to rise at 1 5 c 2 c and 4 c projections while precipitation will continue to decline under these projections ipcc 2022 morocco is situated on the north western edge of the african continent located within latitudes 21 n and 36 n and longitudes 1 w and 17 w the country has a total surface area of about 711 000 km2 which includes about 2 934 km of atlantic coastline and about 512 km of coastline along the mediterranean sea according to 2022 projections morocco has a population of about 37 686 472 people world population review wpr 2022 morocco is characterized by a varied topography which includes mountains plateaux plains oasis and saharan dunes its topography is partly responsible for the country s diverse climate characterized by high inter and intra annual precipitation variability the climate is further characterized by irregular precipitation and rising temperatures which have devastating impacts on agriculture in the atlas mountains and the mediterranean coast of morocco observations of a decline in the amount of rainfall received in winter and spring have been recorded there were more than 330 dry days with less than 1 mm of precipitation daily for the period 1997 to 2007 niang et al 2014 benkenstein 2017 according to pala 2012 the mean annual rainfall in morocco declines from 600 mm in the northwest of the country to 250 mm in the south of the country that is the western sahara in morocco the agricultural sector is very important as it contributes about 14 20 to the country s gdp and represents 43 of all employment and 78 of employment in rural areas saidi diouri 2017 unfortunately more than 80 of arable lands in the country are located within semi arid and arid areas and only about 15 of the land is irrigated saidi diouri 2017 in morocco traditional agriculture is made of small rainfed farms which cultivate essentially cereals legumes and livestock smallholder farmers carry out cultivation that is highly driven by annual rainfall and the economic benefits of the agricultural sector therefore rainfall deficits have a strong impact on the economy of morocco saidi diouri 2017 on the other hand market agriculture is centered on irrigation and represents only about 15 of agricultural land the latter contributes about 45 to the gdp and 75 to agricultural export earnings overall moroccan agriculture consists of mixed and integrated livestock and crop systems representing the main source of income for rural households most range and arable lands receive less than 400 mm of rainfall bregaglio et al 2015 within this cereals and ruminants such as sheep are an integral part of the production systems saidi diouri 2017 despite morocco s rich agricultural potential it faces unmeasured yield and growing season rainfall gaps in key crops such as wheat barley and maize payne 1986 observed crop yields for these crops often fall short of the projected estimates pala et al 2012 bregaglio et al 2015 achli et al 2022 these gaps are judged by huge food imports under the green morocco plan gmp and are expected to continue under the gmp s next phase the generation green strategy saidi diouri 2017 the latter s replacement with the generation green strategy heralds implications for food security through a better understanding of the interplay between varying drivers such as climate crop nutrient deficiency and water management payne 1986 achli et al 2022 however these gaps have not been estimated for most of these crops and there is a lack of understanding of the most calibrated crop models as a result of these uncertainties this work aims at contributing to knowledge by performing a systematic review of the peer reviewed and grey literature to identify the various process based and empirical crop models that have been used in estimating yield gaps in addition the work aims at highlighting the most studied crops the affiliations of the lead authors and the commonly used calibration variables this approach will provide an understanding of the most used models their calibration input data whether they are published in both peer review or grey literature and the affiliations of lead authors as well as the key crops covered by such studies this work is therefore unique in that it provides a holistic snapshot of crop models in morocco that no single study has been able to offer this work will be a reference point for scholars researchers and other stakeholders wishing to test the response of various crops to different environmental conditions based on process based and or empirical crop models at a catchment area scale and a national scale by having a good knowledge of what already exists it becomes easier to define research paths for the future it will save researchers time by serving as a glossary of the most frequently used crop models in morocco this approach is relevant as it fills a major knowledge gap in crop models likely relevant thematic of the green moroccan plan gmp and its replacement for the next decade the generation green strategy and therefore constitutes part of the national agricultural priorities established under the auspices of the gmp faysse 2015 the relevance of this work is further galvanized by the objective of the gmp which aims to position the development of the agricultural sector as a driving force for economic growth montanari bergh 2019 despite the fact that agricultural production of most african countries including morocco is dominated by smallholder farmers who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other stressors the lack of adequate and accurate yield rainfall and planting calendar data information to be able to adjust their planting dates to changes in the growing season rainfall continues to undermind food security prospects zhang et al 2016 the effects of these have been persistent crop yield gaps and crop failures access to such pertinent information will empower farmers in crop planting decision making regarding shifting planting dates based on the available data selecting higher yielding varieties and making irrigation and nutrient use decisions the pan moroccan yield and precipitation gaps project pamocpp contributes to enhancing the resilience of cropping systems in morocco through yield gap studies synthesis and information sharing at the grassroot level by providing a systematic review of all that has been researched so far this work sets the pace in fitting a puzzle in the general process of making cropping systems resilient by making it easier for this current and future research projects to identify crops models and input variables that can be used to calibrate future models and make improvements 2 methods 2 1 systematic crop model tracking approach systematic reviews provide a summary and assessment of the state of knowledge on a topic or research question and rigorously summarize existing knowledge systematic reviews differ from traditional scoping literature reviews in several ways firstly a systematic review is based on clearly framed research questions secondly the systematic review approach outlines explicit methods and criteria to select relevant studies further the systematic review also includes providing information on the search terms used and the inclusion and exclusion criteria finally the systematic review approach easily subjects the collected database of studies to the use of qualitative and quantitative analysis ford and pearce 2010 this current systematic review is focused on the english and french peer review and grey literature documenting process based and empirical crop models used in morocco between 2000 and 2022 therefore this work serves as a proxy database for the country level crop models used in morocco this approach of including both peer review and grey literature in both languages helps to overcome the limitation of only using english peer review and grey literature and underscores this work as developing a general outline of crop models used in morocco the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting relevant articles in the peer reviewed and grey literature are listed in table 1 below the articles used in this work were acquired through scopus and google scholar search engines these search engines were used because they have been known to provide easy access to the primary peer review and grey literature on crop models and ensure wide coverage of crop models the articles considered were searched based on the following terms crop models in morocco empirical crop models in morocco and process based crop models in morocco to enhance our search we used the names of various crop models and blended them into our search terms aquacrop epic dssat wofost cropsyst apsim ceres machine learning regression based models pearson correlation anova and vulnerability indexes fig 1 a total of 189 studies that are relevant to our stated criteria were selected from the initial search march 2022 manual screening of the titles of the remaining articles resulted in the removal of duplicates and more irrelevant papers the abstracts of the remaining papers were read in relation to the inclusion criteria from which a final count of relevant papers was obtained a final count of 68 relevant studies 47 process based crop models table 1 and 21 empirical crop models table 2 see supplementary materials for all the 68 studies were selected for a more detailed review and were imported into endnote to ensure that we are not missing any relevant studies we conducted ground truthing using the web of science over morocco and searched for relevant peer review and grey literature profiling crop models in morocco and did a more detailed search of the peer reviewed and grey literature to verify if our database was missing any relevant studies this process resulted in no new relevant studies that matched our inclusion criteria 2 2 data analysis the more detailed analysis of each paper included was based on the following specific research questions that constitute the coding scheme in what year was the paper published is the paper peer reviewed or grey what is the country of affiliation of the lead author what specific crop models does the paper use what crop types does the paper focus on and what variables are used to calibrate the model this coding scheme is like those used in previous systematic review studies by lesnikowski et al 2013 berrang ford et al 2014 austin et al 2015 ford et al 2015 araos et al 2016a 2016 labbe et al 2017 studies reporting the use of several crops and several crop models and calibration inputs were included it is for this reason that even though there were 68 relevant studies the frequencies of most of the responses obtained exceeded 68 because some studies treated more than one model and more than one crop from these the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to identify major trends descriptive statistics frequencies and percentages were then used to establish the dominant trends all calculations were done in excel and spss while arc map 14 was used to spatially represent the spatial distribution of the affiliations of the lead authors for a summary of the methodology see fig 1 below 3 results 3 1 study types and affiliations of lead authors from this systematic review a total of 68 relevant studies were collected and analyzed fig 1 this number is based on all crop model studies from the peer review and grey literature published between 2000 and 2022 in terms of distribution 47 69 12 and 21 30 88 of these studies were process based and empirically based crop model studies respectively fig 2 from these results it is evident that most crop model studies in morocco use process based models process based crop models exceed empirical based crop models by 26 38 25 in terms of affiliations of the 47 process based crop model studies 25 53 2 were from authors who are affiliated with moroccan institutions this is represented in green on the map fig 3 a further 4 8 6 of the authors who published using process based crop models were from france and italy which is represented by brown on the map fig 3a switzerland the usa and syria each recorded 2 4 3 blue on the map while egypt tunisia china netherlands belgium and australia recorded 1 2 3 of process based crop model studies in morocco fig 3a yellow on the map it can be observed here that most of the authors who published process based crop model studies in morocco are affiliated with moroccan institutions regarding the use of empirical crop models 17 80 of the 21 studies collected have their lead authors affiliated with moroccan institutions represented by green on the map fig 3b france is second with 2 9 5 yellow on the map while netherland and the united kingdom record 1 4 8 dark green on the map fig 3b here also it is observed that a bigger proportion of the authors are affiliated with moroccan institutions 3 2 distribution of peer review and grey literature out of the 47 relevant empirical crop model studies included in this work 38 80 9 are peer review studies on the other hand 9 19 1 of the studies included were grey literature based studies fig 4 a these results show that a majority of the process based crop model studies in morocco have undergone standardization through the peer review process concerning the use of empirical crop models it has been found that of the 21 relevant studies 18 85 7 are peer review studies while 3 14 3 are grey literature based studies fig 4b just as with process based crop models most of the empirical model studies are peer reviewed in the context of the evolution of process based peer review and grey literature studies over time it can be observed that the year 2021 recorded the highest number of studies 5 7 4 while the years 2019 2017 and 2016 recorded 4 5 9 in 2013 3 4 4 studies were recorded fig 5 a in terms of process based grey literature crop models 2020 recorded 3 4 4 studies while 2014 recorded 2 2 9 fig 5a when peer review empirical crop models are considered it is observed that 6 8 8 studies were recorded in 2020 4 5 9 in 2021 and 2 2 9 in 2019 and 2018 fig 5b on the other hand grey literature based empirical crop models recorded 1 1 5 study in 2021 2020 and 2013 fig 5b these results show that there has been an increase in the number of studies with more recent years recording higher frequencies over the years 3 3 distribution of process based and empirical crop model studies this review has found that several process based crop models are used in morocco findings show that 14 key process based crop models are frequently used in morocco fig 6 a this work has also found that the most used process based crop model is the aquacrop model which records 20 the second most used model is cropsyst 14 followed by apsim 12 and epic 12 in terms of empirical crop models a total of 13 most used empirical crop models were identified fig 6a within this this work has also found that regression based empirical crop models scored the highest at about 21 7 followed by machine learning models which scored 17 4 three empirical models occupy the third position with a score of 8 7 these empirical crop models are pearson correlation data mining algorithms and modified penman fig 6b in terms of temporal variations this work has also found that the years 2013 and 2016 recorded the highest number of cropsyst and aquacrop related studies fig 7 a these models are closely followed by saltmed and the simple simulation models with studies published in 2015 and 2021 respectively in the context of empirical crop models machine learning techniques record the single highest number of publications in 2021 fig 7b furthermore critical point and regression based crop models recorded the second highest number of publications in the years 2003 and 2020 respectively fig 7b 3 4 key crops and input variables used in crop model calibration in the context of process based crop models the most studied crop in the scientific peer review and grey literature is wheat which recorded 33 70 2 sunflower and quinoa came second with frequencies of 4 5 9 each while maize recorded a frequency of 3 6 4 fig 8 a these results in the context of process based crop models underscore the prominence of wheat in morocco as an economic crop that sustains the livelihoods of several families these findings are consistent with those performed in the context of empirical crop models for example in terms of empirical crop models wheat recorded the highest frequency of 15 71 4 while barley and apple recorded low frequencies of 2 9 5 fig 8b the general observation that can be drawn from here is that much more emphasis has been placed on wheat in morocco because of its economic value in terms of process based crop model inputs the temperature recorded the highest occurrence or frequency of 38 80 9 while soil properties and precipitation recorded frequencies of 36 76 6 and 34 72 3 respectively management options such as irrigation and fertilization recorded frequencies of 9 19 1 fig 9 a these findings underscore the importance of climatic indicators such as temperature and precipitation in driving crop production in morocco as well as the role of soil properties and land management visibly absent in the calibration of process based models are socio economic drivers of yield the evidently play an important role in farm level decision making concerning empirical crop models the key variables or inputs are very consistent with those used in calibrating process based crop models for example in the context of empirical crop models temperature records the highest frequency of 17 80 9 followed by precipitation with a frequency of 12 57 1 irrigation and soil properties recorded frequencies of 4 19 0 fig 9b it is evident that for both process based and empirical crop models these variables are frequently used in calibration however an interesting observation of the empirical crop models is the fact that in addition to the integration of climatic and biophysical drivers other non climatic and non biophysical drivers such as demography poverty agricultural income and literacy are increasingly being used fig 9b table 3 4 discussion this work has found that of the 68 crop model studies published between 2000 and 2022 most of the studies are peer reviewed this huge proliferation of peer review papers over grey literature is an indication of the efforts by moroccan scholars to standardize research and increase its acceptability in fact this proliferation of peer reviewed studies is a good way of rendering knowledge acceptable through the peer review process which subjects any work to rigor and standardization the argument that peer review literature is considered standardized knowledge has been covered by several studies berrang ford et al 2015 lesnikowski et al 2016 epule et al 2017 despite the rigor with which peer review papers are categorized it is important to note that in many countries much work is being carried out by several non academic organizations which end up publishing a lot of grey literature it is for this reason that of the 68 publications used in this work 21 were grey literature reports this is a pointer that grey literature is increasingly becoming an important source of crop model information in morocco the increase in grey literature is an indication that this type of literature should not be entirely ignored but should be assessed with caution and included in most monitoring and policy related studies this approach has been successfully adopted in systematic reviews by several researchers e g lwasa et al 2015 furthermore this work has also found that in the context of types of crop models aquacrop is the most used process based crop model followed by cropsyst in terms of empirical crop models regression based and machine learning models are more frequently used the aquacrop for example is frequently used in morocco because it is designed to simulate yield in arid and semi arid environments in fact the aquacrop model is adequate for use in environments that experience water stress and just like cropsyst it integrates parameters such as yield precipitation temperature soil characteristics irrigation and fertilization akumaga et al 2017 in addition the aquacrop model for example already has background information on the biophysical conditions of the given environment in which the model will be tested this is vital because when integrating the effects of irrigation precipitation or soil texture the model considers the soil types and textures and their ability to hold moisture and enhance yields with the water table depth determined by the user montoya et al 2016 however the background information that is integrated into the model should be handled with caution and backed by the researcher s knowledge of the study area and this includes water table depth soil properties crops irrigation fertilizers precipitation and temperature khechba et al 2021 as the most dominantly used model aquacrop was developed by the fao due to the need to assess crop response to various environmental conditions the model operates on a daily time step and is suitable for catchment area scale crop simulations the model uses a relatively small number of parameters that are explicit and mostly intuitive and attempts at creating a balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness the objective of the model is to describe plant physiological processes and soil water budgeting with widely acceptable accuracy the key parameters used in the simulation include 1 the plant soil system 2 soil properties 3 soil management irrigation and fertilization 4 weather rainfall air temperature co2 evapotranspiration upper boundary of the model 5 the water table depth and how close it is to the sub soil lower boundary however the water table is not part of the model but the model users must define the depth of the water table which has implications for soil moisture retention aquacrop like other process based models has rendered crop modeling faster as simulations can be performed fast field experimentation on the other hand usually takes two to three years for the initial results to be obtained however aquacrop model can be calibrated and validated from the outputs of field experiments as concerns empirical crop models the most frequently used crop models have some unique advantages for their easy integration in morocco firstly regression based models are easy to implement and based on priorities the users can create the ideal environment for the simulation by selecting the right combination of dependent and independent variables the models also have functionalities that enable the users to overcome overfitting by regulation li 2015 ground truthing across other regions of africa has equally shown that in the context of empirical models regression based models are the most frequently used despite these advantages when using such methods attention should be placed on the effects of outliers and collinearity from several variables reinforcing each other li 2015 regression models on their part focus on the valorization of the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable the objective is often to explain which of the independent variables best explains the dependent variable in most cases yield is the dependent variable and the independent variables are precipitation temperature co2 soil moisture groundwater depth livestock fertilization and irrigation among others the right hand side of the equation is embedded with an error term as well as the slope and intercepts of the equation fig 10 in terms of authorship this work has shown that most studies on crop models in morocco are led by authors with moroccan affiliations this underscores the increasing investments in terms of funding and scholarships that the government and international organizations are currently placing at the disposal of moroccan researchers and students this observation is different from what obtains in other parts of africa such as west center and east africa where ground truthing has shown that most of the crop model based studies and projects are led by authors from other parts of the world france on the other hand is at the second level of crop model based studies in morocco the latter is tied to the colonial history and the existing collaborations between the two countries furthermore for both process based and empirical crop models wheat stands out as the most studied crop in morocco this finding is consistent with the national importance placed on the crop due to its economic value and livelihood sustenance in 2009 wheat stood as the most economically viable crop in morocco with net production of about 6 4 million mt and a market value of 1000 bishaw et al 2019 since 1982 several varieties of bread wheat 25 and durum wheat 34 have been registered in the national catalog along with other crops to its economic importance the government of morocco has greatly subsidized the production to reduce the cost of bread the per capita consumption of cereals in morocco is one of the highest in the world placing a significant role in wheat production in the framework of national food security lehmann et al 2020 this has rendered morocco one of the greatest wheat consuming countries in the world with about 225 kgs year per capita all these developments are encompassed in the plan maroc vert green morocco plan which aimed at the modernization of agriculture and enhancing the accessibility of agricultural inputs to farmers bishaw et al 2019 despite this effort it has been argued that most of the farm inputs and support provided under this program have not often reached smallholder farmers who are at the epicenter of wheat production in morocco lehmann et al 2020 also the plan has been criticized for not being able to ensure compliance as large scale farmers have often declared smaller portions of land in attempts at presenting themselves as smallholders thus puncturing the intentions of the plan hopefully the generation green strategy that replaces the gmp will fix some of these loopholes the importance of quinoa as an upcoming crop in morocco has been outlined in this work when compared with other grains like barley wheat and corn quinoa is far more resilient to drought it is also an important source of non animal protein so increasingly popular with the growing number of vegetarians and vegans around the world evidently the crop was introduced in morocco due to its resilience to the harsh arid and semi arid conditions on the other hand the calibration of most process based and empirical crop models in morocco is based on key model inputs such as precipitation temperature soil properties and soil management the role of climatic drivers on yield trends in morocco has long been established as many of the crops such as wheat are often precipitation dependent several studies have not only calibrated their models using climatic drivers as major inputs but have equally discussed the importance of climatic drivers in impacting crop yields in morocco several studies have underscroed the role of climate in driving crop yields in morocco e g badraoui et al 2011 jarlan et al 2014 bregaglio et al 2015 hirich et al 2016 ouraich et al 2019 bouras et al 2019 bouras et al 2021 achli et al 2022 however crop production is such a complex process and cannot be entirely attributed to one set of factors it is for this reason that most of the models used here also integrate variables such as soil properties aboutayeb et al 2020 moussadek et al 2014 bouasria et al 2021 due to climate change precipitation is not often sufficient for crop production due to problems with timing and distribution as such crop production has often been based on soil management and several studies have incorporated the irrigation parameter kharrou et al 2013 benabdelouahab et al 2016 oubelkacem et al 2020 as well as fertilization ryan et al 2009 mrabet et al 2012 ou zine et al 2021 it is therefore important to understand that crop production is complex and often influenced by several variables as shown by this study however this work has shown that most of the process based models have focused on mostly climatic and biophysical drivers such as weather soil properties and soil management some empirical models are going further and currently integrating non climatic and non biophysical drivers such as poverty rates literacy rates and agricultural income achli et al 2022 the approach of integrating socio economic variables into crop models needs to be emphasized and enhanced because increasingly non climatic drivers are driving crop production systems the big question now is how can these socio economic indicators or parameters be integrated into process based models and why are they necessary firstly the socio economic parameters are important because agriculture takes place within systems that are run by humans farming decisions in the context of irrigation fertilization and what types of crops to plan are often tied to the culture the experiences of the farmers involved and maybe inter generational transfer of cultivation systems many authors are now developing socio ecological systems models that integrate the dominant role of man on the other hand socio economic parameters can be included in process based models by either using the outputs of process based models to calibrate empirical models or using the outputs of empirical models to calibrate process based models furthermore as farmers make irrigation and fertilizer use decisions a component on aspects like literacy and poverty rates and how they influence such decisions should be factored into the management components of the model the current non inclusion of the socio economic components plays on the uncertainties inherent in aquacrop it is for this reason that the fao decided to keep it simple while emphasizing accuracy and robustness through testing and validating calibrating such outputs through experimentation 5 conclusion this systematic review has found that in morocco several processed based and empirical crop models are calibrated to study yield gaps in morocco in addition most of the authors of these studies are from morocco a trend that underscores the leveraging of funding in this genre of research additionally most of the studies are published as peer review papers while wheat stands out as the most frequently studied crop due to its huge valorization economic and livelihood significance finally most of the models are calibrated using a host of climatic and biophysical variables however most process based models have not been able to integrate socio economic variables which are increasingly being used in the empirical crop models a major challenge therefore is for process based model users to figure out how to integrate socio economic variables these findings are of great importance as this work will serve as a compendium for reference from which future studies can make references when calibrating and upgrading future models in fact this work provides a state of the art in terms of the types of models where they are published the affiliations of the lead authors the key crops studied and the key variables used in calibrating such models a critique of the various models is also given to help future users seek ways to improve these models the users are advised to use this information with caution given that the findings are based on only peer review and grey literature published between 2000 and 2022 implying that valuable studies could have been published out of this range also reviews of models used beyond morocco could provide further insights and more search engines included in future reviews however through ground truthing this work has shown that the likelihood of having more studies beyond the scope of this current work is highly limited declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

egg drift river 1 introduction grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp h molitrix are native to eastern china and are highly important source of food both in wild capture fisheries and in aquaculture food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 however wild stocks of these fishes in china have severely declined due to overfishing

grass carp sills 1970 and nuisance plankton bighead and silver carps domaizon and devaux 1999 xie and liu 2001 these fishes have been introduced or used in aquaculture in more than 75 countries however in many of those countries including parts of china where the carp are not native introductions or escapes from aquaculture have resulted in undesirable effects josza et al 2014 milardi et al 2020 su et al 2021 in north america bighead carp and silver carp together the bigheaded carps are considered highly invasive species they have reached extremely high populations and biomass in many parts of the greater mississippi river basin and have had detrimental effects on native fishes irons et al 2007 cudmore et al 2012 chick et al 2020 grass carp especially sterile artificially produced triploid grass carp are still in use for nuisance vegetation control throughout the united states rasmussen 2011 but where grass carp reproduce in the wild they are also considered an invasive species this is especially so in the laurentian great lakes basin chapman et al 2021 where risk assessments have predicted substantial potential for adverse effects cudmore et al 2017 although their adult diets and morphology differ these three species have broadly similar reproductive and early life characteristics and thus have correspondingly similar environmental needs to support survival of the

transverse movement is predicted with a traditional turbulent dispersion parameterization using shear velocity fischer et al 1979 and modification using a beta function of transverse velocity distribution seo and baek 2004 the vertical movement of eggs is predicted with empirically or semi empirically derived eddy viscosity parameterization with addition of the settling or buoyant velocity calculated based on the density difference between eggs and water although fluegg has been widely used and successful the limitation of the model is that the simulator only takes input of one dimensional 1 d velocity information either from hydraulic models or field data despite that fluegg uses open channel theory and empirically derived vertical and lateral velocity distributions to create a 3 d flow field this coupling approach has a potential issue of missing localized effects due to detailed lateral velocity gradients accelerating and decelerating flows strong macro scale turbulence induced by in stream structures or interactions between main and secondary flows the effects of cm to m scale turbulence on suspension drifting time and distance and survival rate of eggs are not well constrained using fluegg with simplified models multi dimension modeling capacity increases in importance in understanding turbulence in complex river systems with meandering braiding or

hydrodynamic models can provide better flow information in the vertical direction coupling 3 d lpt model with 3 d hydrodynamics can greatly improve the model performance by reducing parameterization of flow in the vertical direction to name a few coupled 3 d lpt and 3 d hydrodynamic models have been extensively used in tracking inert water particles cimatoribus et al 2019 oil droplets north et al

substantially longer potential transit time of some grass carp eggs in the sandusky river using a 3 d hydrodynamic model compared with a 1 d model which demonstrates the importance of river turbulence on egg suspension retention and drift heer et al 2020 shows a conceptual diagram of egg distribution predicted by models at various dimensions in which higher dimensional hydrodynamic models tend to give longer tails of egg distribution in upstream rivers we note that the turbulent fluctuation of egg drift used in many existing random walk models still relies on the parameterization of the river dispersion coefficients typically dispersion coefficients are parameterized using local shear velocity water depth and particle location garcia et al 2013 heer et al 2020 on the other hand reynolds averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke and dissipation rate are typically solved from turbulent closure sub models of a 3 d hydrodynamic model their spatial distribution in rivers can likely provide better information about localized turbulent statistics for predicting transport than using parameterization of a dispersion coefficient because tke and its dissipation rate are relevant to the life time of turbulent eddies random walk algorithms can be formulated using these turbulent parameters in estimating the temporal and spatial scales of particle turbulence interactions legg and raupach 1982 bocksell and loth 2001 wang et al 2020 hence the existing lpt models in egg transport can be improved by using those local turbulent parameters in coupled lpt and 3 d hydrodynamic models to overcome the limitations of existing tracking algorithms in resolving localized effects for fluvial egg drift simulation we developed a three dimensional lagrangian egg tracking model that uses fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamics i e resolved mean flow and turbulent characteristics in 3 d space with eddy defined continuous random walk algorithms to characterize the turbulent fluctuation of egg drift in this paper we apply the new model to a short representative reach of the channelized missouri river which is characterized by multiple training structures that impart substantial lateral and vertical complexity to the velocity field we provide a detailed comparison of egg drift simulations between the fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamic model with reduced dimension models with dispersion parameterization this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the model including the new parameterization of egg characteristics the continuous random walk algorithm and the initial and boundary conditions the setup of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model in the selected reach is given in section 3 the egg tracking algorithm for reduced dimension simulation is also discussed in section 3 section 4 provides the results and discussion of hydrodynamic simulation calibration and validation the performance of the egg drift model spatial and temporal egg distributions and comparison among 3 d 2 d and 1 d hydrodynamics conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 model description 2 1 egg characteristics we revisited the experimental data of density diameter and velocity for bighead carp silver carp and grass carp in george et al 2017 and determined a new set of regression equations to calculate egg characteristics the original equation for egg diameter d as a function of the post fertilization time t is 1 d t α 1 exp t β with α and β being regression coefficients from the experimental data this equation mathematically gives the initial egg a diameter of zero which is incorrect since eggs at time t 0 fertilization time have a finite size fluegg forces all calculated diameters using eq 1 that are smaller than a criterion to be a predefined minimal egg diameter however their regression equations were computed enforcing a zero intercept which contributes to inaccuracy in the predictive equation here we recompute the regression equations with the y intercept set equal to the egg diameter at t 0 fertilization time we fit the following equation to the laboratory collected data in george et al 2017 2 d t α 1 1 d min α exp t β with d d min at t 0 the regression using eq 2 is shown in fig 1 and the regression parameters are summarized in table 1 fig 1 shows the major difference occurs within 1 h post spawning when most water hardening occurs we use the same parameterization of egg density as that in fluegg and compensate for the effect of water temperature george et al 2017 garcia et al 2015 3 ρ egg ρ ρ exp t γ ρ t ref t water where ρ is density of the fully hardened egg and the ρ term describes the density change due to the effect of water hardening with t 0 the initial egg density is ρ egg ρ ρ at the reference temperature t ref 22 c at which the regression is performed the ρ term is the density compensation for temperature variation the values of the parameters are summarized in table 1 the terminal velocity of eggs in stationary water is computed by iterating the drag equation 4 ρ egg ρ g π d 3 6 1 2 c d ρ v egg 2 π d 2 4 where g is gravitational acceleration ρ is water density v egg is the terminal velocity the drag

kinematic viscosity of water fig 2 shows the comparison between the measurement data george et al 2017 and the calculated velocity using the new parameterization eqs 2 3 and 4 calculation using eqs 1 3 and 4 are plotted for reference as seen in the plot giving an initial diameter would provide better prediction of egg settling velocity in the early stage our values of egg settling velocity converged with those of the fluegg model after about 1 hour post spawning consistent with the predicted difference of egg diameter as a function of time between eqs 1 and 2 2 2 egg tracking the lagrangian egg tracking equation is written as 6 x i t δ t x i t u i t x i u i t x i u i egg t δ t where u i u i and u i egg are mean flow velocity turbulent fluctuating velocity and egg settling velocity u i egg v egg for i 3 only respectively the subscript i 1 2 3 represents the three directions in the cartesian coordinate system mean velocity u i is the time averaged flow field from a 3 d hydrodynamic model turbulent velocity u i is the solution of a stochastic differential equation known as langevin equation 7 d u i d t c 1 u i c 2 ξ i where ξ i is a standard gaussian white noise representing the random nature of the turbulent velocity the langevin equation preserves the velocity memory i e shown as velocity auto correlation while describing the random process of the turbulent fluctuations the relative importance of these two features are presented in the coefficients c 1 and c 2 legg and raupach 1982 showed c 1 1 τ i and c 2 σ i 2 τ i 0 5 where τ i is the lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies and σ i is the root mean square rms of the instantaneous velocity in each direction the stochastic differential equation eq 7 can be discretized to an equivalent markov chain equation for continuous random walk crw modeling bocksell and loth 2001 8 u i t δ t u i t exp δ t τ i σ i 1 exp 2 δ t τ i 1 2 ξ i in our model σ i and τ i are modeled from the turbulent kinetic energy

turbulence can be generated using random walk fig 3 shows an example of comparison between pure random walk and markov chain random walk in simulating turbulent velocity fluctuation with a time and velocity scale of 0 1 s and 0 1 m s respectively the auto correlation of velocity fluctuations shows that a markov chain random walk can generate a reasonable time scale of correlated velocity data compared to pure randomness from pure random walk i e auto correlation approaches zero after one time step 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the egg release location i e spawning location needs to be specified as an initial condition and must be physically within the water to initiate egg tracking the model automatically checks the user input egg release location to ensure that the egg is within the computational domain i e occupied by water the boundary of the computational domain is defined by the hydrodynamic input file i e water surface river bed and lateral walls a boundary collision algorithm must be used when an egg moves out of the computational domain for instance fluegg uses a reflective boundary condition so that all eggs remain in the computational domain until the end of the simulation garcia et al 2013 here we apply a different algorithm so that we can potentially use it to simulate egg entrapment instead of placing eggs back in the river reflectively from the boundary we place the eggs on the boundary the egg can be resuspended from the boundary or move out of domain again in the next time step if the egg keeps moving out of boundary with multiple steps in the simulation it represents entrapment of egg by the boundary however with sufficiently long time the egg would eventually escape from the entrapment due to the nature of random walk here we can define an entrapment period to prevent escape of some eggs because of the memory effect of markov chain whether the egg would escape from the entrapment in the predefined entrapment period would be determined by the velocity of collision and the time scale of local turbulence hence using a markov chain random walk provides a unique advantage for simulating egg entrapment and resuspension for potential fishery management 2 4 model setup to initiate egg tracking three dimensional river hydrodynamics must be provided as the input file to compute the movement of individual eggs in the river the input river data can be the output of 3 d hydrodynamic models or field measurement data from velocity sensors e g acoustic doppler current profilers adcps the unique feature of our model is that it needs turbulent statistics i e reynolds averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke and its dissipation rate to estimate instantaneous turbulent fluctuation using the markov chain equation tke and its dissipation rate are usually computed in reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models which are widely used in resolving river dynamics our egg tracking model can also be used with the data from time resolving models such as large eddy simulation les with the input hydrodynamic data each individual egg is tracked at each time step based on mean water velocity and turbulent fluctuations at the egg location as well as the settling velocity of the egg in the water the local egg settling velocity is calculated based on egg characteristics i e diameter density which are functions of local water properties and the time since spawning water properties can be output from hydrodynamic models or specified as a function of depth e g stratified flow for well mixed rivers a constant temperature can be specified so that water density and viscosity can be calculated the specified temperature is also needed for calculating egg growth and properties for stratified rivers temperature as a function of location needs to be given egg location is updated every time step where the properties of water and egg are then updated accordingly for the next time step a desired maximal computational time is specified as the maximal duration of egg tracking e g hatch time or estimated drift out of domain time however the actual egg tracking time depends on individual eggs there are two criteria for terminating egg tracking 1 the egg moves out of the maximal distance at the downstream computational domain 2 the egg remains at one location for a pre defined egg entrapment period a default value of 30 s is used however we note that the value is arbitrarily chosen without physical meanings the model is coded using python software with all sub models e g egg characteristics water properties

comparison to demonstrate model performance in simulating egg drift we conducted a case study in a reach of the lower missouri river specifically we compared the egg tracking results using fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamics to those using depth averaged 2 d hydrodynamics and zone averaged 1 d hydrodynamics i e fluegg all simulation conditions are the same with the same hydrodynamic input data 3 1 study area and data collection the study area for the model is a representative 8 kilometer reach of the lower missouri river near lexington missouri this section of the missouri river drains approximately 1 2 million km 2 and has a mean annual discharge of approximately 1700 m 3 s streamflow gaging station 06895500 at waverly missouri us geological survey 2021 the lower missouri river has been highly altered from its natural state by flow regulation by upstream dams and channelization to stabilize banks and maintain a stable barge navigation channel galat and lipkin 2000 jacobson and galat 2006 channelization during the 19th and 20th centuries involved narrowing the active channel to 30 50 of its natural width constructing pile and rock river training structures wing dikes l head dikes and stabilizing banks with rock revetment the result of channelization is a single thread channel with diminished channel complexity at the bend scale but with increased complexity at the navigation structure scale due to strong hydraulic gradients when water flows around and over the rock structures fig 4 flows are seasonally distributed because of snow melt patterns in the upstream watershed with a typical peak around may 31 interactions with convective storms and moisture from the gulf of mexico however can also result in periodic precipitation driven high flow events during

to measure the river flow at 2 hz four adcp transects were conducted at each of ten cross sections fig 4 the vertical resolution is 0 5 m and horizontal resolution is roughly 1 m the instrument blanking distance and the bottom noise prevented measurements within 1 m below the water surface and 1 m above the river bed because the missouri river has a moving bed at the surveyed discharge adcp

fully 3 d hydrodynamic modeling was carried out for the reach with the discharge of 3062 m 3 s this discharge represents approximately 25 daily flow exceedance for the spawning and drift season may june fig 5 shows the model generated channel geometry and the mesh superimposed onto the geometry file flow discharge and hydrostatic pressure were selected for upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively water elevation levels were specified at both ends of the reach from the field survey data the bed roughness was adjusted so that the measured surface water elevation along the

and ɛ with k and ɛ in eqs 9 and 10 respectively because there is no variation of flow characteristics in the vertical direction under the 2 d condition the vertical movement of egg must be empirically

model a or 3 d model the model using 2 d depth averaged hydrodynamic input horizontal crw and vertical random displacement is named tracking model b or 2 d k ɛ model while the model using dispersion coefficients is named tracking model c or 2 d dispersion coefficient model in this study we also applied fluegg v3 0 2 with the same hydrodynamic data where the 3 d hydrodynamic data was averaged across the entire river cross section based on a 8 m grid size in the stream wise direction to obtain 1 d flow characteristics hence we can term fluegg as 1 d dispersion coefficient model note that all models are three dimensional egg tracking the dimension in the model name represents that of hydrodynamics data 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamics the results of model calibration and the mesh independence study are shown in fig 6 the water surface elevation was measured along approximately 7 km stream wise distance in the reach and was compared with modeling results using three different mesh sizes we found overall agreement between the measured data and the modeling output the mean errors of water surface elevation are 6 2 cm 3 7 cm and 1 0 cm for coarse medium and fine mesh sizes compared to the mean water depth of 8 m the discrepancies between measurement and modeling correspond to an overall error of 0 77 0 46 and 0 13 respectively we note that refining grid size would also increase the resolution of the river bed profile and the shape of lateral walls and hydraulic structures in the river hence we expect small differences among different mesh sizes even though the numerical simulation is converged with respect to the mesh size given the overall agreement of using different mesh sizes from calibration we chose to use the fine mesh 4 4 0 4 m for our final hydrodynamic model we initialized our model using the coarse grid after reaching convergence we updated the model to the medium mesh to restart the model and then updated it to the fine mesh for the final model results the measured velocities were used to evaluate our final model results fig 7 shows an example of the comparison of three velocity components between measurements and modeling at cross section number 10 in fig 7 both measurements and modeling data show distinct flow patterns in the main channel and the region between the left bank and the longitudinal dike about 80 m from the left bank visual examination shows an overall good agreement to capture the flow patterns in the cross section figs 8 10 show the cross sectional profiles of depth averaged stream wise velocity u s transverse velocity u t and vertical velocity u v at five selected cross sections we note that the adcp measurements are only averaged from four transects and hence represent more or less the instantaneous velocity as such substantial spatial fluctuations are observed along each cross section in contrast the cfd results represent the flow characteristics of the quasi steady state solution and hence are much smoother nevertheless the agreement between measurements and modeling is good to provide quantitative measures of model performance compared with adcp data cross sectional averaged velocities are plotted for model results against measurements fig 11 the root mean square error rmse was 0 034 and 0 029 m s for u s and u t respectively corresponding to 2 5 and 2 1 of the mean flow 4 2 egg transport simulated silver carp eggs n 6600 were released at the water surface uniformly distributed at 33 locations across the entire river at about 500 m downstream of the upstream boundary fig 12 carp eggs were tracked each second until they flowed out of the computational domain or were entrapped by the river bed or lateral wall fig 12 shows four snapshots of egg transport in the river with the time interval of 0 5 h videos of egg transport are provided in supplementary files the simulation shows that eggs are advected downstream by river flow where the spatial distribution of eggs in the river is primarily shaped by the cross sectional profile of water velocity strong dispersion was found in the river particularly around wing dikes due to large local velocity gradients i e more spreading in these regions the simulation also shows substantial entrapment of eggs see supplementary videos and black dots in fig 12 where eggs are slowed temporary detention or trapped retained for the predefined duration detention and retention are especially evident around dikes with high topographic variability we note that detention and retention are determined by the algorithm which may not represent actual egg movement or settlement in rivers however it provides information on the likelihood for eggs slowing and or being retained in the vicinity of these areas with low velocities and high vorticities the comparison of different tracking models shows different performances in predicting egg transport in the river see fig 13 at t 0 5 hr and fig 14 at t 1 0 hr the supplementary video shows the entire simulation duration for all three models the tracking models using 2 d depth averaged velocity agree well with that using fully 3 d hydrodynamic data for the advection of the eggs in the stream wise direction i e all models show a similar pattern of egg distribution with similar time of arrival of the front of egg cloud however the 2 d k ɛ model has substantially less spreading in the river compared to the other models this suggests that the random walk algorithm using depth averaged turbulent quantities would underestimate egg dispersion compared to the random walk using localized turbulent parameters the prediction of egg dispersion using empirical equations of dispersion coefficients along with depth averaged hydrodynamic data i e tracking model c agrees generally well with that using fully 3 d turbulent data for both advection and diffusion the 2 d dispersion coefficient model relies on accurate estimations of shear velocity as well as the parameterization of dispersion coefficients and turbulent viscosity from the simulation results the 2 d dispersion coefficient model seems to slightly overestimate the transverse dispersion compared to the 3 d model the overestimate of transverse dispersion and underestimate of longitudinal dispersion is likely due to the same scaling coefficient being used in the horizontal dispersion coefficient i e eq 20 in fact the longitudinal dispersion should be stronger than the transverse dispersion fischer et al 1979 as shown in our 3 d model result we also note that egg detention and retention are substantially reduced in 2 d models due to different tracking algorithms in the vertical direction i e empirical equations versus random walk with local turbulence therefore the fully 3 d model has a better capability to estimate egg detention and or retention caused by in stream hydraulic structures the mean location of eggs in the river as a function of time is plotted in fig 15 demonstrating the performance of different models for predicting overall egg transport including fluegg the fluegg simulation stopped once eggs started to flow out of computational domain we stopped the simulation at 1 h after the egg release for this case for the other tracking models all retained eggs are excluded from the data in this plot the simulation results show that mean egg location is predicted further downstream by fluegg than other models the 3 d model has the slowest mean downstream transport due to significant longitudinal dispersion see later figs 16 and 17 however note that fluegg does not handle the uniform distribution of eggs in the channel as an initial condition hence the simulated scenarios between fluegg and other models are not exactly the same in fact fluegg predicts the transport of eggs from the same release point in an averaged flow field does not represents egg release in the center of the channel either hence more or less represents the uniform distribution of egg release across the channel the mean egg location in the transverse direction is largely determined by the lateral movement of water as a result of river morphology in our simulation the mean egg location shifts slightly towards the left bank y w 0 5 within the first 0 5 hr and then shifts towards the right bank y w 0 5 thereafter primarily due to the curvature of the river channel the models with vertical dispersion equations i e both 2 d models and fluegg predict similar mean egg locations in the vertical direction as a function of time after the initial settling the mean vertical location is generally at the half flow depth z h 0 5 due to the almost uniform distribution in the water column the 3 d model shows slower sinking of the egg cloud at the initial stage and the mean egg location seems to continue decreasing downstream the longitudinal distribution of eggs at t 0 5 hr and 1 0 hr is shown in figs 16 and 17 models with 2 d or 3 d hydrodynamic data show a long tail of egg distribution in the upstream direction due to reduction of downstream drift when eggs interact with vortices caused by the wing dikes some eggs are detained or retained locally which also contribute to the highly skewed distribution fluegg does not allow eggs to be retained and hence presents a gaussian like shape of the egg distribution at t 0 5 hr at t 1 0 hr two peaks are observed which is due to the reduced velocities of some eggs close to the left bank while reaching the boundary around x 4000 m similar peaks are observed in other models except for the 3 d model where that second peak was smoothed out by the strong effect of longitudinal dispersion the models with 2 d or 3 d hydrodynamics show an overall agreement of egg distribution except for the fact that 3 d model predicts that more eggs are retained in dike areas the leading edge of the egg distribution shows a gaussian like shape in the 3 d model with increasing time post spawn more obvious in fig 17 but the results of 2 d models show a sharp leading edge the single large peak in the egg distribution in 2 d k ɛ model results is clearly the result of weak turbulent diffusion although the shear dispersion due to lateral velocity gradient was captured the primary dispersion of eggs predicted by model b is due to the spatial velocity gradient in the depth averaged flow field model c uses the horizontal dispersion coefficient to model the random movement of eggs in the horizontal direction which seems to overestimate the lateral movement see fig 14 and may underestimate the longitudinal diffusion showing a sharp leading edge of the egg distribution the difference of egg distributions predicted by models with different dimensions is well described by the conceptual diagram in heer et al 2020 4 3 discussion the egg tracking model presented here serves the same purpose as fluegg but updates the lagrangian particle tracking algorithms using fully resolved turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate in three dimensional space this allows detailed examination of how localized features in large rivers e g wing dikes affect the dispersion of the eggs as well as egg retention and resuspension here we demonstrated the model performance using three different tracking algorithms along with fluegg in the test reach the model with 3 d hydrodynamic data shows various mechanisms of egg transport strong dispersion due to spatial velocity gradients in river cross sections strong effects of wing dikes on slowing down egg movement and potential mechanisms of egg retention the comparison between egg tracking using 3 d hydrodynamics with those using 2 d depth averaged hydrodynamics provides meaningful insights about how egg tracking should be performed with a depth averaged flow field our simulation data show that employment of a random walk using depth averaged turbulence i e tracking model b tends to underestimate egg dispersion and thus is not a desirable method for studying drift of carp eggs however the empirical equations using dispersion coefficient and turbulent viscosity provide generally good agreement for predicting egg dispersion in the river using fully 3 d hydrodynamics a main difference of using 3 d hydrodynamic data versus depth averaged data is the vertical transport of eggs the markov chain random walk used in our model considers the turbulent nature of water flows i e velocity correlation in the time scale this nature is transferred to egg movement giving correlated egg velocity over small time intervals with empirical equations the turbulence is fully randomized by assignments of random numbers multiplied by a factor determined by the vertical and horizontal dispersion coefficients see eqs 15 and 20 hence two limitations are present 1 dispersion coefficient equations may have a large range of scaling coefficients in different river sections and discharges 2 the pure randomization does not truly represent the nature of turbulence we note that egg tracking using 1 d hydrodynamic data i e fluegg provides useful egg drift data in three dimensional space with a remarkably fast simulation compared to higher dimensional models however it misses the detailed information of egg retention resuspension and the effects of in stream hydraulic structures on egg transport hence we suggest using high dimensional hydrodynamics to drive egg drift simulation models if hydrodynamic data and computational time are available necessary simplifications such as using coarse resolution data or using depth averaged hydrodynamic data can be adopted to reduce computational time if empirical dispersion equations are used to calculate egg dispersal validation of parameterization of dispersion coefficients and turbulent viscosity may be needed to increase model accuracy lastly it is important to point out that we do not have ground truth data to validate the egg tracking nor do we fully understand the ecological implications of different predicted egg distributions furthermore the purpose of the model comparison is not to show which model is better but rather to provide a better understanding of the behavior of different models each model has its own advantages and limitations that make it fit for different applications the 3 d model we present here provides an additional tool that is suitable for characterizing the effect of localized river turbulence on egg transport at spatial scales of meters although applied here to carp egg transport similar models have broad implications for understanding transport phenomena in rivers similar to carps endangered pallid sturgeon larvae are thought to be passively transported long distances downstream in the missouri river and their fate survival or death by starvation is thought to be linked to reach scale hydrodynamics that serve to move larvae from the fast and food poor navigation channel into supportive marginal habitats jacobson et al 2016 channel re engineering to increase interception of sturgeon larvae from the main channel into shallow slow rearing habitat has been an emphasis of the missouri river recovery program fischenich et al 2018 but little consideration has been given to interactions between efforts to recover the pallid sturgeon and potential effects on carp populations improved understanding of turbulence mediated particle transport may be applied as well to understanding ecologically important transport processes for sediment invertebrates and particulate organic matter 5 conclusions in this work we present a new 3 d lagrangian particle tracking model to study transport of eggs of grass silver and bighead carps the new model includes a set of new governing equations to calculate egg diameter density and terminal settling velocity as a function of time since spawning and water temperature the markov chain equation is used to estimate evolution of turbulent velocity using resolved turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate a case study of an 8 km reach of the missouri river was conducted to demonstrate performance of the egg tracking model the selected river reach has strong secondary flows induced by river morphology and various sized turbulent eddies caused by wing dikes we calibrated the hydrodynamic model using measured water surface elevation and validated the model using velocity data at ten cross sections in the river measured with an adcp the output of the reynolds averaged data i e quasi steady state velocity and turbulent statistics are used to drive the egg tracking model comparison of egg tracking models using fully 3 d hydrodynamics and depth averaged hydrodynamics shows generally good agreement of egg transport patterns demonstrating the primary role of mean flow advection and dispersion caused by the spatial gradient in river cross sections the 3 d model has a unique capability to capture the effects of strong localized turbulence on egg retention particularly for those in the vertical direction caused by the in stream hydraulic structures model performance suggests random walk using depth averaged turbulent statistics tends to underestimate the turbulent diffusion however tracking using empirical equations of dispersion coefficients agrees fairly well with the results under fully 3 d hydrodynamics in simulating the dispersion of carp eggs in the river we note the accuracy of modeling with 2 d data depends on the reliability of the dispersion coefficient parameterization which may be river dependent and should be validated prior to modeling fluegg was tested for the same conditions and compared with the new model with higher dimensional hydrodynamics even though fluegg does not resolve spatial gradients in river cross sections it provides useful information about the overall dispersion of eggs in rivers with a short computational time and substantially less hydraulic data again validation of the empirical equations using dispersion coefficients may be needed for individual rivers ultimately model evaluation should be established with field collections of eggs and evaluations of egg survival such efforts have been recently carried out for validating egg transport models using field egg capture data heer et al 2020 in summary the proposed egg tracking model driven by 3 d hydrodynamics is able to use local turbulence data to estimate egg transport in highly heterogeneous hydraulic conditions one key advantage of our model is that it does not require the empirical estimation of turbulent dispersion coefficients in the river with a cost of more data required and computational time the algorithm used in our model has a potential to be used for designing hydraulic structures to maximize or minimize egg retention as drift models are now being used both where these carps are highly desirable foodfishes yang et al 2019 and where they are considered invasive species embke et al 2019 our study can

24428,grass carp bighead carp and silver carp spawn in flowing water their eggs and then larvae develop while drifting hydraulic conditions and water temperature control spawning locations egg survival and the downstream distance traveled before the hatched larvae can swim for low velocity nursery habitats existing egg drift models simulate the fluvial transport of carp eggs but have limitations in capturing the effect of localized turbulence on egg transport due to inadequate dimensions of hydrodynamics and or empirical parameterization of river dispersion we present a three dimensional lagrangian particle tracking model that uses fully resolved river hydrodynamics and a continuous random walk algorithm driven by local turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate we incorporate a new set of equations to compute evolving egg characteristics with fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamics to demonstrate the performance of the model we conducted a case study in an eight

both in wild capture fisheries and in aquaculture food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 however wild stocks of these fishes in china have severely declined due to overfishing and dam construction and efforts are being made to revive those stocks chapman et al 2016 because of their utility in aquaculture fisheries enhancement and biological control of nuisance vegetation grass carp sills 1970 and nuisance plankton bighead and silver carps domaizon and devaux 1999 xie and liu 2001 these fishes have been introduced or used in aquaculture in more than 75 countries

2020 su et al 2021 in north america bighead carp and silver carp together the bigheaded carps are considered highly invasive species they have reached extremely high populations and biomass in many

triploid grass carp are still in use for nuisance vegetation control throughout the united states rasmussen 2011 but where grass carp reproduce in the wild they are also considered an invasive species this is especially so in the laurentian great lakes basin chapman et al 2021 where risk assessments have predicted substantial potential for adverse effects cudmore et al 2017 although their adult diets and morphology differ these three species have broadly similar reproductive and early life characteristics and thus have correspondingly similar environmental needs to support survival of the

transverse movement is predicted with a traditional turbulent dispersion parameterization using shear velocity fischer et al 1979 and modification using a beta function of transverse velocity distribution seo and baek 2004 the vertical movement of eggs is predicted with empirically or semi empirically derived eddy viscosity parameterization with addition of the settling or buoyant velocity calculated based on the density difference between eggs and water although fluegg has been widely used and successful the limitation of the model is that the simulator only takes input of one dimensional 1 d velocity information either from hydraulic models or field data despite that fluegg uses open channel theory and empirically derived vertical and lateral velocity distributions to create a 3 d flow field this coupling approach has a potential issue of missing localized effects due to detailed lateral velocity gradients accelerating and decelerating flows strong macro scale turbulence induced by in stream structures or interactions between main and secondary flows the effects of cm to m scale turbulence on suspension drifting time and distance and survival rate of eggs are not well constrained using fluegg with simplified models multi dimension modeling capacity increases in importance in understanding turbulence in complex river systems with meandering braiding or in channel flow structures e g ferguson et al 2003 abad et al 2008 jamieson et al 2011 erwin and jacobson 2015 alvarez et al 2017 erwin et al 2017 le et al 2019 kasprak et al 2022 because 3 d hydrodynamic models can provide better flow information in the vertical direction coupling 3 d lpt model with 3 d hydrodynamics can greatly improve the model performance by reducing parameterization of flow in the vertical direction to name a few coupled 3 d lpt and 3 d hydrodynamic models have been extensively used in tracking inert water particles cimatoribus et al 2019 oil droplets north et al 2011 oil particle aggregates zhu et al 2018b sea plants kang et al 2016 fish eggs heer et al 2020 2021 and fish larvae mcdonald and nelson 2021 for carp egg transport heer et al 2020 illustrated substantially longer potential transit time of some grass carp eggs in the sandusky river using a 3 d hydrodynamic model compared with a 1 d model which demonstrates the importance of river turbulence on egg suspension retention and drift heer et al 2020 shows a conceptual diagram of egg distribution predicted by models at various dimensions in which higher dimensional hydrodynamic models tend to give longer tails of egg distribution in upstream rivers we note that the turbulent fluctuation of egg drift used in many existing random walk models still relies on the parameterization of the river dispersion coefficients typically dispersion coefficients are parameterized using local shear velocity water depth and particle location garcia et al 2013 heer et al 2020 on the other hand reynolds averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke and dissipation rate are typically solved from turbulent closure sub models of a 3 d hydrodynamic model their spatial distribution in rivers can likely provide better information about localized turbulent statistics for predicting transport than using parameterization of a dispersion coefficient because tke and its dissipation rate are relevant to the life time of turbulent eddies random walk algorithms can be formulated using these turbulent parameters in estimating the temporal and spatial scales of particle turbulence interactions legg and raupach 1982 bocksell and loth 2001 wang et al 2020 hence the existing lpt models in egg transport can be improved by using those local turbulent parameters in coupled lpt and 3 d hydrodynamic models to overcome the limitations of existing tracking algorithms in resolving localized effects for fluvial egg drift simulation we developed a three dimensional lagrangian egg tracking model that uses fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamics i e resolved mean flow and turbulent characteristics in 3 d space with eddy defined continuous random walk algorithms to characterize the turbulent fluctuation of egg drift in this paper we apply the new model to a short representative reach of the channelized missouri river which is characterized by multiple training structures that impart substantial lateral and vertical complexity to the velocity field we provide a detailed comparison of egg drift simulations between the fully resolved 3 d hydrodynamic model with reduced dimension models with dispersion parameterization this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the model including the new parameterization of egg characteristics the continuous random walk algorithm and the initial and boundary conditions the setup of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model in the selected reach is given in section 3 the egg tracking algorithm for reduced dimension simulation is also discussed in section 3 section 4 provides the results and discussion of hydrodynamic simulation calibration and validation the performance of the egg drift model spatial and temporal egg distributions and comparison among 3 d 2 d and 1 d hydrodynamics conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 model description 2 1 egg characteristics we revisited the experimental data of density diameter and velocity for bighead carp silver carp and grass carp in george et al 2017 and determined a new set of regression equations to calculate egg characteristics the original equation for egg diameter d as a function of the post fertilization time t is 1 d t α 1 exp t β with α and β being regression coefficients from the experimental data this equation mathematically gives the initial egg a diameter of zero which is incorrect since eggs at time t 0 fertilization time have a finite size fluegg forces all calculated diameters using eq 1 that are smaller than a criterion to be a predefined minimal egg diameter however their regression equations were computed enforcing a zero intercept which contributes to inaccuracy in the predictive equation here we recompute the regression equations with the y intercept set equal to the egg diameter at t 0 fertilization time we fit the following equation to the laboratory collected data in george et al 2017 2 d t α 1 1 d min α exp t β with d d min at t 0 the regression using eq 2 is shown in fig 1 and the regression parameters are summarized in table 1 fig 1 shows the major difference occurs within 1 h post spawning when most water hardening occurs we use the same parameterization of egg density as that in fluegg and compensate for the effect of water temperature george et al 2017 garcia et al 2015 3 ρ egg ρ ρ exp t γ ρ t ref t water where ρ is density of the fully hardened egg and the ρ term describes the density change due to the effect of water hardening with t 0 the initial egg density is ρ egg ρ ρ at the reference temperature t ref 22 c at which the regression is performed the ρ term is the density compensation for temperature variation the values of the parameters are summarized in table 1 the terminal velocity of eggs in stationary water is computed by iterating the drag equation 4 ρ egg ρ g π d 3 6 1 2 c d ρ v egg 2 π d 2 4 where g is gravitational acceleration ρ is water density v egg is the terminal velocity the drag

kinematic viscosity of water fig 2 shows the comparison between the measurement data george et al 2017 and the calculated velocity using the new parameterization eqs 2 3 and 4 calculation using eqs 1 3 and 4 are plotted for reference as seen in the plot giving an initial diameter would provide better prediction of egg settling velocity in the early stage our values of egg settling velocity converged with those of the fluegg model after about 1 hour post spawning consistent with the predicted difference of egg diameter as a function of time between eqs 1 and 2 2 2 egg tracking the lagrangian egg tracking equation is written as 6 x i t δ t x i t u i t x i u i t x i u i egg t δ t where u i u i and u i egg are mean flow velocity turbulent fluctuating velocity and egg settling velocity u i egg v egg for i 3 only respectively the subscript i 1 2 3 represents the three directions in the cartesian coordinate system mean velocity u i is the time averaged flow field from a 3 d hydrodynamic model turbulent velocity u i is the solution of a stochastic differential equation known as langevin equation 7 d u i d t c 1 u i c 2 ξ i where ξ i is a standard gaussian white noise representing the random nature of the turbulent velocity the langevin equation preserves the velocity memory i e shown as velocity auto correlation while describing the random process of the turbulent fluctuations the relative importance of these two features are presented in the coefficients c 1 and c 2 legg and raupach 1982 showed c 1 1 τ i and c 2 σ i 2 τ i 0 5 where τ i is the lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies and σ i is the root mean square rms of the instantaneous velocity in each direction the stochastic differential equation eq 7 can be discretized to an equivalent markov chain

turbulence can be generated using random walk fig 3 shows an example of comparison between pure random walk and markov chain random walk in simulating turbulent velocity fluctuation with a time and velocity scale of 0 1 s and 0 1 m s respectively the auto correlation of velocity fluctuations shows that a markov chain random walk can generate a reasonable time scale of correlated velocity data compared to pure randomness from pure random walk i e auto correlation approaches zero after one time step 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the egg release location i e spawning location needs to be specified as an initial condition and must be physically within the water to initiate egg tracking the model automatically checks the user input egg release location to ensure that the egg is within the computational domain i e occupied by water the boundary of the computational domain is defined by the hydrodynamic input file i e water surface river bed and lateral walls a boundary collision algorithm must be used when an egg moves out of the computational domain for instance fluegg uses a reflective boundary condition so that all eggs remain in the computational domain until the end of the simulation garcia et al 2013 here we apply a different algorithm so that we can potentially use it to simulate egg entrapment instead of placing eggs back in the river reflectively from the boundary we place the eggs on the boundary the egg can be resuspended from the boundary or move out of domain again in the next time step if the egg keeps moving out of boundary with multiple steps in the simulation it represents entrapment of egg by the boundary however with sufficiently long time the egg would eventually escape from the entrapment due to the nature of random walk here we can define an entrapment period to prevent escape of some eggs because of the memory effect of markov chain whether the egg would escape from the entrapment in the predefined entrapment period would be determined by the velocity of collision and the time scale of local turbulence hence using a markov chain random walk provides a unique advantage for simulating egg entrapment and resuspension for potential fishery management 2 4 model setup to initiate egg tracking three dimensional river hydrodynamics must be provided as the input file to compute the movement of individual eggs in the river the input river data can be the output of 3 d hydrodynamic models or field measurement data from velocity sensors e g acoustic doppler current profilers adcps the unique feature of our model is that it needs turbulent statistics i e reynolds averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke and its dissipation rate to estimate instantaneous turbulent fluctuation using the markov chain equation tke and its dissipation rate are usually computed in reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models which are widely used in resolving river dynamics our egg tracking model can also be used with the data from time resolving models such as large eddy simulation les with the input hydrodynamic data each individual egg is tracked at each time step based on mean water velocity and turbulent fluctuations at the egg location as well as the settling velocity of the egg in the water the local egg settling velocity is calculated based on egg characteristics i e diameter density which are functions of local water properties and the time since spawning water properties can be output from hydrodynamic models or specified as a function of depth e g stratified flow for well mixed rivers a constant temperature can be specified so that water density and viscosity can be calculated the specified temperature is also needed for calculating egg growth and properties for stratified rivers temperature as a function of location needs to be given egg location is updated every time step where the properties of water and egg are then updated accordingly for the next time step a desired maximal computational time is specified as the maximal duration of egg tracking e g hatch time or estimated drift out of domain time however the actual egg tracking time depends on individual eggs there are two criteria for

1 study area and data collection the study area for the model is a representative 8 kilometer reach of the lower missouri river near lexington missouri this section of the missouri river drains approximately 1 2 million km 2 and has a mean annual discharge of approximately 1700 m 3 s streamflow gaging station 06895500 at waverly missouri us geological survey 2021 the lower missouri river has been highly altered from its natural state by flow regulation by upstream dams and channelization to stabilize banks and maintain a stable barge navigation channel galat and lipkin 2000 jacobson and galat 2006 channelization during the 19th and 20th centuries involved narrowing the active channel to 30 50 of its natural width constructing pile and rock river training structures wing dikes l head dikes and stabilizing banks with rock revetment the result of channelization is a single thread channel with diminished channel complexity at the bend scale but with increased complexity at the navigation structure scale due to strong hydraulic gradients when water flows around and over the rock structures fig 4 flows are seasonally distributed because of snow melt patterns in the upstream watershed with a typical peak around may 31 interactions with convective storms and moisture from the gulf of mexico however can also result in periodic precipitation driven high flow events during much of the year in the may june when carp are likely to spawn the 75th and 25th daily flow exceedances are 1550 and 3030 m 3 s the interquartile range of water temperatures during may june is 19 0 24

downstream from flow separation zones associated with wing dikes and as broader point bars on the inside of bends fig 4 elliott et al 2009 tracy smith et al 2012 the water surface slope is 0 00015 m m

collected during a focused field campaign from 2019 to 2020 we developed the computational mesh through integration of bathymetry collected through multi beam echo sounder surveys and independently collected aerial lidar integrated into a bathymetric topographic digital elevation model dem the river flow data used in this study is a field survey at the reach on june 4 2020 water surface profile elevations along the channel were collected using a real time corrected kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss a ship board down looking adcp workhorse rio grande teledyne inc was used to measure the river flow at 2 hz four adcp transects were conducted at each of ten cross sections fig 4 the vertical resolution is 0 5 m and horizontal resolution is roughly 1 m the instrument blanking distance and the bottom noise prevented measurements within 1 m below the water surface and 1 m above the river bed because the missouri river has a moving bed at the surveyed discharge adcp

fully 3 d hydrodynamic modeling was carried out for the reach with the discharge of 3062 m 3 s this discharge represents approximately 25 daily flow exceedance for the spawning and drift season may june fig 5 shows the model generated channel geometry and the mesh superimposed onto the geometry file flow discharge and hydrostatic pressure were selected for upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively water elevation levels were specified at both ends of the reach from the field survey data the bed roughness was adjusted so that the measured surface water elevation along the river was used to calibrate the model see fig 4 a mesh independence study was carried along with the model calibration we selected three different sets of mesh coarse 16 16 1 6 m 768 708 cells medium 8 8 0 8 m 6 143 376 cells fine 4 4 0 4 m 49 053 215 cells to test whether the simulation is dependent on the grid size after the satisfactory mesh selection and model calibration the velocity

algorithms using the 2 d hydrodynamic data first we followed the same crw algorithm but using depth averaged tke and dissipation to simulate turbulent fluctuation at each 2 d location i e replacing k and ɛ with k and ɛ in eqs 9 and 10 respectively because there is no variation of flow characteristics in the vertical direction under the 2 d condition the vertical movement of egg must be empirically solved we use the random displacement method as used in fluegg garcia et al 2013 15 z t δ t z t w w egg δ t k v z δ t ξ 2 k v z t 1 2 k v z δ t δ t where k v is the vertical dispersion coefficient

garcia et al 2013 to estimate the horizontal dispersion coefficient k h 20 k h 0 6 h u we note that the scaling coefficient of 0 6 in the equation is for transverse mixing and is strongly affected by river morphology in slowly meandering and irregular sidewall rivers 0 6 is a practical value for the range of 0 4 0 8 fischer et al 1979 for a longitudinal dispersion coefficient the coefficient may be much higher e g the elder s solution for a logarithmic velocity profile gives k h 5 93 h u fischer et al 1979 for convenience we name the egg tracking model with fully 3d hydrodynamic data tracking model a or 3 d model the model using 2 d depth averaged hydrodynamic input horizontal crw and vertical random displacement is named tracking model b or 2 d k ɛ model while the model using dispersion coefficients is named tracking model c or 2 d dispersion coefficient model in this study we also applied fluegg v3 0 2 with the same hydrodynamic data where the 3 d hydrodynamic data was averaged across the entire river cross section based on a 8 m grid size in the stream wise direction to obtain 1 d flow characteristics hence we can term fluegg as 1 d dispersion coefficient model note that all models are three dimensional egg tracking the dimension in the model name represents that of hydrodynamics data 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamics the results of model calibration and the mesh independence study are shown in fig 6 the water surface elevation was measured along approximately 7 km stream wise distance in the reach and was compared with modeling results using three different mesh sizes we found overall agreement between the measured data and the modeling output the mean errors of water surface elevation are 6 2 cm 3 7 cm and 1 0 cm for coarse medium and fine mesh sizes compared to the mean water depth of 8 m the discrepancies between measurement and modeling correspond to an overall error of 0 77 0 46 and 0 13 respectively we note that refining grid size would also increase the resolution of the river bed profile and the shape of lateral walls and hydraulic structures in the river hence we expect small differences among different mesh sizes even though the numerical simulation is converged with respect to the mesh size given the overall agreement of using different mesh sizes from calibration we chose to use the fine mesh 4 4 0 4 m for our final hydrodynamic model we initialized our model using the coarse grid after reaching convergence we updated the model to the medium mesh to restart the model and then updated it to the fine mesh for the final model results the measured velocities were used to evaluate our final model results fig 7 shows an example of the comparison of three velocity components between measurements and modeling at cross section number 10 in fig 7 both measurements and modeling data show distinct flow patterns in the main channel and the region between the left bank and the longitudinal dike about 80 m from the left bank visual examination shows an overall good agreement to capture the flow patterns in the cross section figs 8 10 show the cross sectional profiles of depth averaged stream wise velocity u s transverse velocity u t and vertical velocity u v at five selected cross sections we note that the adcp measurements are only averaged from four transects and hence represent more or less the instantaneous velocity as such substantial spatial fluctuations are observed along each cross section in contrast the cfd results represent the flow characteristics of the quasi steady state solution and hence are much smoother nevertheless the agreement between measurements and modeling is good to provide quantitative measures of model performance compared with adcp data cross sectional averaged velocities are plotted for model results against measurements fig 11 the root mean square error rmse was 0 034 and 0 029 m s for u s and u t respectively corresponding to 2 5 and 2 1 of the mean flow 4 2 egg transport simulated silver carp eggs n 6600 were released at the water surface uniformly distributed at 33 locations across the entire river at about 500 m downstream of the upstream boundary fig 12 carp eggs were tracked each second until they flowed out of the computational domain or were entrapped by the river bed or lateral wall fig 12 shows four snapshots of egg transport in the river with the time interval of 0 5 h videos of egg transport are provided in supplementary files the simulation shows that eggs are advected downstream by river flow where the spatial distribution of eggs in the river is primarily shaped by the cross sectional profile of water velocity strong dispersion was found in the river particularly around wing dikes due to large local velocity gradients i e more spreading in these regions the simulation also shows substantial entrapment of eggs see supplementary videos and black dots in fig 12 where eggs are slowed temporary detention or trapped retained for the predefined duration detention and retention are especially evident around dikes with high topographic variability we note that detention and retention are determined by the algorithm which may not represent actual egg movement or settlement in rivers however it provides information on the likelihood for eggs slowing and or being retained in the vicinity of these areas with low velocities and high vorticities the comparison of different tracking models shows different performances in predicting egg transport in the river see fig 13 at t 0 5 hr and fig 14 at t 1 0 hr the supplementary video shows the entire simulation duration for all three models the tracking models using 2 d depth averaged velocity agree well with that using fully 3 d hydrodynamic data for the advection of the eggs in the stream wise direction i e all models show a similar pattern of egg distribution with similar time of arrival of the front of egg cloud however the 2 d k ɛ model has substantially less spreading in the river compared to the other models this suggests that the random walk algorithm using depth averaged turbulent quantities would underestimate egg dispersion compared to the random walk using localized turbulent parameters the prediction of egg dispersion using empirical equations of dispersion coefficients along with depth averaged hydrodynamic data i e tracking model c agrees generally well with that using fully 3 d turbulent data for both advection and diffusion the 2 d dispersion coefficient model relies on accurate estimations of shear velocity as well as the parameterization of dispersion coefficients and turbulent viscosity from the simulation results the 2 d dispersion coefficient model seems to slightly overestimate the transverse dispersion compared to the 3 d model the overestimate of transverse dispersion and underestimate of longitudinal dispersion is likely due to the same scaling coefficient being used in the horizontal dispersion coefficient i e eq 20 in fact the longitudinal dispersion should be stronger than the transverse dispersion fischer et al 1979 as shown in our 3 d model result we also note that egg detention and retention are substantially reduced in 2 d models due to different tracking algorithms in the vertical direction i e empirical equations versus random walk with local turbulence therefore the fully 3 d model has a better capability to estimate egg detention and or retention caused by in stream hydraulic structures the mean location of eggs in the river as a function of time is plotted in fig 15 demonstrating the performance of different models for predicting overall egg transport including fluegg the fluegg simulation stopped once eggs started to flow out of computational domain we stopped the simulation at 1 h after the egg release for this case for the other tracking models all retained eggs are excluded from the data in this plot the simulation results show that mean egg location is predicted further downstream by fluegg than other models the 3 d model has the slowest mean downstream transport due to significant longitudinal dispersion see later figs 16 and 17 however note that fluegg does not handle the uniform distribution of eggs in the channel as an initial condition hence the simulated scenarios between fluegg and other models are not exactly the same in fact fluegg predicts the transport of eggs from the same release point in an averaged flow field does not represents egg release in the center of the channel either hence more or less represents the uniform distribution of egg release across the channel the mean egg location in the transverse direction is largely determined by the lateral movement of water as a result of river morphology in our simulation the mean egg location shifts slightly towards the left bank y w 0 5 within the first 0 5 hr and then shifts towards the right bank y w 0 5 thereafter primarily due to the curvature of the river channel the models with vertical dispersion equations i e both 2 d models and fluegg predict similar mean egg locations in the vertical direction as a function of time after the initial settling the mean vertical location is generally at the half flow depth z h 0 5 due to the almost uniform distribution in the water column the 3 d model shows slower sinking of the egg cloud at the initial stage and the mean egg location seems to continue decreasing downstream the longitudinal distribution of eggs at t 0 5 hr and 1 0 hr is shown in figs 16 and 17 models with 2 d or 3 d hydrodynamic data show a long tail of egg distribution in the upstream direction due to reduction of downstream drift when eggs interact with vortices caused by the wing dikes some eggs are detained or retained locally which also contribute to the highly skewed distribution fluegg does not allow eggs to be retained and hence presents a gaussian like shape of the egg distribution at t 0 5 hr at t 1 0 hr two peaks are observed which is due to the reduced velocities of some eggs close to the left bank while reaching the boundary around x 4000 m similar peaks are observed in other models except for the 3 d model where that second peak was smoothed out by the strong effect of longitudinal dispersion the models with 2 d or 3 d hydrodynamics show an overall agreement of egg distribution except for the fact that 3 d model predicts that more eggs are retained in dike areas the leading edge of the egg distribution shows a gaussian like shape in the 3 d model with increasing time post spawn more obvious in fig 17 but the results of 2 d models show a sharp leading edge the single large peak in the egg distribution in 2 d k ɛ model results is clearly the result of weak turbulent diffusion although the shear dispersion due to lateral velocity gradient was captured the primary dispersion of eggs predicted by model b is due to the spatial velocity gradient in the depth averaged flow field model c uses the horizontal dispersion coefficient to model the random movement of eggs in the horizontal direction which seems to overestimate the lateral movement see fig 14 and may underestimate the longitudinal diffusion showing a sharp leading edge of the egg distribution the difference of egg distributions predicted by models with different dimensions is well described by the conceptual diagram in heer et al 2020 4 3 discussion the egg tracking model presented here serves the same purpose as fluegg but updates the lagrangian particle tracking algorithms using fully resolved turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate in three dimensional space this allows detailed examination of how localized features in large rivers e g wing dikes affect the dispersion of the eggs as well as egg retention and resuspension here we demonstrated the model performance using three different tracking algorithms along with fluegg in the test reach the model with 3 d hydrodynamic data shows various mechanisms of egg transport strong dispersion due to spatial velocity gradients in river cross sections strong effects of wing dikes on slowing down egg movement and potential mechanisms of egg retention the comparison between egg tracking using 3 d hydrodynamics with those using 2 d depth averaged hydrodynamics provides meaningful insights about how egg tracking should be performed with a depth averaged flow field our simulation data show that employment of a random walk using depth averaged turbulence i e tracking model b tends to underestimate egg dispersion and thus is not a desirable method for studying drift of carp eggs however the empirical equations using dispersion coefficient and turbulent viscosity provide generally good agreement for predicting egg dispersion in the river using fully 3 d hydrodynamics a main difference of using 3 d hydrodynamic data versus depth averaged data is the vertical transport of eggs the markov chain random walk used in our model considers the turbulent nature of water flows i e velocity correlation in the time scale this nature is transferred to egg movement giving correlated egg velocity over small time intervals with empirical equations the turbulence is fully randomized by assignments of random numbers multiplied by a factor determined by the vertical and horizontal dispersion coefficients see eqs 15 and 20 hence two limitations are present 1 dispersion coefficient equations may have a large range of scaling coefficients in different river sections and discharges 2 the pure randomization does not truly represent the nature of turbulence we note that egg tracking using 1 d hydrodynamic data i e fluegg provides useful egg drift data in three dimensional space with a remarkably fast simulation compared to higher dimensional models however it misses the detailed information of egg retention resuspension and the effects of in stream hydraulic structures on egg transport hence we suggest using high dimensional hydrodynamics to drive egg drift simulation models if hydrodynamic data and computational time are available necessary simplifications such as using coarse resolution data or using depth averaged hydrodynamic data can be adopted to reduce computational time if empirical dispersion equations are used to calculate egg dispersal validation of parameterization of dispersion coefficients and turbulent viscosity may be needed to increase model accuracy lastly it is important to point out that we do not have ground truth data to validate the egg tracking nor do we fully understand the ecological implications of different predicted egg distributions furthermore the purpose of the model comparison is not to show which model is better but rather to provide a better understanding of the behavior of different models each model has its own advantages and limitations that make it fit for different applications the 3 d model we present here provides an additional tool that is suitable for characterizing the effect of localized river turbulence on egg transport at spatial scales of meters although applied here to carp egg transport similar models have broad implications for understanding transport phenomena in rivers similar to carps endangered pallid sturgeon larvae are thought to be passively transported long distances downstream in the missouri river and their fate survival or death by starvation is thought to be linked to reach scale hydrodynamics that serve to move larvae from the fast and food poor navigation channel into supportive marginal habitats jacobson et al 2016 channel re engineering to increase interception of sturgeon larvae from the main channel into shallow slow rearing habitat has been an emphasis of the missouri river recovery program fischenich et al 2018 but little consideration has been given to interactions between efforts to recover the pallid sturgeon and potential effects on carp populations improved understanding of turbulence mediated particle transport may be applied as well to understanding ecologically important transport processes for sediment invertebrates and particulate organic matter 5 conclusions in this work we present a new 3 d lagrangian particle tracking model to study transport of eggs of grass silver and bighead carps the new model includes a set of new governing equations to calculate egg diameter density and terminal settling velocity as a function of time since spawning and water temperature the markov chain equation is used to estimate evolution of turbulent velocity using resolved turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate a case study of an 8 km reach of the missouri river was conducted to demonstrate performance of the egg tracking model the selected river reach has strong secondary flows induced by river morphology and various sized turbulent eddies caused by wing dikes we calibrated the hydrodynamic model using measured water surface elevation and validated the model using velocity data at ten cross sections in the river measured with an adcp the output of the reynolds averaged data i e quasi steady state velocity and turbulent statistics are used to drive the egg tracking model comparison of egg tracking models using fully 3 d hydrodynamics and depth averaged hydrodynamics shows generally good agreement of egg transport patterns demonstrating the primary role of mean flow advection and dispersion caused by the spatial gradient in river cross sections the 3 d model has a unique capability to capture the effects of strong localized turbulence on egg retention particularly for those in the vertical direction caused by the in stream hydraulic structures model performance suggests random walk using depth averaged turbulent statistics tends to underestimate the turbulent diffusion however tracking using empirical equations of dispersion coefficients agrees fairly well with the results under fully 3 d hydrodynamics in simulating the dispersion of carp eggs in the river we note the accuracy of modeling with 2 d data depends on the reliability of the dispersion coefficient parameterization which may be river dependent and should be validated prior to modeling fluegg was tested for the same conditions and compared with the new model with higher dimensional hydrodynamics even though fluegg does not resolve spatial gradients in river cross sections it provides useful information about the overall dispersion of eggs in rivers with a short computational time and substantially less hydraulic data again validation of the empirical equations using dispersion coefficients may be needed for individual rivers ultimately model evaluation should be established with field collections of eggs and evaluations of egg survival such efforts have been recently carried out for validating egg transport models using field egg capture data heer et al 2020 in summary the proposed egg tracking model driven by 3 d hydrodynamics is able to use local turbulence data to estimate egg transport in highly heterogeneous hydraulic conditions one key advantage of our model is that it does not require the empirical estimation of turbulent dispersion coefficients in the river with a cost of more data required and computational time the algorithm used in our model has a potential to be used for designing hydraulic structures to maximize or minimize egg retention as drift models are now being used both where these carps are highly desirable foodfishes yang et al 2019 and where they are considered invasive species embke et al 2019 our study can

distribution of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility patterns is lacking we synthesised three existing soil and smb c n p stoichiometric ratio datasets with newly collected data to create a dataset containing 4 363 records we devised a novel method for interpreting these data in which the scatter plot representing the smb c p soil c p y axis to smb c n soil c n x axis

flexibility line parallel to the y axis and 4 both c n and c p exhibit flexibility concentrated at a single point applying this model to the large dataset we found that microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility exhibit geographical patterns related to biome type soil type and precipitation and more specifically that natural ecosystems exhibit pattern 1 whereas agroecosystems exhibit pattern 3 our findings also indicate that the smb c p soil c p and the smb c n soil c n relationships can be expressed as a simple function and are maintained by different microbial responses

present study was to identify key environmental factors that simultaneously alter microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility in addition we aimed at clarifying in what ways microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility respond to variation in soil nutrient statuses in this study we took a new approach to the interpretation of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility from datasets on consumer stoichiometry smb c n and c p and on resource stoichiometry soil c n and c p we provided the four relational expressions figs 1 a b that we considered the

sites 2 2 synthesis overview we synthesised the data described in section 2 1 with that from the datasets published by cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 and xu et al 2013 all data points represent the soil layer from the surface to a depth of 0 4 m sampling site latitudes ranged from 77 s to 83 n if geographic information was lacking in the publications we determined the latitude based on the names of the study sites the mat and map ranged from 23 to 30 c and 80 to 5 100 mm respectively across the range of studies reviewed the data were collected using various methods to measure the smb c n and p detailed in xu et al 2013 however the chloroform fumigation incubation and fumigation extraction methods were commonly used we categorised the data from cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 and the present study according to the 11 major natural biomes from which the samples were obtained boreal forest temperate coniferous forest temperate broadleaf forest tropical subtropical forest mixed forest grassland shrub tundra desert natural wetland and savanna based on xu et al 2013 however the information available in the literature was not always sufficient to accurately classify the biomes and ecosystems in addition in the three existing datasets several biomes and ecosystems are aggregated because of an insufficient quantity of data e g grassland and savanna we did not apply these same data handling methods to the data we collected although all agroecosystems are categorised as cropland with or without pasture in the existing datasets hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 we added new agroecosystem categories cropland paddy orchard and pasture where we defined cropland to include upland field crops such as vegetables maize and soybean we divided the agroecosystems into tropical subtropical 30 0 s to 30 0 n and temperate and boreal 30 0 n to 66 5 n and 30 0 s to 66 5 s respectively zones to capture the latitudinal gradients of the smb physiological patterns the data pairs were categorised into 27 major soil types based on the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2014 where the soil type was not mentioned in the publication we estimated the soil type from the available soil and geographic information in some articles only the soil organic c n and p concentrations were listed rather than the soil total concentrations soil c n and p summary data for the smb and soil c n and p stoichiometry are presented as geometric mean values unless otherwise indicated all units for the c n and p concentrations in the smb and soil were unified to mol kg 1 and all ratios expressed on a molar basis the latest version of this dataset including bibliographic information is available from the web based data depository doi 10 5281 zenodo 5803964 2 3 novel interpretation based on the large data synthesis we classified the smb soil c n and c p stoichiometry into four patterns fig 1a and transformed them into a single graph by plotting the relationship between the smb c p soil c p y axis of fig 1b and the smb c n soil c n x axis of fig 1b when the smb c n and c p are both in homeostasis fig 1a pattern 1 the smb c n remains constant whereas the soil c n varies and the smb c p remains constant whereas the soil c p varies plotting the smb c p divided by the soil c p against the smb c n divided by the soil c n yields line 1 in fig 1b which shows a positive correlation when both the smb c n and c p are non homeostatic fig 1a pattern 4 the smb c n varies as the soil c n varies and the smb c p varies as the soil c p varies plotting the smb c p divided by the soil c p against the smb c n divided by the soil c n yields point 4 in fig 1b lines 2 and 3 in fig 1b indicate homeostasis of the smb c n and non homeostasis of the smb c p fig 1a pattern 2 and non homeostasis of the smb c n and homeostasis of the smb c p fig 1a pattern 3 respectively geometric mean values of the c n and c p stoichiometry for the soil and smb were determined from the dataset the smb soil c n and c p were held constant at their respective mean values for homeostasis and were varied from their respective mean values for non homeostasis we denote the log10 transformed x axis smb c n soil c n as cn and the log10 transformed y axis smb c p soil c p as cp throughout the remainder of the manuscript the plot of smb c p soil c p against smb c n soil c n can be divided into four regions each with a different nutrient status of the soil environment fig 1c enabling us to understand how the microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility are maintained in each region quadrant i in fig 1c represents a nutrient sufficient status where the smb c n and c p are higher than the soil c n and c p cp 1 and cn 1 and release of the two nutrients taken up by the smb occurs whereas quadrant iii represents a nutrient deficient status where the smb c n and c p are lower than the soil c n and c p cp 1 and cn 1 and immobilisation of both nutrients occurs quadrants ii and iv in fig 1c indicate a n deficient and p sufficient status and a n sufficient and p deficient status respectively 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using the r software program version 4 1 0 r development core team 2021 the smb and soil c n c p and n p were log10 transformed to improve the normality of the distributions supplementary fig 1 because c n and p stoichiometries in various biomes and ecosystems often exhibit a log normal distribution sterner and elser 2002 hartman and richardson 2013 we used our novel method to visualise the microbial physiological traits or patterns from our combined dataset categorised by biomes and ecosystems and environmental factors such as latitude mat map soil types and soil ph because the number of data points for several of the environmental factors were insufficient for robust statistical analysis we excluded categories with less than 4 data points we used the following procedure to categorise patterns in the distributions of subsets of our data fig 2 1 check if there is a significant positive correlation of cp with cn use linear regression to test for cp and cn correlation at the α 0 001 0 01 or 0 05 levels for each of the environmental factor categories table 1 2 if yes the distribution of the data subset is classified as pattern 1 3 if no calculate the root mean square error rmse values to determine which model best fits the data subset pattern 2 pattern 3 or pattern 4 4 assign the subset to the pattern with the lowest rmse value pattern 1 prioritised whether the data subsets for each category of environmental factors were a regression model with a slope in this study we assessed whether the distribution of cn and cp by biomes and ecosystems was consistent with the segmentation obtained using the k means clustering algorithm when the data can be grouped by natural and agroecosystems the cohen s kappa coefficient by k means clustering approaches 1 the kappa scores were defined as showing κ 0 2 poor agreement 0 2 κ 0 4 fair agreement 0 4 κ 0 6 moderate agreement 0 6 κ 0 8 good agreement and κ 0 8 very good agreement 3 results the c n p stoichiometry was 43 6 1 for the smb and 128 9 1 for the soil supplementary table 1 the smb c n p stoichiometry was within the range of previously reported values of 42 96 6 9 1 whereas the soil c p and n p stoichiometry values were lower than the previously reported values of 186 402 13 21 1 cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 this may reflect the relatively larger proportion of agricultural soils in our dataset compared to previously reported data when the smb c n and c p were both in homeostasis fig 1a pattern 1 the smb c n remained constant geometric mean 7 16 supplementary table 1 whereas the soil c n varied from 1 88 to 136 mean 14 2 similarly when the smb c p remained constant mean 54 3 the soil c p varied from 4 17 to 3 97 104 mean 129 when both the smb c n and c p were non homeostatic fig 1a pattern 4 the smb c n varied from 0 08 to 85 7 as the soil c n varied from 1 88 to 136 and the smb c p varied from 0 07 to 5 94 103 as the soil c p varied from 4 17 to 3 97 104 patterns 2 and 3 fig 1b are associated with only c n and only c p homeostasis respectively these ratios were calculated individually for each data point collected from the literature based on the geometric means of all data points collected from the literature lines 1 2 and 3 in fig 1b were expressed by the following equations cp 0 833 cn p 0 001 smb c p soil c p smb c n soil c n 0 833 cp 0 420 and cn 0 504 respectively point 4 in fig 1b was expressed as cn cp 0 504 0 420 when all the data were analysed without considering the environmental factors the relationship between cn and cp was classified as pattern 1 and could be explained using the equation cp 1 109 cn 0 203 p 0 001 n 380 r 2 0 276 smb c p soil c p 0 627 smb c n soil c n 1 109 table 1 the result indicated that both the microbial c n and c p stoichiometric ratios were largely in homeostasis fig 1a when the data were categorised by biomes and ecosystems the natural biomes and ecosystems were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 table 1 more specifically tropical subtropical forest n 93 and savanna 13 were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 table 1 whereas the others were classified as pattern 3 when temperate coniferous 10 broadleaf 38 and boreal 3 forests or grasslands 46 and pasture 24 were aggregated they were also classified as pattern 1 p 0 05 tundra 14 natural wetlands 5 and shrub 6 were classified as pattern 3 in contrast the agroecosystems except pasture showed no positive correlation between cn and cp and were classified as pattern 3 table 1 and fig 3 a these results indicated that the smb c n was stoichiometrically flexible whereas the smb c p was in homeostasis fig 1a similar to the biomes and ecosystems category each category of map could be classified as either pattern 1 or 3 however we did not identify a trend along the precipitation gradient table 1 and fig 3b categorised by soil type the data were classified as either pattern 1 acrisols cambisols and fluvisols p 0 001 and anthrosols p 0 01 table 1 or pattern 3 andosols arenosols ferralsols gleysols luvisols and vertisols table 1 and fig 3c almost all categories of latitude fig 3d mat fig 3e and soil ph fig 3f were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 to 0 05 table 1 we determined that the biomes and ecosystems fig 3a and the environmental factors that exhibited physiological patterns 1 and 3 map fig 3b and soil type fig 3c were more sensitive to changes in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility than the other environmental factors in this study no data subsets were clearly categorised as patterns 2 or 4 in the present study the cn and cp values tended to decrease with increasing latitude from the tropical subtropical to the temperate regions to the boreal forests fig 4 a b in boreal and temperate regions all data from the natural biomes and agroecosystems were distributed in quadrant ii and iii on the left in fig 1c over a wide range of cp 0 01 cp 10 a narrow range of cn 0 1 cn 1 and below a 1 1 line cp cn only for natural biomes the temperate agroecosystems were distributed in quadrants ii and iii whereas the temperate natural biomes and ecosystems were distributed only in quadrant iii and had much lower cp values than the agroecosystems κ 0 681 p 0 001 fig 4a we found that the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions had an n deficient status these natural biomes and agroecosystems showed c n homeostasis and flexibility respectively through microbial n immobilisation table 1 fig 4a in tropical subtropical regions data from the natural biomes and agroecosystems classified into quadrants i iii and iv with wide ranges of both cn and cp 0 1 cn or cp 10 and below a 1 1 line cp cn only for natural biomes fig 4b the tropical subtropical natural biomes and ecosystems and agroecosystems overlapped in quadrants iii and iv κ 0 272 p 0 025 fig 4b the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the tropical subtropical regions were widely distributed in quadrants reflecting soils with both n deficient and n sufficient statuses fig 1c natural biomes maintained c n homeostasis and agroecosystems maintained c n flexibility via n immobilisation in soils with both n deficient statuses and via n mineralisation in soils with both n sufficient statuses table 1 figs 1c and 4b natural biomes and agroecosystems with p poor soils lower quadrants maintained c p homeostasis via p immobilisation whereas those with p rich soils upper quadrants maintained c p homeostasis via p mineralisation table 1 figs 1c and 4b comparing the natural and agroecosystems in more detail data reflecting artificial flooding of rice paddies was distributed in quadrants i and ii and showed substantially larger cp values compared to the natural wetlands quadrant iii κ 0 656 p 0 428 fig 4c grassland and pasture data were distributed in the same quadrant quadrant iii however these two ecosystems were categorised into different data distribution patterns κ 0 604 p 0 001 fig 4d it was not possible to separate the data for cropland and paddy soils into different groups κ 0 362 p 0 625 figs 4a b c 4 discussion 4 1 geographic patterns of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility the novel interpretation we propose highlights that the four patterns of stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility of smb c n and smb c p can be classified according to differences in biomes and ecosystems map and soil type table 1 figs 3a 3b 3c in particular the pattern was different for nutrient rich soils such as occur in agroecosystems where fertilisers are applied and for nutrient poor soils such as those found in natural biomes and ecosystems soil microorganisms are considered to be largely homeostatic however this idea is inconsistent with the significant differences in microbial c n p stoichiometric ratios found across biomes and ecosystem types mooshammer et al 2014 zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 here we have shown that geographical patterns in microbial stoichiometric flexibility are expressed specifically in relation to biomes and ecosystems and the environmental factors map and soil type table 1 although latitude mat and soil ph are important environmental factors that affect microbial c use efficiency cue and extracellular enzyme production sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 sinsabaugh et al 2016 as well as microbial abundance and community composition e g rousk et al 2009 hartman and richardson 2013 kaiser et al 2016 we found that they were not strongly correlated with variation in microbial stoichiometric flexibility table 1 4 2 environmental factors correlated with microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility microbial stoichiometric flexibility can be exhibited by organisms or by entire ecosystems based on changes in the c n p stoichiometry of individuals or the microbial community and on shifts in community structure sistla and schimel 2012 fanin et al 2017 the degree of stoichiometric flexibility varies among microbial communities with different metabolic and stoichiometric properties and extracellular enzyme capabilities empirical evidence has also been reported which indicates that microbial communities control cue and n p use efficiency n p ue mooshammer et al 2014 to maintain microbial physiological traits in response to soil nutrient status in the present study differences among biomes and ecosystems and changes in the environmental factors map and soil types table 1 figs 3a 3b 3c may cause adjustments in c and elemental balance and shifts in microbial community composition that affect microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility microbial community structure differs among biomes and ecosystems hartman et al 2008 in the present study we showed there was a clear difference between natural ecosystems pattern 1 and agroecosystems except pastures pattern 3 fig 3a this may be because agricultural management practices such as flooding drenovsky et al 2004 during the rice growing season soil acidification by n fertilisation rousk et al 2009 and soc input management li et al 2015 may have more substantial impacts regarding the effects of map soil water availability determined by interactions between map mat and annual evaporation is a key factor that influences the smb c to soc ratio serna chavez et al 2013 which may change the capacity of c release by causing microbial community changes however the effect of precipitation on microbial dynamics remains controversial for example precipitation has major effects on microbial community composition in semi arid areas yang et al 2021 however only minor effects on microbial community composition are evident based on a global meta analysis ren et al 2018 in the present study microbial physiological patterns appeared to be sensitive to map but the trend associated with the map gradient was not clear table 1 fig 3b in relation to the effects of soil type soil properties such as texture soc ph and the soil c n ratio can also determine the fungal and bacterial biomass c and its ratio to some extent hartman et al 2008 fierer et al 2009 kaiser et al 2016 he et al 2020 in the present study the andosols gleysols and ferralsols classified as pattern 3 table 1 fig 3c were distinguished as a similar group with iron and aluminium chemistry soil properties and were closely distributed in quadrant iii for soils with a low available p level such as andosols the immobilisation of p within the soil microorganisms as an intermediate pool between the total soil p and available p pools is an important mechanism for regulating the supply of available p sugito and shinano 2013 the expression of c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility among soil types with common soil properties may be attributed to the soil microbial community however these relationships need further analysis 4 3 microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility in relation to soil nutrient statuses as the soil nutrient status changes between quadrants fig 1c the smb maintains c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility via different microbial reactions mineralisation or immobilisation in soils with a nutrient deficient status such as highly weathered soils vitousek and sanford 1986 yang et al 2013 limiting elements are immobilised within the smb and are more intensively reused however in soils with a nutrient sufficient status excess elements are released as a result of the adaptation of microbial element use efficiency mooshammer et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in the present study most of the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions had an n deficient status and there was significant difference in the ratio of smb c p to soil c p between them figs 1c and 4a those in the tropical subtropical regions were distributed in soils with both n deficient and n sufficient statuses and no significant difference in the ratio of smb c p to soil c p was detected between them figs 1c and 4b the findings of the present study suggested that temperate regions are associated with a greater anthropogenic influence on microbial physiological responses compared to that in tropical subtropical regions some soil microorganisms in tropical subtropical regions are able to release both nutrients via mineralisation because their cn and cp 1 quadrant i in fig 1c despite the chronic deficiency of p in the soil a similar observation has been made for plant litter in tropical natural ecosystems manzoni et al 2010 it appears that in the tropics decomposers of plant litter adapt to soils with a p deficient status by increasing the threshold elemental ratio i e ter c p frost et al 2006 of c and p to enable p release in the present study when the smb c n and c p were both in homeostasis the relationship between cn and cp was located below the 1 1 line fig 3a suggesting that the smb preferentially took up more p than n a comparison of the c n p ratios of various terrestrial ecosystems also showed that more p than n is usually retained zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 a finding consistent with the results of the present study du et al 2020 estimated that 82 of the natural terrestrial ecosystem is limited by p or co limited by n and p showing a strong latitudinal gradient the homeostatic responses of the smb c p could be viewed as reflecting much more widespread limitation by soil p bioavailability than previously estimated du et al 2020 hou et al 2020 4 4 microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility under natural and agroecosystems one of the causes of the differences in the microbial physiological patterns among natural and agroecosystems is thought to be the input of artificially synthesised fertilisers in global analyses nitrogen input has been shown to exhibit negative impacts on microbial growth and activity treseder 2008 zhang et al 2018 sistla et al 2015 hypothesised that stoichiometric flexibility of c n and c p can mainly occur either 1 when the smb is limited by added n or p or 2 when luxury uptake of n or p which is not accompanied by an increase in microbial growth occurs without n or p limitation and 3 when the growth rate of an individual and microbial community is relatively slow i e little c uptake the previous study tested these hypotheses by a global meta analysis and demonstrated that the stoichiometric flexibility of c n or c p in response to fertilisation increases with lower resource availability i e more nutrient limited status and with greater initial biomass c n or c p i e lower growth rate applying these conditions to the present study it was thought that the n inputs to soils distributed in quadrants ii and iii fig 1c cn 1 which were originally limited by n and in quadrants i and iv fig 1c cn 1 which were not originally limited by n and in which luxury uptake occurred would result in microbial c n stoichiometric flexibility for relatively slow growing species fig 3a the latter condition is considered applicable to agroecosystems this is supported by the results of a modelling study showing that anthropogenic n inputs and other improvements alleviate soil resource limitations on soil microorganisms cui et al 2021 however conditions 1 and 3 or 2 and 3 could not be applied to the smb c p in this study in the natural ecosystems of the tropical rainforest fanin et al 2017 and temperate deciduous forest heuck et al 2015 biomes the smb c p exhibited weak flexibility in association with p fertilisation this trend also seems to be more pronounced with lower environmental nutrient availability and with more nutrient limited soil microorganisms sistla et al 2015 when cn and cp were calculated from fanin et al 2017 and plotted on our diagram fig 1b they were all distributed in quadrant iii reflecting soil with a nutrient deficient status showing a wide range of cp 0 01 cp 1 a narrow range of cn 0 1 cn 1 and a 1 1 line in summary our findings indicated that more c p as well as c n homoeostatic microbial organisms or communities in nutrient poor natural biomes and ecosystems pattern 1 could be shifted to less homoeostatic individuals or communities pattern 3 due to changes in the soil nutrient status caused by anthropogenic disturbance in the agroecosystems table 1 and fig 3a another striking difference between the natural and agroecosystems was that the paddy soils exhibited a much higher cp compared to that of the wetland biome soils fig 4c and paddy soil data were distributed in all quadrants our results are consistent with the smb data reported by li et al 2012 their available data also indicated that paddies possess substantially higher cp than natural ecosystems and distributed in quadrants ii and iv where p or n are rich flooded paddies are the largest anthropogenic wetlands kögel knabner et al 2010 paddy soils are generally anaerobic when flooded during the rice growing season and then become aerobic when they are drained during the non cropping season in addition to fertilisation changes in soil management from permanently saturated wetlands to seasonally flooded paddies not only significantly decrease the soil nutrients but also lead to a shift in the structure of the soil microbial community wang et al 2011 a recent global synthesis has provided evidence that natural grassland has bacteria dominated communities in contrast to all other native biomes which are partially responsible for suppression of som decomposition and nitrification deng et al 2018 grazing can greatly reduce bacterial and fungal communities however this is dependent on the intensity of grazing in the pasture zhao et al 2017 the findings of these studies indicate that the soil microbial communities have different rates of c and nutrient cycling which may support the different data distributions between natural grassland and pasture that were evident in the present study fig 4d 4 5 global patterns between smb c n soil c n and smb c p soil c p co limitation for each environmental factor category showing pattern 1 we found a simple correlation between cn and cp which could be expressed by the simple power function table 1 cp 1 109 cn 0 203 p 0 001 n 380 r 2 0 276 smb c p soil c p 0 627 smb c n soil c n 1 109 table 1 the larger the slope of the regression line representing the relationship between cn and cp table 1 the more stoichiometric flexibility cn tended to exhibit pattern 3 and the smaller the slope the more stoichiometric flexibility cp tended to exhibit pattern 2 according to frost et al 2006 the element ratio at which growth and metabolism switches from c limitation i e nutrient mineralisation to nutrient limitation i e nutrient immobilisation is known as ter and is rearranged as follows smb c n p ter c n p cue n p ue where smb c n p is exactly met by soil resource c n p ter c n p given cue and n p ue that is smb c n p soil c n p 1 as shown in fig 1c divergence from this exactly balanced condition represents the distance from microbial stoichiometric homeostasis in a manner comparable to the focus of the study described in this section sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 extended this conceptual relationship to extracellular enzyme activity eea and suggested that the term ter c n p smb c n p is proportional to eea c n p smb c n p soil c n p sinsabaugh et al 2016 estimated cue by applying eea through ter which can be rearranged as smb c n p soil c n p cue eea c n p kx cuemax cue where kx is the half saturation coefficient 0 5 and cuemax is the maximum constant 0 6 the expression of extracellular enzymes is a product of cellular metabolism that is specifically regulated by the availability of nutrients in the environment therefore their eea reflects the microbial nutrient needs in relation to supply sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 as this formulation includes eea and cue or n p ue it represents microbial physiological traits in response to soil nutrient status which is consistent with our study thus modelling and theoretical research on the role of soil microbial processes in c n and p biogeochemical cycles have evolved to incorporate a combination of conceptual models such as est ter stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 cui et al 2021 our interpretation can be placed in the context of these broader studies in particular we quantified the microbial physiological traits in different categories of biomes and ecosystems and environmental factors the slope of the relationship between cn and cp increased with increasing map decreasing mat and increasing soil ph except for a soil ph 4 5 and 7 9 table 1 and figs 3b 3e 3f suggesting that the smb c n may change the degree of stoichiometric flexibility to adapt to their soil environments this relationship may reflect cn and cp co limitation nutrient co limitation has recently been reported across the globe elser et al 2007 harpole et al 2011 peñuelas et al 2013 occurring when plants and soil microorganisms are limited by the availability of two or more particular nutrients and the addition of either or both nutrients is required to stimulate growth čapek et al 2018 co limitation involving n and p is mechanistically explained by a close metabolic link between nutrients at the molecular level marklein and houlton 2012 because c n and p cycles are stoichiometrically coupled increased n input is known to enhance p cycling in a wide variety of terrestrial ecosystems marklein and houlton 2012 in addition the responses of the soil c cycle in models that include nutrient feedbacks by incorporating the c n and p coupling concept are quite different from those without nutrient feedbacks suggesting the importance of nutrient limitation on the terrestrial c sink thornton et al 2007 wang et al 2010 wieder et al 2015 although our evidence of co limitation of cn and cp may leave room for debate there is potential to advance our understanding and modeling of microbially mediated nutrient fluxes in response to c and nutrient limitations du et al 2020 4 6 study limitations and improvements previous studies have observed whether the smb expresses stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility in fertilisation experiments using an index called h to show the degree to which the smb maintains its c n p stoichiometric ratios when soil resource availability is changed sterner and elser 2002 however it was not known whether these observed patterns of stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility could be seen across spatial scales construction of this large dataset enabled us to take patterns in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility observed in natural ecosystems and agroecosystems at local scales and scale them up to reveal global patterns however sources of uncertainty remain in the practical application of our method to categorise patterns 1 4 data for the c n and p concentrations in both soil and smb must be available even though our synthesis included all available data sample numbers for some categories were low n 4 table 1 consequently it will be important to retest these patterns as more data accumulate in particular to determine if there are environmental factors or categories that indicate patterns 2 and 4 some categories of biomes ecological and environmental factors have minimal differences in the rmse values calculated from patterns 2 3 and 4 e g gleysols this suggests that patterns need to be retested as sample sizes increase we note that soc and total nutrient concentrations may be poor predictors of microbially accessible nutrients due to the high degree of variability in the decomposability of c compounds trap et al 2016 however fierer et al 2009 reported that soc may be a better predictor of smb c than other soil properties p 0 001 there is much room for debate on how to determine nutrient accessibility to soil microorganisms recent reports have proposed a method to evaluate som that takes into account the chemical and physical stabilisation processes of som and the accessibility of som to soil microorganisms wagai et al 2015 agroecosystems should receive more attention in global scale analysis of c and nutrient cycles associated with changes in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility as evidenced by the fact that all agricultural management types are categorised as cropland in the existing available large dataset agroecosystems are a major non point source of both nitrates and phosphates to surface water and groundwater supplies as well as of co2 ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere in order to quantify the contribution of such sources to n and p eutrophication and global warming the c n and p that cycles through the smb in various agroecosystems needs to be better understood and reflected in models the classified patterns of microbial physiological traits provide a novel framework to incorporate variable microbial processes in process based biogeochemical models our approach using large microbial datasets may overcome the scale up mismatch problem of applying the model at a global scale 5 conclusions by interpreting new datasets in a new way we confirmed that patterns of microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility can vary with differences in biomes and ecosystems map and soil type diagrammatically we divided the soil environment into four regions on the basis of nutrient status and showed how soil microorganisms in each region respond to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility patterns our novel interpretation provides key evidence on broad scale geographic patterns of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility and may improve our understanding of where how and to what degree the shift from stoichiometric homeostasis to stoichiometric flexibility or vice versa will affect c and nutrient dynamics credit authorship contribution statement k asada conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

24429,the soil microbial biomass smb adapts to altered soil resources either by maintaining roughly constant stoichiometry to soil carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p availability or by shifting to the elemental balance in the soil although a shift from stoichiometric homeostasis to flexibility or vice versa may affect terrestrial c and nutrient dynamics a holistic understanding of the global distribution of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility patterns is lacking we synthesised three existing soil and smb c n p stoichiometric ratio datasets with newly collected data to create a dataset containing 4 363 records we devised a novel method for interpreting these data in which the scatter plot representing the smb c p soil c p y axis to smb c n soil c n x axis relationship is classified into four distinct patterns 1 both c n and c p are in homeostasis along the 1 1 line 2 only c p exhibits flexibility line parallel to the x axis 3 only c n exhibits flexibility line parallel to the y axis and 4 both c n and c p exhibit flexibility concentrated at a single point applying this model to the large dataset we found that microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility exhibit geographical patterns related to biome type soil type and precipitation and more specifically that natural ecosystems exhibit pattern 1 whereas agroecosystems exhibit pattern 3 our findings also indicate that the smb c p soil c p and the smb c n soil c n relationships can be expressed as a simple function and are maintained by different microbial responses

present study was to identify key environmental factors that simultaneously alter microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility in addition we aimed at clarifying in what ways microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility respond to variation in soil nutrient statuses in this study we took a new approach to the interpretation of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility from datasets on consumer stoichiometry smb c n and c p and on resource stoichiometry soil c n and c p we provided the four relational expressions figs 1 a b that we considered the distribution of the data should show if 1 both the smb c n and c p are in homeostasis 2 the smb c n is in homeostasis but the smb c p is flexible 3 the smb c n is flexible but the smb c p is in homeostasis or 4 both the smb c n and c p are flexible we collected a total of 4 363 data points by combining existing soil and smb datasets cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 with 890 independently collected data points applying a novel interpretation to these new datasets we focused on three main hypotheses 1 the four patterns are determined by different environmental factors 2 microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility exhibit distinct geographic patterns and 3 microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility respond differently to soil nutrient status 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection using the scopus online database http www scopus com and agriknowledge http agriknowledge affrc go jp we searched for peer reviewed articles that contained the keywords soil microbial biomass and carbon nitrogen or phosphorus we refined the search using the terms soil c soil n and soil p we collected smb and soil total c n and p data concentrations and ratios from published studies not included in the existing smb datasets cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 studies were excluded if we could not easily interpret the smb and total soil c n and p molar concentrations or ratios from the text graphs or tables provided by the authors our search yielded 80 studies that included 717 smb c n 130 smb c p and 130 smb n p data pairs that were used in the data analysis associated study site information was also retrieved from published studies including longitude latitude elevation mean annual temperature mat mean annual precipitation map soil type and soil ph these being the variables usually recorded to reflect the most common environmental factors at soil sampling sites 2 2 synthesis overview we synthesised the data described in section 2 1 with that from the datasets published by cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 and xu et al 2013 all data points represent the soil layer from the surface to a depth of 0 4 m sampling site latitudes ranged from 77 s to 83 n if geographic information was lacking in the publications we determined the latitude based on the names of the study sites the mat and map ranged from 23 to 30 c and 80 to 5 100 mm respectively across the range of studies reviewed the data were collected using various methods to measure the smb c n and p detailed in xu et al 2013 however the chloroform fumigation incubation and fumigation extraction methods were commonly used we categorised the data from cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 and the present study according to the 11 major natural biomes from which the samples were obtained boreal forest temperate coniferous forest temperate broadleaf forest tropical subtropical forest mixed forest grassland shrub tundra desert natural wetland and savanna based on xu et al 2013 however the information available in the literature was not always sufficient to accurately classify the biomes and ecosystems in addition in the three existing datasets several biomes and ecosystems are aggregated because of an insufficient quantity of data e g grassland and savanna we did not apply these same data handling methods to the data we collected although all agroecosystems are categorised as cropland with or without pasture in the existing datasets hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 we added new agroecosystem categories cropland paddy orchard and pasture where we defined cropland to include upland field crops such as vegetables maize and soybean we divided the agroecosystems into tropical subtropical 30 0 s to 30 0 n and temperate and boreal 30 0 n to 66 5 n and 30 0 s to 66 5 s respectively zones to capture the latitudinal gradients of the smb physiological patterns the data pairs were categorised into 27 major soil types based on the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2014 where the soil type was not mentioned in the publication we estimated the soil type from the available soil and geographic information in some articles only the soil organic c n and p concentrations were listed rather than the soil total concentrations soil c n and p summary data for the smb and soil c n and p stoichiometry are presented as geometric mean values unless otherwise indicated all units for the c n and p concentrations in the smb and soil were unified to mol kg 1 and all ratios expressed on a molar basis the latest version of this dataset including bibliographic information is available from the web based data depository doi 10 5281 zenodo 5803964 2 3 novel interpretation based on the large data synthesis we classified the smb soil c n and c p stoichiometry into four patterns fig 1a and transformed them into a single graph by plotting the relationship between the smb c p soil c p y axis of fig 1b and the smb c n soil c n x axis of fig 1b when the smb c n and c p are both in homeostasis fig 1a pattern 1 the smb c n remains constant whereas the soil c n varies and the smb c p remains constant whereas the soil c p varies plotting the smb c p divided by the soil c p against the smb c n divided by the soil c n yields line 1 in fig 1b which shows a positive correlation when both the smb c n and c p are non homeostatic fig 1a pattern 4 the smb c n varies as the soil c n varies and the smb c p varies as the soil c p varies plotting the smb c p divided by the soil c p against the smb c n divided by the soil c n yields point 4 in fig 1b lines 2 and 3 in fig 1b indicate homeostasis of the smb c n and non homeostasis of the smb c p fig 1a pattern 2 and non homeostasis of the smb c n and homeostasis of the smb c p fig 1a pattern 3 respectively geometric mean values of the c n and c p stoichiometry for the soil and smb were determined from the dataset the smb soil c n and c p were held constant at their respective mean values for homeostasis and were varied from their respective mean values for non homeostasis we denote the log10 transformed x axis smb c n soil c n as cn and the log10 transformed y axis smb c p soil c p as cp throughout the remainder of the manuscript the plot of smb c p soil c p against smb c n soil c n can be divided into four regions each with a different nutrient status of the soil environment fig 1c enabling us to understand how the microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility are maintained in each region quadrant i in fig 1c represents a nutrient sufficient status where the smb c n and c p are higher than the soil c n and c p cp 1 and cn 1 and release of the two nutrients taken up by the smb occurs whereas quadrant iii represents a nutrient deficient status where the smb c n and c p are lower than the soil c n and c p cp 1 and cn 1 and immobilisation of both nutrients occurs quadrants ii and iv in fig 1c indicate a n deficient and p sufficient status and a n sufficient and p deficient status respectively 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using the r software program version 4 1 0 r development core team 2021 the smb and soil c n c p and n p were log10 transformed to improve the normality of the distributions supplementary fig 1 because c n and p stoichiometries in various biomes and ecosystems often exhibit a log normal distribution sterner and elser 2002 hartman and richardson 2013 we used our novel method to visualise the microbial physiological traits or patterns from our combined dataset categorised by biomes and ecosystems and environmental factors such as latitude mat map soil types and soil ph because the number of data points for several of the environmental factors were insufficient for robust statistical analysis we excluded categories with less than 4 data points we used the following procedure to categorise patterns in the distributions of subsets of our data fig 2 1 check if there is a significant positive correlation of cp with cn use linear regression to test for cp and cn correlation at the α 0 001 0 01 or 0 05 levels for each of the environmental factor categories table 1 2 if yes the distribution of the data subset is classified as pattern 1 3 if no calculate the root mean square error rmse values to determine which model best fits the data subset pattern 2 pattern 3 or pattern 4 4 assign the subset to the pattern with the lowest rmse value pattern 1 prioritised whether the data subsets for each category of environmental factors were a regression model with a slope in this study we assessed whether the distribution of cn and cp by biomes and ecosystems was consistent with the segmentation obtained using the k means clustering algorithm when the data can be grouped by natural and agroecosystems the cohen s kappa coefficient by k means clustering approaches 1 the kappa scores were defined as showing κ 0 2 poor agreement 0 2 κ 0 4 fair agreement 0 4 κ 0 6 moderate agreement 0 6 κ 0 8 good agreement and κ 0 8 very good agreement 3 results the c n p stoichiometry was 43 6 1 for the smb and 128 9 1 for the soil supplementary table 1 the smb c n p stoichiometry was within the range of previously reported values of 42 96 6 9 1 whereas the soil c p and n p stoichiometry values were lower than the previously reported values of 186 402 13 21 1 cleveland and liptzin 2007 hartman and richardson 2013 xu et al 2013 this may reflect the relatively larger proportion of agricultural soils in our dataset compared to previously reported data when the smb c n and c p were both in homeostasis fig 1a pattern 1 the smb c n remained constant geometric mean 7 16 supplementary table 1 whereas the soil c n varied from 1 88 to 136 mean 14 2 similarly when the smb c p remained constant mean 54 3 the soil c p varied from 4 17 to 3 97 104 mean 129 when both the smb c n and c p were non homeostatic fig 1a pattern 4 the smb c n varied from 0 08 to 85 7 as the soil c n varied from 1 88 to 136 and the smb c p varied from 0 07 to 5 94 103 as the soil c p varied from 4 17 to 3 97 104 patterns 2 and 3 fig 1b are associated with only c n and only c p homeostasis respectively these ratios were calculated individually for each data point collected from the literature based on the geometric means of all data points collected from the literature lines 1 2 and 3 in fig 1b were expressed by the following equations cp 0 833 cn p 0 001 smb c p soil c p smb c n soil c n 0 833 cp 0 420 and cn 0 504 respectively point 4 in fig 1b was expressed as cn cp 0 504 0 420 when all the data were analysed without considering the environmental factors the relationship between cn and cp was classified as pattern 1 and could be explained using the equation cp 1 109 cn 0 203 p 0 001 n 380 r 2 0 276 smb c p soil c p 0 627 smb c n soil c n 1 109 table 1 the result indicated that both the microbial c n and c p stoichiometric ratios were largely in homeostasis fig 1a when the data were categorised by biomes and ecosystems the natural biomes and ecosystems were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 table 1 more specifically tropical subtropical forest n 93 and savanna 13 were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 table 1 whereas the others were classified as pattern 3 when temperate coniferous 10 broadleaf 38 and boreal 3 forests or grasslands 46 and pasture 24 were aggregated they were also classified as pattern 1 p 0 05 tundra 14 natural wetlands 5 and shrub 6 were classified as pattern 3 in contrast the agroecosystems except pasture showed no positive correlation between cn and cp and were classified as pattern 3 table 1 and fig 3 a these results indicated that the smb c n was stoichiometrically flexible whereas the smb c p was in homeostasis fig 1a similar to the biomes and ecosystems category each category of map could be classified as either pattern 1 or 3 however we did not identify a trend along the precipitation gradient table 1 and fig 3b categorised by soil type the data were classified as either pattern 1 acrisols cambisols and fluvisols p 0 001 and anthrosols p 0 01 table 1 or pattern 3 andosols arenosols ferralsols gleysols luvisols and vertisols table 1 and fig 3c almost all categories of latitude fig 3d mat fig 3e and soil ph fig 3f were classified as pattern 1 p 0 001 to 0 05 table 1 we determined that the biomes and ecosystems fig 3a and the environmental factors that exhibited physiological patterns 1 and 3 map fig 3b and soil type fig 3c were more sensitive to changes in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility than the other environmental factors in this study no data subsets were clearly categorised as patterns 2 or 4 in the present study the cn and cp values tended to decrease with increasing latitude from the tropical subtropical to the temperate regions to the boreal forests fig 4 a b in boreal and temperate regions all data from the natural biomes and agroecosystems were distributed in quadrant ii and iii on the left in fig 1c over a wide range of cp 0 01 cp 10 a narrow range of cn 0 1 cn 1 and below a 1 1 line cp cn only for natural biomes the temperate agroecosystems were distributed in quadrants ii and iii whereas the temperate natural biomes and ecosystems were distributed only in quadrant iii and had much lower cp values than the agroecosystems κ 0 681 p 0 001 fig 4a we found that the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions had an n deficient status these natural biomes and agroecosystems showed c n homeostasis and flexibility respectively through microbial n immobilisation table 1 fig 4a in tropical subtropical regions data from the natural biomes and agroecosystems classified into quadrants i iii and iv with wide ranges of both cn and cp 0 1 cn or cp 10 and below a 1 1 line cp cn only for natural biomes fig 4b the tropical subtropical natural biomes and ecosystems and agroecosystems overlapped in quadrants iii and iv κ 0 272 p 0 025 fig 4b the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the tropical subtropical regions were widely distributed in quadrants reflecting soils with both n deficient and n sufficient statuses fig 1c natural biomes maintained c n homeostasis and agroecosystems maintained c n flexibility via n immobilisation in soils with both n deficient statuses and via n mineralisation in soils with both n sufficient statuses table 1 figs 1c and 4b natural biomes and agroecosystems with p poor soils lower quadrants maintained c p homeostasis via p immobilisation whereas those with p rich soils upper quadrants maintained c p homeostasis via p mineralisation table 1 figs 1c and 4b comparing the natural and agroecosystems in more detail data reflecting artificial flooding of rice paddies was distributed in quadrants i and ii and showed substantially larger cp values compared to the natural wetlands quadrant iii κ 0 656 p 0 428 fig 4c grassland and pasture data were distributed in the same quadrant quadrant iii however these two ecosystems were categorised into different data distribution patterns κ 0 604 p 0 001 fig 4d it was not possible to separate the data for cropland and paddy soils into different groups κ 0 362 p 0 625 figs 4a b c 4 discussion 4 1 geographic patterns of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility the novel interpretation we propose highlights that the four patterns of stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility of smb c n and smb c p can be classified according to differences in biomes and ecosystems map and soil type table 1 figs 3a 3b 3c in particular the pattern was different for nutrient rich soils such as occur in agroecosystems where fertilisers are applied and for nutrient poor soils such as those found in natural biomes and ecosystems soil microorganisms are considered to be largely homeostatic however this idea is inconsistent with the significant differences in microbial c n p stoichiometric ratios found across biomes and ecosystem types mooshammer et al 2014 zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 here we have shown that geographical patterns in microbial stoichiometric flexibility are expressed specifically in relation to biomes and ecosystems and the environmental factors map and soil type table 1 although latitude mat and soil ph are important environmental factors that affect microbial c use efficiency cue and extracellular enzyme production sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 sinsabaugh et al 2016 as well as microbial abundance and community composition e g rousk et al 2009 hartman and richardson 2013 kaiser et al 2016 we found that they were not strongly correlated with variation in microbial stoichiometric flexibility table 1 4 2 environmental factors correlated with microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility microbial stoichiometric flexibility can be exhibited by organisms or by entire ecosystems based on changes in the c n p stoichiometry of individuals or the microbial community and on shifts in community structure sistla and schimel 2012 fanin et al 2017 the degree of stoichiometric flexibility varies among microbial communities with different metabolic and stoichiometric properties and extracellular enzyme capabilities empirical evidence has also been reported which indicates that microbial communities control cue and n p use efficiency n p ue mooshammer et al 2014 to maintain microbial physiological traits in response to soil nutrient status in the present study differences among biomes and ecosystems and changes in the environmental factors map and soil types table 1 figs 3a 3b 3c may cause adjustments in c and elemental balance and shifts in microbial community composition that affect microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility microbial community structure differs among biomes and ecosystems hartman et al 2008 in the present study we showed there was a clear difference between natural ecosystems pattern 1 and agroecosystems except pastures pattern 3 fig 3a this may be because agricultural management practices such as flooding drenovsky et al 2004 during the rice growing season soil acidification by n fertilisation rousk et al 2009 and soc input management li et al 2015 may have more substantial impacts regarding the effects of map soil water availability determined by interactions between map mat and annual evaporation is a key factor that influences the smb c to soc ratio serna chavez et al 2013 which may change the capacity of c release by causing microbial community changes however the effect of precipitation on microbial dynamics remains controversial for example precipitation has major effects on microbial community composition in semi arid areas yang et al 2021 however only minor effects on microbial community composition are evident based on a global meta analysis ren et al 2018 in the present study microbial physiological patterns appeared to be sensitive to map but the trend associated with the map gradient was not clear table 1 fig 3b in relation to the effects of soil type soil properties such as texture soc ph and the soil c n ratio can also determine the fungal and bacterial biomass c and its ratio to some extent hartman et al 2008 fierer et al 2009 kaiser et al 2016 he et al 2020 in the present study the andosols gleysols and ferralsols classified as pattern 3 table 1 fig 3c were distinguished as a similar group with iron and aluminium chemistry soil properties and were closely distributed in quadrant iii for soils with a low available p level such as andosols the immobilisation of p within the soil microorganisms as an intermediate pool between the total soil p and available p pools is an important mechanism for regulating the supply of available p sugito and shinano 2013 the expression of c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility among soil types with common soil properties may be attributed to the soil microbial community however these relationships need further analysis 4 3 microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility in relation to soil nutrient statuses as the soil nutrient status changes between quadrants fig 1c the smb maintains c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility via different microbial reactions mineralisation or immobilisation in soils with a nutrient deficient status such as highly weathered soils vitousek and sanford 1986 yang et al 2013 limiting elements are immobilised within the smb and are more intensively reused however in soils with a nutrient sufficient status excess elements are released as a result of the adaptation of microbial element use efficiency mooshammer et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in the present study most of the natural biomes and agroecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions had an n deficient status and there was significant difference in the ratio of smb c p to soil c p between them figs 1c and 4a those in the tropical subtropical regions were distributed in soils with both n deficient and n sufficient statuses and no significant difference in the ratio of smb c p to soil c p was detected between them figs 1c and 4b the findings of the present study suggested that temperate regions are associated with a greater anthropogenic influence on microbial physiological responses compared to that in tropical subtropical regions some soil microorganisms in tropical subtropical regions are able to release both nutrients via mineralisation because their cn and cp 1 quadrant i in fig 1c despite the chronic deficiency of p in the soil a similar observation has been made for plant litter in tropical natural ecosystems manzoni et al 2010 it appears that in the tropics decomposers of plant litter adapt to soils with a p deficient status by increasing the threshold elemental ratio i e ter c p frost et al 2006 of c and p to enable p release in the present study when the smb c n and c p were both in homeostasis the relationship between cn and cp was located below the 1 1 line fig 3a suggesting that the smb preferentially took up more p than n a comparison of the c n p ratios of various terrestrial ecosystems also showed that more p than n is usually retained zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 a finding consistent with the results of the present study du et al 2020 estimated that 82 of the natural terrestrial ecosystem is limited by p or co limited by n and p showing a strong latitudinal gradient the homeostatic responses of the smb c p could be viewed as reflecting much more widespread limitation by soil p bioavailability than previously estimated du et al 2020 hou et al 2020 4 4 microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility under natural and agroecosystems one of the causes of the differences in the microbial physiological patterns among natural and agroecosystems is thought to be the input of artificially synthesised fertilisers in global analyses nitrogen input has been shown to exhibit negative impacts on microbial growth and activity treseder 2008 zhang et al 2018 sistla et al 2015 hypothesised that stoichiometric flexibility of c n and c p can mainly occur either 1 when the smb is limited by added n or p or 2 when luxury uptake of n or p which is not accompanied by an increase in microbial growth occurs without n or p limitation and 3 when the growth rate of an individual and microbial community is relatively slow i e little c uptake the previous study tested these hypotheses by a global meta analysis and demonstrated that the stoichiometric flexibility of c n or c p in response to fertilisation increases with lower resource availability i e more nutrient limited status and with greater initial biomass c n or c p i e lower growth rate applying these conditions to the present study it was thought that the n inputs to soils distributed in quadrants ii and iii fig 1c cn 1 which were originally limited by n and in quadrants i and iv fig 1c cn 1 which were not originally limited by n and in which luxury uptake occurred would result in microbial c n stoichiometric flexibility for relatively slow growing species fig 3a the latter condition is considered applicable to agroecosystems this is supported by the results of a modelling study showing that anthropogenic n inputs and other improvements alleviate soil resource limitations on soil microorganisms cui et al 2021 however conditions 1 and 3 or 2 and 3 could not be applied to the smb c p in this study in the natural ecosystems of the tropical rainforest fanin et al 2017 and temperate deciduous forest heuck et al 2015 biomes the smb c p exhibited weak flexibility in association with p fertilisation this trend also seems to be more pronounced with lower environmental nutrient availability and with more nutrient limited soil microorganisms sistla et al 2015 when cn and cp were calculated from fanin et al 2017 and plotted on our diagram fig 1b they were all distributed in quadrant iii reflecting soil with a nutrient deficient status showing a wide range of cp 0 01 cp 1 a narrow range of cn 0 1 cn 1 and a 1 1 line in summary our findings indicated that more c p as well as c n homoeostatic microbial organisms or communities in nutrient poor natural biomes and ecosystems pattern 1 could be shifted to less homoeostatic individuals or communities pattern 3 due to changes in the soil nutrient status caused by anthropogenic disturbance in the agroecosystems table 1 and fig 3a another striking difference between the natural and agroecosystems was that the paddy soils exhibited a much higher cp compared to that of the wetland biome soils fig 4c and paddy soil data were distributed in all quadrants our results are consistent with the smb data reported by li et al 2012 their available data also indicated that paddies possess substantially higher cp than natural ecosystems and distributed in quadrants ii and iv where p or n are rich flooded paddies are the largest anthropogenic wetlands kögel knabner et al 2010 paddy soils are generally anaerobic when flooded during the rice growing season and then become aerobic when they are drained during the non cropping season in addition to fertilisation changes in soil management from permanently saturated wetlands to seasonally flooded paddies not only significantly decrease the soil nutrients but also lead to a shift in the structure of the soil microbial community wang et al 2011 a recent global synthesis has provided evidence that natural grassland has bacteria dominated communities in contrast to all other native biomes which are partially responsible for suppression of som decomposition and nitrification deng et al 2018 grazing can greatly reduce bacterial and fungal communities however this is dependent on the intensity of grazing in the pasture zhao et al 2017 the findings of these studies indicate that the soil microbial communities have different rates of c and nutrient cycling which may support the different data distributions between natural grassland and pasture that were evident in the present study fig 4d 4 5 global patterns between smb c n soil c n and smb c p soil c p co limitation for each environmental factor category showing pattern 1 we found a simple correlation between cn and cp which could be expressed by the simple power function table 1 cp 1 109 cn 0 203 p 0 001 n 380 r 2 0 276 smb c p soil c p 0 627 smb c n soil c n 1 109 table 1 the larger the slope of the regression line representing the relationship between cn and cp table 1 the more stoichiometric flexibility cn tended to exhibit pattern 3 and the smaller the slope the more stoichiometric flexibility cp tended to exhibit pattern 2 according to frost et al 2006 the element ratio at which growth and metabolism switches from c limitation i e nutrient mineralisation to nutrient limitation i e nutrient immobilisation is known as ter and is rearranged as follows smb c n p ter c n p cue n p ue where smb c n p is exactly met by soil resource c n p ter c n p given cue and n p ue that is smb c n p soil c n p 1 as shown in fig 1c divergence from this exactly balanced condition represents the distance from microbial stoichiometric homeostasis in a manner comparable to the focus of the study described in this section sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 extended this conceptual relationship to extracellular enzyme activity eea and suggested that the term ter c n p smb c n p is proportional to eea c n p smb c n p soil c n p sinsabaugh et al 2016 estimated cue by applying eea through ter which can be rearranged as smb c n p soil c n p cue eea c n p kx cuemax cue where kx is the half saturation coefficient 0 5 and cuemax is the maximum constant 0 6 the expression of extracellular enzymes is a product of cellular metabolism that is specifically regulated by the availability of nutrients in the environment therefore their eea reflects the microbial nutrient needs in relation to supply sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 as this formulation includes eea and cue or n p ue it represents microbial physiological traits in response to soil nutrient status which is consistent with our study thus modelling and theoretical research on the role of soil microbial processes in c n and p biogeochemical cycles have evolved to incorporate a combination of conceptual models such as est ter stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 cui et al 2021 our interpretation can be placed in the context of these broader studies in particular we quantified the microbial physiological traits in different categories of biomes and ecosystems and environmental factors the slope of the relationship between cn and cp increased with increasing map decreasing mat and increasing soil ph except for a soil ph 4 5 and 7 9 table 1 and figs 3b 3e 3f suggesting that the smb c n may change the degree of stoichiometric flexibility to adapt to their soil environments this relationship may reflect cn and cp co limitation nutrient co limitation has recently been reported across the globe elser et al 2007 harpole et al 2011 peñuelas et al 2013 occurring when plants and soil microorganisms are limited by the availability of two or more particular nutrients and the addition of either or both nutrients is required to stimulate growth čapek et al 2018 co limitation involving n and p is mechanistically explained by a close metabolic link between nutrients at the molecular level marklein and houlton 2012 because c n and p cycles are stoichiometrically coupled increased n input is known to enhance p cycling in a wide variety of terrestrial ecosystems marklein and houlton 2012 in addition the responses of the soil c cycle in models that include nutrient feedbacks by incorporating the c n and p coupling concept are quite different from those without nutrient feedbacks suggesting the importance of nutrient limitation on the terrestrial c sink thornton et al 2007 wang et al 2010 wieder et al 2015 although our evidence of co limitation of cn and cp may leave room for debate there is potential to advance our understanding and modeling of microbially mediated nutrient fluxes in response to c and nutrient limitations du et al 2020 4 6 study limitations and improvements previous studies have observed whether the smb expresses stoichiometric homeostasis or flexibility in fertilisation experiments using an index called h to show the degree to which the smb maintains its c n p stoichiometric ratios when soil resource availability is changed sterner and elser 2002 however it was not known whether these observed patterns of stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility could be seen across spatial scales construction of this large dataset enabled us to take patterns in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility observed in natural ecosystems and agroecosystems at local scales and scale them up to reveal global patterns however sources of uncertainty remain in the practical application of our method to categorise patterns 1 4 data for the c n and p concentrations in both soil and smb must be available even though our synthesis included all available data sample numbers for some categories were low n 4 table 1 consequently it will be important to retest these patterns as more data accumulate in particular to determine if there are environmental factors or categories that indicate patterns 2 and 4 some categories of biomes ecological and environmental factors have minimal differences in the rmse values calculated from patterns 2 3 and 4 e g gleysols this suggests that patterns need to be retested as sample sizes increase we note that soc and total nutrient concentrations may be poor predictors of microbially accessible nutrients due to the high degree of variability in the decomposability of c compounds trap et al 2016 however fierer et al 2009 reported that soc may be a better predictor of smb c than other soil properties p 0 001 there is much room for debate on how to determine nutrient accessibility to soil microorganisms recent reports have proposed a method to evaluate som that takes into account the chemical and physical stabilisation processes of som and the accessibility of som to soil microorganisms wagai et al 2015 agroecosystems should receive more attention in global scale analysis of c and nutrient cycles associated with changes in microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility as evidenced by the fact that all agricultural management types are categorised as cropland in the existing available large dataset agroecosystems are a major non point source of both nitrates and phosphates to surface water and groundwater supplies as well as of co2 ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere in order to quantify the contribution of such sources to n and p eutrophication and global warming the c n and p that cycles through the smb in various agroecosystems needs to be better understood and reflected in models the classified patterns of microbial physiological traits provide a novel framework to incorporate variable microbial processes in process based biogeochemical models our approach using large microbial datasets may overcome the scale up mismatch problem of applying the model at a global scale 5 conclusions by interpreting new datasets in a new way we confirmed that patterns of microbial c n and c p stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility can vary with differences in biomes and ecosystems map and soil type diagrammatically we divided the soil environment into four regions on the basis of nutrient status and showed how soil microorganisms in each region respond to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility patterns our novel interpretation provides key evidence on broad scale geographic patterns of microbial stoichiometric homeostasis and flexibility and may improve our understanding of where how and to what degree the shift from stoichiometric homeostasis to stoichiometric flexibility or vice versa will affect c and nutrient dynamics credit authorship contribution statement k asada conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft
