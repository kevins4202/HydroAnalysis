distribution and its values of moments uncertain parameters obtained in the field of naval architecture and ocean engineering naoe often have multi source and heterogeneous characteristics which are quite suitably described by interval numbers thus in recent years interval optimization has attracted increasing attention and applications in the naoe field chen chen and xiong 2009 researched the multi object multi layer grey evaluation method for the optimal selection of ship forms where interval number was used to express the uncertainty of the technical index hou hou et al 2017 studied the

system and the randomness of interval optimization in this case is analysed 2 uncertainty characteristics of ice loads vessel sailing in ice areas would be subjected to continuous load impact from all directions and the load would show significant uncertainty characteristic of a probability distribution such experimental data were derived from an expedition voyage in the west part of the barents sea in march 2007 the data were obtained by instrumenting with fibre optic strain sensors on several locations along the hull eight frames on the bow area and one frame on the starboard side to measure the strain responses suyuthi et al 2012 intercepting a relatively stable time range generated the data amount n 556 and the frequency 1 hz and the data time sequence and some main statistical indicators are shown in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the data s skewness and kurtosis have large values indicating a far from normal distribution thus the time series of the measured ice induced load appears as a sequence of spikes to maximise the uncertainty of the spikes values in quantitative modelling it is reasonable to express the special time series in an interval form the interval midpoint can be set as the mathematical expectation of the ice load series and the interval radius can be set according to the characteristics of the studied problem specifically interval numbers with constant and multiple radiuses can effectively describe the ice load sequence the larger the radius is the higher the uncertainty of the interval becomes and the more unexpected features of the real situation can be included in the consequence study ice load is transformed into the ice load coefficient according to the calculation model whose interval characteristics are also similar to those of ice load 3

efficiency of ship it is necessary to ensure that vessel speed v s is between the maximum power speed v min and the maximum design speed v max in summary the eeoi optimization model in this research

introduction to interval method interval number is composed of a pair of ordered real numbers which has the dual characteristics of set and value the idea of interval mathematics originated in 1930s british scholar young 1931 first described interval arithmetic and gave the rules of real number set calculation interval number is a type of number expressed by an interval as is shown 6 a i a l a r where a l a r r and a l a r a l and a r is the upper and lower bound of interval number a i when a l a r a i turns out to be a real with deterministic value for interval numbers a i and b i interval order relationship expressed by m w can be used to evaluate their degrees 7 a i m w b i o n l y i f m a i m b i a n d w a i w b i a i m w b i o n l y i f a i m w b i a n d a i b i 8 m a i a l a r 2 w a i a r a l 2 m b i b l b r 2 w b i b r b l 2 where m is the midpoint of interval and w is the radius 4 2 theory of interval optimization for the optimization model with interval number the possible values of objective function and constraint condition caused by uncertainty are usually expressed by interval form the above problems cannot be solved by the traditional deterministic optimization method whose judgment is based on the specific value of the objective function and constraints at each design vector therefore an interval based uncertain optimization method is proposed interval uncertainty optimization problem can be described as 9 o p t min f x u s t g x u b i b l b r x ω n u u i i u i l u i r i 1 2 q where x is design variable with n dimensions and its range is ω n u is uncertain vector with q dimensions and its uncertainty is described by an interval number u i f and g is objective function and restrictive condition respectively which is related to x and u b i is the allowable interval of uncertain restrictive condition objective function above can be transformed to certainty based on interval order relationship 10 min m f x u w f x u m f x u 1 2 f l x f r x w f x u 1 2 f r x f l x f l x min f x u f r x max f x u where min f x u and max f x u are lower and upper bounds of target when x is deterministic and u changes in interval range and are obtained by inner layer optimization weights of the two objectives midpoint and radius are given in order to achieve the single objective optimization model whose objective function is 11 o p t min 1 β m f x u β w f x u where β is the weight 0 β 1 which reflects the important of midpoint and radius of interval objective function restrictive condition is integrated into the objective function as a form of penalty function then a certainty unconstrained optimization model is established 12 o p t min f p x u f p x u 1 β m f x u β w f x u σ φ p c i d i λ φ p c i d i λ max 0 p c i d i λ 2 where σ is penalty factor with a large value φ is penalty function 4 3 interval optimization of single segment 4 3 1 calculation configuration and cases a typical characteristic of an interval optimization system is its two layer nested structure the inner layer optimization is used to find the upper and the lower limits of the objective function and constraint conditions based on the interval number the outer layer optimization is used to find the optimal design variables based on the interval objective and the constraint it is necessary to find the optimization algorithm with high applicability according to the task characteristics of each level with the development of computational science and its wide application in engineering the modern heuristic algorithm based on evolution has great advantages for such complex engineering problems this study focuses on some typical methods such as multi island genetic algorithm miga adaptive simulated annealing asa and particle swarm optimization pso all of which have good applicability to specific engineering issues nonetheless the application performance of each algorithm needs further studies in combination with practical cases design variable is set as engine speed n whose initial value is 550 r min and the design space is 500 600 r min the design objective is to find the minimum eeoi for deterministic optimization do and the minimum synthesis parameter fp for interval optimization to comprehensively compare and analyse the influence of different optimization methods and parameters 10 cases s1 s10 are listed in table 1 whose results would be significant references for subsequent analysis calculation cases involve the do which has no interval number interval optimization with a single interval number io single and interval optimization with double interval numbers io double there are great differences of the complexity of the algorithm the number of iteration steps and the cost of time between do and io in order to obtain reasonable computing cost also different optimization tasks of inner layer and outer layer lead to different requirements for the algorithm inner parameters would be different between do and io which are shown in table 2 4 3 2 calculation results and analysis according to the cases and parameters in the above section results of each case are obtained by iterative optimization calculation as shown in table 3 computer hardware is configured as cpu 2 8 ghz ram 8 0 gb as is shown in table 2 optimal eeoi of io cases s4 s10 is form of interval also vessel speed v s is also the form of interval in io cases because of v w optimization iterative curves of some typical cases are shown in fig 2 which includes different algorithms of deterministic optimization different interval number of single interval optimization and double interval optimization as shown in fig 2 all the presented iterative curves are extremely random at the initial stage the purpose is to maximise global optimization and avoid falling into local optimization once a global optimal solution is found due to the inter island connection setting of miga the subsequent iterative search shows repeated verifications with ergodic property which constantly confirms and accepts the current optimal solution according to the calculation results the algorithms applicability the interval index s weight and the interval number configuration are analysed as follows 1 applicability of algorithms the do of s1 s3 uses three different algorithms asa miga and pso asa has a locked optimal solution at the early stage of optimization so it does not need to run the maximum number of iterations asa can find the optimal solution quickly which can be terminated ahead of time and can ensure that the solution quality is good enough after reaching the convergence condition therefore asa is suitable to be used as an internal iteration algorithm for interval optimization and can find the maximum and the minimum values of objective function and constraint in a short time through single interval optimization cases s4 and s7 and double interval optimization cases s8 and s10 the performance of two different internal algorithms asa and pso can be compared the two algorithms optimization results have little difference and they can effectively find the optimal solution that meets the requirements however due to the slightly longer time consumed with the pso algorithm the two algorithms differ in efficiency as a result miga and asa can ensure that the optimization system quickly locks the objective function s upper and lower limits as well as guarantee the effectiveness of the search process and the uniqueness of the optimal solution through the multi island structure in a global design space 2 weight of radius there are two weights of the radius 0 2 and 0 5 in the above cases s4 and s5 are single interval cases while s8 and s9 are double interval cases both with different weights as shown the larger the radius weight is the smaller the comprehensive optimization target result fp opt becomes meanwhile the slightly smaller interval radius of the eeoi optimization results with a large radius weight shows that properly increasing the radius weight can effectively improve the optimization performance and narrow the range of results to be more accurate and reliable with lower uncertainty 3 configuration of interval number s4 and s6 are single interval cases with different interval numbers because the interval form of flow velocity v w brings more uncertainty to the target function the interval radius of the eeoi optimization results is larger for double interval cases because of two interval numbers in s8 the uncertainty of the output performance is increased for practical purposes to ensure the pertinence of the design process and the accuracy of the results interval numbers should be reduced as much as possible in order to avoid the blindness and the lack of pertinence caused by excessive uncertainty to the optimization solver during an operation 4 4 interval optimization of multiple segments 4 4 1 calculation configuration and cases a long distance voyage often passes through several segments with different hydrological characteristics such as velocity density distance etc thus navigation strategy is different in each segment then optimization of eeoi is necessary to maintain high energy efficiency for multi segments it is necessary to extract or define quantitative setting of uncertain parameters for each segment this section involves five different segments same midpoint and different radius of interval number are adopted interval form of two uncertain parameters is set as a series of radius midpoint ratio w m 10 20 30 configuration of design variable and optimization objective is kept the same as single segment cases shown above some parameters are different in every segment which are set v wi 5 1 4 9 5 5 4 3 3 7 km h d i 610 503 550 620 348 km and c icei 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 3 0 9 e 4 fig 3 optimization algorithm adopts miga asa combination which has high applicability in single segment in order to unify with the total steps of other working conditions max number of generated designs in asa of deterministic optimization cases is set to 5000 thus total iteration steps of do is about 5000 calculation cases of multiple segments m1 m10 are shown in table 4 4 4 2 calculation results and analysis after iterative optimization calculation results of each case are obtained as shown in table 5 as is shown in fig 3 characteristics of initial and stable stages of iterative curve are similar to those in section 4 3 2 meanwhile effect of applicability of algorithms weight of radius and configuration of interval number are similar to those in single segment chapter as an important index of interval number radius midpoint ratio w m will have an important impact on the results it makes the uncertainty represented by interval number dimensionless in a simple form and directly represents it the influence of the interval uncertainty on the calculation results can be considered by fixing the mid point of the interval and changing w m in a series table 4 contains a series of different radius midpoint ratios m4 6 for single interval and m8 10 for double intervals radius is directly related to uncertainty of interval number so that results are quite different and strongly related to radius radius midpoint ratio of this series of cases and optimization results are plotted as shown in fig 4 as is shown the larger the w m the greater the result difference between results of double interval is larger than that of single interval which is due to the greater uncertainty of double interval cases which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity of results to w m 5 stochastic analysis containing interval numbers 5 1 calculation configuration and framework when sailing in ice area many factors associated with eeoi would fluctuate randomly in a small range due to external or internal uncertainties therefore it is more scientific and reasonable to characterize them as random variables when participating in optimization design according to experience distribution type of these parameters are set as normal distribution expectation μ is fixed value of deterministic optimization and standard deviation σ is set a small proportion 10 in this research of μ in order to research influence of interval optimization design with random variables on results three methods monte carlo simulation mcs first order reliability method form and mean value reliability method mvrm are used to do the uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis framework of eeoi is shown in table 6 which indicates interval number setting rules of single and multiple segments cases and parameters of each analysis method 5 2 results and analysis according to the above table calculated results are shown in following figures and tables in order to compare effect of different interval radius on results fig 5 shows probability distributions and cumulative distributions for both single and multiple segments standard deviation of probability parameters in this example is 10 a great value in realistic problem of expectation a smaller peak value of probability of eeoi around 3 2 5 is obtained from fig 5 degree of dispersion is smaller for result of small radius than that of large radius namely the weaker the interval degree of input parameters the higher the accuracy of the results that is also consistent with the basic rule of uncertainty response fig 6 shows the probability distributions results of different methods in order to simplify under the premise of explaining the rules only 10 and 40 of interval radius are listed here fig 7 shows this comparison via bar chart and can be observed more intuitively results of form and mvrm are basically the same whatever interval radius or whether cases are multiple segments while of mcs results are slightly lower than of the above two and no regular pattern among the differences the main reason for the difference is that mcs is based on the idea of random ergodic sampling in the design space and the consistency of the results largely depends on the number of samples therefore when dealing with such uncertain response problems the calculation conditions are more dependent and inevitably the accurate analysis results will take more time more nuanced differences between form and mvrm can be seen in table 7 and which show the values of this uncertainty analysis as shown in table 7 expectation value of form and mvrm are strictly the same because of the same sampling rules standard deviation of the two have slight difference which however can be ignored in the design process 6 conclusions based on interval optimization for both single and multiple segments minimum eeoi uncertainty optimization and analysis considering probability parameters have been conducted by calculating a series of cases the influence of parameter uncertainty on the energy efficiency of a vessel sailing in an ice area is generally revealed with about 15 reduce of eeoi because of the high randomness and mutation of ice loads the interval method is reasonable and superior also the following conclusions are drawn 1 in interval optimization due to different tasks of internal and external optimization different algorithms should be selected to improve operational reliability after a comparative study the miga asa combination can enable the optimization task performance with good applicability 2 the parameter setting in interval optimization has a significant influence the weight of the radius has a negative effect on the target value while the number of intervals in the optimization directly reflects the system s uncertainty which has a huge impact on the design results the interval radius is also an important factor that influences the output response especially in double interval cases 3 the introduction of probability parameters into interval optimization increases input uncertainty thus producing an output response in accordance with a specific probability the probability influence of different analysis methods and a series of interval radius on the results can be revealed through an uncertainty analysis and then guide the practical application 4 the practical performance of energy efficiency interval optimization can be improved by further establishing the multi disciplinary calculation or simulation

introduction to interval method interval number is composed of a pair of ordered real numbers which has the dual characteristics of set and value the idea of interval mathematics originated in 1930s british scholar young 1931 first described interval arithmetic and gave the rules of real number set calculation interval number is a type of number expressed by an interval as is shown 6 a i a l a r where a l a r r and a l a r a l and a r is the upper and lower bound of interval number a i when a l a r a i turns out to be a real with deterministic value for interval numbers a i and b i interval order relationship expressed by m w can be used to evaluate their degrees 7 a i m w b i o n l y i f m a i m b i a n d w a i w b i a i m w b i o n l y i f a i m w b i a n d a i b i 8 m a i a l a r 2 w a i a r a l 2 m b i b l b r 2 w b i b r b l 2 where m is the midpoint of interval and w is the radius 4 2 theory of interval optimization for the optimization model with interval number the possible values of objective function and constraint condition caused by uncertainty are usually expressed by interval form the above problems cannot be solved by the traditional deterministic optimization method whose judgment is based on the specific value of the objective function and constraints at each design vector therefore an interval based uncertain optimization method is proposed interval uncertainty optimization problem can be described as 9 o p t min f x u s t g x u b i b l b r x ω n u u i i u i l u i r i 1 2 q where x is design variable with n dimensions and its range is ω n u is uncertain vector with q dimensions and its uncertainty is described by an interval number u i f and g is objective function and restrictive condition respectively which is related to x and u b i is the allowable interval of uncertain restrictive condition objective function above can be transformed to certainty based on interval order relationship 10 min m f x u w f x u m f x u 1 2 f l x f r x w f x u 1 2 f r x f l x f l x min f x u f r x max f x u where min f x u and max f x u are lower and upper bounds of target when x is deterministic and u changes in interval range and are obtained by inner layer optimization weights of the two objectives midpoint and radius are given in order to achieve the single objective optimization model whose objective function is 11 o p t min 1 β m f x u β w f x u where β is the weight 0 β 1 which reflects the important of midpoint and radius of interval objective function restrictive condition is integrated into the objective function as a form of penalty function then a certainty unconstrained optimization model is established 12 o p t min f p x u f p x u 1 β m f x u β w f x u σ φ p c i d i λ φ p c i d i λ max 0 p c i d i λ 2 where σ is penalty factor with a large value φ is penalty function 4 3 interval optimization of single segment 4 3 1 calculation configuration and cases a typical characteristic of an interval optimization system is its two layer nested structure the inner layer optimization is used to find the upper and the lower limits of the objective function and constraint conditions based on the interval number the outer layer optimization is used to find the optimal design variables based on the interval objective and the constraint it is necessary to find the optimization algorithm with high applicability according to the task characteristics of each level with the development of computational science and its wide application in engineering the modern heuristic algorithm based on evolution has great advantages for such complex engineering problems this study focuses on some typical methods such as multi island genetic algorithm miga adaptive simulated annealing asa and particle swarm optimization pso all of which have good applicability to specific engineering issues nonetheless the application performance of each algorithm needs further studies in combination with practical cases design variable is set as engine speed n whose initial value is 550 r min and the design space is 500 600 r min the design objective is to find the minimum eeoi for deterministic optimization do and the minimum synthesis parameter fp for interval optimization to comprehensively compare and analyse the influence of different optimization methods and parameters 10 cases s1 s10 are listed in table 1 whose results would be significant references for subsequent analysis calculation cases involve the do which has no interval number interval optimization with a single interval number io single and interval optimization with double interval numbers io double there are great differences of the complexity of the algorithm the number of iteration steps and the cost of time between do and io in order to obtain reasonable computing cost also different optimization tasks of inner layer and outer layer lead to different requirements for the algorithm inner parameters would be different between do and io which are shown in table 2 4 3 2 calculation results and analysis according to the cases and parameters in the above section results of each case are obtained by iterative optimization calculation as shown in table 3 computer hardware is configured as cpu 2 8 ghz ram 8 0 gb as is shown in table 2 optimal eeoi of io cases s4 s10 is form of interval also vessel speed v s is also the form of interval in io cases because of v w optimization iterative curves of some typical cases are shown in fig 2 which includes different algorithms of deterministic optimization different interval number of single interval optimization and double interval optimization as shown in fig 2 all the presented iterative curves are extremely random at the initial stage the purpose is to maximise global optimization and avoid falling into local optimization once a global optimal solution is found due to the inter island connection setting of miga the subsequent iterative search shows repeated verifications with ergodic property which constantly confirms and accepts the current optimal solution according to the calculation results the algorithms applicability the interval index s weight and the interval number configuration are analysed as follows 1 applicability of algorithms the do of s1 s3 uses three different algorithms asa miga and pso asa has a locked optimal solution at the early stage of optimization so it does not need to run the maximum number of iterations asa can find the optimal solution quickly which can be terminated ahead of time and can ensure that the solution quality is good enough after reaching the convergence condition therefore asa is suitable to be used as an internal iteration algorithm for interval optimization and can find the maximum and the minimum values of objective function and constraint in a short time through single interval optimization cases s4 and s7 and double interval optimization cases s8 and s10 the performance of two different internal algorithms asa and pso can be compared the two algorithms optimization results have little difference and they can effectively find the optimal solution that meets the requirements however due to the slightly longer time consumed with the pso algorithm the two algorithms differ in efficiency as a result miga and asa can ensure that the optimization system quickly locks the objective function s upper and lower limits as well as guarantee the effectiveness of the search process and the uniqueness of the optimal solution through the multi island structure in a global design space 2 weight of radius there are two weights of the radius 0 2 and 0 5 in the above cases s4 and s5 are single interval cases while s8 and s9 are double interval cases both with different weights as shown the larger the radius weight is the smaller the comprehensive optimization target result fp opt becomes meanwhile the slightly smaller interval radius of the eeoi optimization results with a large radius weight shows that properly increasing the radius weight can effectively improve the optimization performance and narrow the range of results to be more accurate and reliable with lower uncertainty 3 configuration of interval number s4 and s6 are single interval cases with different interval numbers because the interval form of flow velocity v w brings more uncertainty to the target function the interval radius of the eeoi optimization results is larger for double interval cases because of two interval numbers in s8 the uncertainty of the output performance is increased for practical purposes to ensure the pertinence of the design process and the accuracy of the results interval numbers should be reduced as much as possible in order to avoid the blindness and the lack of pertinence caused by excessive uncertainty to the optimization solver during an operation 4 4 interval optimization of multiple segments 4 4 1 calculation configuration and cases a long distance voyage often passes through several segments with different hydrological characteristics such as velocity density distance etc thus navigation strategy is different in each segment then optimization of eeoi is necessary to maintain high energy efficiency for multi segments it is necessary to extract or define quantitative setting of uncertain parameters for each segment this section involves five different segments same midpoint and different radius of interval number are adopted interval form of two uncertain parameters is set as a series of radius midpoint ratio w m 10 20 30 configuration of design variable and optimization objective is kept the same as single segment cases shown above some parameters are different in every segment which are set v wi 5 1 4 9 5 5 4 3 3 7 km h d i 610 503 550 620 348 km and c icei 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 3 0 9 e 4 fig 3 optimization algorithm adopts miga asa combination which has high applicability in single segment in order to unify with the total steps of other working conditions max number of generated designs in asa of deterministic optimization cases is set to 5000 thus total iteration steps of do is about 5000 calculation cases of multiple segments m1 m10 are shown in table 4 4 4 2 calculation results and analysis after iterative optimization calculation results of each case are obtained as shown in table 5 as is shown in fig 3 characteristics of initial and stable stages of iterative curve are similar to those in section 4 3 2 meanwhile effect of applicability of algorithms weight of radius and configuration of interval number are similar to those in single segment chapter as an important index of interval number radius midpoint ratio w m will have an important impact on the results it makes the uncertainty represented by interval number dimensionless in a simple form and directly represents it the influence of the interval uncertainty on the calculation results can be considered by fixing the mid point of the interval and changing w m in a series table 4 contains a series of different radius midpoint ratios m4 6 for single interval and m8 10 for double intervals radius is directly related to uncertainty of interval number so that results are quite different and strongly related to radius radius midpoint ratio of this series of cases and optimization results are plotted as shown in fig 4 as is shown the larger the w m the greater the result difference between results of double interval is larger than that of single interval which is due to the greater uncertainty of double interval cases which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity of results to w m 5 stochastic analysis containing interval numbers 5 1 calculation configuration and framework when sailing in ice area many factors associated with eeoi would fluctuate randomly in a small range due to external or internal uncertainties therefore it is more scientific and reasonable to characterize them as random variables when participating in optimization design according to experience distribution type of these parameters are set as normal distribution expectation μ is fixed value of deterministic optimization and standard deviation σ is set a small proportion 10 in this research of μ in order to research influence of interval optimization design with random variables on results three methods monte carlo simulation mcs first order reliability method form and mean value reliability method mvrm are used to do the uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis framework of eeoi is shown in table 6 which indicates interval number setting rules of single and multiple segments cases and parameters of each analysis method 5 2 results and analysis according to the above table calculated results are shown in following figures and tables in order to compare effect of different interval radius on results fig 5 shows probability distributions and cumulative distributions for both single and multiple segments standard deviation of probability parameters in this example is 10 a great value in realistic problem of expectation a smaller peak value of probability of eeoi around 3 2 5 is obtained from fig 5 degree of dispersion is smaller for result of small radius than that of large radius namely the weaker the interval degree of input parameters the higher the accuracy of the results that is also consistent with the basic rule of uncertainty response fig 6 shows the probability distributions results of different methods in order to simplify under the premise of explaining the rules only 10 and 40 of interval radius are listed here fig 7 shows this comparison via bar chart and can be observed more intuitively results of form and mvrm are basically the same whatever interval radius or whether cases are multiple segments while of mcs results are slightly lower than of the above two and no regular pattern among the differences the main reason for the difference is that mcs is based on the idea of random ergodic sampling in the design space and the consistency of the results largely depends on the number of samples therefore when dealing with such uncertain response problems the calculation conditions are more dependent and inevitably the accurate analysis results will take more time more nuanced differences between form and mvrm can be seen in table 7 and which show the values of this uncertainty analysis as shown in table 7 expectation value of form and mvrm are strictly the same because of the same sampling rules standard deviation of the two have slight difference which however can be ignored in the design process 6 conclusions based on interval optimization for both single and multiple segments minimum eeoi uncertainty optimization and analysis considering probability parameters have been conducted by calculating a series of cases the influence of parameter uncertainty on the energy efficiency of a vessel sailing in an ice area is generally revealed with about 15 reduce of eeoi because of the high randomness and mutation of ice loads the interval method is reasonable and superior also the following conclusions are drawn 1 in interval optimization due to different tasks of internal and external optimization different algorithms should be selected to improve operational reliability after a comparative study the miga asa combination can enable the optimization task performance with good applicability 2 the parameter setting in interval optimization has a significant influence the weight of the radius has a negative effect on the target value while the number of intervals in the optimization directly reflects the system s uncertainty which has a huge impact on the design results the interval radius is also an important factor that influences the output response especially in double interval cases 3 the introduction of probability parameters into interval optimization increases input uncertainty thus producing an output response in accordance with a specific probability the probability influence of different analysis methods and a series of interval radius on the results can be revealed through an uncertainty analysis and then guide the practical application 4 the practical performance of energy efficiency interval optimization can be improved by further establishing the multi disciplinary calculation or simulation

20686,as a key device in subsea production system of the offshore hydrocarbon resources exploitation the umbilical consists of a variety of functional components such as hydraulic tubes electrical cables and optical cables the cross sectional layout design plays an important role in the performance of an umbilical considering the mechanical and geometrical properties as the quantitative design objectives the mathematical model of multi objective optimization of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical is described meanwhile the algorithm of smallest radius of the enclosing circle and the multiplier penalty function method are proposed then the manufacture factor is considered and the layering strategy based on the identification of contact points is introduced to modify implement algorithm to obtain the optimal cross sectional layout with layering characteristic finally some case studies are performed the optimal cross sectional layouts with layering characteristic are obtained comparing with the initial design and cross sectional layouts without layering the results verify the feasibility of the presented optimization design algorithm which can improve the design efficiency of an umbilical and avoid the manual process keywords umbilical cross sectional layout multi objective layering strategy optimization design 1 introduction umbilicals are widely applied in the subsea production system of the offshore oil and gas exploitation which is the key remote controlling device typically connecting the floating platform on the sea surface and the manifold at the seabed see fig 1 a several functions are performed by the umbilical such as providing the hydraulic power controlling signal and chemicals transmission channel knapp et al 1991 therefore an umbilical consists of a variety of functional components such as hydraulic tubes steel tubes or hoses electrical cables and optical cables which are bundled together and encased in a single line in a certain cross sectional layout as shown in fig 1 b knapp et al 2007 with the recent increase of the offshore hydrocarbon resources exploitation at the deep water depth the umbilical s application is expected to integrate more controlling functions therefore the number of functional components in the cross section of an umbilical sees an increasing trend chen et al 2016 the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical has an impact on the performance of an umbilical which influences the geometrical and mechanical properties the umbilical with different cross sectional layouts perform the different properties given a certain umbilical structure yue 2013 presented the theoretical methodology based on the curve beam theory to calculate the cross sectional tensional stiffness of an umbilical the results were compared with the tensile test results and the theoretical methodology considering cross sectional radial shrinkage was validated sævik 2002 assumed that the helical functional components only occur axial deformation without lateral displacement when an umbilical performs the bending behavior the methodology based on the sliding routine loxodromic curve was proposed to obtain the stiffness and stress of an umbilical under bending behavior lukassen 2019 gave an assumption that there was the lateral displacement of helical functional components under the bending behavior the theoretical methodology based on the sliding routine geodesic curve was presented to calculate the mechanical properties of an umbilical dai 2020 addressed the stresses in dynamic steel tube umbilicals under loads combining tension and bending corresponding to the top connection with the floater through the experimental tests a beam and penalty contact modeling procedure were applied to describe the extreme stress behavior and further validated against measured dynamic axial stress gustavsen 2009 analyzed the thermal electrical and magnetic distribution and loss characteristics of an umbilical with a certain cross section when electrical cables transmitted the power it was found that the high temperature due to the heat release could cause the material aging recent research works mostly focus on the theoretical numerical and experimental analysis of an umbilical with a certain cross sectional layout there are only a few research literatures to perform the optimization design of the sectional layout of an umbilical which can improve the mechanical and other physical properties of the umbilical structure the process of cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is currently performed manually the arrangement of functional components should be as compacted and symmetrical as possible which is mentioned in the specification iso 13628 5 2009 the more symmetrical cross section of an umbilical can bear loads such as tension bending or torsion due to wave current or motion of the floating platform in a balanced status lu 2012 introduced the dimensionless indices through the cross sectional stiffness of each functional component to implement the symmetry of cross sectional layout of an umbilical and compared the mechanical properties of the umbilical with different cross sections through the numerical simulation the process of cross sectional design can be treated as the packing problem of several component with different properties on a plane surface huang and ye 2010 introduced the quasi physical method that virtual interaction force is assumed on the cross section of each functional component to drive each elasticity disk moving to the cross sectional center until the enclosing circle is the smallest which the layout have a high level of compactness wang 2019 proposed a stimulus response based allocation sra method through the mapping between the task allocation in swarm intelligence labor division and the space allocation in circle packing problems to address the circle packing problem with equilibrium constraints then 35 benchmark instances are used to test the performance of sra with mostly a high level of match li 2013 developed knowledge based heuristic particle swarm optimization approach with the adjustment strategy khpsoa to solve the weighted circle packing problem the numerical experiments show that khpsoa is superior to the existing algorithms in the performances based on the strategy of packing problem yang et al 2018 considered compactness symmetry balance and thermal distribution of the cross section of an umbilical and presented the feasible mathematical description and the multi disciplinary optimization framework was proposed based on the pso particle swarm optimization algorithm to implement the design of cross section of umbilical which was verified by a case study however the manufacture process of an umbilical is that functional components are bundled layer and layer which can improve the ease of manufacture the optimization design of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical should consider the layering strategy which is studied in this paper the layout problem of cross sections is a typical multi objective optimization problem to perform geometrical and mechanical properties simultaneously and traditional theoretical methods are often difficult to achieve rapid optimization design specially under the layering condition this paper gives a mathematical description of the optimization design of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical and presents a specific implementation method with the optimization objectives of compactedness balance and avoiding contact wear furthermore layering strategy is introduced corresponding optimization algorithms are developed to provide a concrete and feasible optimization design method for the cross sectional layout of an umbilical 2 question description 2 1 factors considered in section layout the real cross section of an umbilical as shown in fig 1 b can be simplified as the diagrammatic sketch see fig 2 it is assumed that the functional components of an umbilical consist of 6 steel pipes and 7 electrical cables fig 3 shows different designs for the same set of components where each design is optimal in some respects there is no known solution that is optimal in all respects the cross section in fig 3 a has a smaller outer diameter than other umbilicals with a high level of compactness which can be achieved by minimizing the cross sectional radius of the final design these kinds of umbilical with compacted cross section can improve the radial stiffness which is of benefit to the tensile strength and enhances their abilities of resisting the extreme loads under the harsh ocean environment in addition the cross sectional area of a layout design of the umbilical is directly related to the manufacturing cost the cross section in fig 3 b is more symmetrical with a high level of balance which can withstand the loads at a uniform distribution then the high utilization rate of material strength can extend the fatigue life of an umbilical there are some more vulnerable components such as steel pipes at the cross section which should be not in contact the umbilical with this kind of cross section can avoid the interactional frictional wear and improve the mechanical performance and safety therefore this kind of components will be scattered in the cross section of the umbilical as shown in fig 3 c there is obvious layering phenomenon in the cross section in fig 3 d this kind of cross section is based on manufacturing considerations and the layering process can decrease the number of manufacturing passes the total number of filling bodies with circular or special shape should be reduced which is advantageous to reduce the manufacture costs and processing risk these above judgements are applied to the cross sectional layout designs during preparation and review but this approach replies on manual experiences recently therefore an optimized cross sectional layout design of an umbilical should be produced automatically to achieve required performances such as minimized the outer diameter excellent mechanical properties and layering arrangement finally the manufacturing cost should be minimized as much as possible and the umbilical of final design performs the longer service life 2 2 establish mathematical model of layout design it can be seen that the problem of the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical can be interpreted as an optimization design process to meet the above performance requirements under the premise of a given type and number of components in the umbilical therefore it is necessary to establish a mathematical model for the optimization design problem and then develop the corresponding optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal cross sectional layout of the umbilical before establishing the mathematical model the following assumptions should be given to define the problem 1 the difference of cross sectional sizes of various functional components in the real umbilical is small for most cases therefore it is assumed that the cross sectional diameters of different components are the same 2 in this paper the implementation of the optimization algorithm only covers the cross sectional layout of the umbilical within two layers which can be extended to the cross section with multi layer in the future work 3 the radial deformation of functional components will be caused by the interaction force during operation or installation which has no impact on the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical so the functional components can be treated as rigid disks and the deformation is not considered 4 ignore the influence of circular or irregular filling bodies on cross sectional layouts only hydraulic tubes steel pipes or hoses and electrical cables are considered in the cross sectional layout design the optical cables can be analogized to electrical cables during implementation of the optimization algorithm because they have the similar properties 2 2 1 design variables of the cross sectional layout design firstly cartesian coordinate system is established by selecting a point in the plane of the cross section of an umbilical as the center then the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical can be transformed into the optimization problem of the continuous design variables which are the coordinates of central position of all components in the cross section it is given that an umbilical consists of m steel pipes with radius r s and n electrical cables with radius r q as shown in fig 4 p i s x i y i i 1 2 m are used to describe the center position of the steel pipe and p i q x j y j j 1 2 n are used to describe the central position of the electrical cable all functional components are enclosed in a circle to form the cross section of an umbilical and the radius is marked as r these central positions of all components will be changed to find the optimal positions and improve the properties of the cross section of an umbilical during optimization design 2 2 2 required performances as mentioned in section 2 1 the geometrical performance compactness and mechanical properties balance and safety should be considered in the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical therefore the process is an optimization design with multiple objectives which should be pursued to reach the optimal at some extent 2 2 2 1 the geometric performance the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical should be as compacted as possible which requires to minimize the radius of the cross section the compacted cross section not only can improve the anti extrusion performance but also can reduce the manufacturing cost actually the more compact the cross sectional layout is the greater the tensile stiffness is meanwhile the bending stiffness becomes smaller and the flexibility of the umbilical is better which can improve the performance of mechanical properties of the umbilical assuming that the index of geometric performance g a corresponding to the compactness of the cross sectional layout design can be expressed as eq 1 which is proportional to the area of the cross section where the λ a is the geometric coefficient therefore geometric properties m a and the manufacturing cost c a of an umbilical can be described through some functions with the g a as shown in eq 2 1 g a λ a π r 2 2 m a ζ a g a c a η a g a where ζ a and η a are the coefficients of mechanical properties and manufacturing cost respectively it is clear that the index of geometric performance g a should be designed smaller 2 2 2 2 the mechanical properties for different functional components the capacities of resisting loads are different due to different cross sectional configuration and materials so the cross sectional layout should be designed at a high level of balance to bear the cross sectional loads during operation and installation during the operation of the umbilical the main load is the combined load of tension and bending especially at the junction of the umbilical and the floater the tension is usually as high as tens of tons which is a typical dangerous location of mechanical failure in this case the most important load is tensile force while the bending deformation is relatively small the internal components of the umbilical are intertwined with each other which is a typical non adhesive form and the mechanical model is a stoplog structure according to the basic theory of mechanics of materials the bending and torsional stiffness of the cross section of the umbilical almost does not depend on the geometric layout of functional components moreover the virtual gravity index is introduced to realize the cross sectional balance based on the tensile stiffness of each functional component which is not only balanced in the tensile performance but also balanced in the bending and torsion resistance of the cross section in addition the bending performance is mainly considered in the verification stage of the detailed design of the umbilical so it is not optimized in the conceptual design stage of the cross sectional layout therefore only the axial tensile stiffness of each component section is introduced as the virtual gravity index value g in this paper as shown in equation 3 different types of components have different tensile properties generally the tensile stiffnesses of steel pipes are larger and electrical cables are smaller 3 g e a where e is elastic modulus a is the area of the section given the cross section layout of an umbilical the force system will be performed based on these virtual gravities see fig 5 the cross sectional balance depends on the deviation distance δ from the virtual gravity center of all functional components to the center of the cross section as shown in eq 4 in order to make the cross sectional layout of an umbilical more balanced the value of δ should be smaller it is assumed that there a relationship between the mechanical properties m b of an umbilical and the deviation distance which can be described as eq 5 4 δ g i s p i s g j q p j q i 1 m g i s j 1 n g j q 5 m b ξ b δ where ξ b is the coefficients of mechanical properties g i s is the virtual gravity vector of the i t h steel pipe is the virtual gravity vector of the j t h electrical cable for different cross section layout of an umbilical the deviation distance δ is different the bending neutral surface and torsion center will be offset in the case of an unbalanced cross sectional layout when the section is subjected to bending moments and torques the cross section cannot distribute the loads more evenly conversely both the bending neutral plane and the torsion center pass through the cross section centroid in the case of the balanced cross sectional layout the cross section can distribute the loads evenly therefore when the balance of the section layout is better the ability of the cross section to withstands bending and torsion load is also improved the cross section layout of an umbilical with good balance will have a good bearing capacity to withstand loads which is not easy to be damaged during the service life in addition the cross sectional layout of an umbilical should avoid steel pipes contact when the steel pipes contact under loads during operation and installation the relative slip will cause fatigue wear resulting in the long term damage d f being treated as the mechanical optimization objective which can be expressed as eq 6 6 d f i 1 j 1 i j n ψ f f 2 r s 2 p i s p j s 2 where p i s p j s x i x j 2 y i y j 2 ψ f is the coefficients of mechanical properties f t 1 e t is a nonlinear decreasing function it is introduced to transfer the relationship between the long term damage and the distance between both steel pipes to a decreasing trend which is suitable for describing the contact damage problem of vulnerable components the probability of long term damage will be decreased when the distance between steel tubes increases 2 2 3 constrain conditions during the implementation process of the cross sectional layout design all functional components are arranged in the enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical it is necessary to ensure that all functional components are neither overlapped by each other nor outside the enclosing circle therefore the constraint conditions can be expressed as eq 7 7 p i s p j s 2 2 r s 2 0 i j i j 1 2 m p i q p j q 2 2 r q 2 0 i j i j 1 2 n p i q p j s 2 r s r q 2 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n r r s 2 p i s 2 0 i 1 2 m r r q 2 p j q 2 0 j 1 2 n 2 2 4 optimization formulation in common many engineering design problems require that several objectives are satisfied simultaneously thus it is suitable to refer to them as multi objective problems the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is a typical multi objective optimization problem to consider the above mentioned indexes which can be defined as eq 8 8 to find x x i y i x j y j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n min f x g a x δ x d f x t s t x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2 r s 2 0 i j i j 1 2 m x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2 r q 2 0 i j i j 1 2 n x i x j 2 y i y j 2 r s r q 2 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n r r s 2 x i 2 y i 2 0 i 1 2 m r r q 2 x j 2 y j 2 0 j 1 2 n where x is a multi dimensional variable vector of the design parameters given that the design variables objective functions and constrain conditions are described in mathematical expressions the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is the process that positions of all components are driven to achieve the multiple required objectives such as compactness balance and avoiding the wear contact under the assumption of rigid components without any overlap in solving this kind of multi objective optimization problems there are often conflicts between the objectives there is no case that all the objectives reach the optimal situation therefore we should consider all the objectives comprehensively and find a solution with good trade off among several objectives in order to obtain compacted balanced and low wear cross sectional layout the multi objective optimization problem can be transformed into a single objective optimization problem which is defined by the following objective functions through the weight coefficients to sum up the mathematical model of cross sectional layout optimization design of an umbilical can be expressed as eq 9 according to the assumption let r s r q r it is assumed that three optimization objectives are treated with the same weight coefficients let c 1 c 2 c 3 1 3 the optimization formulation can be described as eq 10 9 to find x x i y i x j y j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n min f x c 1 g a x c 2 δ x c 3 d f x s t x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2

solve the smallest radius of the enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical according to the assumption in section 2 2 the circular cross sections of electrical cables and steel pipes contained in the umbilical have the same radiuses as shown in fig 6 a therefore the circular cross section of functional components can be discretized into the point set at a plane as shown in fig 6 b the solution of the smallest enclosing radius of the cross section is converted to the problem of solving the smallest enclosing circle of the discrete point set at a plane if the point set is marked as p the smallest enclosing circle should contain all the points and the radius is the smallest among all possible circles the aim of the solving algorithm is to find the center position and radius of the smallest enclosing circle it is no doubt from the mathematical theory that the smallest enclosing circle of a finite point set p is unique li et al 2011 there are some properties of the smallest enclosing circle to be considered before presenting the solving algorithm of the problem it can be proved that if there is only one point v in p the radius of the smallest enclosing circle is zero and its center is point v which is the degenerate form generally the non degenerate smallest enclosing circle can be defined by two or three boundary points of the point set as shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b if there are only two points on the boundary they must be both ends of the diameter and the other points are inside the circle however the two points a and d with the largest distance in point set p both are not necessarily on the boundary and there must be a proved equation d a d d is the diameter of smallest enclosing circle as shown in fig 8 therefore three points in the point set are applied to perform the solution of the smallest enclosing circle of the point set it is found that if three vertices create a right triangle or an obtuse triangle the longest side is the diameter of the smallest enclosing circle see fig 9 a if the three vertices create an acute triangle the smallest enclosing circle is the circumscribed circle of the triangle as shown in fig 9 b concerning the above solving strategy there are three classic algorithms for solving the smallest enclosing circle such as the randomized incremental algorithm mark et al 2005 the farthest point first progressive algorithm dfaa wang et al 2000 and the dual decision algorithm frank et al 2005 it has been proved that the farthest point first progressive algorithm is the most efficient among these three algorithms which is selected to solve the smallest radius of the enclosing circle the main steps of the algorithm are as follows step 1 any three points are randomly selected from the discrete point set which are marked as a b and c step 2 the smallest enclosing circle α is constructed with these three points step 3 the point v in the point set p that is farthest from the center of α is selected to validate the enclosing circle α if v is within α which is believed as the smallest the algorithm will terminate otherwise going to the next step step 4 three points in a b c v are selected to construct a smallest enclosing circle α containing four points the selected three points should be on the boundary of the enclosing circle as possible and they are re marked as a b and c then it will go to step 2 if the enclosing circle α passes through only two points in a b and c the two points on the circle will be taken as a and b and any point from the other two points will be taken as a c 3 2 multiplier penalty function method most practical optimization problems from engineering design are constrained optimization problems that is the values of design variables are limited in a certain range the multiplier penalty function method can be generally used to solve such optimization problems which is a classical analytical method for solving conditional extremum where the constrained optimization problem can be transformed into the unconstrained extremum problem he et al 2005 the cross sectional layout optimization design is the typical optimization problem with inequality constraints which can be simplified as following equations 11 min f x s t g i x 0 i 1 2 n where f x is the objective function to be optimized g i x are inequality constrained equations in this model it needs to add inequality constraints to the original objective function f x and then combine it with multiplier penalty function to get the augmented lagrange function see eq 12 12 m x u ρ f x 1 2 ρ i 1 m max 0 u i ρ g i x 2 u i 2 where u i is the multiplier and ρ is the penalty factor concerning the unconstrained optimization problem min m x u ρ the quasi newton method generally is used to solve it the bfgs broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 and shanno 1970 algorithm is one of the most effective quasi newton methods the most important step in newton method is to solve the hessian matrix of the objective function of multi dimensional variables in each iteration however the key task in the quasi newton method is to solve the simulation matrix b k 1 of the hessian matrix at each iteration the modified formula of b k 1 is 13 b k 1 b k y k y k t s k t y k b k s k s k t b k s k t b k s k where s k x k 1 x k y k m x k 1 u ρ m x k u ρ the simulation matrix b k 1 is used to judge the extremum of multivariate function according to the bfgs correction formula the standard bfgs algorithm is given step 1 the initial point set x 0 r n is randomly given and initial symmetric positive definite matrix b 0 r n n is solved the accuracy ε 0 is set and this step is defined as k 0 step 2 the m x k u ρ 0 can be solved if m x k u ρ 0 the algorithm will be terminated and the solution of the problem is x k otherwise the expression of the iteration direction is obtained as following equation 14 d k b k 1 m x k u ρ 0 step 3 the step size λ k is determined according to the current search criteria step 4 the next step can be defined as x k 1 x k λ k d k if m x k 1 u ρ 0 the solution of the optimization problem will be x k 1 otherwise it will go to the next step step 5 b k 1 can be calculated from standard correction eq 19 while make k k 1 and go to step 2 in addition the sufficiently large parameter ρ is selected during the process of iteration and the multiplier u k of the k 1 t h iteration is obtained by modifying the multiplier in the k t h iteration which is modified as 15 u i k 1 max 0 u i k ρ g i x k the judgment function is 16 φ k i 1 n max g i x k u i k ρ 2 1 2 when φ k φ x k ε iteration stops finally the unconstrained optimization problem can be solved through the above multi loop iteration 3 3 layering strategy the cross section of an umbilical is composed of many kinds of components there are multiple passes in the process of processing and manufacturing where each pass wraps a number of components into a single super component for inclusion into a future pass layering process is beneficial to reduce the manufacture costs and the processing risk therefore it is important to arrange the components of the cross section of an umbilical in layers in this paper the layering methodology based on the identification of contact points is introduced to realize the layering arrangement of the components in the cross section of an umbilical in order to find the contact point of these circular cross sections of components the contact point of any two circular cross sections should be find firstly because there is no penetration between the components the intersection of the two circular cross sections in contact is the tangent point the steps of the layering algorithm are as follows step 1 according to the assumption in section 2 2 that the functional components of the umbilical have the same radius the cross sections of these components can be seen as disks at a plane the linear equation of a straight line passing through the centers of two circles according to the central coordinates and the equations of common string lines of two disks are solved then the intersection point of two straight lines is obtained which is the contact point of two disks and marked as step 2 after getting all the contact points the smallest enclosing circle containing all contact points is constructed through the dfaa algorithm in section 3 1 which is called as the quasi layering circle as shown in fig 10 it is found that some components mostly are enclosed in the quasi layering circle others are out of the quasi layering circle step 3 in order to determine the number of circles arranged in the layering circle the proportion coefficient is introduced to control the setting the proportion coefficient is set according to the distance d i between the centers of all the disks in the quasi layering circle and the centre of the quasi layering circle and arrange it from small to large and record it as dis d 1 d 2 d i i 1 2 n if the number of components in the first layer is 3 then the proportion coefficient is equal to dis 3 after the number of circles in the first layer is determined the layering circle is constructed which is the smallest enclosing circle for the inner components then the remaining components are arranged in the second layer finally the layering cross section of an umbilical is obtained as shown in fig 11 3 4 steps of the optimization algorithm of the cross sectional layout of the umbilical based on the layering strategy by combining the multiplier penalty function method with the algorithm of the smallest radius of enclosing circle and introducing the layering strategy the optimal layering cross sectional layout of an umbilical with the good geometrical properties excellent mechanical properties and the lowest manufacturing cost can be obtained steps of the optimization algorithm are as follows step 1 parameters of the cross section of an umbilical coordinates and radius of each circular function component are initialized step 2 initial point x 0 the initial multiplier vector u 1 and initial penalty factor ρ 1 are given its amplification factor c 1 control error ε 0 and constant θ 0 1 are set while let k 1 step 3 taking x k 1 as the initial point bfgs algorithm is used to solve unconstrained problems m x u ρ and the x k is obtained meanwhile the dfaa algorithm is used to solve the radius of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical step 4 when φ k ε x k is the optimal solution and the iteration stops otherwise ρ k 1 c ρ k is set and it turn to step 5 step 5 the multiplier u i k 1 is modified according to eq 21 and k k 1 is set it turns to step1 and the loop iteration is conducted until the optimal solution of unconstrained problem is obtained step 7 step 2 to step 5 which is the multiplier penalty function method algorithm is repeated and used to optimize the layout of components of the second layer step 8 the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical is obtained the flow chart of the optimization algorithm is shown in fig 12 4 case study 4 1 basic parameters in this paper the example of the umbilical mentioned in section 2 is selected for the cross sectional layout design the functional components are shown in fig 13 the basic geometric and mechanical parameters of each component are shown in table 1 which are substituted into the optimization design algorithm of cross sectional layout of the umbilical for iterative calculation 4 2 analysis and comparison of optimization results by inputting the basic parameters and initial coordinates of each component into the corresponding array the temporary optimal solution considering compactness and balance can be obtained by iterative calculation the radius of the smallest enclosing circle and the offset distance of virtual gravity center are extracted from the above layout forms as shown in table 2 and the optimal layout is compared and analyzed as shown in fig 16 a the initial cross sectional layout of an umbilical is given firstly all components of the cross section are constantly converging towards the center in the iterative calculation process of the optimization algorithm and then some non layered cross sectional layouts are obtained it should be noted that three optimization objectives are proposed in section 2 which are compactness balance and avoiding contact between steel pipes the non contact between steel tubes means that the distance between them can be infinite which is in contradiction with the compact objective and the balance objective there is no solution when it is optimized for a single objective therefore the objective of avoiding contact between steel tubes is considered when discussing the compactness and balance of the cross sectional layout and is not optimized as a single objective in the optimization algorithm thus three objective combinations are set up which are case 1 considering compactness and low wear case 2 considering balance and low wear and case 3 considering three terms together respectively then the optimal solution set of two or three objectives can be obtained through iterative settlement and the design results are shown in fig 14 the compactness of the cross sectional layout shown in fig 14 a is best but the balance is the worst this layout will be subjected to the larger loads the cross sectional layout shown in fig 14 b has the best balance performance but the radius is the largest which means more manufacture cost it is found that cross sectional layouts cannot reach the optimal state without any layers considering above two factors together the cross sectional layout can be obtained as shown in fig 15 this design of the cross section layout of an umbilical has a smaller radius with compactness and better balance performance because considering the objective of avoiding contact between steel pipes steel pipes in the final cross sectional layout are distributed on both sides of the cross section of an umbilical which reduces long term damage to a certain extent therefore the cross sectional layout shown in fig 15 is the optimal non layered cross sectional layout of an umbilical according to the layering algorithm the proportion coefficient is key factor to control the number of components arranged in the first layer when the proportion coefficient is set to 1 3962 it means two components closest to the center of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section will be arranged in the first layer the remaining components continue to move and are guaranteed to be outside of the first enclosing circle finally the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical with two components in the first layer is obtained as shown in fig 16 b meanwhile the proportion coefficient is set to 1 4188 and 1 5751 which means three and four components closest to the center of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section will be arranged in the first layer other operations are the same as above and the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical with three members in the first layer is obtained as shown in fig 17 b and fig 18 b finally three kinds of sectional layout forms are obtained the sectional layout 1 has the largest radius with the poor compactness performance compared with other layouts it is easy from fig 16 b to find that there are larger gaps between different components which need some filling bodies to improve the compactness and increase the manufacture cost the compactness of the sectional layout 3 is moderate but the balance is the worst this design of the cross section layout of an umbilical will causes that steel tubes or electric cables are subjected to the larger loads which shortens the in service lifetime the sectional layout 2 has the smallest radius with good compactness and best balance performance compared with other two cross sectional layouts this design will perform the excellent mechanical properties and advantages in providing substantial savings in processing cost to sum up the cross sectional layout shown in fig 17 b is the optimal layering cross sectional layout of an umbilical compared with the optimal cross sectional layout without layers of an umbilical shown in fig 15 the cross sectional layout 2 has the smallest radius with the best compactness performance and there is no big gap in balance performance it is not difficult to find that the shape of filling bodies and the arrangement of components of the sectional layout 2 are regular which reduces the manufacturing risk and processing cost of an umbilical the layering cross sectional layout shows better geometric and mechanical properties in order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm the numerical simulation of the cross section under a given pressure is presented in this paper actually the umbilical will be subjected to large tensions and cycle bending loads during operation due to self weight ocean environment and floating movement because of the helical structure of the steel armour wires they will produce radial pressure on the inner bundle therefore initial cross sectional layout optimal cross sectional layout without layers and optimal cross sectional layout with layers are loaded with an outer radial pressure of 5 5 mpa as shown in fig 19 then the structural responses such as the radial displacement and the contact pressure will be analyzed it can be seen from fig 20 that the radial displacements of the three cross sections are 0 0915 mm 0 0348 mm and 0 028 mm respectively compared with the initial cross section the displacement of the optimal cross section without layers is reduced by 61 97 and the optimal cross section with layers is reduced by 69 40 it verifies that the cross section with small radius has large radial stiffness and is not easy to deform optimal cross section has lower contact pressure than that of the initial cross section as shown in fig 21 compared with the initial cross section the contact pressure of the optimal cross section without layers is reduced by 8 32 and the optimal cross section with layers is reduced by 61 09 which verifies the feasibility of the objective function of avoiding the contact between steel pipes from the numerical simulation results the radial displacement of the optimal cross section with layers is the smallest and the wear between steel pipes is well reduced in addition the optimal cross section with layers has a high level of balance to bear the loads therefore it can be seen that the geometric and mechanical properties of the cross section of the umbilical are improved after the optimization including the cross sectional diameter radial stiffness balance and low wear the conclusion that the optimal cross sectional layout with layers is the optimal layout form is consistent with the results of the algorithm which verifies the effectiveness of the multiplier penalty function algorithm proposed in this paper 5 conclusion the cross section of an umbilical is composed of electrical cable optical cable steel pipe and filling bodies different components have different physical properties and different cross sections will show different geometric characteristics bearing capacity heat distribution cost and manufacturability therefore the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is a typical multi objective optimization problem considering the mechanical and geometrical properties as the design objectives this paper establishes the mathematical model of this optimization problem based on the model the multiplier penalty function optimization algorithm is carried out then the manufacturing consideration is considered and the layering strategy is introduced to the optimization design algorithm of the cross sectional layout finally taking an umbilical with 13 functional components as an example the optimal layering cross sectional layout is obtained through experiments a cross sectional layout meeting the specification requirements can be obtained automatically through this design method which take the place of manual design furthermore the optimization algorithm of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical based on the layering strategy proposed in this paper provides a concrete and feasible optimization design method for the cross sectional layout of an umbilical as for the problem of contact between steel pipes in the cross sectional layout of an umbilical the algorithm proposed in this paper does not get the optimal result which is a problem that needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement zhixun yang conceptualization methodology xu yin

20686,as a key device in subsea production system of the offshore hydrocarbon resources exploitation the umbilical consists of a variety of functional components such as hydraulic tubes electrical cables and optical cables the cross sectional layout design plays an important role in the performance of an umbilical considering the mechanical and geometrical properties as the quantitative design

obtained comparing with the initial design and cross sectional layouts without layering the results verify the feasibility of the presented optimization design algorithm which can improve the design efficiency of an umbilical and avoid the manual process keywords umbilical cross sectional layout multi objective layering strategy optimization design 1 introduction umbilicals are widely applied in the subsea production system of the offshore oil and gas exploitation which is the key remote controlling device typically connecting the floating platform on the sea surface and the manifold at the seabed see fig 1 a several functions are performed by the umbilical such as providing the hydraulic power controlling signal and chemicals transmission channel knapp et al 1991 therefore an umbilical consists of a variety of functional components such as hydraulic tubes steel tubes or hoses electrical cables and optical cables which are bundled together and encased in a single line in a certain cross sectional layout as shown in fig 1 b knapp et al 2007 with the recent increase of the offshore hydrocarbon resources exploitation at the deep water depth the umbilical s application is expected to integrate more controlling functions therefore the number of functional components in the cross section of an umbilical sees an increasing trend chen et al 2016 the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical has an impact on the performance of an umbilical which influences the geometrical and mechanical properties the umbilical with different cross sectional layouts perform the different properties given a certain umbilical structure yue 2013 presented the theoretical methodology based on the curve beam theory to calculate the cross sectional tensional stiffness of an umbilical the results were compared with the tensile test results and the theoretical methodology considering cross sectional radial shrinkage was validated sævik 2002 assumed that the helical functional components only occur axial deformation without lateral displacement when an umbilical performs the bending behavior the methodology based on the sliding routine loxodromic curve was proposed to obtain the stiffness and stress of an umbilical under bending behavior lukassen 2019 gave an assumption that there was the lateral displacement of helical functional components under the bending behavior the theoretical methodology based on the sliding routine geodesic curve was presented to calculate the mechanical properties of an umbilical dai 2020 addressed the stresses in dynamic steel tube umbilicals under loads combining tension and bending corresponding to the top connection with the floater through the experimental tests a beam and penalty contact modeling procedure were applied to describe the extreme stress behavior and further validated against measured dynamic axial stress gustavsen 2009 analyzed the thermal electrical and magnetic distribution and loss characteristics of an umbilical with a certain cross section when electrical cables transmitted the power it was found that the high temperature due to the heat release could cause the material aging recent research works mostly focus on the theoretical numerical and experimental analysis of an umbilical with a certain cross sectional layout there are only a few research literatures to perform the optimization design of the sectional layout of an umbilical which can improve the mechanical and other physical properties of the umbilical structure the process of cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is currently performed manually the arrangement of functional components should be as compacted and symmetrical as possible which is mentioned in the specification iso 13628 5 2009 the more symmetrical cross section of an umbilical can bear loads such as tension bending or torsion due to wave current or motion of the floating platform in a balanced status lu 2012 introduced the dimensionless indices through the cross sectional stiffness of each functional component to implement the symmetry of cross sectional layout of an umbilical and compared the mechanical properties of the umbilical with different cross sections through the numerical simulation the process of cross sectional design can be treated as the packing problem of several component with different properties on a plane surface huang and ye 2010 introduced the quasi physical method that virtual interaction force is assumed on the cross section of each functional component to drive each elasticity disk moving to the cross sectional center until the enclosing circle is the smallest which the layout have a high level of compactness wang 2019 proposed a stimulus response based allocation sra method through the mapping between the task allocation in swarm intelligence labor division and the space allocation in circle packing problems to address the circle packing problem with equilibrium constraints then 35 benchmark instances are used to test the performance of sra with mostly a high level of match li 2013 developed knowledge based heuristic particle swarm optimization approach with the adjustment strategy khpsoa to solve the weighted circle packing problem the numerical experiments show that khpsoa is superior to the existing algorithms in the performances based on the strategy of packing problem yang et al 2018 considered compactness symmetry balance and thermal distribution of the cross section of an umbilical and presented the feasible mathematical description and the multi disciplinary optimization framework was proposed based on the pso particle swarm optimization algorithm to implement the design of cross section of umbilical which was verified by a case study however the manufacture process of an umbilical is that functional components are bundled layer and layer which can improve the ease of manufacture the optimization design of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical should consider the layering strategy which is studied in this paper the layout problem of cross sections is a typical multi objective optimization problem to perform geometrical and mechanical properties simultaneously and traditional theoretical methods are often difficult to achieve rapid optimization design specially under the layering condition this paper gives a mathematical description of the optimization design of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical and presents a specific implementation method with the optimization objectives of compactedness balance and avoiding contact wear furthermore layering strategy is introduced corresponding optimization algorithms are developed to provide a concrete and feasible optimization design method for the cross sectional layout of an umbilical 2 question description 2 1 factors considered in section layout the real cross section of an umbilical as shown in fig 1 b can be simplified as the diagrammatic sketch see fig 2 it is assumed that the functional components of an umbilical consist of 6 steel pipes and 7 electrical cables fig 3 shows different designs for the same set of components where each design is optimal in some respects there is no known solution that is optimal in all respects the cross section in fig 3 a has a smaller outer diameter than other umbilicals with a high level of compactness which can be achieved by minimizing the cross sectional radius of the final design these kinds of umbilical with compacted cross section can improve the radial stiffness which is of benefit to the tensile strength and enhances their abilities of resisting the extreme loads under the harsh ocean environment in addition the cross sectional area of a layout design of the umbilical is directly related to the manufacturing cost the cross section in fig 3 b is more symmetrical with a high level of balance which can withstand the loads at a uniform distribution then the high utilization rate of material strength can extend the fatigue life of an umbilical there are some more vulnerable components such as steel pipes at the cross section which should be not in contact the umbilical with this kind of cross section can avoid the interactional frictional wear and improve the mechanical performance and safety therefore this kind of components will be scattered in the cross section of the umbilical as shown in fig 3 c there is obvious layering phenomenon in the cross section in fig 3 d this kind of cross section is based on manufacturing considerations and the layering process can decrease the number of manufacturing passes the total number of filling bodies with circular or special shape should be reduced which is advantageous to reduce the manufacture costs and processing risk these above judgements are applied to the cross sectional layout designs during preparation and review but this approach replies on manual experiences recently therefore an optimized cross sectional layout design of an umbilical should be produced automatically to achieve required performances such as minimized the outer diameter excellent mechanical properties and layering arrangement finally the manufacturing cost should be minimized as much as possible and the umbilical of final design performs the longer service life 2 2 establish mathematical model of layout design it can be seen that the problem of the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical can be interpreted as an optimization design process to meet the above performance requirements under the premise of a given type and number of components in the umbilical therefore it is necessary to establish a mathematical model for the optimization design problem and then develop the corresponding optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal cross sectional layout of the umbilical before establishing the mathematical model the following assumptions should be given to define the problem 1 the difference of cross sectional sizes of various functional components in the real umbilical is small for most cases therefore it is assumed that the cross sectional diameters of different components are the same 2 in this paper the implementation of the optimization algorithm only covers the cross sectional layout of the umbilical within two layers which can be extended to the cross section with multi layer in the future work 3 the radial deformation of functional components will be caused by the interaction force during operation or installation which has no impact on the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical so the functional components can be treated as rigid disks and the deformation is not considered 4 ignore the influence of circular or irregular filling bodies on cross sectional layouts only hydraulic tubes steel pipes or hoses and electrical cables are considered in the cross sectional layout design the optical cables can be analogized to electrical cables during implementation of the optimization algorithm because they have the similar properties 2 2 1 design variables of the cross sectional layout design firstly cartesian coordinate system is established by selecting a point in the plane of the cross section of an umbilical as the center then the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical can be transformed into the optimization problem of the continuous design variables which are the coordinates of central position of all components in the cross section it is given that an umbilical consists of m steel pipes with radius r s and n electrical cables with radius r q as shown in fig 4 p i s x i y i i 1 2 m are used to describe the center position of the steel pipe and p i q x j y j j 1 2 n are used to describe the central position of the electrical cable all functional components are enclosed in a circle to form the cross section of an umbilical and the radius is marked as r these central positions of all components will be changed to find the optimal positions and improve the properties of the cross section of an umbilical during optimization design 2 2 2 required performances as mentioned in section 2 1 the geometrical performance compactness and mechanical properties balance and safety should be considered in the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical therefore the process is an optimization design with multiple objectives which should be pursued to reach the optimal at some extent 2 2 2 1 the geometric performance the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical should be as compacted as possible which requires to minimize the radius of the cross section the compacted cross section not only can improve the anti extrusion performance but also can reduce the manufacturing cost actually the more compact the cross sectional layout is the greater the tensile stiffness is meanwhile the bending stiffness becomes smaller and the flexibility of the umbilical is better which can improve the performance of mechanical properties of the umbilical assuming that the index of geometric performance g a corresponding to the compactness of the cross sectional layout design can be expressed as eq 1 which is proportional to the area of the cross section where the λ a is the geometric coefficient therefore geometric properties m a and the manufacturing cost c a of an umbilical can be described through some functions with the g a as shown in eq 2 1 g a λ a π r 2 2 m a ζ a g a c a η a g a where ζ a and η a are the coefficients of mechanical properties and manufacturing cost respectively it is clear that the index of geometric performance g a should be designed smaller 2 2 2 2 the mechanical properties for different functional components the capacities of resisting loads are different due to different cross sectional configuration and materials so the cross sectional layout should be designed at a high level of balance to bear the cross sectional loads during operation and installation during the operation of the umbilical the main load is the combined load of tension and bending especially at the junction of the umbilical and the floater the tension is usually as high as tens of tons which is a typical dangerous location of mechanical failure in this case the most important load is tensile force while the bending deformation is relatively small the internal components of the umbilical are intertwined with each other which is a typical non adhesive form and the mechanical model is a stoplog structure according to the basic theory of mechanics of materials the bending and torsional stiffness of the cross section of the umbilical almost does not depend on the geometric layout of functional components moreover the virtual gravity index is introduced to realize the cross sectional balance based on the tensile stiffness of each functional component which is not only balanced in the tensile performance but also balanced in the bending and torsion resistance of the cross section in addition the bending performance is mainly considered in the verification stage of the detailed design of the umbilical so it is not optimized in the conceptual design stage of the cross sectional layout therefore only the axial tensile stiffness of each component section is introduced as the virtual gravity index value g in this paper as shown in equation 3 different types of components have different tensile properties generally the tensile stiffnesses of steel pipes are larger and electrical cables are smaller 3 g e a where e is elastic modulus a is the area of the section given the cross section layout of an umbilical the force system will be performed based on these virtual gravities see fig 5 the cross sectional balance depends on the deviation distance δ from the virtual gravity center of all functional components to the center of the cross section as shown in eq 4 in order to make the cross sectional layout of an umbilical more balanced the value of δ should be smaller it is assumed that there a relationship between the mechanical properties m b of an umbilical and the deviation distance which can be described as eq 5 4 δ g i s p i s g j q p j q i 1 m g i s j 1 n g j q 5 m b ξ b δ where ξ b is the coefficients of mechanical properties g i s is the virtual gravity vector of the i t h steel pipe is the virtual gravity vector of the j t h electrical cable for different cross section layout of an umbilical the deviation distance δ is different the bending neutral surface and torsion center will be offset in the case of an unbalanced cross sectional layout when the section is subjected to bending moments and torques the cross section cannot distribute the loads more evenly conversely both the bending neutral plane and the torsion center pass through the cross section centroid in the case of the balanced cross sectional layout the cross section can distribute the loads evenly therefore when the balance of the section layout is better the ability of the cross section to withstands bending and torsion load is also improved the cross section layout of an umbilical with good balance will have a good bearing capacity to withstand loads which is not easy to be damaged during the service life in addition the cross sectional layout of an umbilical should avoid steel pipes contact when the steel pipes contact under loads during operation and installation the relative slip will cause fatigue wear resulting in the long term damage d f being treated as the mechanical optimization objective which can be expressed as eq 6 6 d f i 1 j 1 i j n ψ f f 2 r s 2 p i s p j s 2 where p i s p j s x i x j 2 y i y j 2 ψ f is the coefficients of mechanical properties f t 1 e t is a nonlinear decreasing function it is introduced to transfer the relationship between the long term damage and the distance between both steel pipes to a decreasing trend which is suitable for describing the contact damage problem of vulnerable components the probability of long term damage will be decreased when the distance between steel tubes increases 2 2 3 constrain conditions during the implementation process of the cross sectional layout design all functional components are arranged in the enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical it is necessary to ensure that all functional components are neither overlapped by each other nor outside the enclosing circle therefore the constraint conditions can be expressed as eq 7 7 p i s p j s 2 2 r s 2 0 i j i j 1 2 m p i q p j q 2 2 r q 2 0 i j i j 1 2 n p i q p j s 2 r s

simultaneously thus it is suitable to refer to them as multi objective problems the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is a typical multi objective optimization problem to consider the above mentioned indexes which can be defined as eq 8 8 to find x x i y i x j y j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n min f x g a x δ x d f x t s t x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2 r s 2 0 i j i j 1 2 m x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2 r q 2 0

that the design variables objective functions and constrain conditions are described in mathematical expressions the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is the process that positions of all components are driven to achieve the multiple required objectives such as compactness balance and avoiding the wear contact under the assumption of rigid components without any overlap in solving this kind of multi objective optimization problems there are often conflicts between the objectives there is no case that all the objectives reach the optimal situation therefore we should consider all the objectives comprehensively and find a solution with good trade off among several objectives in order to obtain compacted balanced and low wear cross sectional layout the multi objective optimization problem can be transformed into a single objective optimization problem which is defined by the following objective functions through the weight coefficients to sum up the mathematical model of cross sectional layout optimization design of an umbilical can be expressed as eq 9 according to the assumption let r s r q r it is assumed that three optimization objectives are treated with the same weight coefficients let c 1 c 2 c 3 1 3 the optimization formulation can be described as eq 10 9 to find x x i y i x j y j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n min f x c 1 g a x c 2 δ x c 3 d f x s t x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2

weight coefficients for the corresponding multi objectives to find x x i y i x j y j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 10 min f x 1 3 f 1 x 1 3 f 2 x 1 3 f 3 x s t x i x j 2 y i y j 2 2 r 2 0 i j i j 1 2 m n r r 2 x i

solve the smallest radius of the enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical according to the assumption in section 2 2 the circular cross sections of electrical cables and steel pipes contained in the umbilical have the same radiuses as shown in fig 6 a therefore the circular cross section of functional components can be discretized into the point set at a plane as shown in fig 6 b the solution of the smallest enclosing radius of the cross section is converted to the problem of solving the smallest enclosing circle of the discrete point set at a plane if the point set is marked as p the smallest enclosing circle should contain all the points and the radius is the smallest among all possible circles the aim of the solving algorithm is to find the center position and radius of the smallest enclosing circle it is no doubt from the mathematical theory that the smallest enclosing circle of a finite point set p is unique li et al 2011 there are some properties of the smallest enclosing circle to be considered before presenting the solving algorithm of the problem it can be proved that if there is only one point v in p the radius of the smallest enclosing circle is zero and its center is point v which is the degenerate form generally the non degenerate smallest enclosing circle can be defined by two or three boundary points of the point set as shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b if there are only two points on the boundary they must be both ends of the diameter and the other points are inside the circle however the two points a and d with the largest distance in point set p both are not necessarily on the boundary and there must be a proved equation d a d d is the diameter of smallest enclosing circle as shown in fig 8 therefore three points in the point set are applied to perform the solution of the smallest enclosing circle of the point set it is found that if three vertices create a right triangle or an obtuse triangle the longest side is the diameter of the smallest enclosing circle see fig 9 a if the three vertices create an acute triangle the smallest enclosing circle is the circumscribed circle of the triangle as shown in fig 9 b concerning the above solving strategy there are three classic algorithms for solving the smallest enclosing circle such as the randomized incremental algorithm mark et al 2005 the farthest point first progressive algorithm dfaa wang et al 2000 and the dual decision algorithm frank et al 2005 it has been proved that the farthest point first progressive algorithm is the most efficient among these three algorithms which is selected to solve the smallest radius of the enclosing circle the main steps of the algorithm are as follows step 1 any three points are randomly selected from the discrete point set which are marked as a b and c step 2 the smallest enclosing circle α is constructed with these three points step 3 the point v in the point set p that is farthest from the center of α is selected to validate the enclosing circle α if v is within α which is believed as the smallest the algorithm will terminate otherwise going to the next step step 4 three points in a b c v are selected to construct a smallest enclosing circle α containing four points the selected three points should be on the boundary of the enclosing circle as possible and they are re marked as a b and c then it will go to step 2 if the enclosing circle α passes through only two points in a b and c the two points on the circle will be taken as a and b and any point from the other two points will be taken as a c 3 2 multiplier penalty function method most practical optimization problems from engineering design are constrained optimization problems that is the values of design variables are limited in a certain range the multiplier penalty function method can be generally used to solve such optimization problems which is a classical analytical method for solving conditional extremum where the constrained optimization problem can be transformed into the unconstrained extremum problem he et al 2005 the cross sectional layout optimization design is the typical optimization problem with inequality constraints which can be simplified as following equations 11 min f x s t g i x 0 i 1 2 n where f x is the objective function to be optimized g i x are inequality constrained equations in this model it needs to add inequality constraints to the original objective function f x and then combine it with multiplier penalty function to get the augmented lagrange function see eq 12 12 m x u ρ f x 1 2 ρ i 1 m max 0 u i ρ g i x 2 u i 2 where u i is the multiplier and ρ is the penalty factor concerning the unconstrained optimization problem min m x u ρ the quasi newton method generally is used to solve it the bfgs broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 and shanno 1970 algorithm is one of the most effective quasi newton methods the most important step in newton method is to solve the hessian matrix of the objective function of multi dimensional variables in each iteration however the key task in the quasi newton method is to solve the simulation matrix b k 1 of the hessian matrix at each iteration the modified formula of b k 1 is 13 b k 1 b k y k y k t s k t y k b k s k s k t b k s k t b k s k where s k x k 1 x k y k m x k 1 u ρ m x k u ρ the simulation matrix b k 1 is used to judge the extremum of multivariate function according to the bfgs correction formula the standard bfgs algorithm is given step 1 the initial point set x 0 r n is randomly given and initial symmetric positive definite matrix b 0 r n n is solved the accuracy ε 0 is set and this step is defined as k 0 step 2 the m x k u ρ 0 can be solved if m x k u ρ 0 the algorithm will be terminated and the solution of the problem is x k otherwise the expression of the iteration direction is obtained as following equation 14 d k b k 1 m x k u ρ 0 step 3 the step size λ k is determined according to the current search criteria step 4 the next step can be defined as x k 1 x k λ k d k if m x k 1 u ρ 0 the solution of the optimization problem will be x k 1 otherwise it will go to the next step step 5 b k 1 can be calculated from standard correction eq 19 while make k k 1 and go to step 2 in addition the sufficiently large parameter ρ is selected during the process of iteration and the multiplier u k of the k 1 t h iteration is obtained by modifying the multiplier in the k t h iteration which is modified as 15 u i k 1 max 0 u i k ρ g i x k the judgment function is 16 φ k i 1 n max g i x k u i k ρ 2 1 2 when φ k φ x k ε iteration stops finally the unconstrained optimization problem can be solved through the above multi loop iteration 3 3 layering strategy the cross section of an umbilical is composed of many kinds of components there are multiple passes in the process of processing and manufacturing where each pass wraps a number of components into a single super component for inclusion into a future pass layering process is beneficial to reduce the manufacture costs and the processing risk therefore it is important to arrange the components of the cross section of an umbilical in layers in this paper the layering methodology based on the identification of contact points is introduced to realize the layering arrangement of the components in the cross section of an umbilical in order to find the contact point of these circular cross sections of components the contact point of any two circular cross sections should be find firstly because there is no penetration between the components the intersection of the two circular cross sections in contact is the tangent point the steps of the layering algorithm are as follows step 1 according to the assumption in section 2 2 that the functional components of the umbilical have the same radius the cross sections of these components can be seen as disks at a plane the linear equation of a straight line passing through the centers of two circles according to the central coordinates and the equations of common string lines of two disks are solved then the intersection point of two straight lines is obtained which is the contact point of two disks and marked as step 2 after getting all the contact points the smallest enclosing circle containing all contact points is constructed through the dfaa algorithm in section 3 1 which is called as the quasi layering circle as shown in fig 10 it is found that some components mostly are enclosed in the quasi layering circle others are out of the quasi layering circle step 3 in order to determine the number of circles arranged in the layering circle the proportion coefficient is introduced to control the setting the proportion coefficient is set according to the distance d i between the centers of all the disks in the quasi layering circle and the centre of the quasi layering circle and arrange it from small to large and record it as dis d 1 d 2 d i i 1 2 n if the number of components in the first layer is 3 then the proportion coefficient is equal to dis 3 after the number of circles in the first layer is determined the layering circle is constructed which is the smallest enclosing circle for the inner components then the remaining components are arranged in the second layer finally the layering cross section of an umbilical is obtained as shown in fig 11 3 4 steps of the optimization algorithm of the cross sectional layout of the umbilical based on the layering strategy by combining the multiplier penalty function method with the algorithm of the smallest radius of enclosing circle and introducing the layering strategy the optimal layering cross sectional layout of an umbilical with the good geometrical properties excellent mechanical properties and the lowest manufacturing cost can be obtained steps of the optimization algorithm are as follows step 1 parameters of the cross section of an umbilical coordinates and radius of each circular function component are initialized step 2 initial point x 0 the initial multiplier vector u 1 and initial penalty factor ρ 1 are given its amplification factor c 1 control error ε 0 and constant θ 0 1 are set while let k 1 step 3 taking x k 1 as the initial point bfgs algorithm is used to solve unconstrained problems m x u ρ and the x k is obtained meanwhile the dfaa algorithm is used to solve the radius of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section of an umbilical step 4 when φ k ε x k is the optimal solution and the iteration stops otherwise ρ k 1 c ρ k is set and it turn to step 5 step 5 the multiplier u i k 1 is modified according to eq 21 and k k 1 is set it turns to step1 and the loop iteration is conducted until the optimal solution of unconstrained problem is obtained step 7 step 2 to step 5 which is the multiplier penalty function method algorithm is repeated and used to optimize the layout of components of the second layer step 8 the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical is obtained the flow chart of the optimization algorithm is shown in fig 12 4 case study 4 1 basic parameters in this paper the example of the umbilical mentioned in section 2 is selected for the cross sectional layout design the functional components are shown in fig 13 the basic geometric and mechanical parameters of each component are shown in table 1 which are substituted into the optimization design algorithm of cross sectional layout of the umbilical for iterative calculation 4 2 analysis and comparison of optimization results by inputting the basic parameters and initial coordinates of each component into the corresponding array the temporary optimal solution considering compactness and balance can be obtained by iterative calculation the radius of the smallest enclosing circle and the offset distance of virtual gravity center are extracted from the above layout forms as shown in table 2 and the optimal layout is compared and analyzed as shown in fig 16 a the initial cross sectional layout of an umbilical is given firstly all components of the cross section are constantly converging towards the center in the iterative calculation process of the optimization algorithm and then some non layered cross sectional layouts are obtained it should be noted that three optimization objectives are proposed in section 2 which are compactness balance and avoiding contact between steel pipes the non contact between steel tubes means that the distance between them can be infinite which is in contradiction with the compact objective and the balance objective there is no solution when it is optimized for a single objective therefore the objective of avoiding contact between steel tubes is considered when discussing the compactness and balance of the cross sectional layout and is not optimized as a single objective in the optimization algorithm thus three objective combinations are set up which are case 1 considering compactness and low wear case 2 considering balance and low wear and case 3 considering three terms together respectively then the optimal solution set of two or three objectives can be obtained through iterative settlement and the design results are shown in fig 14 the compactness of the cross sectional layout shown in fig 14 a is best but the balance is the worst this layout will be subjected to the larger loads the cross sectional layout shown in fig 14 b has the best balance performance but the radius is the largest which means more manufacture cost it is found that cross sectional layouts cannot reach the optimal state without any layers considering above two factors together the cross sectional layout can be obtained as shown in fig 15 this design of the cross section layout of an umbilical has a smaller radius with compactness and better balance performance because considering the objective of avoiding contact between steel pipes steel pipes in the final cross sectional layout are distributed on both sides of the cross section of an umbilical which reduces long term damage to a certain extent therefore the cross sectional layout shown in fig 15 is the optimal non layered cross sectional layout of an umbilical according to the layering algorithm the proportion coefficient is key factor to control the number of components arranged in the first layer when the proportion coefficient is set to 1 3962 it means two components closest to the center of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section will be arranged in the first layer the remaining components continue to move and are guaranteed to be outside of the first enclosing circle finally the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical with two components in the first layer is obtained as shown in fig 16 b meanwhile the proportion coefficient is set to 1 4188 and 1 5751 which means three and four components closest to the center of the smallest enclosing circle of the cross section will be arranged in the first layer other operations are the same as above and the optimal layering cross sectional layout of the umbilical with three members in the first layer is obtained as shown in fig 17 b and fig 18 b finally three kinds of sectional layout forms are obtained the sectional layout 1 has the largest radius with the poor compactness performance compared with other layouts it is easy from fig 16 b to find that there are larger gaps between different components which need some filling bodies to improve the compactness and increase the manufacture cost the compactness of the sectional layout 3 is moderate but the balance is the worst this design of the cross section layout of an umbilical will causes that steel tubes or electric cables are subjected to the larger loads which shortens the in service lifetime the sectional layout 2 has the smallest radius with good compactness and best balance performance compared with other two cross sectional layouts this design will perform the excellent mechanical properties and advantages in providing substantial savings in processing cost to sum up the cross sectional layout shown in fig 17 b is the optimal layering cross sectional layout of an umbilical compared with the optimal cross sectional layout without layers of an umbilical shown in fig 15 the cross sectional layout 2 has the smallest radius with the best compactness performance and there is no big gap in balance performance it is not difficult to find that the shape of filling bodies and the arrangement of components of the sectional layout 2 are regular which reduces the manufacturing risk and processing cost of an umbilical the layering cross sectional layout shows better geometric and mechanical properties in order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm the numerical simulation of the cross section under a given pressure is presented in this paper actually the umbilical will be subjected to large tensions and cycle bending loads during operation due to self weight ocean environment and floating movement because of the helical structure of the steel armour wires they will produce radial pressure on the inner bundle therefore initial cross sectional layout optimal cross sectional layout without layers and optimal cross sectional layout with layers are loaded with an outer radial pressure of 5 5 mpa as shown in fig 19 then the structural responses such as the radial displacement and the contact pressure will be analyzed it can be seen from fig 20 that the radial displacements of the three cross sections are 0 0915 mm 0 0348 mm and 0 028 mm respectively compared with the initial cross section the displacement of the optimal cross section without layers is reduced by 61 97 and the optimal cross section with layers is reduced by 69 40 it verifies that the cross section with small radius has large radial stiffness and is not easy to deform optimal cross section has lower contact pressure than that of the initial cross section as shown in fig 21 compared with the initial cross section the contact pressure of the optimal cross section without layers is reduced by 8 32 and the optimal cross section with layers is reduced by 61 09 which verifies the feasibility of the objective function of avoiding the contact between steel pipes from the numerical simulation results the radial displacement of the optimal cross section with layers is the smallest and the wear between steel pipes is well reduced in addition the optimal cross section with layers has a high level of balance to bear the loads therefore it can be seen that the geometric and mechanical properties of the cross section of the umbilical are improved after the optimization including the cross sectional diameter radial stiffness balance and low wear the conclusion that the optimal cross sectional layout with layers is the optimal layout form is consistent with the results of the algorithm which verifies the effectiveness of the multiplier penalty function algorithm proposed in this paper 5 conclusion the cross section of an umbilical is composed of electrical cable optical cable steel pipe and filling bodies different components have different physical properties and different cross sections will show different geometric characteristics bearing capacity heat distribution cost and manufacturability therefore the cross sectional layout design of an umbilical is a typical multi objective optimization problem considering the mechanical and geometrical properties as the design objectives this paper establishes the mathematical model of this optimization problem based on the model the multiplier penalty function optimization algorithm is carried out then the manufacturing consideration is considered and the layering strategy is introduced to the optimization design algorithm of the cross sectional layout finally taking an umbilical with 13 functional components as an example the optimal layering cross sectional layout is obtained through experiments a cross sectional layout meeting the specification requirements can be obtained automatically through this design method which take the place of manual design furthermore the optimization algorithm of the cross sectional layout of an umbilical based on the layering strategy proposed in this paper provides a concrete and feasible optimization design method for the cross sectional layout of an umbilical as for the problem of contact between steel pipes in the cross sectional layout of an umbilical the algorithm proposed in this paper does not get the optimal result which is a problem that needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement zhixun yang conceptualization methodology xu yin

20687,the coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus is frequently employed to perform undex resistance performance evaluation of structures to date proper consideration of the shock loading on the structure is vitally important for a coupled acoustic structural undex analysis the authors carried out a numerical simulation of a partially submerged circular rc column undergoing an undex shock loading the study focuses on two factors that might affect the shock loading implementation a the duration of an undex shock front the rise time and b the employed acoustic wave formulation type scattered or total with the total wave formulation the calculated kick off displacements of the column in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases are reasonably consistent with the experimental one zhuang et al 2020 the simulation shows that the predicted structural response of the column is sensitive to the rise time the findings suggest that a period of time of 30 40 μs could be reasonable and practical for small explosion equivalent scenarios note that the present conclusion is limited to small explosive charges but invalid for large undex loadings usually having much higher frequencies the study also shows that the scattered wave formulation is not applicable for the current case due to the simulated negative pressure loading on the column the total wave formulation should be used for low stiffness structures to properly simulate possible local cavitation the most important limitation lies in the planar incident wave assumption that makes the current findings less generalizable to other structures with larger lengths heights or stiffnesses keywords rc column underwater explosion fluid structure interaction shock loading rise time local cavitation 1 introduction the underwater explosion undex resistance performance of marine offshore and hydraulic structures is increasingly becoming a central issue for the community due to the defence and anti terrorism needs of governments around the world there is thus a growing body of literature addressing the undex resistance performance prediction or evaluation of various water related facilities or structures field undex tests are usually unacceptable due to potential damage to target structures by shock loadings laboratory undex tests are an approximate alternative but frequently subject to high overheads the limited testing water domain that is restricted by the size of a laboratory water tank can decrease the reliability of the test results before the widespread use of computers research investigating dynamic responses of structures subjected to undexs is usually performed with some analytical models among them taylor s one dimensional fluid structure interaction theory taylor 1941 could be the best known and most commonly used one due to its simplicity and effectiveness even to date there is still a great deal of research using various analytical models and approaches to predict undex responses of structures schiffer and tagarielli 2014 hoo fatt and sirivolu 2017 sone oo et al 2020 these studies have offered important insights into dynamic responses of structures in undex events however such theoretical studies remain narrow in focus dealing only with simple structures e g plate structures in recent years major advances in various numerical methods and computing power have allowed efficient simulation of undex events on computers a widely adopted strategy for undex analysis is to numerically reproduce a benchmark laboratory test for validation purposes first and then carry out a further in depth study qiankun and gangyi 2011 li and rong 2012 hu et al 2020 in the authors opinion experimental undex studies would fulfil more of a benchmark role for calculation and what we know about various undex phenomena in different scenarios could be more and more based on numerical simulation publications that concentrate on numerical undex simulation frequently adopt three strategies the first is to simulate the whole process of an undex event including the detonation shock wave propagation bubble dynamics and fluid structure interaction if any typical hydrocodes that adopt this strategy are ls dyna song et al 2017 autodyn de et al 2017 and msc dytran li and rong 2012 some software for more specialized purposes e g the navy enhanced sierra mechanics is also developed over the past decade with the strategy moyer et al 2016 this strategy focuses on both the undex phenomenon and the structural response in the event correspondingly a simulation with this strategy is generally computationally demanding in cases when the main objective of a simulation is to evaluate the undex resistance performance of a structure a second strategy that focuses more on the structural response is employed a simplified method widely used to treat the transient interaction between a flexible structure and a surrounding infinite medium is the doubly asymptotic approximation daa geers 1971 1978 geers and felippa 1983 a commonly used hydrocode incorporating the daa method is usa deruntz 1989 it uses the boundary element method to reduce the number of elements required to model the surrounding medium in this way it enables the pressure at the interface to be specified in terms of surface motions in order to uncouple the motion of the fluid from that of the structure which brings about its simplicity and computational efficiency a number of numerical studies kwon and fox 1993 ergin 1997 liang et al 2001 liang and tai 2006 hung et al 2009 have been so far carried out on undex responses of structures with the daa method however due to the absence of the modeling of the surrounding medium some critical phenomena in the medium water in undex events e g the cavitation phenomenon cannot be considered by the daa method a practical solution to this problem is to couple the daa method e g the usa code with the finite element method e g the ls dyna code to properly take into account the cavitation phenomenon shin 2004 another efficient tool that applies an undex loading directly to a fluid structure interface without modeling the large volume of water around the target structure i e the simplified interaction tool is also often employed in various undex analyses in recent years van aanhold 2014 apart from the above two strategies a third coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus is increasingly used in recent years jen 2009 qiankun and gangyi 2011 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 moradloo et al 2019 central to this strategy is to cut an undex impact process into two parts one before the onset of the undex loading on the structure and the other after it the simulation only considers the second part i e the incoming incident wave traveling from the undex source to the target structure is neglected to apply the incident wave loading on the structure an acoustic field initialization is performed in the water domain at the beginning of the numerical analysis abaqus 2010 due to the absence of incident wave propagation modeling the cut off strategy is thus more efficient and from a structural analysis perspective seems to be more practical essentially the high efficiency stemming from the cut off strategy is achieved at the sacrifice of the modeling accuracy of the incident wave loading on the structure in a transient undex analysis with abaqus a reference point standing off from the explosion source is defined to specify a pulse loading time history with this pulse history and the relationship between the reference and source points in space the acoustic field initialization and subsequent evolution are determined and so is the incident wave loading on the structure an ideal way to specify the pulse history is to employ an actual pressure time record as was done in kwon and fox 1993 unfortunately such pressure time records are frequently unavailable an alternative way is to determine a pressure time history by calculation with some well known empirical formulas cole 1948 zamyshlyayev and yakovlev 1973 a typical undex loading history is characterized by an instantaneous pressure rise to a peak value followed by a relatively lasting decay on one hand while they can estimate the peak pressure value and give an approximate description for the pressure decay in an exponential manner the empirical formulas do not account for the pressure rise stage on the other hand the pressure rise stage is indispensable to an undex analysis in which the water is modeled with acoustic elements due to their finite element essence woyak 2002 in current analysis practices the pressure rise is usually simplified to a linear process but the determination of the rise time depends more on the practitioner experience seeming somewhat subjective and arbitrary jen 2009 qiankun and gangyi 2011 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 moradloo et al 2019 although a considerable amount of literature has been published on the pressure pulse profiles associated with undex events and their effects however far too little attention has been paid to the pressure rise time in undex analyses another major issue with regard to the undex loading pattern in abaqus is concerned with the acoustic wave formulation type employed in the analysis both scattered jen 2009 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 and total qiankun and gangyi 2011 moradloo et al 2019 wave formulations have been widely used in undex analyses with the total wave formulation the time varying load is applied on the outer boundary of the acoustic medium to generate a response in it and thus the shock loading on the structure in this case to apply the time varying load based on a calculated pressure time history by the cole 1948 or the zamyshlyayev and yakovlev 1973 formula is reasonable however when the scattered wave formulation is used both the acoustic and solid surfaces at their interface are loaded in this case the acoustic pressure degree of freedom only stands for the scattered part of the total pressure but excludes the contribution from the incident wave consequently a free field pressure history of an incident wave at a given point predicted by the empirical formulas or recorded in a field laboratory undex test is no longer fully applicable for the scattered loading input this is because in most cases the reflected wave at an acoustic structural interface is not an exact copy of the incident wave however few researchers have addressed this issue and for simplicity empirical formula predicted jen 2009 or actual recorded van den abeele and verleysen 2013 free field pressure histories were often used as the loading input in previous undex analyses even when the scattered wave formulation was employed much uncertainty still exists about the incident wave loading input issue in the coupled acoustic structural undex analysis so far with this in mind the authors carried out a numerical simulation of a partially submerged circular rc column undergoing an undex shock loading by using the coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus the simulation results with different calculation parameters or acoustic wave formulation types are compared with published experimental data zhuang et al 2020 to find out what factors concerning the loading input have pivotal roles in the simulation it is hoped that this work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the loading aspect of the coupled acoustic structural undex analysis strategy this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the main acoustic equations for describing the constitutive behavior of the fluid solved by the abaqus code section 3 gives a brief overview of the undex test in zhuang et al 2020 that is numerically reproduced in this work and the calculation conditions section 4 presents the simulation results and discussion the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 acoustic equations in abaqus 2010 the equilibrium equation for small motions of a compressible adiabatic fluid with velocity dependent momentum losses is taken to be 1 p x γ x θ i u f ρ f x θ i u f 0 where p is the excess pressure in the fluid the pressure in excess of any static pressure x is the spatial position of the fluid particle u f is the fluid particle velocity u f is the fluid particle acceleration ρ f is the density of the fluid γ is the volumetric drag force per unit volume per velocity and θ i are i independent field variables such as temperature humidity of air or salinity of water on which ρ f and γ may depend the d alembert term has been written without convection on the assumption that there is no steady flow of the fluid this is usually considered sufficiently accurate for steady fluid velocities up to mach 0 1 the constitutive behavior of the fluid is assumed to be inviscid linear and compressible so 2 p k f x θ i x u f where k f is the bulk modulus of the fluid for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation the absolute pressure sum of the static pressure and the excess dynamic pressure cannot drop below the specified cavitation limit when the absolute pressure drops to this limit value the fluid is assumed to undergo free expansion without a corresponding drop in the dynamic pressure the pressure would rebuild in the acoustic medium once the free expansion that took place during the cavitation is reversed sufficiently to reduce the volumetric strain to the level at the cavitation limit the constitutive behavior for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation can be stated as 3 p max p v p c p 0 where a pseudopressure p v a measure of the volumetric strain is defined as 4 p v k f x θ i x u f where p c is the fluid cavitation limit and p 0 is the initial acoustic static pressure a total wave formulation is used for a non linear acoustic medium undergoing cavitation it should be noted that the total wave formulation is very similar to the scattered wave formulation except that the pseudopressure defined as the product of the bulk modulus and the compressive volumetric strain plays the role of the material state variable instead of the acoustic excess pressure the acoustic excess pressure is readily available from this pseudopressure subject to the cavitation condition 3 numerical simulation 3 1 overview of the undex test in zhuang et al 2020 the undex test was carried out in a cylindrical water tank with a diameter of 10 00 m the water depth is 2 25 m the tank bottom is covered with a 0 5 m thick layer of buffer sand the undex target is a rc column with a height of 2 70 m and a diameter of 0 10 m the rc column is vertically installed with its two ends clamped in metallic frames and partially submerged in the water rising 0 45 m from the water surface eight hrb335 grade ribbed bars with diameters of 6 mm are embedded in the column for its longitudinal reinforcement the 28 day compressive strength of the concrete is 52 0 mpa roughly corresponding to the concrete strength grading c80 in the chinese grading system mohurd 2010 a displacement gauge and an acceleration gauge are installed at the back of the column away from the undex source 1 00 m below the water surface in addition nine strain gauges are installed on the rc column at three different heights in which six are for the reinforcing bars and three for the concrete the test setup is shown schematically in fig 1 with the detonation depth 1 m and the stand off distance 1 m steel pipes that have the same stand off distance from the undex source as the rc column are also placed in the water tank the dimensions of the steel pipes are generally the same as the rc column with the steel pipes being 0 20 m shorter than the rc column ten pressure sensors are embedded in the wall of each pipe at five different heights below the water surface with five on the front side facing the undex source and the rest on the back side thus the measured pressure histories can approximately represent the shock loading undergone by the rc column a series of undexs of different explosive weights varying from 0 025 to 0 8 kg were performed at different distances from the rc column varying from 0 to 7 m and the water surface varying from 0 25 to 2 m more details on the undex test e g the real world scene of the test setup the detailed dimensions of the rc column the configuration of the gauges and sensors and the test parameter combinations can be found in zhuang et al 2020 3 2 numerical model the current numerical simulation is carried out with abaqus explicit the concrete column is modeled with c3d8 8 node linear brick elements with the element edge lengths no greater than 0 01 m the reinforcing bars are modeled with t3d2 2 node linear truss elements with the element lengths equaling 0 01 m the reinforcing bar elements are embedded in the concrete elements with the embedded element technique in abaqus 2010 to implement the structural coupling of the two element groups the translational degrees of freedom of the embedded reinforcing bar nodes are constrained to the interpolated values of the corresponding degrees of freedom of the concrete elements the water is meshed by ac3d8r 8 node acoustic brick elements fig 2 shows the numerical model to determine an appropriate fluid domain thickness and the maximum allowable element length for it a modal analysis of the column is performed the employed concrete material parameters will be given in section 3 3 table 1 presents the modal analysis results regarding the first three modes of the column the second mode natural frequency 129 28 hz of the column should be adequate for estimating the maximum allowable fluid element length seeing that the dominant vibration frequency of the column is well below 130 hz in the undex test zhuang et al 2020 the maximum allowable fluid element length can be estimated by abaqus 2010 5 l max c n min f max where l max represents the maximum internodal interval of an element in the mesh n min the number of internodal intervals required per acoustic wavelength n min 10 is recommended f max the maximum frequency of interest and c the velocity of sound in the acoustic medium when the maximum frequency of interest of 130 hz is assumed with n min 12 and c 1500 m s l max should be less than 0 96 m mesh refinement is performed within a 1 m radius around the column to ensure sufficient solution accuracy for the acoustic pressure field neighbouring the column and thus the shock loading on the acoustic structural interface the nominal acoustic element size is set to be 0 05 m within the refinement range this size is slightly larger than one time a 30 μs rise time propagation distance of a shock wave due to the relatively low frequency of the column compared with a shock loading such a one time rise time element mesh is believed to be able to yield structural analysis results of sufficient accuracy with a sufficiently small time increment woyak 2002 while the nominal element size within the refinement range is set at 0 05 m it increases in size to a nominal 0 82 m at the outer fluid boundary with regard to the fluid domain thickness the radius of the water domain it is expressed as m min wavelengths at the minimum frequency f min to be analyzed as follows 6 r c m min f min let m min equal 1 3 woyak 2002 abaqus 2010 and f min be the first mode natural frequency 47 28 hz of the column the fluid domain thickness should thus be larger than 10 58 m in this context the radius of the water domain in the present numerical model is set to be 12 m it should be noted that the wave reflection at the tank wall in the physical test is not considered in the current numerical simulation this consideration excludes the loading effect of any reflected waves on the structural response of the column and can thus highlight that of the incident wave the column is closer to the undex source than the cylindrical tank wall in the physical test that would reflect the incident wave in this light however the initial physical response of the column measured in the test is believed to be meaningful for comparison with the numerical results the numerical model consists of 236696 nodes and 223952 elements of which 26016 continuum elements are for the column 2160 truss elements for the reinforcing bars and 195776 acoustic elements for the water 3 3 material parameters for the water the bulk modulus is 2 14 gpa and the mass density is 1000 kg m3 the velocity of sound in water is assumed to be 1500 m s the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcing bars is taken as 200 gpa the poisson s ratio as 0 3 and the mass density as 7850 kg m3 as mentioned in section 3 1 the actual compressive strength of the concrete employed in the test zhuang et al 2020 roughly corresponds to the c80 strength grade in the chinese grading system mohurd 2010 since the modulus of elasticity of the concrete is unavailable in zhuang et al 2020 it is taken as the recommended value of that for the c80 grade concrete in mohurd 2010 i e 38 gpa the poisson s ratio of the concrete is taken as 0 2 and the mass density as 2500 kg m3 the least explosive weight 0 025 kg case in the test is selected as the object of the present numerical study both the concrete and the reinforcing bars are thus assumed to be linear elastic materials the mass proportional rayleigh damping is used to damp the lower frequencies of the rc column the alpha damping factor is given a value of 29 71 s 1 for both the concrete and the reinforcing bar materials to produce 5 damping for the first vibration mode of the column the stiffness proportional rayleigh damping beta damping that generally damps the higher frequencies is neglected to avoid a dramatic reduction in the stable time increment 3 4 boundary conditions zero velocity boundary conditions are enforced for both ends of the column non reflecting boundary conditions are specified on the lateral and bottom boundaries of the water domain the radiating bottom boundary condition is implemented to account for the energy absorbing effect of the buffer sand that covers the tank bottom the fluid structure interaction between the water and the column is defined at their common wetted interface with a surface based tie constraint the dynamic acoustic pressure at the upper surface of the water is set to zero to enforce a free surface boundary condition an initial linearly varying hydrostatic pressure is specified in the water domain with the pressure values being 0 101 atmospheric pressure and 0 123 mpa at the water surface and bottom respectively the specified hydrostatic pressure is meaningful only when the total wave formulation is used to consider possible fluid cavitation however it does not apply any static loads to the column the boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 2a 3 5 loading given the limited availability of the test data in zhuang et al 2020 a test case with relatively comprehensive experimental results available is numerically reproduced a tnt explosive of a weight of 0 025 kg is detonated 1 m below the water surface 1 25 m above the tank bottom with a stand off distance of 1 m from the column in this test case the reference point for the loading history input is defined on the surface of the column 1 m below the water surface the measured incident wave loading distribution on the column is observed to be even on the whole zhuang et al 2020 due to the relatively small explosive weight used in the case the distance between the undex source and the bottom end of the column is 1 601 m 0 601 m larger than the nearest horizontal distance between them this distance difference produces a shift of about 400 μs between the times at which the shock front reaches the reference point and the bottom end of the column the time shift is equivalent to only 1 53 and 1 10 of the first and third mode natural vibration periods of the column respectively consequently the time shift should not significantly affect the principal vibration modes that dominate the overall dynamic response of the column given that a planar incident wave is thus assumed in the present simulation for simplicity the source point is located 13 m away from the column axis and also 1 m below the water surface note that under the current planar incident wave assumption only the spatial relationship between the source and reference points is meaningful that determines the wave traveling direction the loading history input at the reference point is determined not by the source to reference distance in the simulation but by the actual explosive distance in the test the decay stage of the loading history p t is approximated by the cole 1948 formula with an exponential decay time constant θ as follows 7 p t p max e t θ for tnt explosive p max and θ are given by 8 p max 52 16 w 1 3 r 1 13 9 θ 96 5 w 1 3 w 1 3 r 0 22 where w is expressed in kg of the tnt explosive and r is the stand off distance from the charge measured in meter the calculated p max and θ are thus 12 999 mpa and 36 982 μs respectively regarding the pressure rise stage it is assumed to be a linear process in this analysis unfortunately the actual rise time is not available in zhuang et al 2020 in fact to date there has been little published quantitative test data on the pressure rise time of undex shock loadings because of measurement system limitations walter 2004 and undesired environmental influences draganić et al 2018 one major experimental issue that has dominated the field for many years concerns insufficient cut off frequencies of measurement systems arons 1954 bjørnø and levin 1976 yiannakopoulos and van der schaaf 1998 in addition an undex shock front could be distorted in the test recording due to the finite geometrical size of the employed pressure gauge bjarnholt 1980 some undex tests such as that conducted by park et al 2003 and rolfe et al 2017 have shown that typical undex shock front duration produced by relatively large amounts of explosive is very short compared to the decay time however some experimental data from several other studies bjørnø and levin 1976 mouritz 1995 1996 chambers et al 2001 suggest that the duration of an undex shock front generated by a small amount of explosive could be comparable to the corresponding decay time constant θ a search of the literature reveals few studies arons 1954 mouritz 1995 mouritz 1996 yiannakopoulos and van der schaaf 1998 which suggest the rise time should be less than 30 40 μs in the present analysis the pressure rise is thus assumed to occur over a period of time of up to 40 μs 3 6 column mesh sensitivity analysis considering the undex loading employed that is composed of very high frequencies a numerical verification of the mesh size sensitivity is performed to examine whether the current mesh can yield a proper response of the column essentially the high frequency components two additional models with different mesh sizes for the column are created for comparison the coarse and fine column meshes have element edge lengths no greater than 0 012 m and 0 008 m respectively fig 3 compares the horizontal displacement time histories of the column at three typical points with different meshes the comparison shows that the vibrations of the column at different points elevations are different in terms of their vibrational frequency components the vibrations at points a and c contain some high frequency oscillations essentially at point a but this is not true for that at point b however it is encouraging to note that the calculated displacement histories are found to be hardly distinguishable from each other at each point in particular the three displacement histories at point a that contain considerable high frequency oscillations are in good agreement the comparison gives a good indication that all the three meshes can yield accurate results regarding the dynamic response of the column under the applied undex loading in the following analysis consequently the current model with the intermediate element size 0 01 m is employed 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of rise time in this subsection the total wave formulation is used for the undex shock loading implementation abaqus 2010 to consider possible fluid cavitation the cavitation pressure limit is assigned a zero value implying that the water cannot sustain any tension in the simulation the incident wave loading is applied to the exterior of the acoustic water mesh for comparison of the wall pressure on the column the time period of the numerical analysis is set to be 100 μs with the time interval for output set to be 1 μs for comparison of the structural response of the column however the analysis time period and the output time interval are 0 8 s and 1 ms respectively the pressure rise time of the undex loading is assumed to range from 20 to 40 μs a fixed time incrementation of 1 μs that is less than or equal to 1 20 of the rise time is thus used as suggested by woyak 2002 using such a time increment is believed to be able to provide good results with a relatively coarse acoustic mesh for a low frequency structural system fig 4 shows the initialization of the acoustic field with different durations of the undex shock front significantly the three solutions regarding the acoustic pressure initialization are similar in terms of their pressure values and distributions the planar incident wave front is satisfactorily captured right before it reaches the column as expected the simulated peak pressure values at the shock front are 2 52 0 53 and 3 76 less than the theoretical value 12 999 mpa when the rise time is 20 30 and 40 μs respectively consequently it is believed that the employed water mesh can yield reasonably accurate initialization of the acoustic pressure in the domain and thus apply a proper incident wave loading on the column without significant numerical dissipation or distortion the calculation results in fig 4 suggest that the rise time has little effect on the acoustic pressure initialization in the water fig 5 compares the calculated wall pressure histories on the column with the free field impulses that are used for the loading input in the three cases what stands out in fig 5 is the significant higher peak values of the wall pressure compared with that of the free field pressure the pressure increase is the consequence of the superposition of the incident and reflected waves at the column water interface i e the wall effect xiao et al 2014 the wall pressure rise significantly lags behind that of the free field pressure especially at the initial stage the lag may be explained by the fact that the column should move away from the water at the arrival of the shock front the tendency of the column to separate from the water to some extent hinders the wall pressure rise as regards the pressure drop stage it is interesting to note that the wall pressure drops at an observably faster pace to zero after it rises to the peak the kick off velocity of the column induced by the shock continues to increase at this stage thus causing the water to be increasingly unable to catch up with the column when the column has accelerated enough to separate from the water the initial shock pulse is ended by local cavitation with the wall pressure falling to zero a marked observation to emerge from the data comparison in fig 5 is the difference in peak wall pressure between the three cases a longer duration of the shock front produces a higher peak wall pressure within the employed range 20 40 μs the rise time plays an important role in defining the loading input for the current simulation this finding seems somewhat counterintuitive and could be attributed to the small decay time constant that defines the descending phases of the three inputted loading histories in fact the employed rise time 20 40 μs is comparable to the current decay time constant 36 982 μs in this case an increase in the rise time would significantly amplify the loading impulse and thus produce an observably higher wall pressure on the column therefore the rise time could be a major factor that should be viewed cautiously when dealing with an undex loading history having a decay time constant of the order of tens of microseconds importantly the calculated peak wall pressure when the rise time 30 μs correlates fairly well with the measured one in zhuang et al 2020 hence it could be hypothesized that the actual rise time of the undex loading history be approximately 30 μs this hypothesis does not conflict with previous experimental research into this area bjørnø and levin 1976 chambers et al 2001 which suggests that the rise time of a pulse history produced by a small scale undex could be of the order of the corresponding decay time constant fig 6 shows the calculated displacement time histories at the back of the column 1 00 m below the water surface and the measured one in zhuang et al 2020 the most striking observation to emerge from the displacement time history comparison is that the modeled vibration frequency of the column is significantly higher than the measured one this inconsistency may be due to the inadequate sampling frequency used for the displacement measurement in the test zhuang et al 2020 the modeled vibration frequency approximately 45 hz of the column is slightly lower than its first mode natural frequency 47 28 hz due to the added mass effect of the surrounding water this finding indicates that the dynamic response of the column to the undex loading should be dominated by its fundamental bending mode for which the dominant motion is transverse to the column axis interestingly the calculated kick off displacements in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases the first peaks in the two cases are very close to each other which are prominently larger than that in the rise time 20 μs case these results are in agreement with the findings presented in fig 5 which show that the calculated wall pressure time histories when the rise time 30 and 40 μs are roughly comparable in their impulses although they have significantly different peak values it is encouraging to note that the first peaks in the cases when the rise time 30 and 40 μs appear close to the experimental one a closer inspection reveals that the first experimental peak is slightly higher than the calculated ones but observably lags behind those due to the inadequate sampling frequency for the measurement actually the first experimental peak is captured at approximately t 19 ms and such a time period could be enough for a shock wave to make a round trip from end to end in the 10 m diameter tank thus the first experimental peak should have covered the contribution from the reflected waves arising at the water tank wall this may partly explain the difference in kick off displacement between the experimental and calculation results that the first experimental peak is slightly higher it indicates that the undex shock waves may have been repeatedly reflected by the tank wall without significant dissipation within the initial 200 ms period this explains that the second experimental peak 4 5 mm is even higher than the first one and that the measured peak displacements are significantly larger than the calculated ones during the initial 200 ms period after 200 ms the measured oscillation of the column gradually diminishes and tends to be consistent with the calculation results it implies that the current empirically based damping value employed for the first vibration mode of the column i e 5 of critical can provide a generally reasonable damping mechanism for the system in fact the first experimental peak captured at t 19 ms as mentioned above should not be the kick off displacement in reality due to the inadequate sampling frequency for the measurement the actual kick off displacement could be less than the first experimental peak that should have covered the contribution from the waves reflected in the water tank however the overall experimental results shown in fig 6 could have underestimated the response of the column since not enough sampling points are present on the other hand the current simulation results do not account for the waves reflected in the water tank this simplification is likely to induce errors after a few milliseconds and thus lead to divergences between the simulation and experimental results despite these limitations however the comparison at least indicates a conclusion that the simulated and actual displacement responses of the column are in the same order of magnitude given the current planar incident wave assumption caution must be taken the assumption is based on a premise that the shift between the times at which the shock front reaches the middle and ends of the column is far less than its first few natural vibration periods of some principal vibration modes consequently the current simplified treatment of the incident wave might not be transferable to other simulations that consider some structures with larger lengths heights making the time shift larger or stiffnesses bringing about shorter natural vibration periods in those cases a spherical incident wave should be specified to properly consider the effect of the time shift 4 2 effect of acoustic wave formulation type in this subsection the scattered and total wave formulations are used for the undex shock loading implementation abaqus 2010 for comparison purposes the pressure rise time of the undex loading is assumed to be 30 μs for the current comparison both acoustic and solid surfaces at the column water interface are loaded when the scattered wave formulation is used it should be noted that the calculated pressures with the two formulations are not comparable as the denotations of the pressure in the formulations are essentially different for the total wave formulation the acoustic pressure degree of freedom denotes the total dynamic acoustic pressure including contributions from incident and scattered waves it is particularly applicable when the acoustic medium is capable of cavitation rendering the fluid mechanical behavior non linear for the scattered wave formulation however the pressure at an acoustic node is defined to be only the scattered part of the total pressure this formulation cannot account for possible fluid cavitation by assuming the fluid mechanical behavior linear abaqus 2010 fig 7 compares the displacement time histories of the column with the two acoustic wave formulation types the modeled vibration frequencies of the column with the two formulation types are identical and so are the decay durations of the vibration however the calculated vibration amplitude with the scattered wave formulation is clearly smaller than that with the total wave formulation and also the measured one fig 6 this finding is somewhat unexpected and suggests that the wave formulation selection could significantly affect the incident wave loading implementation for the present case considering the difference in the implication of the pressure in the two formulations the total dynamic acoustic pressure from the scattered pressure results is rebuilt for the sake of coherence and clarity of the pressure time history comparison the calculated scattered pressure is superimposed on the known incident pressure to generate the total pressure this rebuilt total pressure is compared with the calculated total dynamic acoustic pressure when the total wave formulation is used as shown in fig 8 it is apparent that the fluctuations in the acoustic pressure are tiny on the 800 ms timescale compared with those on the 1000 μs timescale this indicates that most of the vibration energy of the column should come from the initial shock pulse the most important aspect of the data in fig 8 is thus in the pressure comparison in the first 1000 μs the first peaks with the two formulations are very close to each other as expected with the scattered wave one appearing slightly higher and earlier however considerable negative pressure is observed when the scattered wave formulation is used and it partly counteracts the shock loading effect of the positive part on the column potential negative pressure is cut off at the hydrostatic pressure level due to the local cavitation phenomenon arising at the column water interface when the total wave formulation is used this could explain why the calculated vibration of the column with the scattered wave formulation is significantly weaker than that with the total wave formulation as shown in fig 7 in fact the local cavitation phenomenon possibly occurring at a fluid structure interface has been reported by some previous numerical research sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2012 the fundamental cause of local cavitation lies in the tendency of the structure to separate from the fluid when the structure is undergoing a shock loading for shell or plate structures that have low structural stiffnesses their dynamic responses are usually strong in undex events the strong vibration could make the local cavitation phenomenon more likely to occur and thus have a more noticeable influence on the fluid structure interaction in the present case the column is located perpendicular to the incident wave direction that renders the transverse motion of the column prominent it may be the case therefore that the local cavitation phenomenon is significant in the present case this finding broadly supports the work of other numerical studies in this area sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2012 linking the vibration of low stiffness structures in undex events with the local cavitation effect the local cavitation effect is the fundamental reason why the scattered wave formulation that describes the water as linear is not applicable to the present case 5 conclusions this paper seeks to address the loading issue in coupled acoustic structural undex analyses this numerical study has identified two important factors a the duration of an undex shock front the rise time and b the employed acoustic wave formulation type scattered or total a 2 70 m high and 0 10 m diameter rc column partially submerged in water is taken as an undex target in the current case study the study has shown that the simulated peak pressure values in the initialized acoustic fields are in good agreement with the theoretical value with the rise time ranging from 20 to 40 μs when the total wave formulation is used the rise time is irrelevant to the acoustic pressure initialization in the water comparison of the calculated kick off displacements of the column in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases with the experimental one zhuang et al 2020 verifies the reliability of the current simulation with the total wave formulation the evidence from this numerical study suggests that the rise time should be recognized as a key parameter when dealing with a small explosion equivalent case that often exists in laboratory undex tests for small explosion equivalent scenarios the dynamic structural analysis results should be highly sensitive to the rise time because the rise time could be comparable to the decay time constant of the undex loading history considering that very little is currently known about the instantaneous pressure rise process of an undex loading history the determination of the rise time should and has to rely more on practical experience it would seem that a period of time of 30 40 μs for the rise time could be reasonable and practical it should be noted that the above conclusion regarding the rise time issue is limited to small explosive charges for which the rise time is in the order of magnitude of the decay time it is not valid for large undex loadings usually having much higher frequencies the study has also shown that the scattered wave formulation is not applicable for the current case in which the column structurally interacts with the water in an undex event this is due to the simulated negative pressure loading on the column that does not actually exist the negative pressure tends to drag the column into the water and thus produces an underestimated response of the column there is therefore a definite need to use the total wave formulation when performing undex analyses of low stiffness structures e g shell plate and column structures to properly consider the local cavitation effect the major limitation of this study is the planar incident wave assumption made in the numerical simulation this assumption makes the current findings less generalizable to other structures with larger lengths heights or stiffnesses despite its exploratory nature this work offers valuable insights into the loading issue in coupled acoustic structural undex analyses however the precise mechanism of the instantaneous pressure rise process of an undex loading history remains to be elucidated in future experimental work a greater focus on the cavitation threshold could produce interesting findings that account more for the local cavitation effect on

20687,the coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus is frequently employed to perform undex resistance performance evaluation of structures to date proper consideration of the shock loading on the structure is vitally important for a coupled acoustic structural undex analysis the authors carried out a numerical simulation of a partially submerged circular rc column undergoing an undex shock loading the study focuses on two factors that might affect the shock loading implementation a the duration of an undex shock front the rise time and b the employed acoustic wave formulation type scattered or total with the total wave formulation the calculated kick off displacements of the column in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases are reasonably consistent with the experimental one zhuang et al 2020 the simulation shows that the predicted structural response of the column is sensitive to the rise time the findings suggest that a period of time of 30 40 μs could be reasonable and practical for small explosion equivalent scenarios note that the present conclusion is limited to small explosive charges but invalid for large undex loadings usually having much higher frequencies the study also shows that the scattered wave formulation is not applicable for the current case due to the simulated negative pressure loading on the column the total wave formulation should be used for low stiffness structures to properly simulate possible local cavitation the most important limitation lies in the planar incident wave assumption that makes the current findings less generalizable to other structures with larger lengths heights or stiffnesses keywords rc column underwater explosion fluid structure interaction shock loading rise time local cavitation 1 introduction the underwater explosion undex resistance performance of marine offshore and hydraulic structures is increasingly becoming a central issue for the community due to the defence and anti terrorism needs of governments around the world there is thus a growing body of literature addressing the undex resistance performance prediction or evaluation of various water related facilities or structures field undex tests are usually unacceptable due to potential damage to target structures by shock loadings laboratory undex tests are an approximate alternative but frequently subject to high overheads the limited testing water domain that is restricted by the size of a laboratory water tank can decrease the reliability of the test results before the widespread use of computers research investigating dynamic responses of structures subjected to undexs is usually performed with some analytical models among them taylor s one dimensional fluid structure interaction theory taylor 1941 could be the best known and most commonly used one due to its simplicity and effectiveness even to date there is still a great deal of research using various analytical models and approaches to predict undex responses of structures schiffer and tagarielli 2014 hoo fatt and sirivolu 2017 sone oo et al 2020 these studies have offered important insights into dynamic responses of structures in undex events however such theoretical studies remain narrow in focus dealing only with simple structures e g plate structures in recent years major advances in various numerical methods and computing power have allowed efficient simulation of undex events on computers a widely adopted strategy for undex analysis is to numerically reproduce a benchmark laboratory test for validation purposes first and then carry out a further in depth study qiankun and gangyi 2011 li and rong 2012 hu et al 2020 in the authors opinion experimental undex studies would fulfil more of a benchmark role for calculation and what we know about various undex phenomena in different scenarios could be more and more based on numerical simulation publications that concentrate on numerical undex simulation frequently adopt three strategies the first is to simulate the whole process of an undex event including the detonation shock wave propagation bubble dynamics and fluid structure interaction if any typical hydrocodes that adopt this strategy are ls dyna song et al 2017 autodyn de et al 2017 and msc dytran li and rong 2012 some software for more specialized purposes e g the navy enhanced sierra mechanics is also developed over the past decade with the strategy moyer et al 2016 this strategy focuses on both the undex phenomenon and the structural response in the event correspondingly a simulation with this strategy is generally computationally demanding in cases when the main objective of a simulation is to evaluate the undex resistance performance of a structure a second strategy that focuses more on the structural response is employed a simplified method widely used to treat the transient interaction between a flexible structure and a surrounding infinite medium is the doubly asymptotic approximation daa geers 1971 1978 geers and felippa 1983 a commonly used hydrocode incorporating the daa method is usa deruntz 1989 it uses the boundary element method to reduce the number of elements required to model the surrounding medium in this way it enables the pressure at the interface to be specified in terms of surface motions in order to uncouple the motion of the fluid from that of the structure which brings about its simplicity and computational efficiency a number of numerical studies kwon and fox 1993 ergin 1997 liang et al 2001 liang and tai 2006 hung et al 2009 have been so far carried out on undex responses of structures with the daa method however due to the absence of the modeling of the surrounding medium some critical phenomena in the medium water in undex events e g the cavitation phenomenon cannot be considered by the daa method a practical solution to this problem is to couple the daa method e g the usa code with the finite element method e g the ls dyna code to properly take into account the cavitation phenomenon shin 2004 another efficient tool that applies an undex loading directly to a fluid structure interface without modeling the large volume of water around the target structure i e the simplified interaction tool is also often employed in various undex analyses in recent years van aanhold 2014 apart from the above two strategies a third coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus is increasingly used in recent years jen 2009 qiankun and gangyi 2011 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 moradloo et al 2019 central to this strategy is to cut an undex impact process into two parts one before the onset of the undex loading on the structure and the other after it the simulation only considers the second part i e the incoming incident wave traveling from the undex source to the target structure is neglected to apply the incident wave loading on the structure an acoustic field initialization is performed in the water domain at the beginning of the numerical analysis abaqus 2010 due to the absence of incident wave propagation modeling the cut off strategy is thus more efficient and from a structural analysis perspective seems to be more practical essentially the high efficiency stemming from the cut off strategy is achieved at the sacrifice of the modeling accuracy of the incident wave loading on the structure in a transient undex analysis with abaqus a reference point standing off from the explosion source is defined to specify a pulse loading time history with this pulse history and the relationship between the reference and source points in space the acoustic field initialization and subsequent evolution are determined and so is the incident wave loading on the structure an ideal way to specify the pulse history is to employ an actual pressure time record as was done in kwon and fox 1993 unfortunately such pressure time records are frequently unavailable an alternative way is to determine a pressure time history by calculation with some well known empirical formulas cole 1948 zamyshlyayev and yakovlev 1973 a typical undex loading history is characterized by an instantaneous pressure rise to a peak value followed by a relatively lasting decay on one hand while they can estimate the peak pressure value and give an approximate description for the pressure decay in an exponential manner the empirical formulas do not account for the pressure rise stage on the other hand the pressure rise stage is indispensable to an undex analysis in which the water is modeled with acoustic elements due to their finite element essence woyak 2002 in current analysis practices the pressure rise is usually simplified to a linear process but the determination of the rise time depends more on the practitioner experience seeming somewhat subjective and arbitrary jen 2009 qiankun and gangyi 2011 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 moradloo et al 2019 although a considerable amount of literature has been published on the pressure pulse profiles associated with undex events and their effects however far too little attention has been paid to the pressure rise time in undex analyses another major issue with regard to the undex loading pattern in abaqus is concerned with the acoustic wave formulation type employed in the analysis both scattered jen 2009 van den abeele and verleysen 2013 and total qiankun and gangyi 2011 moradloo et al 2019 wave formulations have been widely used in undex analyses with the total wave formulation the time varying load is applied on the outer boundary of the acoustic medium to generate a response in it and thus the shock loading on the structure in this case to apply the time varying load based on a calculated pressure time history by the cole 1948 or the zamyshlyayev and yakovlev 1973 formula is reasonable however when the scattered wave formulation is used both the acoustic and solid surfaces at their interface are loaded in this case the acoustic pressure degree of freedom only stands for the scattered part of the total pressure but excludes the contribution from the incident wave consequently a free field pressure history of an incident wave at a given point predicted by the empirical formulas or recorded in a field laboratory undex test is no longer fully applicable for the scattered loading input this is because in most cases the reflected wave at an acoustic structural interface is not an exact copy of the incident wave however few researchers have addressed this issue and for simplicity empirical formula predicted jen 2009 or actual recorded van den abeele and verleysen 2013 free field pressure histories were often used as the loading input in previous undex analyses even when the scattered wave formulation was employed much uncertainty still exists about the incident wave loading input issue in the coupled acoustic structural undex analysis so far with this in mind the authors carried out a numerical simulation of a partially submerged circular rc column undergoing an undex shock loading by using the coupled acoustic structural analysis strategy in abaqus the simulation results with different calculation parameters or acoustic wave formulation types are compared with published experimental data zhuang et al 2020 to find out what factors concerning the loading input have pivotal roles in the simulation it is hoped that this work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the loading aspect of the coupled acoustic structural undex analysis strategy this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the main acoustic equations for describing the constitutive behavior of the fluid solved by the abaqus code section 3 gives a brief overview of the undex test in zhuang et al 2020 that is numerically reproduced in this work and the calculation conditions section 4 presents the simulation results and discussion the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 acoustic equations in abaqus 2010 the equilibrium equation for small motions of a compressible adiabatic fluid with velocity dependent momentum losses is taken to be 1 p x γ x θ i u f ρ f x θ i u f 0 where p is the excess pressure in the fluid the pressure in excess of any static pressure x is the spatial position of the fluid particle u f is the fluid particle velocity u f is the fluid particle acceleration ρ f is the density of the fluid γ is the volumetric drag force per unit volume per velocity and θ i are i independent field variables such as temperature humidity of air or salinity of water on which ρ f and γ may depend the d alembert term has been written without convection on the assumption that there is no steady flow of the fluid this is usually considered sufficiently accurate for steady fluid velocities up to mach 0 1 the constitutive behavior of the fluid is assumed to be inviscid linear and compressible so 2 p k f x θ i x u f where k f is the bulk modulus of the fluid for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation the absolute pressure sum of the static pressure and the excess dynamic pressure cannot drop below the specified cavitation limit when the absolute pressure drops to this limit value the fluid is assumed to undergo free expansion without a corresponding drop in the dynamic pressure the pressure would rebuild in the acoustic medium once the free expansion that took place during the cavitation is reversed sufficiently to reduce the volumetric strain to the level at the cavitation limit the constitutive behavior for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation can be stated as 3 p max p v p c p 0 where a pseudopressure p v a measure of the volumetric strain is defined as 4 p v k f x θ i x u f where p c is the fluid cavitation limit and p 0 is the initial acoustic static pressure a total wave formulation is used for a non linear acoustic medium undergoing cavitation it should be noted that the total wave formulation is very similar to the scattered wave formulation except that the pseudopressure defined as the product of the bulk modulus and the compressive volumetric strain plays the role of the material state variable instead of the acoustic excess pressure the acoustic excess pressure is readily available from this pseudopressure subject to the cavitation condition 3 numerical simulation 3 1 overview of the undex test in zhuang et al 2020 the undex test was carried out in a cylindrical water tank with a diameter of 10 00 m the water depth is 2 25 m the tank bottom is covered with a 0 5 m thick layer of buffer sand the undex target is a rc column with a height of 2 70 m and a diameter of 0 10 m the rc column is vertically installed with its two ends clamped in metallic frames and partially submerged in the water rising 0 45 m from the water surface eight hrb335 grade ribbed bars with diameters of 6 mm are embedded in the column for its longitudinal reinforcement the 28 day compressive strength of the concrete is 52 0 mpa roughly corresponding to the concrete strength grading c80 in the chinese grading system mohurd 2010 a displacement gauge and an acceleration gauge are installed at the back of the column away from the undex source 1 00 m below the water surface in addition nine strain gauges are installed on the rc column at three different heights in which six are for the reinforcing bars and three for the concrete the test setup is shown schematically in fig 1 with the detonation depth 1 m and the stand off distance 1 m steel pipes that have the same stand off distance from the undex source as the rc column are also placed in the water tank the dimensions of the steel pipes are generally the same as the rc column with the steel pipes being 0 20 m shorter than the rc column ten pressure sensors are embedded in the wall of each pipe at five different heights below the water surface with five on the front side facing the undex source and the rest on the back side thus the measured pressure histories can approximately represent the shock loading undergone by the rc column a series of undexs of different explosive weights varying from 0 025 to 0 8 kg were performed at different distances from the rc column varying from 0 to 7 m and the water surface varying from 0 25 to 2 m more details on the undex test e g the real world scene of the test setup the detailed dimensions of the rc column the configuration of the gauges and sensors and the test parameter combinations can be found in zhuang et al 2020 3 2 numerical model the current numerical simulation is carried out with abaqus explicit the concrete column is modeled with c3d8 8 node linear brick elements with the element edge lengths no greater than 0 01 m the reinforcing bars are modeled with t3d2 2 node linear truss elements with the element lengths equaling 0 01 m the reinforcing bar elements are embedded in the concrete elements with the embedded element technique in abaqus 2010 to implement the structural coupling of the two element groups the translational degrees of freedom of the embedded reinforcing bar nodes are constrained to the interpolated values of the corresponding degrees of freedom of the concrete elements the water is meshed by ac3d8r 8 node acoustic brick elements fig 2 shows the numerical model to determine an appropriate fluid domain thickness and the maximum allowable element length for it a modal analysis of the column is performed the employed concrete material parameters will be given in section 3 3 table 1 presents the modal analysis results regarding the first three modes of the column the second mode natural frequency 129 28 hz of the column should be adequate for estimating the maximum allowable fluid element length seeing that the dominant vibration frequency of the column is well below 130 hz in the undex test zhuang et al 2020 the maximum allowable fluid element length can be estimated by abaqus 2010 5 l max c n min f max where l max represents the maximum internodal interval of an element in the mesh n min the number of internodal intervals required per acoustic wavelength n min 10 is recommended f max the maximum frequency of interest and c the velocity of sound in the acoustic medium when the maximum frequency of interest of 130 hz is assumed with n min 12 and c 1500 m s l max should be less than 0 96 m mesh refinement is performed within a 1 m radius around the column to ensure sufficient solution accuracy for the acoustic pressure field neighbouring the column and thus the shock loading on the acoustic structural interface the nominal acoustic element size is set to be 0 05 m within the refinement range this size is slightly larger than one time a 30 μs rise time propagation distance of a shock wave due to the relatively low frequency of the column compared with a shock loading such a one time rise time element mesh is believed to be able to yield structural analysis results of sufficient accuracy with a sufficiently small time increment woyak 2002 while the nominal element size within the refinement range is set at 0 05 m it increases in size to a nominal 0 82 m at the outer fluid boundary with regard to the fluid domain thickness the radius of the water domain it is expressed as m min wavelengths at the minimum frequency f min to be analyzed as follows 6 r c m min f min let m min equal 1 3 woyak 2002 abaqus 2010 and f min be the first mode natural frequency 47 28 hz of the column the fluid domain thickness should thus be larger than 10 58 m in this context the radius of the water domain in the present numerical model is set to be 12 m it should be noted that the wave reflection at the tank wall in the physical test is not considered in the current numerical simulation this consideration excludes the loading effect of any reflected waves on the structural response of the column and can thus highlight that of the incident wave the column is closer to the undex source than the cylindrical tank wall in the physical test that would reflect the incident wave in this light however the initial physical response of the column measured in the test is believed to be meaningful for comparison with the numerical results the numerical model consists of 236696 nodes and 223952 elements of which 26016 continuum elements are for the column 2160 truss elements for the reinforcing bars and 195776 acoustic elements for the water 3 3 material parameters for the water the bulk modulus is 2 14 gpa and the mass density is 1000 kg m3 the velocity of sound in water is assumed to be 1500 m s the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcing bars is taken as 200 gpa the poisson s ratio as 0 3 and the mass density as 7850 kg m3 as mentioned in section 3 1 the actual compressive strength of the concrete employed in the test zhuang et al 2020 roughly corresponds to the c80 strength grade in the chinese grading system mohurd 2010 since the modulus of elasticity of the concrete is unavailable in zhuang et al 2020 it is taken as the recommended value of that for the c80 grade concrete in mohurd 2010 i e 38 gpa the poisson s ratio of the concrete is taken as 0 2 and the mass density as 2500 kg m3 the least explosive weight 0 025 kg case in the test is selected as the object of the present numerical study both the concrete and the reinforcing bars are thus assumed to be linear elastic materials the mass proportional rayleigh damping is used to damp the lower frequencies of the rc column the alpha damping factor is given a value of 29 71 s 1 for both the concrete and the reinforcing bar materials to produce 5 damping for the first vibration mode of the column the stiffness proportional rayleigh damping beta damping that generally damps the higher frequencies is neglected to avoid a dramatic reduction in the stable time increment 3 4 boundary conditions zero velocity boundary conditions are enforced for both ends of the column non reflecting boundary conditions are specified on the lateral and bottom boundaries of the water domain the radiating bottom boundary condition is implemented to account for the energy absorbing effect of the buffer sand that covers the tank bottom the fluid structure interaction between the water and the column is defined at their common wetted interface with a surface based tie constraint the dynamic acoustic pressure at the upper surface of the water is set to zero to enforce a free surface boundary condition an initial linearly varying hydrostatic pressure is specified in the water domain with the pressure values being 0 101 atmospheric pressure and 0 123 mpa at the water surface and bottom respectively the specified hydrostatic pressure is meaningful only when the total wave formulation is used to consider possible fluid cavitation however it does not apply any static loads to the column the boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 2a 3 5 loading given the limited availability of the test data in zhuang et al 2020 a test case with relatively comprehensive experimental results available is numerically reproduced a tnt explosive of a weight of 0 025 kg is detonated 1 m below the water surface 1 25 m above the tank bottom with a stand off distance of 1 m from the column in this test case the reference point for the loading history input is defined on the surface of the column 1 m below the water surface the measured incident wave loading distribution on the column is observed to be even on the whole zhuang et al 2020 due to the relatively small explosive weight used in the case the distance between the undex source and the bottom end of the column is 1 601 m 0 601 m larger than the nearest horizontal distance between them this distance difference produces a shift of about 400 μs between the times at which the shock front reaches the reference point and the bottom end of the column the time shift is equivalent to only 1 53 and 1 10 of the first and third mode natural vibration periods of the column respectively consequently the time shift should not significantly affect the principal vibration modes that dominate the overall dynamic response of the column given that a planar incident wave is thus assumed in the present simulation for simplicity the source point is located 13 m away from the column axis and also 1 m below the water surface note that under the current planar incident wave assumption only the spatial relationship between the source and reference points is meaningful that determines the wave traveling direction the loading history input at the reference point is determined not by the source to reference distance in the simulation but by the actual explosive distance in the test the decay stage of the loading history p t is approximated by the cole 1948 formula with an exponential decay time constant θ as follows 7 p t p max e t θ for tnt explosive p max and θ are given by 8 p max 52 16 w 1 3 r 1 13 9 θ 96 5 w 1 3 w 1 3 r 0 22 where w is expressed in kg of the tnt explosive and r is the stand off distance from the charge measured in meter the calculated p max and θ are thus 12 999 mpa and 36 982 μs respectively regarding the pressure rise stage it is assumed to be a linear process in this analysis unfortunately the actual rise time is not available in zhuang et al 2020 in fact to date there has been little published quantitative test data on the pressure rise time of undex shock loadings because of measurement system limitations walter 2004 and undesired environmental influences draganić et al 2018 one major experimental issue that has dominated the field for many years concerns insufficient cut off frequencies of measurement systems arons 1954 bjørnø and levin 1976 yiannakopoulos and van der schaaf 1998 in addition an undex shock front could be distorted in the test recording due to the finite geometrical size of the employed pressure gauge bjarnholt 1980 some undex tests such as that conducted by park et al 2003 and rolfe et al 2017 have shown that typical undex shock front duration produced by relatively large amounts of explosive is very short compared to the decay time however some experimental data from several other studies bjørnø and levin 1976 mouritz 1995 1996 chambers et al 2001 suggest that the duration of an undex shock front generated by a small amount of explosive could be comparable to the corresponding decay time constant θ a search of the literature reveals few studies arons 1954 mouritz 1995 mouritz 1996 yiannakopoulos and van der schaaf 1998 which suggest the rise time should be less than 30 40 μs in the present analysis the pressure rise is thus assumed to occur over a period of time of up to 40 μs 3 6 column mesh sensitivity analysis considering the undex loading employed that is composed of very high frequencies a numerical verification of the mesh size sensitivity is performed to examine whether the current mesh can yield a proper response of the column essentially the high frequency components two additional models with different mesh sizes for the column are created for comparison the coarse and fine column meshes have element edge lengths no greater than 0 012 m and 0 008 m respectively fig 3 compares the horizontal displacement time histories of the column at three typical points with different meshes the comparison shows that the vibrations of the column at different points elevations are different in terms of their vibrational frequency components the vibrations at points a and c contain some high frequency oscillations essentially at point a but this is not true for that at point b however it is encouraging to note that the calculated displacement histories are found to be hardly distinguishable from each other at each point in particular the three displacement histories at point a that contain considerable high frequency oscillations are in good agreement the comparison gives a good indication that all the three meshes can yield accurate results regarding the dynamic response of the column under the applied undex loading in the following analysis consequently the current model with the intermediate element size 0 01 m is employed 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of rise time in this subsection the total wave formulation is used for the undex shock loading implementation abaqus 2010 to consider possible fluid cavitation the cavitation pressure limit is assigned a zero value implying that the water cannot sustain any tension in the simulation the incident wave loading is applied to the exterior of the acoustic water mesh for comparison of the wall pressure on the column the time period of the numerical analysis is set to be 100 μs with the time interval for output set to be 1 μs for comparison of the structural response of the column however the analysis time period and the output time interval are 0 8 s and 1 ms respectively the pressure rise time of the undex loading is assumed to range from 20 to 40 μs a fixed time incrementation of 1 μs that is less than or equal to 1 20 of the rise time is thus used as suggested by woyak 2002 using such a time increment is believed to be able to provide good results with a relatively coarse acoustic mesh for a low frequency structural system fig 4 shows the initialization of the acoustic field with different durations of the undex shock front significantly the three solutions regarding the acoustic pressure initialization are similar in terms of their pressure values and distributions the planar incident wave front is satisfactorily captured right before it reaches the column as expected the simulated peak pressure values at the shock front are 2 52 0 53 and 3 76 less than the theoretical value 12 999 mpa when the rise time is 20 30 and 40 μs respectively consequently it is believed that the employed water mesh can yield reasonably accurate initialization of the acoustic pressure in the domain and thus apply a proper incident wave loading on the column without significant numerical dissipation or distortion the calculation results in fig 4 suggest that the rise time has little effect on the acoustic pressure initialization in the water fig 5 compares the calculated wall pressure histories on the column with the free field impulses that are used for the loading input in the three cases what stands out in fig 5 is the significant higher peak values of the wall pressure compared with that of the free field pressure the pressure increase is the consequence of the superposition of the incident and reflected waves at the column water interface i e the wall effect xiao et al 2014 the wall pressure rise significantly lags behind that of the free field pressure especially at the initial stage the lag may be explained by the fact that the column should move away from the water at the arrival of the shock front the tendency of the column to separate from the water to some extent hinders the wall pressure rise as regards the pressure drop stage it is interesting to note that the wall pressure drops at an observably faster pace to zero after it rises to the peak the kick off velocity of the column induced by the shock continues to increase at this stage thus causing the water to be increasingly unable to catch up with the column when the column has accelerated enough to separate from the water the initial shock pulse is ended by local cavitation with the wall pressure falling to zero a marked observation to emerge from the data comparison in fig 5 is the difference in peak wall pressure between the three cases a longer duration of the shock front produces a higher peak wall pressure within the employed range 20 40 μs the rise time plays an important role in defining the loading input for the current simulation this finding seems somewhat counterintuitive and could be attributed to the small decay time constant that defines the descending phases of the three inputted loading histories in fact the employed rise time 20 40 μs is comparable to the current decay time constant 36 982 μs in this case an increase in the rise time would significantly amplify the loading impulse and thus produce an observably higher wall pressure on the column therefore the rise time could be a major factor that should be viewed cautiously when dealing with an undex loading history having a decay time constant of the order of tens of microseconds importantly the calculated peak wall pressure when the rise time 30 μs correlates fairly well with the measured one in zhuang et al 2020 hence it could be hypothesized that the actual rise time of the undex loading history be approximately 30 μs this hypothesis does not conflict with previous experimental research into this area bjørnø and levin 1976 chambers et al 2001 which suggests that the rise time of a pulse history produced by a small scale undex could be of the order of the corresponding decay time constant fig 6 shows the calculated displacement time histories at the back of the column 1 00 m below the water surface and the measured one in zhuang et al 2020 the most striking observation to emerge from the displacement time history comparison is that the modeled vibration frequency of the column is significantly higher than the measured one this inconsistency may be due to the inadequate sampling frequency used for the displacement measurement in the test zhuang et al 2020 the modeled vibration frequency approximately 45 hz of the column is slightly lower than its first mode natural frequency 47 28 hz due to the added mass effect of the surrounding water this finding indicates that the dynamic response of the column to the undex loading should be dominated by its fundamental bending mode for which the dominant motion is transverse to the column axis interestingly the calculated kick off displacements in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases the first peaks in the two cases are very close to each other which are prominently larger than that in the rise time 20 μs case these results are in agreement with the findings presented in fig 5 which show that the calculated wall pressure time histories when the rise time 30 and 40 μs are roughly comparable in their impulses although they have significantly different peak values it is encouraging to note that the first peaks in the cases when the rise time 30 and 40 μs appear close to the experimental one a closer inspection reveals that the first experimental peak is slightly higher than the calculated ones but observably lags behind those due to the inadequate sampling frequency for the measurement actually the first experimental peak is captured at approximately t 19 ms and such a time period could be enough for a shock wave to make a round trip from end to end in the 10 m diameter tank thus the first experimental peak should have covered the contribution from the reflected waves arising at the water tank wall this may partly explain the difference in kick off displacement between the experimental and calculation results that the first experimental peak is slightly higher it indicates that the undex shock waves may have been repeatedly reflected by the tank wall without significant dissipation within the initial 200 ms period this explains that the second experimental peak 4 5 mm is even higher than the first one and that the measured peak displacements are significantly larger than the calculated ones during the initial 200 ms period after 200 ms the measured oscillation of the column gradually diminishes and tends to be consistent with the calculation results it implies that the current empirically based damping value employed for the first vibration mode of the column i e 5 of critical can provide a generally reasonable damping mechanism for the system in fact the first experimental peak captured at t 19 ms as mentioned above should not be the kick off displacement in reality due to the inadequate sampling frequency for the measurement the actual kick off displacement could be less than the first experimental peak that should have covered the contribution from the waves reflected in the water tank however the overall experimental results shown in fig 6 could have underestimated the response of the column since not enough sampling points are present on the other hand the current simulation results do not account for the waves reflected in the water tank this simplification is likely to induce errors after a few milliseconds and thus lead to divergences between the simulation and experimental results despite these limitations however the comparison at least indicates a conclusion that the simulated and actual displacement responses of the column are in the same order of magnitude given the current planar incident wave assumption caution must be taken the assumption is based on a premise that the shift between the times at which the shock front reaches the middle and ends of the column is far less than its first few natural vibration periods of some principal vibration modes consequently the current simplified treatment of the incident wave might not be transferable to other simulations that consider some structures with larger lengths heights making the time shift larger or stiffnesses bringing about shorter natural vibration periods in those cases a spherical incident wave should be specified to properly consider the effect of the time shift 4 2 effect of acoustic wave formulation type in this subsection the scattered and total wave formulations are used for the undex shock loading implementation abaqus 2010 for comparison purposes the pressure rise time of the undex loading is assumed to be 30 μs for the current comparison both acoustic and solid surfaces at the column water interface are loaded when the scattered wave formulation is used it should be noted that the calculated pressures with the two formulations are not comparable as the denotations of the pressure in the formulations are essentially different for the total wave formulation the acoustic pressure degree of freedom denotes the total dynamic acoustic pressure including contributions from incident and scattered waves it is particularly applicable when the acoustic medium is capable of cavitation rendering the fluid mechanical behavior non linear for the scattered wave formulation however the pressure at an acoustic node is defined to be only the scattered part of the total pressure this formulation cannot account for possible fluid cavitation by assuming the fluid mechanical behavior linear abaqus 2010 fig 7 compares the displacement time histories of the column with the two acoustic wave formulation types the modeled vibration frequencies of the column with the two formulation types are identical and so are the decay durations of the vibration however the calculated vibration amplitude with the scattered wave formulation is clearly smaller than that with the total wave formulation and also the measured one fig 6 this finding is somewhat unexpected and suggests that the wave formulation selection could significantly affect the incident wave loading implementation for the present case considering the difference in the implication of the pressure in the two formulations the total dynamic acoustic pressure from the scattered pressure results is rebuilt for the sake of coherence and clarity of the pressure time history comparison the calculated scattered pressure is superimposed on the known incident pressure to generate the total pressure this rebuilt total pressure is compared with the calculated total dynamic acoustic pressure when the total wave formulation is used as shown in fig 8 it is apparent that the fluctuations in the acoustic pressure are tiny on the 800 ms timescale compared with those on the 1000 μs timescale this indicates that most of the vibration energy of the column should come from the initial shock pulse the most important aspect of the data in fig 8 is thus in the pressure comparison in the first 1000 μs the first peaks with the two formulations are very close to each other as expected with the scattered wave one appearing slightly higher and earlier however considerable negative pressure is observed when the scattered wave formulation is used and it partly counteracts the shock loading effect of the positive part on the column potential negative pressure is cut off at the hydrostatic pressure level due to the local cavitation phenomenon arising at the column water interface when the total wave formulation is used this could explain why the calculated vibration of the column with the scattered wave formulation is significantly weaker than that with the total wave formulation as shown in fig 7 in fact the local cavitation phenomenon possibly occurring at a fluid structure interface has been reported by some previous numerical research sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2012 the fundamental cause of local cavitation lies in the tendency of the structure to separate from the fluid when the structure is undergoing a shock loading for shell or plate structures that have low structural stiffnesses their dynamic responses are usually strong in undex events the strong vibration could make the local cavitation phenomenon more likely to occur and thus have a more noticeable influence on the fluid structure interaction in the present case the column is located perpendicular to the incident wave direction that renders the transverse motion of the column prominent it may be the case therefore that the local cavitation phenomenon is significant in the present case this finding broadly supports the work of other numerical studies in this area sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2012 linking the vibration of low stiffness structures in undex events with the local cavitation effect the local cavitation effect is the fundamental reason why the scattered wave formulation that describes the water as linear is not applicable to the present case 5 conclusions this paper seeks to address the loading issue in coupled acoustic structural undex analyses this numerical study has identified two important factors a the duration of an undex shock front the rise time and b the employed acoustic wave formulation type scattered or total a 2 70 m high and 0 10 m diameter rc column partially submerged in water is taken as an undex target in the current case study the study has shown that the simulated peak pressure values in the initialized acoustic fields are in good agreement with the theoretical value with the rise time ranging from 20 to 40 μs when the total wave formulation is used the rise time is irrelevant to the acoustic pressure initialization in the water comparison of the calculated kick off displacements of the column in the rise time 30 and 40 μs cases with the experimental one zhuang et al 2020 verifies the reliability of the current simulation with the total wave formulation the evidence from this numerical study suggests that the rise time should be recognized as a key parameter when dealing with a small explosion equivalent case that often exists in laboratory undex tests for small explosion equivalent scenarios the dynamic structural analysis results should be highly sensitive to the rise time because the rise time could be comparable to the decay time constant of the undex loading history considering that very little is currently known about the instantaneous pressure rise process of an undex loading history the determination of the rise time should and has to rely more on practical experience it would seem that a period of time of 30 40 μs for the rise time could be reasonable and practical it should be noted that the above conclusion regarding the rise time issue is limited to small explosive charges for which the rise time is in the order of magnitude of the decay time it is not valid for large undex loadings usually having much higher frequencies the study has also shown that the scattered wave formulation is not applicable for the current case in which the column structurally interacts with the water in an undex event this is due to the simulated negative pressure loading on the column that does not actually exist the negative pressure tends to drag the column into the water and thus produces an underestimated response of the column there is therefore a definite need to use the total wave formulation when performing undex analyses of low stiffness structures e g shell plate and column structures to properly consider the local cavitation effect the major limitation of this study is the planar incident wave assumption made in the numerical simulation this assumption makes the current findings less generalizable to other structures with larger lengths heights or stiffnesses despite its exploratory nature this work offers valuable insights into the loading issue in coupled acoustic structural undex analyses however the precise mechanism of the instantaneous pressure rise process of an undex loading history remains to be elucidated in future experimental work a greater focus on the cavitation threshold could produce interesting findings that account more for the local cavitation effect on

influence of the time duration of etafs on the component fragility varies across different components but the system fragility increases with the increasing time duration on the whole scour can produce either beneficial or adverse effects on the component and system seismic fragilities depending on the scour depth keywords earthquake scour sea crossing cable stayed bridge endurance time method hydrodynamic effect seismic fragility 1 introduction with the ever increasing demand for transportation networks across straits and channels numerous long span sea crossing bridges have been built or are under construction to connect the mainland and island xu et al 2020 as one of the most popular sea crossing bridge types sea crossing cable stayed bridges have been widely constructed such as hangzhou bay bridge ye 2010 china east sea bridge liu et al 2007 sunshine skyway bridge shahawy and arockiasamy 1996 pingtan strait rail cum road bridge ti et al 2019 etc the movement and collision between continental and oceanic plate margins can lead to catastrophic earthquakes in the strait regions as such the seismic behavior of these bridges should be assessed seismic fragility is a common tool for the safety assessment of bridges under earthquake zhong et al 2020a b zhong et al 2018a b investigated the component and system fragilities of a cable stayed bridge using the time history analysis method pang et al 2014 calculated the seismic fragility curves of a single pylon cable stayed bridge using the time history analysis method and discussed the effect of uncertainties in the fragility functions noghabi et al 2014 employed the incremental dynamic analysis ida framework to evaluate the component and system fragilities of a cable stayed bridge li et al 2018 evaluated the seismic behavior of a sea crossing cable stayed bridge and addressed the influences of the soil structure interaction and hydrodynamic effects on the seismic fragility of the bridge however the seismic fragility analysis of cable stayed bridges using conventional methods such as ida is challenging because their structural complexity could lead to expensive computational cost furthermore the strait regions where the sea crossing bridges are located usually suffer from deep water and rapid currents as a result the scour hole may occur around the foundations during the service life of a bridge guo et al 2020 zha et al 2009 reported that the maximum local sour depth around the foundation of a sea crossing bridge would exceed 16 m the occurrence of the scour hole can reduce the lateral stiffness of bridge foundations so that the dynamic characteristics of bridges can be affected guo and chen 2016 wang et al 2019 these can result in significant changes in the performance of sea crossing cable stayed bridges under earthquake loads guo et al 2019 therefore it is of great necessity to discuss the impact of scour effect on the seismic behavior of sea crossing cable stayed bridges unfortunately the vulnerability of sea crossing cable stayed bridges under the joint impact of scour and earthquake scenarios has rarely been reported taking into account the scour effect on the seismic fragility analysis of sea crossing cable stayed bridges not only increases the structural complexity but also requires impractically expensive computational effort for the calculation of seismic fragility curves for different scour depths if conventional methods such as ida are still employed thus it is essential to develop a seismic fragility analysis framework with high computational efficiency for the fragility analysis of more complicated bridge structures to achieve the goal identified above the endurance time method etm is implemented as an alternative technique for calculating the seismic response of structures by subjecting structures to predefined intensifying ground motions estekanchi et al 2020 recently the etm has been widely used to conduct seismic response analyses for various types of structures guo et al 2017 used etm to analyze the seismic behavior of a bridge including the pounding effect and validated etm with the ida method tavazo et al tavazo and ranjbaran 2017 discussed the accuracy of etm in the fragility analysis of a reinforcement concrete frame and found that etm could provide acceptable results through only three time endurance time analyses pang et al 2020a b investigated the seismic response of deep water bridges using the etm and concluded that the etm could provide a satisfactory estimation of hydrodynamic effects with reduced computational effort he et al 2020 used the etm to study the effect of scour depths on the seismic vulnerability of highway bridges and found that the etm was efficient and effective as an alternative to ida method for seismic fragility analysis the etm provides the potential to efficiently investigate the seismic vulnerability of long span cable stayed bridges with high structure complexity which yet remains far less investigated this study employed the etm to develop an efficient seismic fragility analysis framework for the sea crossing cable stayed bridges the numerical model of an example sea crossing cable stayed bridge was established soil structure interactions were considered and the removal of soil springs was used to model the scour depth the added mass model was employed to consider the hydrodynamic effects for the pile and pile cap respectively both etm and ida fragility analyses framework were utilized to calculate the seismic response of the example bridge and the applicability of the etm was validated by comparing the developed fragility curves with those from the ida framework the influence of the time duration of endurance time acceleration functions etafs and the scour effect on both the component and system seismic fragilities were finally investigated 2 seismic fragility analysis framework based on the etm 2 1 component fragility based on the etm the seismic fragility describes the likelihood of the structural damage in the predefined limit state under a specific im level pang et al 2021 assuming that both the seismic demand s d and capacity s c follow lognormal distributions muntasir billah and shahria the fragility function can be expressed as follows 1 p f φ ln s d s c β c 2 β d 2 where β c and β d are the dispersions of s c and s d respectively ф is the standard normal cumulative distribution function the seismic demand model can be developed through the following linear regression analysis in the logarithmically transformed state zhong et al 2018a b 2 ln s d b ln i m a where a and b are the parameters obtained from the linear regression analysis the value of β 2 c β 2 d 1 2 can be taken from the recommendations in the hazards99 user s manual fema 1999 so that the key point of generating the component fragility curves is to develop the seismic demand model the advantage of etm is that the seismic demand models of bridge components can be calculated efficiently by using generated intensifying ground motions called etafs estekanchi et al 2020 the acceleration and displacement response spectra of etafs should increase linearly with the time as follows estekanchi et al 2011 3 s a t t t t t t arg e t s a c t 4 s u t t t t t t arg e t s a c t t 2 4 π 2 in which s at t t and s ut t t are the target acceleration and displacement response spectra s ac t is the selected design acceleration response spectrum t target is the target time for scaling the etafs t is the free vibration period an optimal etaf should satisfy the above two equations so that etafs can be generated by solving the following unconstrained optimization problem 5 min f a g 0 t max 0 t max s a t t s a t t t 2 α s u t t s u t t t 2 d t d t where a g is the target etaf s a t t and s u t t are the acceleration and displacement response spectra of a g t max is the time duration of the etaf and t max is the maximum period of free vibration considered in the optimization process α is the relative weight coefficient for the displacement spectrum more details about the etm based analysis framework can be found in the authors previous work 13 2 2 system fragility the component level fragility curves developed in section 2 1 can provide insights on the relative vulnerability of different bridge components however the overall bridge system is usually thought to be more fragile than any bridge components choi et al 2004 the system fragility is calculated using the joint probability seismic demand model jpsdm this method assumes that there is some level of correlation between the seismic demand models of different bridge components zhong et al 2020a b therefore the system level seismic demand can be calculated as the joint demand on the bridge components the covariance matrix is generated based on the assumed correlation among the demands of different bridge components based on the jpsdm and limit state model a monte carlo sampling mcs is applied to calculate the failure probability across a wide range of ims nielson and desroches 2007 in particular a number of n random samples are obtained from both the jpsdm and damage state model using mcs for each im each demand is assessed in the sampling failure domain and recorded by the following function 6 i f 1 if x 1 x 2 x n f 1 2 n 0 if x 1 x 2 x n f 1 2 n in which x 1 x 2 x n is the sampling demand of n bridge components and f 1 2 n is the corresponding failure domain then the failure probability of the bridge system under a given im level can be expressed as 7 p s y s i 1 n i f i n 3 numerical modeling of an example bridge a sea crossing cable stayed bridge was taken as the example bridge as shown in fig 1 the example bridge has a length of 132 196 532 196 132 1188 m the heights of the reinforced concrete pylon and pier are 220 m and 50 m respectively the pile group foundation for the pylon is located in the 21 m deep water excluding scour depth the pile cap has a dumbbell shaped cross section of 80 4 m 32 4 m 10 m the diameter of the pile is 4 5 m and the pile length is 47 m in addition there are 135 φ40 longitudinal steel bars in each pile and the stirrup spacing is 100 mm the soil above the base rock is 36 m and the soil type around the pile group is medium sand with an effective weight of 30 kn m3 and a friction angle of 30 3 1 finite element modeling the numerical model of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge was built using opensees software as shown in fig 2 the superstructure is modeled by elastic beam elements pang et al 2020a b the pylon pier and pile foundations under pylons were modeled by nonlinear beam elements to represent their inelastic behavior under earthquake loads the pile cap is deemed to act like a rigid body during earthquakes and it is therefore modeled by the concentrated mass and the pile and pile cap are connected by rigid links since the assistant and side piers are located on the beach the scour effect is negligible only the pile group foundations for the pylon were considered in the model the piles for the assistant pier and side pier could remain elastic without the scour effect during earthquakes and was not considered in the numerical model their contributions were simplified as six stiffness springs the constitutive model of the confined and unconfined concrete was considered using the concrete 01 material the strength of the cover concrete for the pylon was 55 mpa while the strength of concrete for the pile and pier was 45 mpa the stress strain relationship of the longitudinal rebars was modeled by the steel 01 material in which the yield strength and elastic modulus are set to 400 mpa and 200 gpa respectively the cables of the bridge were modeled by truss elements combined with the initial strain of the cable using the initstrainmaterial material the elastic modulus and tensile strength for cables was set to 200 gpa and 1860 mpa the bilinear spring element was used to model the bearings 3 2 the modeling approach of scour depths the p y springs were used to model the lateral support of the soil to the pile foundation the parameters for the mechanical behavior of the soil spring elements were calculated according to the formulae and figures provided by api api 1993 it should be noted that the vertical movement of pile tips was restrained because the pile tips were embedded into the based rock in this study the piles were divided into a series of nonlinear beam elements with a length of 0 5 m and the removal of p y springs above the scour depth h as shown in fig 2 c was used to model the scour depth so that the finite element model of the scoured bridge could be created it should be noted that the parameters for the remaining soil spring would be recalculated after the removal of the soil spring 3 3 hydrodynamic effects the foundation of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge is usually located in the deep water environment the surrounding water will affect the dynamic characteristics and seismic response of bridges zhang et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider hydrodynamic effects for sea crossing bridges when evaluating their seismic performance considering the scour effect the added mass model was used to assess the hydrodynamic effects the morison equation was used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass for piles potential flow theory was used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the pile cap with the assistance of aqwa software as shown in fig 3 the calculated added mass for the pile and pile cap in the x y and z directions are listed in table 1 respectively it should be noted that the pile length submerged in the water increases with the increasing scour depth and the added mass on the pile changes with the change of the scour depth as shown in fig 2 c 4 verification of the etm 4 1 generation of etafs the target acceleration response spectrum used in this study is expressed in the following equation 8 s a c s max 5 5 t 0 45 t 0 1 s s max 0 1 s t t g s max t g t t t g where t g is the characteristic period of the ground motion equal to 0 4 s and s max is the peak ground acceleration equal to 0 2 g in this study t max in eq 3 was set to 5 sand α was set to zero three groups of etafs etafs 20s etafs 40s and etafs 60s with the endurance time of 20 s 40 s and 60 s were generated the target times for the three groups of etafs were set to 5 s 10 s and 15 s according to previous studies three etafs are enough to obtain reasonable results estekanchi et al 2020 therefore each group included three generated etafs and the average results were used to calculate the fragility curves for the associated group fig 4 shows one typical etaf in each group used in this study the amplitude of the generated etaf increases continually and the acceleration response spectra of the etaf at the different time match with the corresponding target response spectra the other two etafs in each group also present similar results even though the figures are not shown for brevity 4 2 calculation for the im and engineering demand parameters edps the calculation of seismic fragility curves of structures depends on the choice of im according to the concept of the etm both pga and spectral acceleration of etafs at different times can be used as the im as shown in fig 5 ardebili et al hariri ardebili et al 2014 suggested that the spectral acceleration should be used as im while using the etm as the seismic analysis method thus the spectral acceleration at the period equal to 1 0 s s a 10 was used as the im in this study moreover the edps at different ims can be obtained when etafs are used as input to conduct nonlinear time history analyses as follows 9 f t e d p m a x a b s f τ τ 0 t after a single time history analysis the eta curve that describes the relationship between the im and edp can be obtained 4 3 comparison between the etm and ida the ida framework was also employed to conduct seismic fragility analyses to validate the etm results ten artificial ground motions with the time duration of 40 s were generated fig 6 shows the time history and corresponding acceleration response spectrum of one typical artificial ground motion used in ida the acceleration response spectrum of the artificial ground motion coincides well with the acceleration spectrum expressed in eq 8 ten artificial ground motion were scaled and 80 scaled acceleration records were used as seismic input to calculate the edps of the bridge components under different ims without scour effect to validate the results from etm both etm and ida were used to calculate the fragility curves of the example bridge under no scour condition the earthquake excitation was assumed to be uniform across different soil layers shang et al 2018 the responses of the pylon pile foundation assistant pier side pier and bearings were obtained to develop the corresponding fragility curves for the damage indexes of different bridge components the curvature ductility μ was used as the damage index of the pylon pile foundation assistant pier and side pier the maximum curvatures along the height of the pylon pile assistant pier and side pier were recorded to calculate the curvature ductility coefficients the damage states for the pylon pile and pier were defined as follows 1 μ 2 for slight damage 2 μ 4 for moderate damage 4 μ 7 for major damage and μ 7 for collapse choi et al 2004 the displacement δ of the bearing was used as the damage index for the bearings the damage states for the bearing were defined as follows 50 mm δ 100 mm for slight damage 100 mm δ 150 mm for moderate damage 150 mm δ 255 mm for major damage and δ 255 mm for collapse choi et al 2004 only the longitudinal seismic response of the bearing was considered in this study because the bearing in the transverse direction was designed to be fixed fig 7 presents the transverse fragility curves of the pylon and pile calculated from the etm and ida method respectively only the collapse state is presented herein as similar results are obtained for other damage states the fragility curves calculated by the etm based framework match with the ones developed by the ida method the similar results can also be found for other bridge components and damage states so that they are not shown here for brevity only three etafs were enough to obtain reasonable results through the etm while 80 nonlinear time histories were required for the ida method to ensure the accuracy of the results therefore the etm can substantially improve the calculation efficiency it should be noted that the dispersion coefficients for both methods were selected from hazards99 user s manual fema 1999 when calculating these component fragility curves 4 4 influence of the time duration of the etafs seismic response of bridges can be affected by the time duration of ground motion to examine the influence of the time duration of etafs on the seismic fragility of the bridge three groups of etafs with different time durations of 20 s 40 s and 60 s were employed to calculate the component and system fragility curves of the bridge without the scour effect fig 8 shows the transverse fragility curves of the pile and assistant pier for the collapse damage state it is obvious that the influence of the time duration of etafs on the seismic fragilities of bridge components is sensitive to the component variety the failure probability of the piles calculated by etafs 40s is larger than those from etafs 20 and etafs 60s and the results calculated by etafs 20 and etafs 60s are not much different however the failure probability of the assistant pier increases continually with the increasing etaf time duration though not shown here similar results can be obtained for other bridge components fig 9 shows the influence of the time duration of etafs on the system fragility for the example bridge under the collapse state the transverse failure probability of the bridge system calculated by etafs 20s is much smaller than those obtained from etafs 40s and etafs 60s while the discrepancy among the results from etafs 40s and etafs 60s is negligible for the longitudinal direction the fragility curves calculated by etafs 20s and etafs 40s are not much different while the failure probability calculated by etafs 60s is much larger than those obtained by etafs 20s and etaf 40s therefore the time duration of etafs has different impact on the system fragilities of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge in the transverse and longitudinal directions however a longer time duration tends to lead to a higher failure probability for the bridge system on the whole in this study the results from etafs 40s were used to conduct the parameter study and discuss the effect of scour depths 5 effect of scour on the fragility of the example bridge 5 1 dynamic characteristics considering the scour effect the dynamic characteristics of the example bridge were investigated before analyzing the seismic fragility the natural vibration periods and modal shapes of the example bridge without scour effect are listed in table 2 an increase rate of natural vibration periods was calculated as the ratio of increase in natural vibration periods due to scour effect to the natural vibration periods for the bridge without scour effect it should be noted that the sequence of the natural vibration modes was not changed under different scour depths as shown in fig 10 the first six natural vibration periods change negligibly when the scour depth increases continually with the maximum increase rate less than 2 scour has a negligible effect on the first six modes because they correspond to the vibration of the superstructure and pylon the impact of scour becomes significant on the natural vibration periods of the 23rd and 24th vibration modes as their modal shapes present the vibration of the pile foundation of which the stiffness can be affected by the scour depths significantly the natural vibration period increases by up to 10 as the scour depth reaches to 15 m 5 2 component fragility curves of the example bridge due to the scour effect the etm approach presented in section 4 was adopted to develop the fragility curves for different bridge components of the example bridge under a particular scour depth and for different damage states seven scour depths equal to 0 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 m were investigated in this study fig 11 shows the influence of scour on the transverse fragility of the bridge components under the collapse states the fragility curves under other damage states show similar results so they are not shown here for brevity the failure probability of the pylon tends to decrease with the increasing scour depth the scour effect can reduce the failure probability of the pile when the scour depth is relatively small 2 5 m when the scour depth increases from 2 5 m to 7 5 m the failure probability of the pile foundation increases substantially the impact of scour effect is negligible when the scour depth is in the range of 7 5 m 12 5 m with the scour depth over 12 5 m the failure probability of the pile decreases with the increasing scour depth the scour effect can reduce the failure probability of piers when the scour depth is relatively small 7 5 m and 2 5 m for assistant pier and side pier respectively but increases with the increasing scour depth at larger scour depth 7 5 m 15 m and 2 5 m 12 5 m for assistant pier and side pier respectively fig 12 shows the effect of scour depths on the longitudinal fragility curves of the bridge components under the collapse states it can be seen that the failure probability of the bridge pylon decreases with the increasing scour depth the failure probability of the pile increases at first but the scour effect tends to reduce the failure probability with the scour depth over 5 m similarly the failure probabilities for the assistant pier side pier and bearing increase at first and then decrease nonlinearly when the scour depth is larger than a certain value for instance the failure probability of the bearing decreases when the scour depth is larger than 10 m fig 13 shows the transverse and longitudinal fragility surfaces of bridge components for the collapse state under different scour depths for the transverse fragilities the failure probability of the pile under different scour depths is higher than other bridge components while the side pier has the lowest failure probability the failure probability of the pylon and assistant pier is between the pile foundation and side pier for the longitudinal direction the pile foundation and bearing in general have higher failure probabilities than pylon and assistant pier this indicates that the pile foundation and bearing are more vulnerable to earthquake loads under scour conditions as compared to other bridge components some mitigation measures are necessary to prevent the failure of the pile and bearing of the bridge under earthquake loads overall scour can have either a beneficial or adverse effect on the component fragility the extent of scour effects varies significantly from component to component in general the occurrence of scour and the increase of scour depth tends to transfer the damage from the pylon to the pile foundation this is because the pile foundation is more likely to suffer from deformation during earthquakes considering the scour effect it is almost consistently observed in all bridge components that the impact of scour on failure probability is strongly associated with the scour depth the impact of scour is twofold 1 scour can amplify the deformation of pile foundation due to the removal of soil 2 scour can cause an increase in the natural vibration periods these can produce complex interaction between various bridge components for example the deformation of the pile can increase due to the decreasing lateral stiffness of the bridge foundation whereas can also decrease due to the elongated natural vibration period the behavior change of pile foundation would in turn affect the seismic response of other bridge components different scour depths may change the way that different bridge components interact with each other under earthquake loads 5 3 system fragility curves of the example bridge due to the scour effect fig 14 shows the transverse and longitudinal system fragility curves under different scour depths as shown in fig 14 scour could impose negative effects on the seismic performance of the bridge system but the most adverse seismic responses of the bridge system do not occur under the maximum scour depth for example the transverse failure probabilities of the bridge system change little when the scour depth is in the range of 0 m and 5 m when the scour depth increases from 5 m to 7 5 m the failure probability increases significantly the failure probability decreases when the scour depth is larger than 12 5 m therefore the influence of the scour effect on the system fragility of the example bridge cannot be ignored and mitigation measures should be taken to prevent the failure of the bridge system if the bridge may suffer from both earthquake and scour during the service of life 6 conclusions this paper provides an efficient etm based framework for seismic fragility analysis of sea crossing cable stayed bridges an example cable stayed bridge was modeled and analyzed in opensees to illustrate the developed framework the effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated by comparing the fragility curves obtained from the etm based framework with the ones from the ida based framework the influence of the time duration of endurance time acceleration functions etafs on seismic fragility was also discussed the validated etm based framework was implemented to investigate the effect of scour on the component and system fragilities of the example bridge the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the etm based fragility analysis framework can yield satisfactory results for the seismic assessment of sea crossing cable stayed bridges compared with the ida method the etm only requires three time history analyses to calculate the fragility curves while 80 time history analyses are needed for ida this demonstrated the capability of the etm to reduce computational effort while maintaining the analysis accuracy 2 the influence of the time duration of etafs on the component fragility varies from component to component but a longer time duration consistently leads to a higher failure probability at the bridge system level 3 as the scour depth increases the first few natural vibration periods of the example sea crossing cable stayed bridge remain unaffected by the scour effect the natural vibration periods of higher modes which include the vibration of the pile foundation increase with the increasing scour depths 4 the impact of scour depths on the component level seismic fragility varies from component to component the pile and bearing are more vulnerable under the joint effect of earthquake and scour hazards compared to other bridge components scour can produce either beneficial or adverse effects on the component and system seismic performance depending on the scour depth it should be noted that all above results were obtained on the basis of artificial ground motions the average acceleration response spectrum of the actual ground motions should be used to generate etafs to further verify the applicability of the etm based framework the recommended dispersion coefficients in the guideline are used for the etm and ida framework when calculating the fragility curves the influence of such dispersion coefficients should be discussed when applying etm into the seismic fragility analysis in future work moreover the developed framework requires etafs with longer time duration to evaluate the seismic behavior of bridges with longer natural vibration period and this can lead to the increasing computational effort in solving the unconstrained optimization problem more effective algorithms are required in the future notwithstanding these limitations this study provides an efficient tool for the seismic fragility analysis for sea crossing cable stayed bridges and illustrates the relationship between scour and structural fragility which provides a practical means for seismic design of sea crossing cable stayed

20688,seismic fragility assessment using structural dynamic analysis remains challenging for complex systems due to the high computational demand such as the sea crossing cable stayed bridges the

maximum period of free vibration considered in the optimization process α is the relative weight coefficient for the displacement spectrum more details about the etm based analysis framework can be found in the authors previous work 13 2 2 system fragility the component level fragility curves developed in section 2 1 can provide insights on the relative vulnerability of different bridge components however the overall bridge system is usually thought to be more fragile than any bridge components choi et al 2004 the system fragility is calculated using the joint probability seismic demand model jpsdm this method assumes that there is some level of correlation between the seismic demand models of different bridge components zhong et al 2020a b therefore the system level seismic demand can be calculated as the joint demand on the bridge components the covariance matrix is generated based on the assumed correlation among the demands of different bridge components based on the jpsdm and limit state model a monte carlo sampling mcs is applied to calculate the failure probability across a wide range of ims nielson and desroches 2007 in particular a number of n random samples are obtained from both the jpsdm and damage state model using mcs for each im each demand is assessed in the sampling failure domain and recorded by the following function 6 i f 1 if x 1 x 2 x n f 1 2 n 0 if x 1 x 2 x n f 1 2 n in which x 1 x 2 x n is the sampling demand of n bridge components and f 1 2 n is the corresponding failure domain then the failure probability of the bridge system under a given im level can be expressed as 7 p s y s i 1 n i f i n 3 numerical modeling of an example bridge a sea crossing cable stayed bridge was taken as the example bridge as shown in fig 1 the example bridge has a length of 132 196 532 196 132 1188 m the heights of the reinforced concrete pylon and pier are 220 m and 50 m respectively the pile group foundation for the pylon is located in the 21 m deep water excluding scour depth the pile cap has a dumbbell shaped cross section of 80 4 m 32 4 m 10 m the diameter of the pile is 4 5 m and the pile length is 47 m in addition there are 135 φ40 longitudinal steel bars in each pile and the stirrup spacing is 100 mm the soil above the base rock is 36 m and the soil type around the pile group is medium sand with an effective weight of 30 kn m3 and a friction angle of 30 3 1 finite element modeling the numerical model of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge was built using opensees software as shown in fig 2 the superstructure is modeled by elastic beam elements pang et al 2020a b the pylon pier and pile foundations under pylons were modeled by nonlinear beam elements to represent their inelastic behavior under earthquake loads the pile cap is deemed to act like a rigid body during earthquakes and it is therefore modeled by the concentrated mass and the pile and pile cap are connected by rigid links since the assistant and side piers are located on the beach the scour effect is negligible only the pile group foundations for the pylon were considered in the model the piles for the assistant pier and side pier could remain elastic without the scour effect during earthquakes and was not considered in the numerical model their contributions were simplified as six stiffness springs the constitutive model of the confined and unconfined concrete was considered using the concrete 01 material the strength of the cover concrete for the pylon was 55 mpa while the strength of concrete for the pile and pier was 45 mpa the stress strain relationship of the longitudinal rebars was modeled by the steel 01 material in which the yield strength and elastic modulus are set to 400 mpa and 200 gpa respectively the cables of the bridge were modeled by truss elements combined with the initial strain of the cable using the initstrainmaterial material the elastic modulus and tensile strength for cables was set to 200 gpa and 1860 mpa the bilinear spring element was used to model the bearings 3 2 the modeling approach of scour depths the p y springs were used to model the lateral support of the soil to the pile foundation the parameters for the mechanical behavior of the soil spring elements were calculated according to the formulae and figures provided by api api 1993 it should be noted that the vertical movement of pile tips was restrained because the pile tips were embedded into the based rock in this study the piles were divided into a series of nonlinear beam elements with a length of 0 5 m and the removal of p y springs above the scour depth h as shown in fig 2 c was used to model the scour depth so that the finite element model of the scoured bridge could be created it should be noted that the parameters for the remaining soil spring would be recalculated after the removal of the soil spring 3 3 hydrodynamic effects the foundation of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge is usually located in the deep water environment the surrounding water will affect the dynamic characteristics and seismic response of bridges zhang et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider hydrodynamic effects for sea crossing bridges when evaluating their seismic performance considering the scour effect the added mass model was used to assess the hydrodynamic effects the morison equation was used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass for piles potential flow theory was used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the pile cap with the assistance of aqwa software as shown in fig 3 the calculated added mass for the pile and pile cap in the x y and z directions are listed in table 1 respectively it should be noted that the pile length submerged in the water increases with the increasing scour depth and the added mass on the pile changes with the change of the scour depth as shown in fig 2 c 4 verification of the etm 4 1 generation of etafs the target acceleration response spectrum used in this study is expressed in the following equation 8 s a c s max 5 5 t 0 45 t 0 1 s s max 0 1 s t t g s max t g t t t g where t g is the characteristic period of the ground motion equal to 0 4 s and s max is the peak ground acceleration equal to 0 2 g in this study t max in eq 3 was set to 5 sand α was set to zero three groups of etafs etafs 20s etafs 40s and etafs 60s with the endurance time of 20 s 40 s and 60 s were generated the target times for the three groups of etafs were set to 5 s 10 s and 15 s according to previous studies three etafs are enough to obtain reasonable results estekanchi et al 2020 therefore each group included three generated etafs and the average results were used to calculate the fragility curves for the associated group fig 4 shows one typical etaf in each group used in this study the amplitude of the generated etaf increases continually and the acceleration response spectra of the etaf at the different time match with the corresponding target response spectra the other two etafs in each group also present similar results even though the figures are not shown for brevity 4 2 calculation for the im and engineering demand parameters edps the calculation of seismic fragility curves of structures depends on the choice of im according to the concept of the etm both pga and spectral acceleration of etafs at different times can be used as the im as shown in fig 5 ardebili et al hariri ardebili et al 2014 suggested that the spectral acceleration should be used as im while using the etm as the seismic analysis method thus the spectral acceleration at the period equal to 1 0 s s a 10 was used as the im in this study moreover the edps at different ims can be obtained when etafs are used as input to conduct nonlinear time history analyses as follows 9 f t e d p m a x a b s f τ τ 0 t after a single time history analysis the eta curve that describes the relationship between the im and edp can be obtained 4 3 comparison between the etm and ida the ida framework was also employed to conduct seismic fragility analyses to validate the etm results ten artificial ground motions with the time duration of 40 s were generated fig 6 shows the time history and corresponding acceleration response spectrum of one typical artificial ground motion used in ida the acceleration response spectrum of the artificial ground motion coincides well with the acceleration spectrum expressed in eq 8 ten artificial ground motion were scaled and 80 scaled acceleration records were used as seismic input to calculate the edps of the bridge components under different ims without scour effect to validate the results from etm both etm and ida were used to calculate the fragility curves of the example bridge under no scour condition the earthquake excitation was assumed to be uniform across different soil layers shang et al 2018 the responses of the pylon pile foundation assistant pier side pier and bearings were obtained to develop the corresponding fragility curves for the damage indexes of different bridge components the curvature ductility μ was used as the damage index of the pylon pile foundation assistant pier and side pier the maximum curvatures along the height of the pylon pile assistant pier and side pier were recorded to calculate the curvature ductility coefficients the damage states for the pylon pile and pier were defined as follows 1 μ 2 for slight damage 2 μ 4 for moderate damage 4 μ 7 for major damage and μ 7 for collapse choi et al 2004 the displacement δ of the bearing was used as the damage index for the bearings the damage states for the bearing were defined as follows 50 mm δ 100 mm for slight damage 100 mm δ 150 mm for moderate damage 150 mm δ 255 mm for major damage and δ 255 mm for collapse choi et al 2004 only the longitudinal seismic response of the bearing was considered in this study because the bearing in the transverse direction was designed to be fixed fig 7 presents the transverse fragility curves of the pylon and pile calculated from the etm and ida method respectively only the collapse state is presented herein as similar results are obtained for other damage states the fragility curves calculated by the etm based framework match with the ones developed by the ida method the similar results can also be found for other bridge components and damage states so that they are not shown here for brevity only three etafs were enough to obtain reasonable results through the etm while 80 nonlinear time histories were required for the ida method to ensure the accuracy of the results therefore the etm can substantially improve the calculation efficiency it should be noted that the dispersion coefficients for both methods were selected from hazards99 user s manual fema 1999 when calculating these component fragility curves 4 4 influence of the time duration of the etafs seismic response of bridges can be affected by the time duration of ground motion to examine the influence of the time duration of etafs on the seismic fragility of the bridge three groups of etafs with different time durations of 20 s 40 s and 60 s were employed to calculate the component and system fragility curves of the bridge without the scour effect fig 8 shows the transverse fragility curves of the pile and assistant pier for the collapse damage state it is obvious that the influence of the time duration of etafs on the seismic fragilities of bridge components is sensitive to the component variety the failure probability of the piles calculated by etafs 40s is larger than those from etafs 20 and etafs 60s and the results calculated by etafs 20 and etafs 60s are not much different however the failure probability of the assistant pier increases continually with the increasing etaf time duration though not shown here similar results can be obtained for other bridge components fig 9 shows the influence of the time duration of etafs on the system fragility for the example bridge under the collapse state the transverse failure probability of the bridge system calculated by etafs 20s is much smaller than those obtained from etafs 40s and etafs 60s while the discrepancy among the results from etafs 40s and etafs 60s is negligible for the longitudinal direction the fragility curves calculated by etafs 20s and etafs 40s are not much different while the failure probability calculated by etafs 60s is much larger than those obtained by etafs 20s and etaf 40s therefore the time duration of etafs has different impact on the system fragilities of the sea crossing cable stayed bridge in the transverse and longitudinal directions however a longer time duration tends to lead to a higher failure probability for the bridge system on the whole in this study the results from etafs 40s were used to conduct the parameter study and discuss the effect of scour depths 5 effect of scour on the fragility of the example bridge 5 1 dynamic characteristics considering the scour effect the dynamic characteristics of the example bridge were investigated before analyzing the seismic fragility the natural vibration periods and modal shapes of the example bridge without scour effect are listed in table 2 an increase rate of natural vibration periods was calculated as the ratio of increase in natural vibration periods due to scour effect to the natural vibration periods for the bridge without scour effect it should be noted that the sequence of the natural vibration modes was not changed under different scour depths as shown in fig 10 the first six natural vibration periods change negligibly when the scour depth increases continually with the maximum increase rate less than 2 scour has a negligible effect on the first six modes because they correspond to the vibration of the superstructure and pylon the impact of scour becomes significant on the natural vibration periods of the 23rd and 24th vibration modes as their modal shapes present the vibration of the pile foundation of which the stiffness can be affected by the scour depths significantly the natural vibration period increases by up to 10 as the scour depth reaches to 15 m 5 2 component fragility curves of the example bridge due to the scour effect the etm approach presented in section 4 was adopted to develop the fragility curves for different bridge components of the example bridge under a particular scour depth and for different damage states seven scour depths equal to 0 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 m were investigated in this study fig 11 shows the influence of scour on the transverse fragility of the bridge components under the collapse states the fragility curves under other damage states show similar results so they are not shown here for brevity the failure probability of the pylon tends to decrease with the increasing scour depth the scour effect can reduce the failure probability of the pile when the scour depth is relatively small 2 5 m when the scour depth increases from 2 5 m to 7 5 m the failure probability of the pile foundation increases substantially the impact of scour effect is negligible when the scour depth is in the range of 7 5 m 12 5 m with the scour depth over 12 5 m the failure probability of the pile decreases with the increasing scour depth the scour effect can reduce the failure probability of piers when the scour depth is relatively small 7 5 m and 2 5 m for assistant pier and side pier respectively but increases with the increasing scour depth at larger scour depth 7 5 m 15 m and 2 5 m 12 5 m for assistant pier and side pier respectively fig 12 shows the effect of scour depths on the longitudinal fragility curves of the bridge components under the collapse states it can be seen that the failure probability of the bridge pylon decreases with the increasing scour depth the failure probability of the pile increases at first but the scour effect tends to reduce the failure probability with the scour depth over 5 m similarly the failure probabilities for the assistant pier side pier and bearing increase at first and then decrease nonlinearly when the scour depth is larger than a certain value for instance the failure probability of the bearing decreases when the scour depth is larger than 10 m fig 13 shows the transverse and longitudinal fragility surfaces of bridge components for the collapse state under different scour depths for the transverse fragilities the failure probability of the pile under different scour depths is higher than other bridge components while the side pier has the lowest failure probability the failure probability of the pylon and assistant pier is between the pile foundation and side pier for the longitudinal direction the pile foundation and bearing in general have higher failure probabilities than pylon and assistant pier this indicates that the pile foundation and bearing are more vulnerable to earthquake loads under scour conditions as compared to other bridge components some mitigation measures are necessary to prevent the failure of the pile and bearing of the bridge under earthquake loads overall scour can have either a beneficial or adverse effect on the component fragility the extent of scour effects varies significantly from component to component in general the occurrence of scour and the increase of scour depth tends to transfer the damage from the pylon to the pile foundation this is because the pile foundation is more likely to suffer from deformation during earthquakes considering the scour effect it is almost consistently observed in all bridge components that the impact of scour on failure probability is strongly associated with the scour depth the impact of scour is twofold 1 scour can amplify the deformation of pile foundation due to the removal of soil 2 scour can cause an increase in the natural vibration periods these can produce complex interaction between various bridge components for example the deformation of the pile can increase due to the decreasing lateral stiffness of the bridge foundation whereas can also decrease due to the elongated natural vibration period the behavior change of pile foundation would in turn affect the seismic response of other bridge components different scour depths may change the way that different bridge components interact with each other under earthquake loads 5 3 system fragility curves of the example bridge due to the scour effect fig 14 shows the transverse and longitudinal system fragility curves under different scour depths as shown in fig 14 scour could impose negative effects on the seismic performance of the bridge system but the most adverse seismic responses of the bridge system do not occur under the maximum scour depth for example the transverse failure probabilities of the bridge system change little when the scour depth is in the range of 0 m and 5 m when the scour depth increases from 5 m to 7 5 m the failure probability increases significantly the failure probability decreases when the scour depth is larger than 12 5 m therefore the influence of the scour effect on the system fragility of the example bridge cannot be ignored and mitigation measures should be taken to prevent the failure of the bridge system if the bridge may suffer from both earthquake and scour during the service of life 6 conclusions this paper provides an efficient etm based framework for seismic fragility analysis of sea crossing cable stayed bridges an example cable stayed bridge was modeled and analyzed in opensees to illustrate the developed framework the effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated by comparing the fragility curves obtained from the etm based framework with the ones from the ida based framework the influence of the time duration of endurance time acceleration functions etafs on seismic fragility was also discussed the validated etm based framework was implemented to investigate the effect of scour on the component and system fragilities of the example bridge the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the etm based fragility analysis framework can yield satisfactory results for the seismic assessment of sea crossing cable stayed bridges compared with the ida method the etm only requires three time history analyses to calculate the fragility curves while 80 time history analyses are needed for ida this demonstrated the capability of the etm to reduce computational effort while maintaining the analysis accuracy 2 the influence of the time duration of etafs on the component fragility varies from component to component but a longer time duration consistently leads to a higher failure probability at the bridge system level 3 as the scour depth increases the first few natural vibration periods of the example sea crossing cable stayed bridge remain unaffected by the scour effect the natural vibration periods of higher modes which include the vibration of the pile foundation increase with the increasing scour depths 4 the impact of scour depths on the component level seismic fragility varies from component to component the pile and bearing are more vulnerable under the joint effect of earthquake and scour hazards compared to other bridge components scour can produce either beneficial or adverse effects on the component and system seismic performance depending on the scour depth it should be noted that all above results were obtained on the basis of artificial ground motions the average acceleration response spectrum of the actual ground motions should be used to generate etafs to further verify the applicability of the etm based framework the recommended dispersion coefficients in the guideline are used for the etm and ida framework when calculating the fragility curves the influence of such dispersion coefficients should be discussed when applying etm into the seismic fragility analysis in future work moreover the developed framework requires etafs with longer time duration to evaluate the seismic behavior of bridges with longer natural vibration period and this can lead to the increasing computational effort in solving the unconstrained optimization problem more effective algorithms are required in the future notwithstanding these limitations this study provides an efficient tool for the seismic fragility analysis for sea crossing cable stayed bridges and illustrates the relationship between scour and structural fragility which provides a practical means for seismic design of sea crossing cable stayed

20689,this study experimentally investigates the evolution of mechanically generated waves mixed with wind driven waves the pre existing wind driven waves are time stable and space non uniform during the tests empirical formulations for fetch laws of dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency of wind driven waves at the laboratory scale are given experimental results show that the characteristics of mixed waves are affected by the variations in wind speed fetch wave period and wave height at small fetches both waves are generally inhabited after mixing with increasing fetch the energy of the generated waves is enhanced at a large wave steepness level when the frequency gap between the two wave types is small mixed waves tend to have a chaotic wave evolution however the changes in the two types of waves are small when the frequency gap between the two waves is large a frequency lock in phenomenon of the wind driven waves at high order waves of the generated waves is found in the regular wave tests at large wave steepness levels such a phenomenon does not exist in present irregular wave tests with increasing fetch the spectrum of mixed waves downshifts at the beginning and upshifts at a large fetch keywords experiment wind driven waves mechanically generated waves wave evolution frequency lock in 1 introduction in a marine environment wind and wave loads affect the safety of offshore structures recently the coupling actions of winds and waves on offshore structures especially deep water flexible structures such as tension leg platform floating bridge and floating wind turbine have aroused great interest among researchers and engineers michailides et al 2016 sarmiento et al 2019 xu et al 2018 although numerical simulation is the mainstream approach to analyze oscillation or dynamic responses of these structures under wind and wave loads laboratory tests are crucial for understanding the kinematic or vibrational mechanism and validating the analysis and design hypotheses moreover the generation of a wave field that matches the reality of oceans is still a challenge for the laboratory test of offshore structures considering the combined actions of wind and wave one main reason is the length limitation of the water flume it makes the wave properties such as wave periods and wave heights of the wind driven waves wdws in a short fetch cannot meet the test requirements although takagaki et al 2017 provided a loop type wave generation method that successfully generates wdws under long fetch conditions this method requires the wdws are undisturbed by the structures and the 3 dimensional effects of wdws are insignificant to obtain the target waves wave generation systems are necessary in laboratories the mechanically generated waves mgws are more like swells therefore it is essential to study the interaction between wdws and mgws in laboratory scales previous studies showed the average spectral density of wdws is substantially reduced when winds are in the same direction of wave propagation mitsuyasu 1966 first experimentally proved that swells suppress the energy of wdws and phillips and banner 1974 attributed this phenomenon to the presence of drift currents caused by winds the presence of swells could enhance drift currents at crests and cause wdws to break at lower amplitudes another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the four wave resonance interactions which transport wave interactions to the region of higher wavenumbers where waves are more effectively dissipated balk 1995 1999 however the inherent mechanism of this physical phenomenon requires further investigation when the wave steepness of swells is small the analysis of morland 1997 showed that similar to experimental results the swells have a stabilizing effect on wdws the growth rate at the crests and troughs of wdws decreases rapidly with increasing swell amplitude the wavelengths of wdws become shorter at the crest and opposite at the trough the averaged pressure in the vertical direction was observed to be negative at crests and positive at troughs from the simulation results of winds blowing over the swells iafrati et al 2019 sullivan et al 2008 the pressure differences lead to suppression effects on the swells for a wave group with large wave steepness the experiment of kharif et al 2008 showed that the focus point of extreme waves shifted downstream in the presence of wind the height and duration of the extreme waves are increased the frequency downshifting occurred during the formation of the extreme waves and became more significant at a higher wind speed using the modified nonlinear schrodinger equation eeltink et al 2017 concluded that the wave spectrum downshifts are owing to the joint actions of wind force and wave dissipation in their simulation when the wind force term exceeds the fluid viscosity of the same order it upshifts the spectral mean frequency waseda and tulin 1999 experimentally investigated the initial instability of nonlinear deep water wave trains with wind effects and showed that the natural modulational frequency and growth rate in the presence of wind are different from those in the absence of wind kharif et al 2010 concluded that the presence of modulational instability is controlled by wind force actions and energy dissipation under the same conditions the unstable domain shrinks at the low frequency regime besides lower frequency swells required a stronger wind speed to sustain modulational instability when the swells propagate upwind the growth of wdws are less affected by the swells at small swell steepness but when the swell steepness increases the growth of wdws is intensified by the swells mitsuyasu and yoshida 1991 this phenomenon is in sharp contrast to the attenuation of wdws caused by swells propagating in the wind direction peirson et al 2003 indicated that owing to the influence of opposing winds the magnitude of wave attenuation rates is approximately 2 5 times that of wave growth rates under comparable wind forces when the winds and swells are misaligned the characteristics of form drag surface roughness and momentum exchange at the water surface rely on their directions field measurements showed that estimating the azimuthal dependency of surface roughness under swell dominated conditions is important holthuijsen et al 2012 in particular the study pointed out that cross swells considerably increase wave generation under high wind speed u 10 30 m s and reduce the wave generation under low wind speed u 10 30 m s this may explain the large scatter in the observed nondimensional surface roughness under swell dominated conditions patton et al 2019 in the laboratory producing target wind and wave fields is important for the model experiments of offshore structures under the coupled actions of winds and waves in the presence of wind the mgws by a wavemaker can be disturbed by the wdws which are typically time stable and space non uniform in flumes for the evolution of mgws the mathematical models such as the nonlinear schrodinger equation nls benjamin and feir 1967 and zakharov equation krasitskii 1994 zakharov 1968 can only qualitatively analyze the energy transfer or modulational instability experimental studies therefore are crucial for studying the interaction between winds and waves this study focuses on the evolution process of mixed mgws and wdws at the laboratory scale the structure of present study is as follows in section 2 the experimental setup and data analysis of wdws are introduced section 3 shows the experimental results of mixed mgws and wdws section 4 presents the discussions and main findings of this study 2 experiments 2 1 experimental set up the experiment was carried out at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory in harbin institute of technology of china the test facility has a closed circuit wind tunnel with a wind tunnel test section and a wave flume as shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the wind test section and the wave flume are 6 0 3 6 50 0 m and 5 0 4 5 50 0 m respectively the water depth is 3 5 m a guide plate was extended with a slope of 1 15 at the wind inlet to reduce the effects of a sudden change in the wind tunnel cross section the regular and irregular waves were generated using a programmable wavemaker located at the left side of the wave flume the test cases were classified into three categories wind only wave only and wind wave cases respectively for wind only and wave only cases the mechanical equipment was used to generate the winds or waves in the test facility for the wind wave cases the fan of the wind tunnel was first started under the still water condition of the wave flume when the wind driven waves are in an equilibrium state the wavemaker was initiated with pre determined inputs the wind wave field can also be achieved by adjusting the order of generating winds and waves waseda and tulin 1999 although the difference between the two types of wind and wave fields generated in the laboratory was rarely addressed in most previous studies it is easily realized that owing to long running time the effect of wave reflection in the second approach would be more serious than that of the first approach therefore the first approach was frequently adopted to generated the required wind and wave fields in this study chabchoub et al 2013 kharif et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 ten wave gauges were used to measure the wave surface elevation among them the first wave gauge was deployed 2 0 m away from the guide plate and the subsequent wave gauges were uniformly distributed along the wave flume at an interval of 2 5 m for the wind only and wind wave cases the wind speeds at the location of gauge 8 were measured using a pitot probe mounted on a moveable measurement frame and setra s model 239 pressure transducer during these tests the wind speeds at the heights of 5 0 cm 7 5 cm 10 0 cm 12 5 cm 15 0 cm 20 0 cm 25 0 cm 30 0 cm and 35 0 cm above the still water level were acquired the test signals of the wave surface elevation and wind speed were transferred to a pxi based data acquisition system from the national instruments corporation with a sampling frequency of 1000 hz table 1 lists the test cases in this study for the wave only category a series of regular waves with wave period and wave height within the scopes of 0 7 2 0 s and 30 130 mm as well as irregular waves with the jonswap spectrum were generated in the wave flume the data lengths for regular wave cases and irregular wave cases are 150 s and 300 s respectively during the tests the running time of wavemaker for the two kinds of waves are 75 s and 180 s the reflection coefficients for the regular wave cases of t 0 7 s 0 8 s 1 0 s and 2 0 s are estimated by a linear separation method with two wave gauges baldock and simmonds 1999 the maximum reflection coefficients for four kinds of wave periods at different wave height levels are less than 0 11 0 12 0 14 and 0 12 respectively olfateh et al 2017 and addona et al 2018 concluded that reflection waves can affect the momentum transport properties by the nonzero reynolds wave shear stress even for a very small reflection coefficient besides it other mean quantities like the mean water elevation are also affected by the reflected waves with the reflection coefficients in 0 11 0 14 the wave shape is slightly different from the periodic mgws and can be almost homogeneous along the flume addona et al 2020 affected by the reflected waves the growth of wdws close to the flume end can be suppressed in the cases of wind following mgws at the rest fetches wdws grow in average with fetch addona 2019 because reflection effects are not the main concern of present study further discussions on them are not conducted in the following for the wind only category 9 types of wind with speeds in 2 4 9 55 m s were generated to investigate wdws the records of wdws in wind only cases are 120 s duration in this table u 10 is the wind speed at 10 m above the still water level it is calculated by the experimental results of roughness length and friction velocity details are given in the next subsection as for the wind wave category all waves as listed in table 1 were repeatedly tested under five types of wind speeds in the measured wave elevation the periodic components having the same frequencies of wavemaker motion and their bounded waves represent the mgws the other fluctuating components represent wdws thais and magnaudet 1995 2 2 data analysis of wdws based on the test results of wind only cases wdws undisturbed by mgws are first analyzed generally in the boundary layer the mean wind speed u z is expressed in the logarithmic profile as 1 u z u 1 κ ln z z 0 where u is the air friction velocity κ is the von karman s constant κ 0 4 z 0 is the roughness length smith 1988 which is written as 2 z 0 α g u 2 γ v u where α is the charnock parameter charnock 1955 g is the gravitational acceleration v is the kinematic viscosity of air and γ 0 11 is a constant businger 1973 the first term of z 0 in eq 2 accounts for the actual roughness elements driven by the wind stress in the form of surface gravity waves the second term accounts for the roughness of the ocean when it is aerodynamically smooth and the surface stress is supported by viscous shear edson et al 2013 fairall et al 2003 smith 1988 using the wind speed data measured at different heights u and z 0 in eq 1 are obtained through the least square method the mean wind speed at 10 m above the still water level u 10 is evaluated using eq 1 with the determined z 0 and u fig 2 shows the experimental values of u and α with respect to u 10 in fig 2 a a fitting curve provided by edson et al 2013 where u was suggested to be 0 03 u 10 for 4 m s u 10 8 5 m s and 0 035 u 10 for u 10 8 5 m s is depicted for comparison in the region of u 10 4 m s u 0 03 u 10 is still adopted for the comparison fig 2 a shows the fitting curve matches well with the experimental results even for the data where u 10 4 m s fig 2 b shows the comparison between experimental results and the predicted results of 3 α 0 0017 u 10 0 005 edson et al 2013 eq 3 is obtained by fitting the field data with u 10 between 7 and 18 m s a constant value of α 0 011 adopted by smith 1988 is also presented for comparison the experimental results of α are resolved by eq 2 with z 0 including and not including the term of γ v u respectively it shows they have less difference when u 10 8 m s under lower wind speed the term of γ v u can significantly reduce the value of α and make α sensitive to u 10 for the experimental results α calculated without considering γ v u are more stable at low wind speed from the comparison eq 3 and its extension line at u 10 7 m s shows a better prediction of α which has an increasing tendency with u 10 nevertheless α 0 011 is also acceptable for the experimental results when u 10 5 m s fig 3 shows some close up images of wdws at the location of gauge 8 under different wind speeds during the test wdws were first observed when u 10 reached 2 49 m s with increasing u 10 and fetch the peak frequency decreases and the wave height increases to quantify wdws the dimensionless fetch peak frequency and wave energy used in the analysis of test results are defined as follows 4 χ 10 g χ u 10 2 5 v 10 u 10 f p g 6 ε 10 η 2 g 2 u 10 4 where χ 10 v 10 ε 10 are the dimensionless fetch peak frequency and wave energy of wdws respectively χ and f p are the fetch and peak frequency of wdws respectively η is the measured wave elevation and denotes the time average figs 4 and 5 show the experimental results of v 10 ε 10 versus χ 10 together with the curves of empirical functions from the previous studies typically v 10 and ε 10 have forms of v 10 a v χ 10 b v and ε 10 a ε χ 10 b ε in which a v b v a ε and b ε are constants determined from oceanic field data a high order fitting formulation was provided in the study of hwang and wang 2004 in which a v b v a ε and b ε are also the functions of χ 10 from figs 4 and 5 the experimental results indicate that a v b v a ε and b ε should be functions of u 10 because the maximum fetch in laboratories is typically small it is worth providing more accurate formulations of v 10 and ε 10 for the laboratory tests the typically forms of v 10 and ε 10 shown above are kept by fitting the experimental results a v b v a ε and b ε are given by 7 a v 529 5 u 10 2 134 15 35 2 π 8 b ν 0 7807 u 10 0 21 9 a ε 2 965 1 e 0 1087 u 10 3 19 2 10 7 10 b ε 4 556 e 0 1015 u 10 2 1 07 with the effective range of 3 40 m s u 10 9 55 m s and 2 5 m χ 25 m the results of v 10 and ε 10 with best fitting results of a v b v a ε and b ε are plotted in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 shows the power spectral density of wdws measured at gauge 1 3 5 7 and 9 in this figure the power law of f λ λ 5 is also presented as a reference in the case of u 10 2 49 m s the wdws were first observed around gauge 5 but the wave height is too low to be recorded and there is no typical spectrum peak of wdws at gauge 1 3 and 5 in fig 6 a conventionally the high frequency tail of the wind driven wave spectrum is formed in equilibrium and saturation ranges romero and melville 2010 takagaki et al 2018 with power laws of f 4 and f 5 respectively the equilibrium range exists near the peak frequency and the saturation range is formed at a relatively higher frequency however no rigorous border exists between them fig 7 shows the variation of s η η f 5 with f f p because wdws measured at gauge 9 when u 10 2 49 m s and at gauge 1 when u 10 9 55 m s are capillary waves their spectral variation at high frequency tail is different from the others with increasing u 10 and χ 10 a power law of f 5 in equilibrium range become clear fig 7 also indicates the second order waves have significant effects on the variation of s η η f 5 while these effects decrease with the increasing u 10 and χ 10 because of the limitation of maximum wind speed and fetch the values of λ obtained in this study are larger than most field measurements resio 2004 romero and melville 2010 and high wind speed experiments takagaki et al 2017 2018 we expect that λ would gradually converge to 4 with increasing u 10 and χ 10 following the widely accepted power law f 4 in equilibrium range 3 results 3 1 wind wave cases regular waves after wdws reached a fetch limited equilibrium state the wavemaker was initiated fig 8 shows an example of the mixed waves from wdws and mgws in fig 8 a the wavemaker just generated the water wave in a short time and a distinct border is observed between the two types of waves to study the mixed waves at the beginning of this interaction wavelet transforms of the wave elevation measured at gauge 6 are presented in fig 9 under u 10 9 55 m s in this figure the wavelet analysis results of the mixed wave with the same wave period but different wave heights are presented for comparison similar to experimental results of chu et al 1992 the crests at the first few waves could be increasing in amplitude when the mgws overtake the pre existing wdws afterwards the mixed waves are in a relatively stable state except for the case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm in this case the amplitude of wdws is comparable to that of mgws and the peak frequencies of the two types of waves are close from the wavelet transform results it is seen that the mgws almost disappear in the time range 60 80 s at the same wave height level a larger wave period can maintain the original mgws as the wave period increases the interaction between the two types of waves decreases and the mutual suppression effects also decrease for a large wave height or wave steepness wdws is sharply reduced to a low level for t 0 7 s 0 8 s and 1 0 s when t 2 0 s the peak frequencies of wdws and mgws have a large gap the change of wdws and mgws after the encounter is much smaller than other cases in the cases of t 2 0 s the frequency shift of wdws is observed a larger wave height would make this shift clearer the wavelet transform results show that the frequency of wdws at the crest would be upshifted and the frequency at the trough would be downshifted similar to the theoretical prediction of morland 1997 generally the differences in the wave spectrum of wdws depend on the wave period and wave height of mgws to further investigate the unstable mixed waves when t 0 7 s and h 30 mm the evolution process of mgws is illustrated in fig 10 in the absence and presence of winds respectively as shown in fig 10 a the surface elevation of mgws without wind effects is similar except for the time delay between the series distributed wave gauges nevertheless when winds and wdws are included even at a distance of 2 5 m from gauge 1 mgws are significantly reduced at gauge 2 at gauge 3 the frequency components corresponding to mgws are observed again such a phenomenon is also found in the measured data of other wave gauges in nonlinear oscillators the fermi pasta ulam tsingou recurrence fermi et al 1955 is found in which the energy of a system is transferred between the modes rather than splitting between them such a recurrence was proved to exist in the nls equation which is frequently used to analyze the modulational instability of the wave evolution armaroli et al 2017 chin et al 2015 ruban 2012 yuen and ferguson 1978 from fig 10 b the recurrence of mgws is observed in the wave evolution process since the amplitudes of mgws are small the growth rate and frequency region of the modulational instability which is proportional to the wave amplitude are typically small therefore the recurrence between mgws and their sidebands are insignificant in the wind wave cases mgws and wdws are under different driving mechanisms and an inhibiting effect occurs between them therefore during the evolution the recurrence between mgws and wdws happens when one wave is inhibited and the other is enhanced to get insight into the recurrence fig 11 shows the magnified illustration of the wave elevation in region 1 of fig 10 at some moments the wave height of wdws is larger than mgws such a recurrence can be observed in other regions the spectra of wave elevation in selected regions are shown in fig 12 it is evident that mgws still dominate the peak frequency of mixed waves in region 3 and 4 wdws with wide band spectrum is comparable to that of mgws and the spectra of them almost merge on average the spectral energy of mgws and wdws in the mixed waves is lower both for the wave and wind only cases respectively theoretical analysis of balk 1995 indicates the energy reduction is caused by four wave resonance interactions these interactions lead to the diffusion of wave actions happen in the regions of higher wavenumbers where energy dissipates more effectively in fig 2 a the peak frequency of wdws in mixed waves is indeed observed at a higher frequency however this phenomenon cannot be directly attributed to the results of four wave resonance interactions this is because the wdws riding on mgws have different wavelength and height according to their position addona et al 2020 hasselmann 1971 longuet higgins and stewart 1960 the frequency of wdws due to surface drift can be shifted to a larger value at the crests of mgws as a result wdws could break at the crests of mgws when the steepness of wdws at the point of incipient breaking phillips and banner 1974 in this process longuet higgins 1969 commented that the long waves could gain energy from the regenerated short waves after the wave breaking without including the wind actions hasselmann 1971 found that the work done on the long waves by the interaction stresses corresponding to maser mechanism of wave generation in longuet higgins 1969 is almost exactly balanced by the loss of potential energy arising from the mass transfer the residual energy transfer can lead to attenuation of the long waves addona et al 2020 moreover the enhanced turbulence caused by wave breaking can further accelerate the dissipation of mgws simulations of wind following fast propagating waves have shown important evidence that the air pressure has an inhibiting effect on the swell sullivan et al 2008 the results show the averaged air pressure in the vertical direction is downward at crests of the swell and upward at troughs of the swell the pressure difference can enforce the wave height decrease in the propagating another potential reason for the energy reduction is due to the three dimensional motion of wdws which conflict with the two dimensional mgws balk 1999 this three dimensional effect also results in accelerating the wave dissipation in summary four reasons for the energy reduction have been mentioned above and they are 1 four wave resonance interaction 2 wdws breaking 3 air pressure inhibiting effects and 4 three dimensional effects of wdws the energy reduction of mgws and wdws could be the results of their joint actions but there is no evidence indicating which one is the dominant fig 13 shows the phase celerity c p of mgws for the cases of t 0 7 s and u 10 9 55 m s at different fetches c p in this figure is normalized by the theoretical value c p 0 which is calculated by linear dispersion law it has c g 0 π k t under the condition of deep water depth the experimental results show a generally increasing tendency of c p c p 0 with the increasing fetch the increase can be enhanced by a larger wave steepness as a comparison the theoretical phase celerity c p w i n d of wdws without mgws are plotted simultaneously because of wind drift and stokes current the values of c p w i n d in reality are slightly larger than the theoretical values liberzon and shemer 2011 longo 2012 therefore the red dash line in fig 13 can meet black fitting curves in advance at a smaller fetch however owing to the length limitation of the flume the present tests cannot reach the region where c p w i n d c p in speculation the evolution of mgws and wdws could be much different in this region to figure out it further experimental tests are required the variations of phase celerity with fetches for the other three wave periods have the same tendency as the results of t 0 7 s in fig 14 the average value of c p c p 0 and c g c g 0 in space are plotted to present the effect of wind speed on the celerity the average group celerity was estimated by the cross correlation of the wave elevation measured at gauge 1 and gauge 10 chiapponi et al 2020 longo 2012 in the cases of t 2 0 s the wave steepness used for the tests is very low resulting in the two kinds of celerity are almost constant in the test range of ka for the other cases because of the stokes current the phase and group celerities increase with the increasing steepness in the wave only cases in the wind wave cases the average values show that phase and group celerities increase with the steepness and the wind speed the increasing slopes of phase celerity for a specific wave period are similar with different wind speeds by contrast the results of group celerity show larger discreteness this is caused by the determination of best cross correlation between the two sets of data which exists more human errors for both phase and group celerities the growth rate of the ratios slightly decreases with the increasing wind speed the energy variations of mixed waves are evaluated using the ratios of standard deviation between the mixed waves and the mgws in the absence of wind as shown in fig 15 in this figure σ and σ 0 are the standard deviation of measured wave elevation for the mixed waves in wind wave cases and the mgws in wave only cases respectively the region of mixed waves with mgws in a stable state is used to calculate σ 0 it is clear that the wind action has inhibiting effects on mixed waves at a small fetch the higher the u 10 more obvious the inhibiting effects at small fetches the energy of wdws is much lower than mgws therefore the energy reduction caused by four wave resonance interaction wave breaking and three dimensional effects of wdws is insignificant in this case the air pressure inhibiting effects could become the main reason for the reduction with the increase in fetch the peak frequency difference between wdws and mgws decreases because the energy of wdws becomes larger at large wind fetches the ratio is shown in fig 15 increases at the large fetch the wave period or frequency of mgws are important in the interaction between the two waves in all cases the wind effects and pre existing wdws have the largest interaction in the case of t 0 7 s when t 2 0 s the changes in the wave energy of mixed waves compared to that of original mgws are negligible this is owing to the peak frequency of wdws being far away from that of mgws fig 16 plots the spectrum evolution of wind wave and wave only cases under the condition of u 10 9 55 m s it intuitively shows the influence of wave height and wave period on the evolution of mgws and the growth of wdws with increasing fetch for each wave period the results for the minimum and maximum wave height are presented in the regular wave cases the high frequency region in the follows represent the region where f 1 5 t fig 16 illustrates the high order waves especially the second order waves of mgws dominant the high frequency region when the wave height is much larger than that of wdws such phenomena are more distinct in the case of t 0 8 h 70 mm and t 1 0 s h 110 mm in the two cases the maximum values green dots of the mixed waves in the high frequency region occur at the second order frequency of mgws regardless of the variance in location the characteristics of wdws in the wind only case almost disappear in the surface plots the energy change of wgws caused by the wind and wdws mainly happens at the frequency of wgws and their high order frequencies in the case of t 2 0 s h 130 mm although the wave height is large the wave steepness is very low the spectrum of the mixed waves at the high frequency region is similar to that of t 2 0 s h 50 mm except for the maximum values green dots in the case of low wave height for all wave periods the existing mgws can reduce the growth of wdws with the increasing fetch nonetheless maximum values green dots of the mixed waves in the high frequency region have a similar trend to the wdws in wind only cases except at gauge 1 it is because the pre existing wdws are negligible at gauge 1 and have less impact on the mgws than other locations therefore the maximum values in the high frequency region occur at the second order frequency the comparison between the green dots and yellow dash lines indicates that the former frequencies are larger than the later frequencies at the beginning with further increasing fetch the former frequencies decrease sharply and slightly lower than the later frequencies for all cases the changes of wdws and mgws with t 2 0 s and h 50 mm are the least the conclusion is the same as previous studies and it is the larger the frequency gap between the two kinds of wave and lower wave steepness of mgws the less interaction between them after mixing to detail the energy change of the water waves in the high frequency region a dimensionless spectral difference function δ s η η f n is defined as 11 δ s η η f s η η wind wave f s η η wave only f s η η ref where s η η wind wave f is the spectrum of the mixed waves in wind wave case s η η wave only f is the spectrum of mgws in wave only case s η η ref is the peak value of the spectrum of wdws at gauge 10 under the condition of u 10 9 55 m s the method of spectral difference is similar to the splitting method of wdws and mgws showed in the study of addona et al 2020 but in the frequency domain the spectral difference can intuitively show the energy changes of mgws and wdws at different frequencies figs 17 and 18 show the dimensionless spectral differences of the mixed waves under u 10 6 04 and 9 55 m s meanwhile the spectrum of wind only cases under the two wind speeds are plotted as references in these figures the rendering of the contour is truncated at 1 to clearly illustrate the spectral difference of the high frequency components with a frequency resolution of 0 061 hz the dimensional amplitude change corresponding to 1 is 2 39 mm it is shown that wdws and mgws are inhibited in the case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm at small fetches because the frequency components of wdws that are close to the frequency of mgws have been significantly reduced the peak frequencies of wdws could become higher than that in wind only cases the second order waves of mgws are reduced accompanying the reduction of the first order mgws when t 0 7 s and h 50 mm the increasing wave height will further reduce the energy of wdws the reduction of the second and third order mgws also exist at the fetch of the peak frequency of wdws reaching the second order frequency the spectral differences of second order components turn positive with further increase in fetch the first order frequency of wdws also become positive increasing wave height will bring positive happenings forward similar phenomena are found in the cases of t 0 8 s 1 0 s and 2 0 s it suggests the first order mgws might extract the energy from the winds or wdws through the high order mgws in the cases of t 2 0 s and h 50 mm the changes in wdws are minimal compared to other cases when the wave height is 130 mm the frequencies of wdws shift to the high order frequencies of mgws these are observed in all compared cases at large wave height level or wave steepness level in conclusion in figs 17 and 18 the growth of wdws in wind wave cases is suppressed for all test cases for a small wave height and a large wave period the effects of mgws on wdws are small for a large wave height the spectrum of wdws meanly distributes at the high order of mgws in the cases of large wave heights or wave steepness positive spectral differences mainly happen at high order frequencies of mgws rather than changes through increasing fetches such as the case of t 1 0 s and h 110 mm it shows a lock in phenomenon of the peak frequency of wdws varies with the fetches fig 19 plots these frequencies which have been divided by the peak frequency of mgws at different fetches and steepness levels at low steepness levels the lock in phenomenon is insignificant and the maximum positive spectral differences happen around the peak frequency of wdws in the wind only cases with the increase in wave steepness the peak frequency of wdws will be locked at the nearby orders of mgws fig 19 indicates the maximum positive spectral difference will probably happen at the second order 3 2 wind wave cases irregular waves compared with regular waves irregular waves have a broader spectral width fig 20 presents examples of measured irregular waves under u 10 0 m s and u 10 9 55 m s the surface plots of the spectrum after the mixed waves becoming stable are shown in fig 21 it illustrates that the power spectral density of the dominant wave components is reduced at a wide frequency range while the peak frequencies of mgws are unchanged the reduction caused by the winds and wdws on each frequency component is different this has been discussed in the regular wave cases with different wave periods the spectrum of the case of t p 0 86 s h s 30 mm is a typical double peak spectrum that consists of wdws and mgws for the other cases there is no typical peak of wdws in the wind wave cases as shown in fig 22 the main reason is that a larger significant wave height of mgws can significantly suppress the growth of wdws with the decreasing wave height of wdws and increasing wave height of mgws the second peak corresponding to wdws will disappear fig 23 shows the spectral differences of irregular wave cases when the wind speeds are u 10 6 04 m s and u 10 9 55 m s dimensionless process for irregular wave cases is the same as the regular wave cases unlike regular waves the frequency spectrum of first and high order mgws have a wide frequency range and the high order reduction or enhancement is not as significant as regular waves from the evolution process of the spectrum no obvious lock in phenomenon in wdws is found when the effects of wind and pre existing wdws are included the spectrum of the irregular waves mgws is reduced in a wider frequency range when compared to that in regular wave cases the main reduction of mgws is observed at their peak frequency and the frequencies slightly higher than it under different wind conditions the comparative results indicate the increasing wind speed will further reduce the energy of mgws at their peak frequency while the reduction region at the high frequency region is shrunk under the same wind condition and peak frequency of mgws the increasing significant wave height or significant wave steepness can extend the spectral reduction range of mgws in both high and low frequency region meanwhile the positive range of spectral difference at the large fetch region is also enhanced in regular wave cases the spectral difference suggests there might exist energy transfer between the first order mgws and winds or wdws through the high order mgws but for the irregular waves the high order component in the spectrum is insignificant as shown in fig 22 another possible reason for energy enhance at large fetches could be the four wave resonance interactions for a closed system in which the energy is conserved four wave resonance interactions on the evolution of irregular wave can transfer the energy from the dominant frequency components to low frequency components and high frequency components janssen 2004 in the selected regions cyan squares of fig 23 the energy transfer corresponding to the spectral difference is similar to the results of four wave resonance interactions it suggests that wind actions or wdws can promote the four wave resonance interactions because of the momentum exchange of air water and energy dissipation the present system is nonconservative from the analysis of regular wave cases the mgws with a large frequency is easily reduced in the wind wave cases therefore in the results of four wave resonance interactions the energy enhance at high frequency components could disappear due to the energy reduction as a result energy enhances only happen at the low frequency components meanwhile the energy of dominant frequency components and high frequency components are both reduced anyway these are only possible reasons more evidence is required for the energy transfer to evaluate the spectral shifts of mgws after encountering the pre existing wdws a spectral mean frequency f m eeltink et al 2017 is defined as 12 f m n 1 n f n s η η f n n 1 n s η η f n where s η η f n is the power spectral density of wave surface elevation at frequency f n n is the total number of frequency components in eq 12 the selected f n is in the range of 0 f n f n in which f n is the truncated frequency f n is the frequency at which 90 of the cumulative energy of mgws in the wave only cases for t p 0 86 s and t p 1 26 s the average values of f n with different wave heights are 1 74 hz and 1 24 hz respectively here f m o represents the spectral mean frequency of the original mgws and f m m represents the spectral mean frequency of mixed waves the spectral difference δ f m is obtained as δ f m f m m f m o it has f m o is upshifted when δ f m 0 and f m o is downshifted when δ f m 0 fig 24 shows the results of δ f m at different fetches where the obvious spectral downshift of mixed waves at small fetches is visible the tendency of f m o with the increasing fetch is dependent on the peak frequency and significant wave height at large fetches f m o of some cases turn to upshift for cases of t p 1 26 s at large wave height level the spectral upshifts happen at most fetches one reason is that the inhibiting effect between mgws and wgws is insignificant as the frequency gap between them is large another reason is the increasing wdws in the high frequency region will increase the f m m of the mixed waves eeltink et al 2017 concluded that the spectral mean frequency upshifts when the wind input energy exceeds the fluid dispassion as we know the growth of wdws is a process of energy accumulation from winds under a constant wind speed whether the spectral mean frequency upshifts or downshifts depends on the selection of fetch in other words the spectral shift should be evaluated by the accumulated input energy and output energy in the process of evolution 4 discussions and conclusions an experimental study on the evolution of mixed mechanically generated waves and pre existing wind driven waves was performed in this study the pre existing wind driven waves are time stable and space non uniform the present study was conducted in the requirement of the scale model tests under the coupled actions of winds and waves more attention is paid to the evolution of mechanically generated waves mgws affected by the wind driven waves wdws and winds because wdws are space non uniform it is necessary to study wave evolution from the interaction at the beginning in the scale model experiments the scale ratio is selected according to the sizes of prototype structures and the wave flume a scaling ratio in 1 40 1 80 is conventionally adopted for the wave flume experiments molin 2002 taking 1 60 with froude number scaling criteria as an example the wave period in 0 7 2 0 s the wave height in 30 130 mm and the wind speed of 9 55 m s used in this study in the full scale condition are 5 4 15 5 s 1 8 7 8 m and 74 m s about 48 m s at 10 m above the still water level respectively the test cases in this study can provide valuable references for the model tests because the classical empirical fetch laws quoted in section 2 2 hwang and wang 2004 kahma and calkoen 1992 like jonswap law are the average fitting results of the field data in a broad climate condition range in a laboratory they are not accurate enough for predicting the wind driven waves in quite short fetches therefore more accurate empirical formulations for the dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency of wdws are provided in this study in this study the wind wave case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm shows the largest difference compared with the waves in wave only cases different from many previous studies addona et al 2020 waseda and tulin 1999 the wave period and height of wdws in this case are comparable to mgws a recurrence between the wdws and mgws which are driven by two different generation mechanisms is observed in this case in principle the two kinds of waves in the recurrence are reciprocal inhibition at some moments wdws can dominant the mixed waves when the wave steepness of mgws is significantly large phillips and banner 1974 concluded the wdws had disappeared into the noise level and only the primary mgws with their harmonics is evident however the energy changes of high order mgws were relevant to the wind actions and the growth of wdws as shown in fig 18 more particular is the spectral difference at second order wgws in the cases of t 1 0 s and h 110 mm turns positive at the fetch where the peak frequency of wdws in wind only cases close to the frequency of second order wgws based on the mentioned works the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 both wave height and period dominate the characteristics of mixed waves at different fetches the wavelet transform results indicate that the mixed wave can promptly enter into a relatively stable region after the first few waves of the mgws when the wave period of mgws is close to that of wdws the evolution of mixed waves exists in the recurrence between mgws and wdws when the wave period of mgws is far from that of wdws the energy changes and spectral differences are insignificant 2 in this study existing mgws inhibited wdws in all cases while wdws only inhibited mgws at small fetches at large fetches the energy of mgws can be enhanced under some conditions specifically at large wave steepness levels the increasing wind speed can further inhibit mgws at small fetches while also further enhancing mgws owing to the shrinking frequency gap between them 3 the frequency lock in phenomenon of wind driven waves is found in cases of regular waves at large wave steepness levels under these conditions the peak frequencies of wind driven waves are locked in at the second order or the nearby order frequency of mgws in irregular wave cases there is no apparent frequency lock in phenomenon of wind driven waves because of the limitation in present study some phenomena still require further investigation for example 1 a more interesting case for future study is under the condition of when the phase celerity of wdws can exceed the mgws 2 whether the first order mgws can extract the energy from the winds or wdws through the high order mgws or not need more evidence credit authorship contribution statement jiabin liu conceptualization methodology validation formal

20689,this study experimentally investigates the evolution of mechanically generated waves mixed with wind driven waves the pre existing wind driven waves are time stable and space non uniform during the tests empirical formulations for fetch laws of dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency of wind driven waves at the laboratory scale are given experimental results show that the characteristics of mixed waves are affected by the variations in wind speed fetch wave period and wave height at small fetches both waves are generally inhabited after mixing with increasing fetch the energy of the generated waves is enhanced at a large wave steepness level when the frequency gap between the two wave types is small mixed waves tend to have a chaotic wave evolution however the changes in the two types of waves are small when the frequency gap between the two waves is large a frequency lock in phenomenon of the wind driven waves at high order waves of the generated waves is found in the regular wave tests at large wave steepness levels such a phenomenon does not exist in present irregular wave tests with increasing fetch the spectrum of mixed waves downshifts at the beginning and upshifts at a large fetch keywords experiment wind driven waves mechanically generated waves wave evolution frequency lock in 1 introduction in a marine environment wind and wave loads affect the safety of offshore structures recently the coupling actions of winds and waves on offshore structures especially deep water flexible structures such as tension leg platform floating bridge and floating wind turbine have aroused great interest among researchers and engineers michailides et al 2016 sarmiento et al 2019 xu et al 2018 although numerical simulation is the mainstream approach to analyze oscillation or dynamic responses of these structures under wind and wave loads laboratory tests are crucial for understanding the kinematic or vibrational mechanism and validating the analysis and design hypotheses moreover the generation of a wave field that matches the reality of oceans is still a challenge for the laboratory test of offshore structures considering the combined actions of wind and wave one main reason is the length limitation of the water flume it makes the wave properties such as wave periods and wave heights of the wind driven waves wdws in a short fetch cannot meet the test requirements although takagaki et al 2017 provided a loop type wave generation method that successfully generates wdws under long fetch conditions this method requires the wdws are undisturbed by the structures and the 3 dimensional effects of wdws are insignificant to obtain the target waves wave generation systems are necessary in laboratories the mechanically generated waves mgws are more like swells therefore it is essential to study the interaction between wdws and mgws in laboratory scales previous studies showed the average spectral density of wdws is substantially reduced when winds are in the same direction of wave propagation mitsuyasu 1966 first experimentally proved that swells suppress the energy of wdws and phillips and banner 1974 attributed this phenomenon to the presence of drift currents caused by winds the presence of swells could enhance drift currents at crests and cause wdws to break at lower amplitudes another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the four wave resonance interactions which transport wave interactions to the region of higher wavenumbers where waves are more effectively dissipated balk 1995 1999 however the inherent mechanism of this physical phenomenon requires further investigation when the wave steepness of swells is small the analysis of morland 1997 showed that similar to experimental results the swells have a stabilizing effect on wdws the growth rate at the crests and troughs of wdws decreases rapidly with increasing swell amplitude the wavelengths of wdws become shorter at the crest and opposite at the trough the averaged pressure in the vertical direction was observed to be negative at crests and positive at troughs from the simulation results of winds blowing over the swells iafrati et al 2019 sullivan et al 2008 the pressure differences lead to suppression effects on the swells for a wave group with large wave steepness the experiment of kharif et al 2008 showed that the focus point of extreme waves shifted downstream in the presence of wind the height and duration of the extreme waves are increased the frequency downshifting occurred during the formation of the extreme waves and became more significant at a higher wind speed using the modified nonlinear schrodinger equation eeltink et al 2017 concluded that the wave spectrum downshifts are owing to the joint actions of wind force and wave dissipation in their simulation when the wind force term exceeds the fluid viscosity of the same order it upshifts the spectral mean frequency waseda and tulin 1999 experimentally investigated the initial instability of nonlinear deep water wave trains with wind effects and showed that the natural modulational frequency and growth rate in the presence of wind are different from those in the absence of wind kharif et al 2010 concluded that the presence of modulational instability is controlled by wind force actions and energy dissipation under the same conditions the unstable domain shrinks at the low frequency regime besides lower frequency swells required a stronger wind speed to sustain modulational instability when the swells propagate upwind the growth of wdws are less affected by the swells at small swell steepness but when the swell steepness increases the growth of wdws is intensified by the swells mitsuyasu and yoshida 1991 this phenomenon is in sharp contrast to the attenuation of wdws caused by swells propagating in the wind direction peirson et al 2003 indicated that owing to the influence of opposing winds the magnitude of wave attenuation rates is approximately 2 5 times that of wave growth rates under comparable wind forces when the winds and swells are misaligned the characteristics of form drag surface roughness and momentum exchange at the water surface rely on their directions field measurements showed that estimating the azimuthal dependency of surface roughness under swell dominated conditions is important holthuijsen et al 2012 in particular the study pointed out that cross swells considerably increase wave generation under high wind speed u 10 30 m s and reduce the wave generation under low wind speed u 10 30 m s this may explain the large scatter in the observed nondimensional surface roughness under swell dominated conditions patton et al 2019 in the laboratory producing target wind and wave fields is important for the model experiments of offshore structures under the coupled actions of winds and waves in the presence of wind the mgws by a wavemaker can be disturbed by the wdws which are typically time stable and space non uniform in flumes for the evolution of mgws the mathematical models such as the nonlinear schrodinger equation nls benjamin and feir 1967 and zakharov equation krasitskii 1994 zakharov 1968 can only qualitatively analyze the energy transfer or modulational instability experimental studies therefore are crucial for studying the interaction between winds and waves this study focuses on the evolution process of mixed mgws and wdws at the laboratory scale the structure of present study is as follows in section 2 the experimental setup and data analysis of wdws are introduced section 3 shows the experimental results of mixed mgws and wdws section 4 presents the discussions and main findings of this study 2 experiments 2 1 experimental set up the experiment was carried out at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory in harbin institute of technology of china the test facility has a closed circuit wind tunnel with a wind tunnel test section and a wave flume as shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the wind test section and the wave flume are 6 0 3 6 50 0 m and 5 0 4 5 50 0 m respectively the water depth is 3 5 m a guide plate was extended with a slope of 1 15 at the wind inlet to reduce the effects of a sudden change in the wind tunnel cross section the regular and irregular waves were generated using a programmable wavemaker located at the left side of the wave flume the test cases were classified into three categories wind only wave only and wind wave cases respectively for wind only and wave only cases the mechanical equipment was used to generate the winds or waves in the test facility for the wind wave cases the fan of the wind tunnel was first started under the still water condition of the wave flume when the wind driven waves are in an equilibrium state the wavemaker was initiated with pre determined inputs the wind wave field can also be achieved by adjusting the order of generating winds and waves waseda and tulin 1999 although the difference between the two types of wind and wave fields generated in the laboratory was rarely addressed in most previous studies it is easily realized that owing to long running time the effect of wave reflection in the second approach would be more serious than that of the first approach therefore the first approach was frequently adopted to generated the required wind and wave fields in this study chabchoub et al 2013 kharif et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 ten wave gauges were used to measure the wave surface elevation among them the first wave gauge was deployed 2 0 m away from the guide plate and the subsequent wave gauges were uniformly distributed along the wave flume at an interval of 2 5 m for the wind only and wind wave cases the wind speeds at the location of gauge 8 were measured using a pitot probe mounted on a moveable measurement frame and setra s model 239 pressure transducer during these tests the wind speeds at the heights of 5 0 cm 7 5 cm 10 0 cm 12 5 cm 15 0 cm 20 0 cm 25 0 cm 30 0 cm and 35 0 cm above the still water level were acquired the test signals of the wave surface elevation and wind speed were transferred to a pxi based data acquisition system from the national instruments corporation with a sampling frequency of 1000 hz table 1 lists the test cases in this study for the wave only category a series of regular waves with wave period and wave height within the scopes of 0 7 2 0 s and 30 130 mm as well as irregular waves with the jonswap spectrum were generated in the wave flume the data lengths for regular wave cases and irregular wave cases are 150 s and 300 s respectively during the tests the running time of wavemaker for the two kinds of waves are 75 s and 180 s the reflection coefficients for the regular wave cases of t 0 7 s 0 8 s 1 0 s and 2 0 s are estimated by a linear separation method with two wave gauges baldock and simmonds 1999 the maximum reflection coefficients for four kinds of wave periods at different wave height levels are less than 0 11 0 12 0 14 and 0 12 respectively olfateh et al 2017 and addona et al 2018 concluded that reflection waves can affect the momentum transport properties by the nonzero reynolds wave shear stress even for a very small reflection coefficient besides it other mean quantities like the mean water elevation are also affected by the reflected waves with the reflection coefficients in 0 11 0 14 the wave shape is slightly different from the periodic mgws and can be almost homogeneous along the flume addona et al 2020 affected by the reflected waves the growth of wdws close to the flume end can be suppressed in the cases of wind following mgws at the rest fetches wdws grow in average with fetch addona 2019 because reflection effects are not the main concern of present study further discussions on them are not conducted in the following for the wind only category 9 types of wind with speeds in 2 4 9 55 m s were generated to investigate wdws the records of wdws in wind only cases are 120 s duration in this table u 10 is the wind speed at 10 m above the still water level it is calculated by the experimental results of roughness length and friction velocity details are given in the next subsection as for the wind wave category all waves as listed in table 1 were repeatedly tested under five types of wind speeds in the measured wave elevation the periodic components having the same frequencies of wavemaker motion and their bounded waves represent the mgws the other fluctuating components represent wdws thais and magnaudet 1995 2 2 data analysis of wdws based on the test results of wind only cases wdws undisturbed by mgws are first analyzed generally in the boundary layer the mean wind speed u z is expressed in the logarithmic profile as 1 u z u 1 κ ln z z 0 where u is the air friction velocity κ is the von karman s constant κ 0 4 z 0 is the roughness length smith 1988 which is written as 2 z 0 α g u 2 γ v u where α is the charnock parameter charnock 1955 g is the gravitational acceleration v is the kinematic viscosity of air and γ 0 11 is a constant businger 1973 the first term of z 0 in eq 2 accounts for the actual roughness elements driven by the wind stress in the form of surface gravity waves the second term accounts for the roughness of the ocean when it is aerodynamically smooth and the surface stress is supported by viscous shear edson et al 2013 fairall et al 2003 smith 1988 using the wind speed data measured at different heights u and z 0 in eq 1 are obtained through the least square method the mean wind speed at 10 m above the still water level u 10 is evaluated using eq 1 with the determined z 0 and u fig 2 shows the experimental values of u and α with respect to u 10 in fig 2 a a fitting curve provided by edson et al 2013 where u was suggested to be 0 03 u 10 for 4 m s u 10 8 5 m s and 0 035 u 10 for u 10 8 5 m s is depicted for comparison in the region of u 10 4 m s u 0 03 u 10 is still adopted for the comparison fig 2 a shows the fitting curve matches well with the experimental results even for the data where u 10 4 m s fig 2 b shows the comparison between experimental results and the predicted results of 3 α 0 0017 u 10 0 005 edson et al 2013 eq 3 is obtained by fitting the field data with u 10 between 7 and 18 m s a constant value of α 0 011 adopted by smith 1988 is also presented for comparison the experimental results of α are resolved by eq 2 with z 0 including and not including the term of γ v u respectively it shows they have less difference when u 10 8 m s under lower wind speed the term of γ v u can significantly reduce the value of α and make α sensitive to u 10 for the experimental results α calculated without considering γ v u are more stable at low wind speed from the comparison eq 3 and its extension line at u 10 7 m s shows a better prediction of α which has an increasing tendency with u 10 nevertheless α 0 011 is also acceptable for the experimental results when u 10 5 m s fig 3 shows some close up images of wdws at the location of gauge 8 under different wind speeds during the test wdws were first observed when u 10 reached 2 49 m s with increasing u 10 and fetch the peak frequency decreases and the wave height increases to quantify wdws the dimensionless fetch peak frequency and wave energy used in the analysis of test results are defined as follows 4 χ 10 g χ u 10 2 5 v 10 u 10 f p g 6 ε 10 η 2 g 2 u 10 4 where χ 10 v 10 ε 10 are the dimensionless fetch peak frequency and wave energy of wdws respectively χ and f p are the fetch and peak frequency of wdws respectively η is the measured wave elevation and denotes the time average figs 4 and 5 show the experimental results of v 10 ε 10 versus χ 10 together with the curves of empirical functions from the previous studies typically v 10 and ε 10 have forms of v 10 a v χ 10 b v and ε 10 a ε χ 10 b ε in which a v b v a ε and b ε are constants determined from oceanic field data a high order fitting formulation was provided in the study of hwang and wang 2004 in which a v b v a ε and b ε are also the functions of χ 10 from figs 4 and 5 the experimental results indicate that a v b v a ε and b ε should be functions of u 10 because the maximum fetch in laboratories is typically small it is worth providing more accurate formulations of v 10 and ε 10 for the laboratory tests the typically forms of v 10 and ε 10 shown above are kept by fitting the experimental results a v b v a ε and b ε are given by 7 a v 529 5 u 10 2 134 15 35 2 π 8 b ν 0 7807 u 10 0 21 9 a ε 2 965 1 e 0 1087 u 10 3 19 2 10 7 10 b ε 4 556 e 0 1015 u 10 2 1 07 with the effective range of 3 40 m s u 10 9 55 m s and 2 5 m χ 25 m the results of v 10 and ε 10 with best fitting results of a v b v a ε and b ε are plotted in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 shows the power spectral density of wdws measured at gauge 1 3 5 7 and 9 in this figure the power law of f λ λ 5 is also presented as a reference in the case of u 10 2 49 m s the wdws were first observed around gauge 5 but the wave height is too low to be recorded and there is no typical spectrum peak of wdws at gauge 1 3 and 5 in fig 6 a conventionally the high frequency tail of the wind driven wave spectrum is formed in equilibrium and saturation ranges romero and melville 2010 takagaki et al 2018 with power laws of f 4 and f 5 respectively the equilibrium range exists near the peak frequency and the saturation range is formed at a relatively higher frequency however no rigorous border exists between them fig 7 shows the variation of s η η f 5 with f f p because wdws measured at gauge 9 when u 10 2 49 m s and at gauge 1 when u 10 9 55 m s are capillary waves their spectral variation at high frequency tail is different from the others with increasing u 10 and χ 10 a power law of f 5 in equilibrium range become clear fig 7 also indicates the second order waves have significant effects on the variation of s η η f 5 while these effects decrease with the increasing u 10 and χ 10 because of the limitation of maximum wind speed and fetch the values of λ obtained in this study are larger than most field measurements resio 2004 romero and melville 2010 and high wind speed experiments takagaki et al 2017 2018 we expect that λ would gradually converge to 4 with increasing u 10 and χ 10 following the widely accepted power law f 4 in equilibrium range 3 results 3 1 wind wave cases regular waves after wdws reached a fetch limited equilibrium state the wavemaker was initiated fig 8 shows an example of the mixed waves from wdws and mgws in fig 8 a the wavemaker just generated the water wave in a short time and a distinct border is observed between the two types of waves to study the mixed waves at the beginning of this interaction wavelet transforms of the wave elevation measured at gauge 6 are presented in fig 9 under u 10 9 55 m s in this figure the wavelet analysis results of the mixed wave with the same wave period but different wave heights are presented for comparison similar to experimental results of chu et al 1992 the crests at the first few waves could be increasing in amplitude when the mgws overtake the pre existing wdws afterwards the mixed waves are in a relatively stable state except for the case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm in this case the amplitude of wdws is comparable to that of mgws and the peak frequencies of the two types of waves are close from the wavelet transform results it is seen that the mgws almost disappear in the time range 60 80 s at the same wave height level a larger wave period can maintain the original mgws as the wave period increases the interaction between the two types of waves decreases and the mutual suppression effects also decrease for a large wave height or wave steepness wdws is sharply reduced to a low level for t 0 7 s 0 8 s and 1 0 s when t 2 0 s the peak frequencies of wdws and mgws have a large gap the change of wdws and mgws after the encounter is much smaller than other cases in the cases of t 2 0 s the frequency shift of wdws is observed a larger wave height would make this shift clearer the wavelet transform results show that the frequency of wdws at the crest would be upshifted and the frequency at the trough would be downshifted similar to the theoretical prediction of morland 1997 generally the differences in the wave spectrum of wdws depend on the wave period and wave height of mgws to further investigate the unstable mixed waves when t 0 7 s and h 30 mm the evolution process of mgws is illustrated in fig 10 in the absence and presence of winds respectively as shown in fig 10 a the surface elevation of mgws without wind effects is similar except for the time delay between the series distributed wave gauges nevertheless when winds and wdws are included even at a distance of 2 5 m from gauge 1 mgws are significantly reduced at gauge 2 at gauge 3 the frequency components corresponding to mgws are observed again such a phenomenon is also found in the measured data of other wave gauges in nonlinear oscillators the fermi pasta ulam tsingou recurrence fermi et al 1955 is found in which the energy of a system is transferred between the modes rather than splitting between them such a recurrence was proved to exist in the nls equation which is frequently used to analyze the modulational instability of the wave evolution armaroli et al 2017 chin et al 2015 ruban 2012 yuen and ferguson 1978 from fig 10 b the recurrence of mgws is observed in the wave evolution process since the amplitudes of mgws are small the growth rate and frequency region of the modulational instability which is proportional to the wave amplitude are typically small therefore the recurrence between mgws and their sidebands are insignificant in the wind wave cases mgws and wdws are under different driving mechanisms and an inhibiting effect occurs between them therefore during the evolution the recurrence between mgws and wdws happens when one wave is inhibited and the other is enhanced to get insight into the recurrence fig 11 shows the magnified illustration of the wave elevation in region 1 of fig 10 at some moments the wave height of wdws is larger than mgws such a recurrence can be observed in other regions the spectra of wave elevation in selected regions are shown in fig 12 it is evident that mgws still dominate the peak frequency of mixed waves in region 3 and 4 wdws with wide band spectrum is comparable to that of mgws and the spectra of them almost merge on average the spectral energy of mgws and wdws in the mixed waves is lower both for the wave and wind only cases respectively theoretical analysis of balk 1995 indicates the energy reduction is caused by four wave resonance interactions these interactions lead to the diffusion of wave actions happen in the regions of higher wavenumbers where energy dissipates more effectively in fig 2 a the peak frequency of wdws in mixed waves is indeed observed at a higher frequency however this phenomenon cannot be directly attributed to the results of four wave resonance interactions this is because the wdws riding on mgws have different wavelength and height according to their position addona et al 2020 hasselmann 1971 longuet higgins and stewart 1960 the frequency of wdws due to surface drift can be shifted to a larger value at the crests of mgws as a result wdws could break at the crests of mgws when the steepness of wdws at the point of incipient breaking phillips and banner 1974 in this process longuet higgins 1969 commented that the long waves could gain energy from the regenerated short waves after the wave breaking without including the wind actions hasselmann 1971 found that the work done on the long waves by the interaction stresses corresponding to maser mechanism of wave generation in longuet higgins 1969 is almost exactly balanced by the loss of potential energy arising from the mass transfer the residual energy transfer can lead to attenuation of the long waves addona et al 2020 moreover the enhanced turbulence caused by wave breaking can further accelerate the dissipation of mgws simulations of wind following fast propagating waves have shown important evidence that the air pressure has an inhibiting effect on the swell sullivan et al 2008 the results show the averaged air pressure in the vertical direction is downward at crests of the swell and upward at troughs of the swell the pressure difference can enforce the wave height decrease in the propagating another potential reason for the energy reduction is due to the three dimensional motion of wdws which conflict with the two dimensional mgws balk 1999 this three dimensional effect also results in accelerating the wave dissipation in summary four reasons for the energy reduction have been mentioned above and they are 1 four wave resonance interaction 2 wdws breaking 3 air pressure inhibiting effects and 4 three dimensional effects of wdws the energy reduction of mgws and wdws could be the results of their joint actions but there is no evidence indicating which one is the dominant fig 13 shows the phase celerity c p of mgws for the cases of t 0 7 s and u 10 9 55 m s at different fetches c p in this figure is normalized by the theoretical value c p 0 which is calculated by linear dispersion law it has c g 0 π k t under the condition of deep water depth the experimental results show a generally increasing tendency of c p c p 0 with the increasing fetch the increase can be enhanced by a larger wave steepness as a comparison the theoretical phase celerity c p w i n d of wdws without mgws are plotted simultaneously because of wind drift and stokes current the values of c p w i n d in reality are slightly larger than the theoretical values liberzon and shemer 2011 longo 2012 therefore the red dash line in fig 13 can meet black fitting curves in advance at a smaller fetch however owing to the length limitation of the flume the present tests cannot reach the region where c p w i n d c p in speculation the evolution of mgws and wdws could be much different in this region to figure out it further experimental tests are required the variations of phase celerity with fetches for the other three wave periods have the same tendency as the results of t 0 7 s in fig 14 the average value of c p c p 0 and c g c g 0 in space are plotted to present the effect of wind speed on the celerity the average group celerity was estimated by the cross correlation of the wave elevation measured at gauge 1 and gauge 10 chiapponi et al 2020 longo 2012 in the cases of t 2 0 s the wave steepness used for the tests is very low resulting in the two kinds of celerity are almost constant in the test range of ka for the other cases because of the stokes current the phase and group celerities increase with the increasing steepness in the wave only cases in the wind wave cases the average values show that phase and group celerities increase with the steepness and the wind speed the increasing slopes of phase celerity for a specific wave period are similar with different wind speeds by contrast the results of group celerity show larger discreteness this is caused by the determination of best cross correlation between the two sets of data which exists more human errors for both phase and group celerities the growth rate of the ratios slightly decreases with the increasing wind speed the energy variations of mixed waves are evaluated using the ratios of standard deviation between the mixed waves and the mgws in the absence of wind as shown in fig 15 in this figure σ and σ 0 are the standard deviation of measured wave elevation for the mixed waves in wind wave cases and the mgws in wave only cases respectively the region of mixed waves with mgws in a stable state is used to calculate σ 0 it is clear that the wind action has inhibiting effects on mixed waves at a small fetch the higher the u 10 more obvious the inhibiting effects at small fetches the energy of wdws is much lower than mgws therefore the energy reduction caused by four wave resonance interaction wave breaking and three dimensional effects of wdws is insignificant in this case the air pressure inhibiting effects could become the main reason for the reduction with the increase in fetch the peak frequency difference between wdws and mgws decreases because the energy of wdws becomes larger at large wind fetches the ratio is shown in fig 15 increases at the large fetch the wave period or frequency of mgws are important in the interaction between the two waves in all cases the wind effects and pre existing wdws have the largest interaction in the case of t 0 7 s when t 2 0 s the changes in the wave energy of mixed waves compared to that of original mgws are negligible this is owing to the peak frequency of wdws being far away from that of mgws fig 16 plots the spectrum evolution of wind wave and wave only cases under the condition of u 10 9 55 m s it intuitively shows the influence of wave height and wave period on the evolution of mgws and the growth of wdws with increasing fetch for each wave period the results for the minimum and maximum wave height are presented in the regular wave cases the high frequency region in the follows represent the region where f 1 5 t fig 16 illustrates the high order waves especially the second order waves of mgws dominant the high frequency region when the wave height is much larger than that of wdws such phenomena are more distinct in the case of t 0 8 h 70 mm and t 1 0 s h 110 mm in the two cases the maximum values green dots of the mixed waves in the high frequency region occur at the second order frequency of mgws regardless of the variance in location the characteristics of wdws in the wind only case almost disappear in the surface plots the energy change of wgws caused by the wind and wdws mainly happens at the frequency of wgws and their high order frequencies in the case of t 2 0 s h 130 mm although the wave height is large the wave steepness is very low the spectrum of the mixed waves at the high frequency region is similar to that of t 2 0 s h 50 mm except for the maximum values green dots in the case of low wave height for all wave periods the existing mgws can reduce the growth of wdws with the increasing fetch nonetheless maximum values green dots of the mixed waves in the high frequency region have a similar trend to the wdws in wind only cases except at gauge 1 it is because the pre existing wdws are negligible at gauge 1 and have less impact on the mgws than other locations therefore the maximum values in the high frequency region occur at the second order frequency the comparison between the green dots and yellow dash lines indicates that the former frequencies are larger than the later frequencies at the beginning with further increasing fetch the former frequencies decrease sharply and slightly lower than the later frequencies for all cases the changes of wdws and mgws with t 2 0 s and h 50 mm are the least the conclusion is the same as previous studies and it is the larger the frequency gap between the two kinds of wave and lower wave steepness of mgws the less interaction between them after mixing to detail the energy change of the water waves in the high frequency region a dimensionless spectral difference function δ s η η f n is defined as 11 δ s η η f s η η wind wave f s η η wave only f s η η ref where s η η wind wave f is the spectrum of the mixed waves in wind wave case s η η wave only f is the spectrum of mgws in wave only case s η η ref is the peak value of the spectrum of wdws at gauge 10 under the condition of u 10 9 55 m s the method of spectral difference is similar to the splitting method of wdws and mgws showed in the study of addona et al 2020 but in the frequency domain the spectral difference can intuitively show the energy changes of mgws and wdws at different frequencies figs 17 and 18 show the dimensionless spectral differences of the mixed waves under u 10 6 04 and 9 55 m s meanwhile the spectrum of wind only cases under the two wind speeds are plotted as references in these figures the rendering of the contour is truncated at 1 to clearly illustrate the spectral difference of the high frequency components with a frequency resolution of 0 061 hz the dimensional amplitude change corresponding to 1 is 2 39 mm it is shown that wdws and mgws are inhibited in the case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm at small fetches because the frequency components of wdws that are close to the frequency of mgws have been significantly reduced the peak frequencies of wdws could become higher than that in wind only cases the second order waves of mgws are reduced accompanying the reduction of the first order mgws when t 0 7 s and h 50 mm the increasing wave height will further reduce the energy of wdws the reduction of the second and third order mgws also exist at the fetch of the peak frequency of wdws reaching the second order frequency the spectral differences of second order components turn positive with further increase in fetch the first order frequency of wdws also become positive increasing wave height will bring positive happenings forward similar phenomena are found in the cases of t 0 8 s 1 0 s and 2 0 s it suggests the first order mgws might extract the energy from the winds or wdws through the high order mgws in the cases of t 2 0 s and h 50 mm the changes in wdws are minimal compared to other cases when the wave height is 130 mm the frequencies of wdws shift to the high order frequencies of mgws these are observed in all compared cases at large wave height level or wave steepness level in conclusion in figs 17 and 18 the growth of wdws in wind wave cases is suppressed for all test cases for a small wave height and a large wave period the effects of mgws on wdws are small for a large wave height the spectrum of wdws meanly distributes at the high order of mgws in the cases of large wave heights or wave steepness positive spectral differences mainly happen at high order frequencies of mgws rather than changes through increasing fetches such as the case of t 1 0 s and h 110 mm it shows a lock in phenomenon of the peak frequency of wdws varies with the fetches fig 19 plots these frequencies which have been divided by the peak frequency of mgws at different fetches and steepness levels at low steepness levels the lock in phenomenon is insignificant and the maximum positive spectral differences happen around the peak frequency of wdws in the wind only cases with the increase in wave steepness the peak frequency of wdws will be locked at the nearby orders of mgws fig 19 indicates the maximum positive spectral difference will probably happen at the second order 3 2 wind wave cases irregular waves compared with regular waves irregular waves have a broader spectral width fig 20 presents examples of measured irregular waves under u 10 0 m s and u 10 9 55 m s the surface plots of the spectrum after the mixed waves becoming stable are shown in fig 21 it illustrates that the power spectral density of the dominant wave components is reduced at a wide frequency range while the peak frequencies of mgws are unchanged the reduction caused by the winds and wdws on each frequency component is different this has been discussed in the regular wave cases with different wave periods the spectrum of the case of t p 0 86 s h s 30 mm is a typical double peak spectrum that consists of wdws and mgws for the other cases there is no typical peak of wdws in the wind wave cases as shown in fig 22 the main reason is that a larger significant wave height of mgws can significantly suppress the growth of wdws with the decreasing wave height of wdws and increasing wave height of mgws the second peak corresponding to wdws will disappear fig 23 shows the spectral differences of irregular wave cases when the wind speeds are u 10 6 04 m s and u 10 9 55 m s dimensionless process for irregular wave cases is the same as the regular wave cases unlike regular waves the frequency spectrum of first and high order mgws have a wide frequency range and the high order reduction or enhancement is not as significant as regular waves from the evolution process of the spectrum no obvious lock in phenomenon in wdws is found when the effects of wind and pre existing wdws are included the spectrum of the irregular waves mgws is reduced in a wider frequency range when compared to that in regular wave cases the main reduction of mgws is observed at their peak frequency and the frequencies slightly higher than it under different wind conditions the comparative results indicate the increasing wind speed will further reduce the energy of mgws at their peak frequency while the reduction region at the high frequency region is shrunk under the same wind condition and peak frequency of mgws the increasing significant wave height or significant wave steepness can extend the spectral reduction range of mgws in both high and low frequency region meanwhile the positive range of spectral difference at the large fetch region is also enhanced in regular wave cases the spectral difference suggests there might exist energy transfer between the first order mgws and winds or wdws through the high order mgws but for the irregular waves the high order component in the spectrum is insignificant as shown in fig 22 another possible reason for energy enhance at large fetches could be the four wave resonance interactions for a closed system in which the energy is conserved four wave resonance interactions on the evolution of irregular wave can transfer the energy from the dominant frequency components to low frequency components and high frequency components janssen 2004 in the selected regions cyan squares of fig 23 the energy transfer corresponding to the spectral difference is similar to the results of four wave resonance interactions it suggests that wind actions or wdws can promote the four wave resonance interactions because of the momentum exchange of air water and energy dissipation the present system is nonconservative from the analysis of regular wave cases the mgws with a large frequency is easily reduced in the wind wave cases therefore in the results of four wave resonance interactions the energy enhance at high frequency components could disappear due to the energy reduction as a result energy enhances only happen at the low frequency components meanwhile the energy of dominant frequency components and high frequency components are both reduced anyway these are only possible reasons more evidence is required for the energy transfer to evaluate the spectral shifts of mgws after encountering the pre existing wdws a spectral mean frequency f m eeltink et al 2017 is defined as 12 f m n 1 n f n s η η f n n 1 n s η η f n where s η η f n is the power spectral density of wave surface elevation at frequency f n n is the total number of frequency components in eq 12 the selected f n is in the range of 0 f n f n in which f n is the truncated frequency f n is the frequency at which 90 of the cumulative energy of mgws in the wave only cases for t p 0 86 s and t p 1 26 s the average values of f n with different wave heights are 1 74 hz and 1 24 hz respectively here f m o represents the spectral mean frequency of the original mgws and f m m represents the spectral mean frequency of mixed waves the spectral difference δ f m is obtained as δ f m f m m f m o it has f m o is upshifted when δ f m 0 and f m o is downshifted when δ f m 0 fig 24 shows the results of δ f m at different fetches where the obvious spectral downshift of mixed waves at small fetches is visible the tendency of f m o with the increasing fetch is dependent on the peak frequency and significant wave height at large fetches f m o of some cases turn to upshift for cases of t p 1 26 s at large wave height level the spectral upshifts happen at most fetches one reason is that the inhibiting effect between mgws and wgws is insignificant as the frequency gap between them is large another reason is the increasing wdws in the high frequency region will increase the f m m of the mixed waves eeltink et al 2017 concluded that the spectral mean frequency upshifts when the wind input energy exceeds the fluid dispassion as we know the growth of wdws is a process of energy accumulation from winds under a constant wind speed whether the spectral mean frequency upshifts or downshifts depends on the selection of fetch in other words the spectral shift should be evaluated by the accumulated input energy and output energy in the process of evolution 4 discussions and conclusions an experimental study on the evolution of mixed mechanically generated waves and pre existing wind driven waves was performed in this study the pre existing wind driven waves are time stable and space non uniform the present study was conducted in the requirement of the scale model tests under the coupled actions of winds and waves more attention is paid to the evolution of mechanically generated waves mgws affected by the wind driven waves wdws and winds because wdws are space non uniform it is necessary to study wave evolution from the interaction at the beginning in the scale model experiments the scale ratio is selected according to the sizes of prototype structures and the wave flume a scaling ratio in 1 40 1 80 is conventionally adopted for the wave flume experiments molin 2002 taking 1 60 with froude number scaling criteria as an example the wave period in 0 7 2 0 s the wave height in 30 130 mm and the wind speed of 9 55 m s used in this study in the full scale condition are 5 4 15 5 s 1 8 7 8 m and 74 m s about 48 m s at 10 m above the still water level respectively the test cases in this study can provide valuable references for the model tests because the classical empirical fetch laws quoted in section 2 2 hwang and wang 2004 kahma and calkoen 1992 like jonswap law are the average fitting results of the field data in a broad climate condition range in a laboratory they are not accurate enough for predicting the wind driven waves in quite short fetches therefore more accurate empirical formulations for the dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency of wdws are provided in this study in this study the wind wave case of t 0 7 s and h 30 mm shows the largest difference compared with the waves in wave only cases different from many previous studies addona et al 2020 waseda and tulin 1999 the wave period and height of wdws in this case are comparable to mgws a recurrence between the wdws and mgws which are driven by two different generation mechanisms is observed in this case in principle the two kinds of waves in the recurrence are reciprocal inhibition at some moments wdws can dominant the mixed waves when the wave steepness of mgws is significantly large phillips and banner 1974 concluded the wdws had disappeared into the noise level and only the primary mgws with their harmonics is evident however the energy changes of high order mgws were relevant to the wind actions and the growth of wdws as shown in fig 18 more particular is the spectral difference at second order wgws in the cases of t 1 0 s and h 110 mm turns positive at the fetch where the peak frequency of wdws in wind only cases close to the frequency of second order wgws based on the mentioned works the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 both wave height and period dominate the characteristics of mixed waves at different fetches the wavelet transform results indicate that the mixed wave can promptly enter into a relatively stable region after the first few waves of the mgws when the wave period of mgws is close to that of wdws the evolution of mixed waves exists in the recurrence between mgws and wdws when the wave period of mgws is far from that of wdws the energy changes and spectral differences are insignificant 2 in this study existing mgws inhibited wdws in all cases while wdws only inhibited mgws at small fetches at large fetches the energy of mgws can be enhanced under some conditions specifically at large wave steepness levels the increasing wind speed can further inhibit mgws at small fetches while also further enhancing mgws owing to the shrinking frequency gap between them 3 the frequency lock in phenomenon of wind driven waves is found in cases of regular waves at large wave steepness levels under these conditions the peak frequencies of wind driven waves are locked in at the second order or the nearby order frequency of mgws in irregular wave cases there is no apparent frequency lock in phenomenon of wind driven waves because of the limitation in present study some phenomena still require further investigation for example 1 a more interesting case for future study is under the condition of when the phase celerity of wdws can exceed the mgws 2 whether the first order mgws can extract the energy from the winds or wdws through the high order mgws or not need more evidence credit authorship contribution statement jiabin liu conceptualization methodology validation formal
