11370,the intensification of irrigated agriculture is required for attaining food security it could result however in water resources problems of waterlogging and secondary salinization to assess different management strategies in solving the problems the current study used a simulation model saltmod in a command area of north west india which faced the problems of salinization and waterlogging following the thriving testing in the course of calibration and validation it was used for studying various water management alternatives for the command area the analysis of different scenarios shows that watertables in the command would persist to go up under the normal conditions thus right management alternatives for example increased groundwater use rice area reduction and reduced canal water use are recommended the ideal scenario revealed that small changes of 3 6 in input values would contain the problems of the study region keywords irrigated agriculture waterlogging

006 0 010 m3 s 1 3 model description 3 1 principle saltmod is a computer program for the forecast and simulation of the salinity of soil moisture drainage water and groundwater the watertable depth and leaching of salts and drain discharge in irrigated areas under various agro geo hydrological conditions several crop rotations and a range of water management scenarios oosterbaan 2008 saltmod is based on seasonal salt and water balances of cropped areas the saltmod program description of principles user s manual examples of previous applications in various locations and literature related to its uses are freely available at www waterlog info 3 2 calibration and validation the model was calibrated for a 12 year period i e from october 1991 to june 2003 which was followed by its validation with recorded system variables for a different 12 year period i e from october 2003 to june 2015 the standard procedure reported by sorooshian and gupta 1995 was followed for the calibration in the command area the majority of the model input parameters were either estimated or measured values of some non sensitive or less sensitive model parameters were assumed rationally for instance values of leaching efficiency of transition zone and root zone and total porosity of root zone transition zone and aquifer were assumed the measurement of some factors such as leaching efficiency flq and effective porosity peq could not be done these factors were established during the model calibration the different inputs used in the model are given in table 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analyses were carried out for effective porosity and leaching efficiency a 50 change to the calibrated values were considered to evaluate the sensitivity 3 4 statistical evaluation

variable of the ith observation o is the mean of the recorded state variables i 1 to n and n is the number of the observations 3 5 simulation of water management strategies following the successful simulation during the calibration and validation periods the model was used for studying various water management alternatives for the command area in the prediction mode the model parameters fixed through the calibration process were used to forecast the system response under a specific set of conditions prognostic simulations were carried out to analyse the long term 16 years from 2015 to 2031 effect of various strategies on the watertable depth and groundwater salinity the extended simulations include different hydrological conditions and various combination of tubewell canal water use for irrigation the study examines five different water management scenarios which descriptions follow scenario 1 existing situations the water and salt balances of the command in the next 16 years in 2031 is shown under this scenario if the existing situations about cropping agro hydrological settings and discharge recharge would prevail scenario 2 dry situations this scenario discloses the salt and water balances of the command in the coming 16 years if some dry years take place in a row scenario 3 wet situations this scenario presents the situation of water and salt balances in the command in the next 16 years if wet years happen sequentially scenario 4 increased groundwater use the rising groundwater level in the command can be moderated by raising the total pumping volume this can be done by increasing the pumping volumes from the currently installed wells this scenario shows the impacts of raising the pumping volume by four percent over the current level scenario 5 optimal conditions the eventual aim of a management study is to sustain the groundwater depth at a level which is neither very deep nor very shallow it facilitates to circumvent the undesirable effects of overexploitation of groundwater and also it would not lead to waterlogging and secondary salinization of root zone in this scenario a number of permutations are analysed to find out optimal input values for example decreased increased tubewell canal water and or increased decreased crop area in order that the groundwater level could be stabilized at a safe depth throughout the simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation the results with recorded groundwater levels during the saltmod calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 the predicted values convincingly fit with the recorded values throughout the simulation fig 3 shows more or less similar results with the groundwater salinities values throughout the simulation runs the statistical analysis of data acquired during the simulation was done the rmse and me are reasonably low during the simulation as given in table 3 the error relative to the normal deviation of the recorded values is judged through the ef which ranges between and 1 00 values of ef above 0 50 are good enough the ef values were computed at 0 81 and 0 87 during calibration with the groundwater levels and salinities data in that order table 3 the corresponding values were 0 89 and 0 80 during the validation period thus from figs 2 and 3 and table 3 it could be judged that the model saltmod did well in forecasting watertable depths and groundwater salinities during the simulation periods 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis results for groundwater levels and salinities data are summarized in quantitative and qualitative terms in table 4 it is observed that the flq is sensitive to groundwater salinities only while the peq is sensitive to groundwater levels as well the deeper watertable depths and lower salinities were observed with an increase in peq values 4 3 assessment of simulated scenarios scenario 1 existing conditions a steady and continuous groundwater table rise were obtained in this scenario during the study period 2015 2031 fig 4 this could be observed from the figure that groundwater table will rise 0 054 m annually to touch a level of 0 67 m bgsl below the ground surface level against the current 1 53 m so it would register a total watertable rise of 0 86 m in the next 16 year simulation period furthermore under existing conditions the watertable will arrive at the root zone during the tenth year of the prediction period hence it could be wrapped up that if the current set of conditions persists for the coming 16 years there may not be feasible to cultivate any field crops under shallow watertable and poor groundwater conditions since the salinity of groundwater would rise to 8 81 ds m 1 against the current level of 7 95 ds m 1 because groundwater table has been going up in the study region for the last few decades singh 2016b the ongoing rise in the groundwater table as predicted is worrisome and necessitates urgent intervention for long term sustainability in farm production scenario 2 dry conditions in this scenario a steady and continuous decline in groundwater table is noticed as shown in fig 4 this can be seen that groundwater table would decline by 0 53 m at the rate of 0 033 m per annum the groundwater table would arrive at 2 06 m bgsl finally from 1 53 m in the beginning the salinity of groundwater in this scenario would decline from 7 95 ds m 1 in the beginning to 7 21 ds m 1 towards the end the decline in watertable in this scenario is clear for the reason of low net groundwater recharges throughout the successive dry years the groundwater level decline signifies the overdraft condition and would entail some limitations on the groundwater use scenario 3 wet conditions under this scenario the groundwater table shows a rising trend fig 4 it rises by 1 2 m in the 16 year simulation period to touch a level of 0 33 m bgsl against the current 1 53 m the average annual rate of rise would be 0 075 m though it would be higher in the initial years this rise would be higher by 0 021 m over and above the existing conditions moreover the groundwater table will arrive at the root zone during the seventh year of the prediction the salinity of groundwater may rise to 8 33 ds m 1 against the current 7 95 ds m 1 in the wet conditions the excess rainfall condition would generate more groundwater recharge which causes groundwater table rise in the command area scenario 4 increased groundwater use the results obtained for this scenario show a steady and continuous groundwater table decline throughout the study period 2015 2031 fig 4 this could be observed from the results that groundwater table would decline at 0 051 m by year to touch a level of 2 35 m bgsl against the current 1 53 m thus an increase in groundwater use might bring down the groundwater table of the command area by 0 82 m the salinity of groundwater could decline to 7 05 ds m 1 against the current level of 7 95 ds m 1 also in this situation the groundwater table would never arrive at the root zone of crops during the simulation period thus this is recommended that groundwater use should be increased to sustain the groundwater level at a safe depth as it is a need for achieving the long term sustainability in farm production scenario 5 optimal conditions the watertable in the command is already at 1 53 m bgsl which would negatively affect the crop productivity due to root zone salinization different combinations are therefore tested to determine optimal input values i e tubewell canal water and or increased decreased crop area in order that the groundwater level could be stabilized at a safe depth the results of this scenario are depicted in fig 4 this can be seen that groundwater table would lower to more than 2 m bgsl in the fifth year of the simulation and it could be stabilized at 2 65 m in the twelfth year where it remains until the end the salinity of groundwater in this scenario would vary between 6 93 and 7 14 ds m 1 starting the eleventh year this rather favorable conditions of water and salt balances may possibly be realized by altering the tubewell draft by 5 canal supply by 16 and rice area by 7 for the first five years of the simulation after that tubewell draft by 3 canal water supply by 6 and rice area by 4 therefore it is concluded that little changes in different input parameters could keep the command from more salinization and waterlogging 5 conclusions it is clear from evaluating the results that saltmod appears to be a helpful model for the simulation of watertable depths and salinities in agricultural areas it is capable of appraising the upcoming water and salt balances through a range of interventions the watertables in the command area would persist to go up in the coming years in the existing conditions therefore assured crop cultivation in the study region could not be continued under the present cropping pattern discharge recharge and agro hydro meteorological settings under the optimal conditions a decreased rice area against non rice crops is recommended since it could trim down percolation significantly apart from rice area reduction enlarged use of groundwater and reduced canal water use are also recommended groundwater withdrawals can be augmented by putting in additional tubewells at fresh sites and encouraging stakeholders farmers to utilize poor quality groundwater in conjunction with limited higher quality canal water for irrigation purposes the optimal scenario revealed that small changes of 3 6 in input values would contain the hydrological problems of the study region the discussed management alternatives if put into practice will help significantly to lessen the groundwater table rise and secondary salinization of agricultural lands

information to conduct this study lastly the author expresses his thanks to the editor guest editor and anonymous reviewers whose constructive suggestions and insightful comments have led to

trend fig 4 it rises by 1 2 m in the 16 year simulation period to touch a level of 0 33 m bgsl against the current 1 53 m the average annual rate of rise would be 0 075 m though it would be higher in the initial years this rise would be higher by 0 021 m over and above the existing conditions moreover the groundwater table will arrive at the root zone during the seventh year of the prediction the salinity of groundwater may rise to 8 33 ds m 1 against the current 7 95 ds m 1 in the wet conditions the excess rainfall condition would generate more groundwater recharge which causes groundwater table rise in the command area scenario 4 increased groundwater use the results obtained for this scenario show a steady and continuous groundwater table decline throughout the study period 2015 2031 fig 4 this could be observed from the results that groundwater table would decline at 0 051 m by year to touch a level of 2 35 m bgsl against the current 1 53 m thus an increase in groundwater use might bring down the groundwater table of the command area by 0 82 m the salinity of groundwater could decline to 7 05 ds m 1 against the current level of 7 95 ds m 1 also in this situation the groundwater table would never arrive at the root zone of crops during the simulation period thus this is recommended that groundwater use should be increased to sustain the groundwater level at a safe depth as it is a need for achieving the long term sustainability in farm production scenario 5 optimal conditions the watertable in the command is already at 1 53 m bgsl which would negatively affect the crop productivity due to root zone salinization different combinations are therefore tested to determine optimal input values i e tubewell canal water and or increased decreased crop area in order that the groundwater level could be stabilized at a safe depth the results of this scenario are depicted in fig 4 this can be seen that groundwater table would lower to more than 2 m bgsl in the fifth year of the simulation and it could be stabilized at 2 65 m in the twelfth year where it remains until the end the salinity of groundwater in this scenario would vary between 6 93 and 7 14 ds m 1 starting the eleventh year this rather favorable conditions of water and salt balances may possibly be realized by altering the tubewell draft by 5 canal supply by 16 and rice area by 7 for the first five years of the simulation after that tubewell draft by 3 canal water supply by 6 and rice area by 4 therefore it is concluded that little changes in different input parameters could keep the command from more salinization and waterlogging 5 conclusions it is clear from evaluating the results that saltmod appears to be a helpful model for the simulation of watertable depths and salinities in agricultural areas it is capable of appraising the upcoming water and salt balances through a range of interventions the watertables in the command area would persist to go up in the coming years in the existing conditions therefore assured crop cultivation in the study region could not be continued under the present cropping pattern discharge recharge and agro hydro meteorological settings under the optimal conditions a decreased rice area against non rice crops is recommended since it could trim down percolation significantly apart from rice area reduction enlarged use of groundwater and reduced canal water use are also recommended groundwater withdrawals can be augmented by putting in additional tubewells at fresh sites and encouraging stakeholders farmers to utilize poor quality groundwater in conjunction with limited higher quality canal water for irrigation purposes the optimal scenario revealed that small changes of 3 6 in input values would contain the hydrological problems of the study region the discussed management alternatives if put into practice will help significantly to lessen the groundwater table rise and secondary salinization of agricultural lands

11371,in central vietnam farmers report an increasing occurrence frequency of water shortages for irrigation during dry seasons particularly during the summer autumn rice season water is often insufficient to irrigate the entire rice production areas and thus restricting rice productivity significantly in this study a coupled hydrological irrigation optimization modelling system is developed to optimize irrigation strategies for a typical rice irrigation system in central vietnam the model consists of a fully distributed hydrologic model which simulates the inflow to a reservoir and an irrigation model which optimizes the rice irrigation technology i e alternate wetting and drying awd or continuous flooding cf irrigation schedule and cropping area under given water constraints irrigation strategies are derived based on different initial reservoir water levels at the beginning of the cropping season as well as different maximum water releases the simulation results show that the initial level of water in the reservoir is crucial water levels of less than 90 do not provide sufficient water to irrigate the entire cropping area whereas a level of 70 restricts the cropping area to 75 awd is able to reduce the water input ranging from 4 to 10 the adoption of awd therefore has the potential to irrigate a larger area and may help to increase the profit of the farmers however the benefits of awd can only be achieved after significant investment in the canal system and the reservoir outlet since the robustness of the optimization results performance variability is crucial for decision support we estimated the impact of different computing environments on the solutions only limited performance variability is found giving confidence in the robustness of the model for decision support keywords distributed hydrological model irrigation practices optimization model alternate wetting and drying continuous flooding central vietnam 1 introduction rice is the main staple crop of asia wassmann et al 2009 in vietnam rice production plays an important role for the agricultural sector which accounts for approximately 21 of the country s economy nguyen et al 2010 undoubtedly rice export remains a critical foreign currency income for the country s gdp as vietnam is one of the top rice producers and exporters in the world pandey et al 2014 at the same time rice is also a strategic crop for the national food security in contrast among others rice production is the biggest water consumer accounting for 92 and 72 of water withdrawal in mainland and maritime southeast asia respectively bueno et al 2010 nelson et al 2015 or 24 30 of the total world s freshwater withdrawals bouman et al 2007 lampayan et al 2015b however increasing water stress due to rapid population growth climate change the deterioration of water quality and increasing competition from other water users threatens the water availability for irrigated rice production in many asian countries including vietnam rejesus et al 2011 the un global assessment report on disaster risk reduction 2015 revealed that by 2050 about 40 of the global population is expected to be living in river basins that experience severe water stress particularly in africa and asia recently many rice growing areas in vietnam such as cuu long delta low mekong basin highland plateau and central region have been suffering from water scarcity for agricultural irrigation due to extreme droughts and or salinity intrusion since vietnam is expected to belong to the most severely affected countries worldwide by climate change the vulnerability of agriculture will be increased undp 2007 monre 2012 therefore it is of paramount importance to identify suitable agricultural management strategies which are able to maintain or even increase the yields under reduced water availability increasing sectoral competition for water demands for the development of more efficient water usage in agriculture li et al 2001 many efforts have been made to develop ways to decrease the water use in rice production and increase water productivity belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 a promising technology for increasing eco efficiency in rice production is alternate wetting and drying awd the awd technology does not only reduce the total water amount for rice production but also reduces methane emissions from paddy fields without considerable yield losses e g bouman et al 2007 rejesus et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015a in awd the soil surface is allowed to dry for a certain number of days before re flooding thus the field is alternately flooded and dried in a specific form of awd the safe awd the field is allowed to drain out until the water level reaches 15 cm below the soil surface 15 cm deep water table the threshold of 15 cm will not cause any yield decline since the roots of the rice plants are still able to take up water from the perched ground water and the almost saturated soil above the water table lampayan et al 2015a the period of non flooded soil in awd between irrigations can vary from few days to more than 10 days in the absence of precipitation depending on soil type and weather climate conditions bouman et al 2007 rejesus et al 2011 singh et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015a in contrast with continuous flooding cf the ponded water is kept at a certain level usually at 5 cm above the surface during the growing period from few days after transplanting until few days before maturity water savings without significant yield losses by awd compared to cf have been reported from field studies for bangladesh rahman 2014 south china liang et al 2016 and the philippines rejesus et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 apart from similar yields obtained by awd a reduction is revealed in e g tabbal et al 2002 and belder et al 2004 while an increase is found in li et al 2001 lampayan et al 2015a conducted research on the adoption of awd for irrigated lowland rice in the philippines bangladesh and vietnam the results showed that awd can reduce water input for irrigation up to 38 without yield reduction besides field studies irrigation optimization models are required to test the performance of awd and cf systematically under various boundary conditions the number of such studies is limited for southeast asia hong et al 2015 developed a water balance model to simulate water level changes in the rice field which accounts for interactions between the rice field and the irrigation system and evaluated the effectiveness of different irrigation technologies for the soc trang province southern vietnam results show that awd is the most effective irrigation technology in terms of water requirements and the number of irrigation events the number of irrigation events pumping times are found to range between 11 and 32 among different considered irrigation technologies in central vietnam rice is still grown predominantly under cf water is released to the rice cropping areas roughly at the same time which is speculated to aggravate the problem of water scarcity particularly the dry summer autumn season as a consequence it is reported of reduced rice yields for this season therefore our study aims to develop an integrated hydrological and irrigation model applicable for central vietnam which allows to optimize irrigation management i e optimal irrigation techniques schedules and cropping area 2 materials and method the vu gia thu bon vgtb river basin is located in central vietnam between 107 15 108 20 e and 14 55 16 04 n the basin has an area of 10 350 km2 covering the entire quang nam province da nang city and a small part of kon tum province fig 1 the elevation of the vgtb ranges from sea level to 2598 m a s l 2 1 climatic and edaphic characteristics the climate of the vgtb basin is driven by south asia monsoon system it is characterized by relatively warm winters and dry summers souvignet et al 2014 the rainy season frequently affected by typhoons lasts from september to december the vgtb is facing recurrent floods during the wet seasons but also water shortages during the dry seasons rainfall during the wet season amounts up to 80 of the total annual rainfall the mean temperature varies between 24 c and 26 c the maximum temperature can reach over 35 c in june and or july whereas the minimum temperature can fall below 15 c in january in the wet season the relative humidity is about 85 88 in the lowlands and about 90 95 in high elevated area while during the dry season this rate is below 80 and 80 85 respectively the basin consists of three distinct landscape types the uplands the midlands and the lowlands typically soils in the catchment are acrisols and poor grey soil covering most of uplands and midlands silty soil and alluvial plains along rivers as well as sandy soil in the low lying area 2 2 agricultural characterization in quang nam province agriculture is the primary economic sector in terms of labour it employs over 50 of the population total rice cultivation area for entire province is about 87 396 ha for two rice crops winter spring ws and summer autumn sa quang nam statistical year book 2014 the lowlands and midlands of the vgtb basin are dominated by irrigated rice paddies cash crops are also cultivated in the regions of rice based cropping systems but rice is still by far the predominant crop in the region pedroso et al 2016 further upland there exist a combination of natural and production forests irrigated rice is also present in high plateaus fink et al 2013 although awd has been officially integrated into the guidelines for rice irrigation across quang nam province by the department of agriculture and rural development dard since 2012 cf is still the prevailing irrigation technology the reasons may vary but can be summarized as the farmers traditional beliefs that standing water is required at all stages of rice growing to obtain high yields farmers have little incentive to reduce water use as the water pricing system is not in place potential problems with rodents under awd particularly when the soil is dried the higher water requirement of awd at the beginning of each irrigation event which may potentially lead to temporary water shortages if all fields are prepared at the same time rice productivity is relatively low and unstable due to the high climate variability and due to a weak technical infrastructure and an insufficient amount of water for irrigation particularly for the sa season in response to an increasingly unstable water supply many small scale reservoirs have been adopted to capture flows at small upstream tributaries in total there are 757 irrigation schemes of which 518 are barrages and 179 are pumping stations about 73 reservoirs with a volume ranging between 1 106 m3 and over 2 106 m3 were built for irrigation adb 2011 the potential cultivation area to be supplied by the reservoirs is 17 048 ha which accounts for about 42 5 of the total irrigated area however the actual irrigated area reaches 50 of its designed capacity due to insufficient irrigation systems 2 3 case study selection of a typical rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam we identified the que trung rice growing irrigation scheme located in nong son district quang nam province as typical local rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam and suitable for modelling during field surveys we have elaborated the research needs jointly with local stakeholders from the water and the agricultural sector in the region the irrigation system includes a reservoir trung loc and an associated canal system for irrigation water for irrigation is taken from the reservoir with the designed volume capacity of 1 85 106 m3 the reservoir consists of a concrete dam of 331 m in length and 27 4 m in height water is diverted to the canal scheme for irrigation via one submerged conduit running beneath the dam and controlled by a valve the reservoir outlet is designed to release a maximum discharge of 0 3 m3 s of water irrigating up to 145 ha of rice during the sa season the decision on the total irrigated area strongly depends on the initial storage of the reservoir before the dry season and seasonal climate forecast outlook the available water in the reservoir before the sa season is on average only approximately 75 of the dam design this fact frequently leads to water shortages towards the end of the sa season the representative irrigation scheme can be seen in fig 2 it includes three irrigation demand sites with 4 irrigation blocks per site each block has a size of 12 ha in total 12 blocks are modelled to account for 144 ha of sa paddy rice 2 4 modeling approach a vast number of integrated hydrological and agro economic models have been developed for different spatial scales e g rosegrant et al 2000 cai et al 2003 ahrends et al 2008 al juaidi et al 2014 the modelling system of this study consists of the hydrological model wasim and an irrigation optimization model which allows to simulate the connections between the hydrologic and irrigation components of the case study irrigation scheme the hydrological response of the upper vgtb basin is simulated by the hydrological model wasim which serves as input for the optimization model of the que trung scheme we designed our irrigation model that resembles closely the situation prevailing in the que trung rice irrigation scheme but at the same time is flexible enough to be applicable to other irrigation schemes in the region the hydrological model wasim and the irrigation model are explained in the following 2 4 1 hydrological modelling using wasim the hydrological wasim model is employed to simulate the hydrological process of the upper vgtb basin 3213 5 km2 wasim is a fully distributed mainly physically based hydrological model and supports both continuous and event based rainfall runoff simulations the model is widely used in mountainous areas in european countries e g kunstmann et al 2006 smiatek and kunstmann 2016 but it has already been successfully applied in semi arid regions such as west africa e g ahrends et al 2008 in the present study the wasim model is set up for upper vgtb river basin with a 24 hour time step and a 500 500 m spatial resolution the vertical fluxes of water within the unsaturated soil zone are calculated with a finite difference scheme for the discrete richards equation richards 1931 surface runoff interflow and base flow are determined at each model grid cell discharge routing is based on the kinematic wave approach using different flow velocities for different water levels in the river channel a linear reservoir approach is employed to calculate baseflow at the outlet gauge all runoff components are superimposed at the gauge to create the total runoff the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith approach monteith 1975 the soil module in wasim calculates the infiltration of water and the surface runoff generation as proposed by green and ampt 1911 required inputs for the model include daily temperature precipitation relative humidity wind and global radiation as well as gridded information on topography soil and land use the wasim model was calibrated and validated against the discharge observations at nong son station using a split sampling technique the model was calibrated for the period 1976 1981 and validated for two independent periods i e 1982 1988 and 1995 2000 the model was calibrated using daily observed station precipitation and reanalysis data for temperature relative humidity wind speed and global radiation the physiographic parameters for land use and soil texture are obtained from literature e g schulla 2012 and harmonized world soil database further empirical parameters including recession constant for interflow ki recession constant for direct runoff kd drainage density dr scaling factor for base flow q0 and recession constant for base flow kb have to be calibrated a sensitivity analysis was performed under the prevailing environmental conditions to identify the most crucial parameters to be calibrated and to determine the limits for each parameter the parameters kd dr and kb are found to be the most sensitive the physically plausible ranges for these parameters were taken from literature the calibrated model parameters were obtained by two approaches a trial and error procedure manual calibration and an automatic parameter estimation using the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 both leading to similar values of the most sensitive model parameters in order to evaluate the model performance several statistical measures such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse are employed more detail about the hydrological model wasim is given in dang et al 2017 and laux et al 2017 fig 3 exemplarily shows hydrographs of simulated and observed discharges for the validation period 1982 1988 overall there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed discharges but the model slightly underestimates discharge the agreement between simulated and observed discharges is also reflected in the model performance criteria with values both of nse and r2 greater than 0 8 for both the calibration and validation periods similarly the absolute values of pbias are in the acceptable range between 5 6 and 1 7 nrmse values for both calibration approaches are at the same order of magnitude table 1 after successful calibration the model is assumed to be reliable to reproduce discharges for the que trung subcatchment 4 0 km2 in the upper vgtb basin together with evapotranspiration which will be used as inputs for the irrigation optimization model introduced in the next section 2 4 2 irrigation optimization model the irrigation optimization model developed for this study is written in general algebraic modeling system gams rosenthal 2016 gams is a high level programming language designed for solving mathematical optimization problems and is widely used in the water resources and agricultural economics studies ahrends et al 2008 in optimization modeling gams is combined with one of solvers covering a broad range of mathematical programming models including linear non linear mixed integer mixed complementarity and constrained non linear systems in this study we use the cplex solver that uses branch and cut algorithms for solution search and is frequently used for mixed integer programming mip gams 2016 the model accounts for the structure of the irrigation network the reservoir by including its water balance reservoir inflow and outflow initial reservoir storage and evaporation the irrigation techniques and schedules the model maximizes the return of rice production for the whole irrigation scheme there are three different irrigation areas and each area can operate up to four irrigation blocks tertiary level see fig 2 this leads to 12 tertiary irrigation units irrigation can be staggered on 15 different days and farmers can choose between awd or cf all together we have 360 possible irrigation activities expressed as binary variables thus the allocation of land for cropping the irrigation technology and the irrigation scheduling for each block are important decision variables in the model the sa rice cultivation period covers a fixed period of 110 days starting from land preparation until maturity the optimization model may provide each block with 200 mm water for land preparation within the first 15 days of the cultivation period depending on the available water the model optimizes the starting date of the first irrigation for each block within the three areas during the land preparation phase the following irrigation events depend on the crop evapotranspiration exclusively see eq 1 thereafter possible irrigation options include safe awd hereafter referred to awd and cf fig 4 the choice of irrigation technology determines the irrigation water for each block for awd during early growth stage about one week after seeding water level is always maintained at the depth of around 2 5 cm above soil surface for about two weeks to control weeds and pests bouman et al 2007 lampayan et al 2015a after the early stage the awd irrigation is continuously applied until one week before the flowing period starts from one week before to one week after flowering the ponded water is kept at about 5 cm above soil surface to avoid spikelet sterility and yield loss lampayan et al 2015b after this period awd is again applied until maturity in other words the model considers the rice physiological requirements of water which is not allowed to drop below soil surface during early growth period and flowering period as these stages are very sensitive to water deficit stress that would affect the yield bouman et al 2007 in contrast with cf water is always kept at the depth of around 5 cm above surface for the whole rice growing stage irrigation water depth at each block is expressed as 1 w d t w d t 1 s q t p t e t c t p e r c t where wd t is the irrigation water depth at time t mm pt is precipitation at time t mm sqt is the inflow to the block at time t mm etct mm crop evapotranspiration determined by reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient etc eto kc where kc is the crop coefficient fao 1998 perct is the percolation rate mm in this study we assume a constant rate for percolation since the precipitation amount is very small during the dry summer autumn season in this region and no precipitation information in the vicinity of the irrigation scheme is available we set precipitation to zero during the cropping period the objective function is to maximize the monetary profit under different agricultural irrigation scenarios other economic variables include crop yield and rice price maximum profit will be obtained by maximizing cultivation area under different water availability scenarios rice price and rice yield information collected through a field survey in early 2015 are 6000 vnd kg 0 3 usd and 5 000 kg ha respectively in this study the rice yield is assumed to be identical for awd and cf e g rejesus et al 2011 rahman 2014 liang et al 2016 i e no process based crop model is integrated the applied objective function can be expressed as follows 2 m a x z i j b s t e c h p r i

model then the current solution is passed to the irrigation model 2 4 2 1 land constraints the binary variable onblock determines which block is in the optimal solution using either awd or cf

study the wasim output of the year 2012 is employed the optimal irrigation is defined as the decision set which maximizes the objective function in terms of cultivation area and irrigation technology under given water constraints i e the reservoir inflow and the initial reservoir storage 3 results we apply the irrigation optimization model with different scenarios of initial reservoir storages and various maximum water releases in total 4 different scenarios are defined to demonstrate the interactions between irrigation needs under the awd and cf technologies the initial reservoir storages before the beginning of the summer autumn cropping season are assumed to be 100 90 80 and 70 of the full reservoir s capacity 1 85 million m3 which is defined as the water amount that can be used for sa rice irrigation these assumptions are based on the results of focal group discussions with agricultural officials in a field survey carried out in 2015 possible maximum flows released from the reservoir are set to range between 0 3 and 1 0 m3 s with an increment of 0 1 m3 s this allows the model to investigate whether or not the designed outlet is sufficient to apply the awd irrigation technology for the entire considered cropping area and how the maximum outflow and the initial reservoir volume may impact on the optimization results 3 1 optimized irrigation area and technology the results for optimized irrigation area and its associated irrigation technology i e awd or cf for the que trung rice irrigation system under different scenarios are shown in fig 5 each sub figure presents the optimized irrigated area block and the number of blocks irrigated by either awd or cf under prescribed maxima water releases the total irrigation water amount under different scenarios is also presented as shown in the figure the irrigated area is different between the different scenarios and ranges between 8 12 blocks with 12 ha each under scenario 1 the entire rice cropping area 12 blocks is irrigated under every case of reservoir release however the optimal fraction of the two irrigation technologies is different the largest number of blocks in which awd is applied is 11 whereas the lowest number of blocks in which cf is applied is 1 the lowest number of awd of 4 and the largest number of cf of 8 are found when water release is equal to 0 3 m3 s and 0 4 m3 s fig 5a for further increases of the outlet discharge the number of blocks applying awd are increasing and cf decreasing similar trends are found for scenario 2 where the lowest number of awd of 0 and largest number of cf of 12 are found when maximum water release is equal to 0 3 m3 s while maximum value of awd and minimum value of cf are 12 and 0 respectively when water release is equal to 1 0 m3 s fig 5b in scenario 3 fig 5c maximum awd applied to 11 blocks and minimum cf no blocks are found when water release larger than 0 6 m3 s i e awd is applied for all blocks and no blocks of cf are chosen interestingly the model identifies the maximum minimum number of blocks applying cf awd for the smallest reservoir release of 0 3 m3 s the designed water release of the trung loc reservoir this also holds true for all other scenarios out of all simulated scenarios the entire rice cropping area is irrigated under scenarios 1 and 2 under all possible water releases while 11 blocks are irrigated in scenario 3 only 9 or 10 blocks are irrigated under scenario 4 fig 5d due to the limited initial water storages within the reservoir before the cropping season there is a significant discrepancy in terms of irrigation water consumption under the four considered scenarios it can be clearly seen from fig 5 a that the total irrigated water is smallest 1 751 m m3 when the release equals to 1 0 m3 s while it is largest 1 905 m m3 when the release is 0 7 m3 s it is found that comparatively more water can be saved if more awd is applied in case of 1 0 m3 s approximately 7 of water can be saved 12 blocks applied awd in this case in scenario 2 the smallest and largest water consumption is also under releases of 1 0 m3 s and 0 7 m3 s respectively the total irrigation water under release of 1 0 m3 s in this scenario is smaller than that of scenario 1 however the difference is insignificant this could be attributed to the slightly different in number of blocks applied awd and cf in these two scenarios 12 awd and 0 cf for scenario 2 compared to 11 awd and 1 cf for scenario 1 total irrigation water is always smallest when water release is 1 0 m3 s under three scenarios 1 2 and 3 under this water release awd is the predominant irrigation practice for all scenarios leading to the lowest water demands for irrigation it is noted that under scenario 4 shown in fig 5 d the total irrigation water is smallest when the release is 0 3 m3 s in this case only 9 blocks are irrigated this is also the smallest irrigated area associated to the least initial water level in the reservoir amongst all scenarios 3 2 optimized irrigation schedule detailed irrigation schedule for 12 blocks under 2 most extreme selected scenarios i e initial reservoir storage of 100 and 70 are exemplarily shown in fig 6 the optimization model provides the timetable day for staggered irrigation for every block and its associated irrigation technology tech under different water releases the irrigation scheduling differs among the water release rates from 0 3 1 0 m3 s in scenario 1 fig 6a for instance with a rate of 0 3 m3 s block 3 of area 2 starts the first irrigation on the first day using cf followed by block 2 of area 3 on day 2 and also applied cf practice block 2 in area 2 starts its first irrigation latest on day 15 and irrigated with awd under water release of 1 0 m3 s two blocks block 3 area 1 and block 1 area 2 start their first irrigation at the same time day 5 and applied the same practice awd three blocks blocks 1 and 2 of area 1 and block 2 of area 3 are irrigated on the day 11 in this scenario at discharge releases of equal or less than 0 5 m3 s it is found that all blocks are irrigated on different days this finding is similar for other scenarios indicating that maximum water release of more than 0 5 m3 s are required to irrigate more than one block at the same time in the second scenario 4 fig 6b it is found that under water releases of 0 9 and 1 0 m3 s all irrigated blocks 10 are irrigated at the 4 last consecutive days of 15 days and the awd technology is applied for all these blocks this is probably because that the initial water and inflow to the reservoir is insufficient to apply awd practice before day 12 likewise as fig 5 it is shown that the number of irrigated blocks decreases with decreasing initial reservoir level regarding irrigation water input table 2 exhibits the mean irrigation water required for one block by applying either awd or cf under different scenarios there is a slight difference in irrigation water input between awd and cf the range of total irrigation water for one block ranges between 0 145 to 0 147 mm3 for awd and 0 151 to 0 157 mm3 for cf on average the irrigation water allocated for one block by awd and cf is about 0 145 mm3 and 0 154 mm3 respectively in general awd is more water efficient than cf with water saving ranges from 4 to 10 depending on scenarios in terms of irrigation events the number of irrigation times by awd in all considered scenarios is considerably less than that of cf the average number of irrigation events by awd and cf for one block during entire cropping season is 12 and 21 respectively table 3 3 3 optimization procedure fig 7 exemplarily shows the values obtained by the objective function of the mip optimization problem against the number of iterations for scenario 1 under water release of 1 0 m3 s it can be seen that the values of the objective function solid line are increasing with increasing number of iterations the stepwise increases in the function values indicate the iterations when a new solution is found after a solution is found the solver checks if this solution is better than the currently best known integer solution the dashed line is indicating the optimality gap in between the possible best and current best known solutions this line is decreasing as the gap is becoming smaller the gap becomes zero when the current best known solution equals the best possible solution 3 4 robustness of optimization results on different computer architectures in this study the latest gams version 24 7 3 with latest cplex 12 6 3 0 running in 64 bit mode are employed to run on different platforms 1 on a pc with windows os i7 with 8 cores x2 6 ghz a mac i7 with 2 cores 2 8 ghz and a linux cluster using an ivy cpu unit intel xenon with 12 cores 2 8 ghz in order to establish comparability two cores threads are used on each system fig 8 top shows the optimal results for scenario 1 performed on the different platforms it can be seen that there are slight differences in the maximum number of blocks applied awd and cf the largest number of blocks irrigated by awd is 11 on the pc and the mac it is only 10 on the linux cluster while the largest numbers of cf are 10 9 and 8 for mac linux cluster and windows pc respectively overall the tendencies of the optimization results between awd and cf are similar for the different computer architectures i e increased awd and decreased cf with increased reservoir releases the only exception occurs for the selected reservoir release of 0 7 m3 s where there is a significant difference between the pc on the one hand and the mac and linux cluster on the other hand fig 8 bottom this is possible due to the dynamic optimality for the mip optimization despite of the same total number of irrigated blocks 12 on three computer architectures there are 6 blocks for awd and 6 for cf on the pc while the numbers are 10 awd and 2 cf on both the linux cluster and the mac such a performance variability for mip problems using the same model and the same solver are well known in computer engineering e g koch et al 2011 but only rarely considered and discussed in applications klotz and newman 2013 potential reasons comprise the imperfect tie breaking when solving a mip i e the selections of the best solution which may be made arbitrarily based on the order in which the best solutions are considered or influenced by rounding errors this in combination with e g different compiler options depends on the platform koch et al 2011 4 discussion under different hypothesized initial water levels in the reservoir during the summer autumn cropping season in 2012 the model results predominantly suggest the usage of awd rather than cf our findings obtained for central vietnam are in line with other studies in southeast asia in which awd is found to be a technology which can save irrigation water e g lampayan et al 2015a b rahman 2014 it is found in this study that the application of awd potentially allows to irrigate more blocks in the que trung irrigation scheme but only if the discharge release of the reservoir is redesigned towards larger flow rates than the current one 0 3 m3 s the irrigation optimization model indicates that reservoir outflow rates of 0 5 m3 s are required to facilitate the adoption of awd the water use for irrigation is lower when more awd is applied this finally helps to save water for irrigation and to crop larger areas the entire rice cropping area can be irrigated only if the initial water storages of the reservoir are 100 and 90 of its capacity thus the reservoir size is well designed for the size of this irrigation scheme only 75 of the cropping area can be irrigated if the initial water in the reservoir is 70 and the given maximum water release this finding is in agreement with statements from the local agricultural authorities nguyen s 2015 personal communication thus we assume that the model reasonably represents the irrigation scheme in addition the model amount of irrigation water by cf for 1 ha summer autumn rice is comparable with the actual irrigation water running by local practices for que trung irrigation system which ranges from 10 000 to 12 000 m3 ha crop the irrigation water requirement total irrigation water for 1 ha of rice per summer autumn cropping season by both the cf and awd technologies is also in line with findings from a study of nguyen et al 2010 conducted for some areas in quang nam province central vietnam our results also reveal that total irrigation water for one block 12 ha by awd is less than that of cf indicating that the awd technology is more water efficient assuming the same rice yields based on cf and awd on average awd saves 6 water input compared to cf since there is no other actual irrigation data available for the que trung irrigation scheme to validate our modelling results we had to compare our results with similar studies across south east asia the water saving by awd compared to cf modelled in our study is less than the field study of lampayan et al 2015a for bangladesh and the philippines in this study the differences in total water input for rice between awd and cf range between 13 and 38 it is noted that such discrepancies are possible due to difference in soil properties climate conditions cultivation practices and cropping seasons by saving more irrigation water amount the awd practice could be a promising irrigation option in central vietnam that can eliminate the increasing irrigation water stress as a small reduction of water use for rice can free up large volumes of this vital resource for increasing rice production and other uses lampayan et al 2015a in terms of number of irrigation events the average number of irrigation events by awd is 12 and by cf is 21 respectively our analysis suggests that awd reduces the number of irrigation events approximately 43 as compared to cf thus costs induced by irrigation can be reduced if awd is applied properly in the region field studies and also modelling results have reported similar results when applying awd and cf for rice growing areas in the region such as liang et al 2016 for southern china lampayan et al 2015a for bangladesh the philippines and vietnam and rahman 2014 for bangladesh our model results are also in line with findings from hong et al 2015 conducted for the soc trang province in southern vietnam apart from suggested optimal irrigation technology our model goes one step further and provides information about the optimal area for cropping as well as irrigation schedules associated to each block this could be of crucial importance for agricultural managers to better plan their cropping preparations moreover we analyzed the optimization results for performance variability from different computer architectures since a performance variability for mip problems using the same model and the same solver are well known in computer engineering e g koch et al 2011 which may lead to non robust solutions and difficulties for decision support we found that test simulations showed similar tendencies and varied only slightly on the 3 computing environments giving confidence in the robustness of the model for decision support it is noted that only the hydrological model has been validated a quantitative validation of the irrigation model was not possible however we compared our modelling results in terms of water requirement for irrigation number and interval of irrigation events and irrigated area for cropping with research studies and data from central vietnam in particular but also for the southeast asian region in general 5 conclusions in this study a hydrological and an irrigation optimization model system has been developed to improve agricultural management strategies for a typical rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam the model is designed to account for water shortages occurring during the summer autumn season in this region the model provides staggered irrigation schedules for awd and cf for a typical rice irrigation system the model is found to be robust on different computing environments in conclusion the adoption of awd in the region potentially allows saving water compared to the prevailing cf during the summer autumn season given that the technical infrastructure allows e g reservoir capacity maximum reservoir release this study however is limited in the following aspects additional monetary e g labor and reservoir operation costs and environmental factors different global warming potentials of the cropping technologies are not included in the model thus a more detailed cost benefit analysis should be included in future studies the model was developed and tested for one cropping cycle 2012 the applicability with long term climate projections or seasonal climate forecasts will be beneficial for decision making i e for designing new irrigation schemes and for seasonal reservoir management despite of the aforementioned limitations this study focused on the development of the model and intended to lay a foundation for further studies aiming at the improvement of existing or the design of new irrigation systems in the region in the long run the model can potentially be transferred to similar irrigation schemes in the region and can potentially be applied in concert with both seasonal predictions and long term climate projections this study also stresses the need to conduct field experiments in central vietnam to validate the model system further under

11371,in central vietnam farmers report an increasing occurrence frequency of water shortages for irrigation during dry seasons particularly during the summer autumn rice season water is often insufficient to irrigate the entire rice production areas and thus restricting rice productivity significantly in this study a coupled hydrological irrigation optimization modelling system is developed to optimize irrigation strategies for a typical rice irrigation system in central vietnam the model consists of a fully distributed hydrologic model which simulates the inflow to a reservoir and an irrigation model which optimizes the rice irrigation technology i e alternate wetting and drying awd or continuous flooding cf irrigation schedule and cropping area under given water constraints irrigation strategies are derived based on different initial reservoir water levels at the beginning of the cropping season as well as different maximum water releases the simulation results show that the initial level of water in the reservoir is crucial water levels of less than 90 do not provide sufficient water to irrigate the entire cropping area whereas a level of 70 restricts the cropping area to 75 awd is able to reduce the water input ranging from 4 to 10 the adoption of awd therefore has the potential to irrigate a larger area and may help to increase the profit of the farmers however the benefits of awd can only be achieved after significant investment in the canal system and the reservoir outlet since the robustness of the optimization results performance variability is crucial for decision support we estimated the impact of different computing environments on the solutions only limited performance variability is found giving confidence in the robustness of the model for decision support keywords distributed hydrological model irrigation practices optimization model alternate wetting and drying continuous flooding central vietnam 1 introduction rice is the main staple crop of asia wassmann et al 2009 in vietnam rice production plays an important role for the agricultural sector which accounts for approximately 21 of the country s economy nguyen et al 2010 undoubtedly rice export remains a critical foreign currency income for the country s gdp as vietnam is one of the top rice producers and exporters in the world pandey et al 2014 at the same time rice is also a strategic crop for the national food security in contrast among others rice production is the biggest water consumer accounting for 92 and 72 of water withdrawal in mainland and maritime southeast asia respectively bueno et al 2010 nelson et al 2015 or 24 30 of the total world s freshwater withdrawals bouman et al 2007 lampayan et al 2015b however increasing water stress due to rapid population growth climate change the deterioration of water quality and increasing competition from other water users threatens the water availability for irrigated rice production in many asian countries including vietnam rejesus et al 2011 the un global assessment report on disaster risk reduction 2015 revealed that by 2050 about 40 of the global population is expected to be living in river basins that experience severe water stress particularly in africa and asia recently many rice growing areas in vietnam such as cuu long delta low mekong basin highland plateau and central region have been suffering from water scarcity for agricultural irrigation due to extreme droughts and or salinity intrusion since vietnam is expected to belong to the most severely affected countries worldwide by climate change the vulnerability of agriculture will be increased undp 2007 monre 2012 therefore it is of paramount importance to identify suitable agricultural management strategies which are able to maintain or even increase the yields under reduced water availability increasing sectoral competition for water demands for the development of more efficient water usage in agriculture li et al 2001 many efforts have been made to develop ways to decrease the water use in rice production and increase water productivity belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 a promising technology for increasing eco efficiency in rice production is alternate wetting and drying awd the awd technology does not only reduce the total water amount for rice production but also reduces methane emissions from paddy fields without considerable yield losses e g bouman et al 2007 rejesus et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015a in awd the soil surface is allowed to dry for a certain number of days before re flooding thus the field is alternately flooded and dried in a specific form of awd the safe awd the field is allowed to drain out until the water level reaches 15 cm below the soil surface 15 cm deep water table the threshold of 15 cm will not cause any yield decline since the roots of the rice plants are still able to take up water from the perched ground water and the almost saturated soil above the water table lampayan et al 2015a the period of non flooded soil in awd between irrigations can vary from few days to more than 10 days in the absence of precipitation depending on soil type and weather climate conditions bouman et al 2007 rejesus et al 2011 singh et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015a in contrast with continuous flooding cf the ponded water is kept at a certain level usually at 5 cm above the surface during the growing period from few days after transplanting until few days before maturity water savings without significant yield losses by awd compared to cf have been reported from field studies for bangladesh rahman 2014 south china liang et al 2016 and the philippines rejesus et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 apart from similar yields obtained by awd a reduction is revealed in e g tabbal et al 2002 and belder et al 2004 while an increase is found in li et al 2001 lampayan et al 2015a conducted research on the adoption of awd for irrigated lowland rice in the philippines bangladesh and vietnam the results showed that awd can reduce water input for irrigation up to 38 without yield reduction besides field studies irrigation optimization models are required to test the performance of awd and cf systematically under various boundary conditions the number of such studies is limited for southeast asia hong et al 2015 developed a water balance model to simulate water level changes in the rice field which accounts for interactions between the rice field and the irrigation system and evaluated the effectiveness of different irrigation technologies for the soc trang province southern vietnam results show that awd is the most effective irrigation technology in terms of water requirements and the number of irrigation events the number of irrigation events pumping times are found to range between 11 and 32 among different considered irrigation technologies in central vietnam rice is still grown predominantly under cf water is released to the rice cropping areas roughly at the same time which is speculated to aggravate the problem of water scarcity particularly the dry summer autumn season as a consequence it is reported of reduced rice yields for this season therefore our study aims to develop an integrated hydrological and irrigation model applicable for central vietnam which allows to optimize irrigation management i e optimal irrigation techniques schedules and cropping area 2 materials and method the vu gia thu bon vgtb river basin is located in central vietnam between 107 15 108 20 e and 14 55 16 04 n the basin has an area of 10 350 km2 covering the entire quang nam province da nang city and a small part of kon tum province fig 1 the elevation of the vgtb ranges from sea level to 2598 m a s l 2 1 climatic and edaphic characteristics the climate of the vgtb basin is driven by south asia monsoon system it is characterized by relatively warm winters and dry summers souvignet et al 2014 the rainy season frequently affected by typhoons lasts from september to december the vgtb is facing recurrent floods during the wet seasons but also water shortages during the dry seasons rainfall during the wet season amounts up to 80 of the total annual rainfall the mean temperature varies between 24 c and 26 c the maximum temperature can reach over 35 c in june and or july whereas the minimum temperature can fall below 15 c in january in the wet season the relative humidity is about 85 88 in the lowlands and about 90 95 in high elevated area while during the dry season this rate is below 80 and 80 85 respectively the basin consists of three distinct landscape types the uplands the midlands and the lowlands typically soils in the catchment are acrisols and poor grey soil covering most of uplands and midlands silty soil and alluvial plains along rivers as well as sandy soil in the low lying area 2 2 agricultural characterization in quang nam province agriculture is the primary economic sector in terms of labour it employs over 50 of the population total rice cultivation area for entire province is about 87 396 ha for two rice crops winter spring ws and summer autumn sa quang nam statistical year book 2014 the lowlands and midlands of the vgtb basin are dominated by irrigated rice paddies cash crops are also cultivated in the regions of rice based cropping systems but rice is still by far the predominant crop in the region pedroso et al 2016 further upland there exist a combination of natural and production forests irrigated rice is also present in high plateaus fink et al 2013 although awd has been officially integrated into the guidelines for rice irrigation across quang nam province by the department of agriculture and rural development dard since 2012 cf is still the prevailing irrigation technology the reasons may vary but can be summarized as the farmers traditional beliefs that standing water is required at all stages of rice growing to obtain high yields farmers have little incentive to reduce water use as the water pricing system is not in place potential problems with rodents under awd particularly when the soil is dried the higher water requirement of awd at the beginning of each irrigation event which may potentially lead to temporary water shortages if all fields are prepared at the same time rice productivity is relatively low and unstable due to the high climate variability and due to a weak technical infrastructure and an insufficient amount of water for irrigation particularly for the sa season in response to an increasingly unstable water supply many small scale reservoirs have been adopted to capture flows at small upstream tributaries in total there are 757 irrigation schemes of which 518 are barrages and 179 are pumping stations about 73 reservoirs with a volume ranging between 1 106 m3 and over 2 106 m3 were built for irrigation adb 2011 the potential cultivation area to be supplied by the reservoirs is 17 048 ha which accounts for about 42 5 of the total irrigated area however the actual irrigated area reaches 50 of its designed capacity due to insufficient irrigation systems 2 3 case study selection of a typical rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam we identified the que trung rice growing irrigation scheme located in nong son district quang nam province as typical local rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam and suitable for modelling during field surveys we have elaborated the research needs jointly with local stakeholders from the water and the agricultural sector in the region the irrigation system includes a reservoir trung loc and an associated canal system for irrigation water for irrigation is taken from the reservoir with the designed volume capacity of 1 85 106 m3 the reservoir consists of a concrete dam of 331 m in length and 27 4 m in height water is diverted to the canal scheme for irrigation via one submerged conduit running beneath the dam and controlled by a valve the reservoir outlet is designed to release a maximum discharge of 0 3 m3 s of water irrigating up to 145 ha of rice during the sa season the decision on the total irrigated area strongly depends on the initial storage of the reservoir before the dry season and seasonal climate forecast outlook the available water in the reservoir before the sa season is on average only approximately 75 of the dam design this fact frequently leads to water shortages towards the end of the sa season the representative irrigation scheme can be seen in fig 2 it includes three irrigation demand sites with 4 irrigation blocks per site each block has a size of 12 ha in total 12 blocks are modelled to account for 144 ha of sa paddy rice 2 4 modeling approach a vast number of integrated hydrological and agro economic models have been developed for different spatial scales e g rosegrant et al 2000 cai et al 2003 ahrends et al 2008 al juaidi et al 2014 the modelling system of this study consists of the hydrological model wasim and an irrigation optimization model which allows to simulate the connections between the hydrologic and irrigation components of the case study irrigation scheme the hydrological response of the upper vgtb basin is simulated by the hydrological model wasim which serves as input for the optimization model of the que trung scheme we designed our irrigation model that resembles closely the situation prevailing in the que trung rice irrigation scheme but at the same time is flexible enough to be applicable to other irrigation schemes in the region the hydrological model wasim and the irrigation model are explained in the following 2 4 1 hydrological modelling using wasim the hydrological wasim model is employed to simulate the hydrological process of the upper vgtb basin 3213 5 km2 wasim is a fully distributed mainly physically based hydrological model and supports both continuous and event based rainfall runoff simulations the model is widely used in mountainous areas in european countries e g kunstmann et al 2006 smiatek and kunstmann 2016 but it has already been successfully applied in semi arid regions such as west africa e g ahrends et al 2008 in the present study the wasim model is set up for upper vgtb river basin with a 24 hour time step and a 500 500 m spatial resolution the vertical fluxes of water within the unsaturated soil zone are calculated with a finite difference scheme for the discrete richards equation richards 1931 surface runoff interflow and base flow are determined at each model grid cell discharge routing is based on the kinematic wave approach using different flow velocities for different water levels in the river channel a linear reservoir approach is employed to calculate baseflow at the outlet gauge all runoff components are superimposed at the gauge to create the total runoff the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith approach monteith 1975 the soil module in wasim calculates the infiltration of water and the surface runoff generation as proposed by green and ampt 1911 required inputs for the model include daily temperature precipitation relative humidity wind and global radiation as well as gridded information on topography soil and land use the wasim model was calibrated and validated against the discharge observations at nong son station using a split sampling technique the model was calibrated for the period 1976 1981 and validated for two independent periods i e 1982 1988 and 1995 2000 the model was calibrated using daily observed station precipitation and reanalysis data for temperature relative humidity wind speed and global radiation the physiographic parameters for land use and soil texture are obtained from literature e g schulla 2012 and harmonized world soil database further empirical parameters including recession constant for interflow ki recession constant for direct runoff kd drainage density dr scaling factor for base flow q0 and recession constant for base flow kb have to be calibrated a sensitivity analysis was performed under the prevailing environmental conditions to identify the most crucial parameters to be calibrated and to determine the limits for each parameter the parameters kd dr and kb are found to be the most sensitive the physically plausible ranges for these parameters were taken from literature the calibrated model parameters were obtained by two approaches a trial and error procedure manual calibration and an automatic parameter estimation using the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 both leading to similar values of the most sensitive model parameters in order to evaluate the model performance several statistical measures such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse are employed more detail about the hydrological model wasim is given in dang et al 2017 and laux et al 2017 fig 3 exemplarily shows hydrographs of simulated and observed discharges for the validation period 1982 1988 overall there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed discharges but the model slightly underestimates discharge the agreement between simulated and observed discharges is also reflected in the model performance criteria with values both of nse and r2 greater than 0 8 for both the calibration and validation periods similarly the absolute values of pbias are in the acceptable range between 5 6 and 1 7 nrmse values for both calibration approaches are at the same order of magnitude table 1 after successful calibration the model is assumed to be reliable to reproduce discharges for the que trung subcatchment 4 0 km2 in the upper vgtb basin together with evapotranspiration which will be used as inputs for the irrigation optimization model introduced in the next section 2 4 2 irrigation optimization model the irrigation optimization model developed for this study is written in general algebraic modeling system gams rosenthal 2016 gams is a high level programming language designed for solving mathematical optimization problems and is widely used in the water resources and agricultural economics studies ahrends et al 2008 in optimization modeling gams is combined with one of solvers covering a broad range of mathematical programming models including linear non linear mixed integer mixed complementarity and constrained non linear systems in this study we use the cplex solver that uses branch and cut algorithms for solution search and is frequently used for mixed integer programming mip gams 2016 the model accounts for the structure of the irrigation network the reservoir by including its water balance reservoir inflow and outflow initial reservoir storage and evaporation the irrigation techniques and schedules the model maximizes the return of rice production for the whole irrigation scheme there are three different irrigation areas and each area can operate up to four irrigation blocks tertiary level see fig 2 this leads to 12 tertiary irrigation units irrigation can be staggered on 15 different days and farmers can choose between awd or cf all together we have 360 possible irrigation activities expressed as binary variables thus the allocation of land for cropping the irrigation technology and the irrigation scheduling for each block are important decision variables in the model the sa rice cultivation period covers a fixed period of 110 days starting from land preparation until maturity the optimization model may provide each block with 200 mm water for land preparation within the first 15 days of the cultivation period depending on the available water the model optimizes the starting date of the first irrigation for each block within the three areas during the land preparation phase the following irrigation events depend on the crop evapotranspiration exclusively see eq 1 thereafter possible irrigation options include safe awd hereafter referred to awd and cf fig 4 the choice of irrigation technology determines the irrigation water for each block for awd during early growth stage about one week after seeding water level is always maintained at the depth of around 2 5 cm above soil surface for about two weeks to control weeds and pests bouman et al 2007 lampayan et al 2015a after the early stage the awd irrigation is continuously applied until one week before the flowing period starts from one week before to one week after flowering the ponded water is kept at about 5 cm above soil surface to avoid spikelet sterility and yield loss lampayan et al 2015b after this period awd is again applied until maturity in other words the model considers the rice physiological requirements of water which is not allowed to drop below soil surface during early growth period and flowering period as these stages are very sensitive to water deficit stress that would affect the yield bouman et al 2007 in contrast with cf water is always kept at the depth of around 5 cm above surface for the whole rice growing stage irrigation water depth at each block is expressed as 1 w d t w d t 1 s q t p t e t c t p e r c t where wd t is the irrigation water depth at time t mm pt is precipitation at time t mm sqt is the inflow to the block at time t mm etct mm crop evapotranspiration determined by reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient etc eto kc where kc is the crop coefficient fao 1998 perct is the percolation rate mm in this study we assume a constant rate for percolation since the precipitation amount is very small during the dry summer autumn season in this region and no precipitation information in the vicinity of the irrigation scheme is available we set precipitation to zero during the cropping period the objective function is to maximize the monetary profit under different agricultural irrigation scenarios other economic variables include crop yield and rice price maximum profit will be obtained by maximizing cultivation area under different water availability scenarios rice price and rice yield information collected through a field survey in early 2015 are 6000 vnd kg 0 3 usd and 5 000 kg ha respectively in this study the rice yield is assumed to be identical for awd and cf e g rejesus et al 2011 rahman 2014 liang et al 2016 i e no process based crop model is integrated the applied objective function can be expressed as follows 2 m a x z i j b s t e c h p r i

model then the current solution is passed to the irrigation model 2 4 2 1 land constraints the binary variable onblock determines which block is in the optimal solution using either awd or cf

study the wasim output of the year 2012 is employed the optimal irrigation is defined as the decision set which maximizes the objective function in terms of cultivation area and irrigation technology under given water constraints i e the reservoir inflow and the initial reservoir storage 3 results we apply the irrigation optimization model with different scenarios of initial reservoir storages and various maximum water releases in total 4 different scenarios are defined to demonstrate the interactions between irrigation needs under the awd and cf technologies the initial reservoir storages before the beginning of the summer autumn cropping season are assumed to be 100 90 80 and 70 of the full reservoir s capacity 1 85 million m3 which is defined as the water amount that can be used for sa rice irrigation these assumptions are based on the results of focal group discussions with agricultural officials in a field survey carried out in 2015 possible maximum flows released from the reservoir are set to range between 0 3 and 1 0 m3 s with an increment of 0 1 m3 s this allows the model to investigate whether or not the designed outlet is sufficient to apply the awd irrigation technology for the entire considered cropping area and how the maximum outflow and the initial reservoir volume may impact on the optimization results 3 1 optimized irrigation area and technology the results for optimized irrigation area and its associated irrigation technology i e awd or cf for the que trung rice irrigation system under different scenarios are shown in fig 5 each sub figure presents the optimized irrigated area block and the number of blocks irrigated by either awd or cf under prescribed maxima water releases the total irrigation water amount under different scenarios is also presented as shown in the figure the irrigated area is different between the different scenarios and ranges between 8 12 blocks with 12 ha each under scenario 1 the entire rice cropping area 12 blocks is irrigated under every case of reservoir release however the optimal fraction of the two irrigation technologies is different the largest number of blocks in which awd is applied is 11 whereas the lowest number of blocks in which cf is applied is 1 the lowest number of awd of 4 and the largest number of cf of 8 are found when water release is equal to 0 3 m3 s and 0 4 m3 s fig 5a for further increases of the outlet discharge the number of blocks applying awd are increasing and cf decreasing similar trends are found for scenario 2 where the lowest number of awd of 0 and largest number of cf of 12 are found when maximum water release is equal to 0 3 m3 s while maximum value of awd and minimum value of cf are 12 and 0 respectively when water release is equal to 1 0 m3 s fig 5b in scenario 3 fig 5c maximum awd applied to 11 blocks and minimum cf no blocks are found when water release larger than 0 6 m3 s i e awd is applied for all blocks and no blocks of cf are chosen interestingly the model identifies the maximum minimum number of blocks applying cf awd for the smallest reservoir release of 0 3 m3 s the designed water release of the trung loc reservoir this also holds true for all other scenarios out of all simulated scenarios the entire rice cropping area is irrigated under scenarios 1 and 2 under all possible water releases while 11 blocks are irrigated in scenario 3 only 9 or 10 blocks are irrigated under scenario 4 fig 5d due to the limited initial water storages within the reservoir before the cropping season there is a significant discrepancy in terms of irrigation water consumption under the four considered scenarios it can be clearly seen from fig 5 a that the total irrigated water is smallest 1 751 m m3 when the release equals to 1 0 m3 s while it is largest 1 905 m m3 when the release is 0 7 m3 s it is found that comparatively more water can be saved if more awd is applied in case of 1 0 m3 s approximately 7 of water can be saved 12 blocks applied awd in this case in scenario 2 the smallest and largest water consumption is also under releases of 1 0 m3 s and 0 7 m3 s respectively the total irrigation water under release of 1 0 m3 s in this scenario is smaller than that of scenario 1 however the difference is insignificant this could be attributed to the slightly different in number of blocks applied awd and cf in these two scenarios 12 awd and 0 cf for scenario 2 compared to 11 awd and 1 cf for scenario 1 total irrigation water is always smallest when water release is 1 0 m3 s under three scenarios 1 2 and 3 under this water release awd is the predominant irrigation practice for all scenarios leading to the lowest water demands for irrigation it is noted that under scenario 4 shown in fig 5 d the total irrigation water is smallest when the release is 0 3 m3 s in this case only 9 blocks are irrigated this is also the smallest irrigated area associated to the least initial water level in the reservoir amongst all scenarios 3 2 optimized irrigation schedule detailed irrigation schedule for 12 blocks under 2 most extreme selected scenarios i e initial reservoir storage of 100 and 70 are exemplarily shown in fig 6 the optimization model provides the timetable day for staggered irrigation for every block and its associated irrigation technology tech under different water releases the irrigation scheduling differs among the water release rates from 0 3 1 0 m3 s in scenario 1 fig 6a for instance with a rate of 0 3 m3 s block 3 of area 2 starts the first irrigation on the first day using cf followed by block 2 of area 3 on day 2 and also applied cf practice block 2 in area 2 starts its first irrigation latest on day 15 and irrigated with awd under water release of 1 0 m3 s two blocks block 3 area 1 and block 1 area 2 start their first irrigation at the same time day 5 and applied the same practice awd three blocks blocks 1 and 2 of area 1 and block 2 of area 3 are irrigated on the day 11 in this scenario at discharge releases of equal or less than 0 5 m3 s it is found that all blocks are irrigated on different days this finding is similar for other scenarios indicating that maximum water release of more than 0 5 m3 s are required to irrigate more than one block at the same time in the second scenario 4 fig 6b it is found that under water releases of 0 9 and 1 0 m3 s all irrigated blocks 10 are irrigated at the 4 last consecutive days of 15 days and the awd technology is applied for all these blocks this is probably because that the initial water and inflow to the reservoir is insufficient to apply awd practice before day 12 likewise as fig 5 it is shown that the number of irrigated blocks decreases with decreasing initial reservoir level regarding irrigation water input table 2 exhibits the mean irrigation water required for one block by applying either awd or cf under different scenarios there is a slight difference in irrigation water input between awd and cf the range of total irrigation water for one block ranges between 0 145 to 0 147 mm3 for awd and 0 151 to 0 157 mm3 for cf on average the irrigation water allocated for one block by awd and cf is about 0 145 mm3 and 0 154 mm3 respectively in general awd is more water efficient than cf with water saving ranges from 4 to 10 depending on scenarios in terms of irrigation events the number of irrigation times by awd in all considered scenarios is considerably less than that of cf the average number of irrigation events by awd and cf for one block during entire cropping season is 12 and 21 respectively table 3 3 3 optimization procedure fig 7 exemplarily shows the values obtained by the objective function of the mip optimization problem against the number of iterations for scenario 1 under water release of 1 0 m3 s it can be seen that the values of the objective function solid line are increasing with increasing number of iterations the stepwise increases in the function values indicate the iterations when a new solution is found after a solution is found the solver checks if this solution is better than the currently best known integer solution the dashed line is indicating the optimality gap in between the possible best and current best known solutions this line is decreasing as the gap is becoming smaller the gap becomes zero when the current best known solution equals the best possible solution 3 4 robustness of optimization results on different computer architectures in this study the latest gams version 24 7 3 with latest cplex 12 6 3 0 running in 64 bit mode are employed to run on different platforms 1 on a pc with windows os i7 with 8 cores x2 6 ghz a mac i7 with 2 cores 2 8 ghz and a linux cluster using an ivy cpu unit intel xenon with 12 cores 2 8 ghz in order to establish comparability two cores threads are used on each system fig 8 top shows the optimal results for scenario 1 performed on the different platforms it can be seen that there are slight differences in the maximum number of blocks applied awd and cf the largest number of blocks irrigated by awd is 11 on the pc and the mac it is only 10 on the linux cluster while the largest numbers of cf are 10 9 and 8 for mac linux cluster and windows pc respectively overall the tendencies of the optimization results between awd and cf are similar for the different computer architectures i e increased awd and decreased cf with increased reservoir releases the only exception occurs for the selected reservoir release of 0 7 m3 s where there is a significant difference between the pc on the one hand and the mac and linux cluster on the other hand fig 8 bottom this is possible due to the dynamic optimality for the mip optimization despite of the same total number of irrigated blocks 12 on three computer architectures there are 6 blocks for awd and 6 for cf on the pc while the numbers are 10 awd and 2 cf on both the linux cluster and the mac such a performance variability for mip problems using the same model and the same solver are well known in computer engineering e g koch et al 2011 but only rarely considered and discussed in applications klotz and newman 2013 potential reasons comprise the imperfect tie breaking when solving a mip i e the selections of the best solution which may be made arbitrarily based on the order in which the best solutions are considered or influenced by rounding errors this in combination with e g different compiler options depends on the platform koch et al 2011 4 discussion under different hypothesized initial water levels in the reservoir during the summer autumn cropping season in 2012 the model results predominantly suggest the usage of awd rather than cf our findings obtained for central vietnam are in line with other studies in southeast asia in which awd is found to be a technology which can save irrigation water e g lampayan et al 2015a b rahman 2014 it is found in this study that the application of awd potentially allows to irrigate more blocks in the que trung irrigation scheme but only if the discharge release of the reservoir is redesigned towards larger flow rates than the current one 0 3 m3 s the irrigation optimization model indicates that reservoir outflow rates of 0 5 m3 s are required to facilitate the adoption of awd the water use for irrigation is lower when more awd is applied this finally helps to save water for irrigation and to crop larger areas the entire rice cropping area can be irrigated only if the initial water storages of the reservoir are 100 and 90 of its capacity thus the reservoir size is well designed for the size of this irrigation scheme only 75 of the cropping area can be irrigated if the initial water in the reservoir is 70 and the given maximum water release this finding is in agreement with statements from the local agricultural authorities nguyen s 2015 personal communication thus we assume that the model reasonably represents the irrigation scheme in addition the model amount of irrigation water by cf for 1 ha summer autumn rice is comparable with the actual irrigation water running by local practices for que trung irrigation system which ranges from 10 000 to 12 000 m3 ha crop the irrigation water requirement total irrigation water for 1 ha of rice per summer autumn cropping season by both the cf and awd technologies is also in line with findings from a study of nguyen et al 2010 conducted for some areas in quang nam province central vietnam our results also reveal that total irrigation water for one block 12 ha by awd is less than that of cf indicating that the awd technology is more water efficient assuming the same rice yields based on cf and awd on average awd saves 6 water input compared to cf since there is no other actual irrigation data available for the que trung irrigation scheme to validate our modelling results we had to compare our results with similar studies across south east asia the water saving by awd compared to cf modelled in our study is less than the field study of lampayan et al 2015a for bangladesh and the philippines in this study the differences in total water input for rice between awd and cf range between 13 and 38 it is noted that such discrepancies are possible due to difference in soil properties climate conditions cultivation practices and cropping seasons by saving more irrigation water amount the awd practice could be a promising irrigation option in central vietnam that can eliminate the increasing irrigation water stress as a small reduction of water use for rice can free up large volumes of this vital resource for increasing rice production and other uses lampayan et al 2015a in terms of number of irrigation events the average number of irrigation events by awd is 12 and by cf is 21 respectively our analysis suggests that awd reduces the number of irrigation events approximately 43 as compared to cf thus costs induced by irrigation can be reduced if awd is applied properly in the region field studies and also modelling results have reported similar results when applying awd and cf for rice growing areas in the region such as liang et al 2016 for southern china lampayan et al 2015a for bangladesh the philippines and vietnam and rahman 2014 for bangladesh our model results are also in line with findings from hong et al 2015 conducted for the soc trang province in southern vietnam apart from suggested optimal irrigation technology our model goes one step further and provides information about the optimal area for cropping as well as irrigation schedules associated to each block this could be of crucial importance for agricultural managers to better plan their cropping preparations moreover we analyzed the optimization results for performance variability from different computer architectures since a performance variability for mip problems using the same model and the same solver are well known in computer engineering e g koch et al 2011 which may lead to non robust solutions and difficulties for decision support we found that test simulations showed similar tendencies and varied only slightly on the 3 computing environments giving confidence in the robustness of the model for decision support it is noted that only the hydrological model has been validated a quantitative validation of the irrigation model was not possible however we compared our modelling results in terms of water requirement for irrigation number and interval of irrigation events and irrigated area for cropping with research studies and data from central vietnam in particular but also for the southeast asian region in general 5 conclusions in this study a hydrological and an irrigation optimization model system has been developed to improve agricultural management strategies for a typical rice irrigation scheme in central vietnam the model is designed to account for water shortages occurring during the summer autumn season in this region the model provides staggered irrigation schedules for awd and cf for a typical rice irrigation system the model is found to be robust on different computing environments in conclusion the adoption of awd in the region potentially allows saving water compared to the prevailing cf during the summer autumn season given that the technical infrastructure allows e g reservoir capacity maximum reservoir release this study however is limited in the following aspects additional monetary e g labor and reservoir operation costs and environmental factors different global warming potentials of the cropping technologies are not included in the model thus a more detailed cost benefit analysis should be included in future studies the model was developed and tested for one cropping cycle 2012 the applicability with long term climate projections or seasonal climate forecasts will be beneficial for decision making i e for designing new irrigation schemes and for seasonal reservoir management despite of the aforementioned limitations this study focused on the development of the model and intended to lay a foundation for further studies aiming at the improvement of existing or the design of new irrigation systems in the region in the long run the model can potentially be transferred to similar irrigation schemes in the region and can potentially be applied in concert with both seasonal predictions and long term climate projections this study also stresses the need to conduct field experiments in central vietnam to validate the model system further under

11372,agriculture is the main consumer of freshwater in the world the paper described the process of virtual water content and flow in crops differences in climatic conditions of different regions in china result in large differences in water consumption during crop growth the virtual water trade in crops connects water flows within and between regions linking the actual water consumption with the invisible water trade as a whole the objective of the paper was supplying the agricultural products virtual water trade evaluation system determining quantitatively the virtual water flow within the region regional using meteorological and agricultural data from 2003 to 2010 a comprehensive analysis of china s domestic international virtual water trade of agricultural products has been undertaken the virtual water for the three primary crops and virtual water trade are discussed the virtual water content of grain crops in northern southern china was 1293 m3 t 942 m3 t respectively the national average value was 1117 m3 t and the regional differences in virtual water content for each crop were significant china s inter regional agricultural products virtual water trade was not consistent with water resource endowment expectations the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the sustainable utilization of water resources and would exacerbate water resources shortages in northern regions china had a trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products the exported agricultural products virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and the imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the net import of virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 it is further concluded that the trend for agricultural products total virtual water green water and blue water is that china is increasing its imports year on year a large increase in imports of agricultural products has led to a decline in the rate of self sufficiency in domestic agricultural production the paper provided the basis for the comprehensive evaluation of crop planting structure adjustment grain import export and the potential of regional water resources development and utilization keywords virtual water virtual water flow virtual water trade china 1 introduction the populations of most nations consume products of both domestic and foreign origin importing together with the products the water which is expended abroad for their production termed virtual water allan 1994 the scholar tony allan 1997 first proposed the concept of virtual water which was further extended by hoekstra 2003a b c to the currently recognized concept of virtual water the quantity of water needed to produce goods and services the related theory of virtual water has provided new ideas for solving the problem of water resources in china agricultural virtual water refers to the water consumed during the production of agricultural products including crops and livestock products the virtual water as non real water yield congealed in products and services is internalized in product in the form of virtual i e embedded water or exogenous water the virtual water is derived with the development of merchandise trade based on resource flow resource substitution and comparative advantage theory since the israeli economists stated the diseconomy to the development of high water consumption agriculture in water shortage countries regions in the 1980s the decision making guidance role of virtual water as countries regions to alleviate water resource shortages has been highlighted with the increasing globalization of commodity exchange trading hoekstra further expanded virtual water as the amount of water resources needed to produce commodities and services hoekstra and hung 2002 since 2002 the theories of virtual water have been internationally expanded while the quantitative calculation system has been gradually elaborated therefore for a region the smaller the total amount of virtual water for agricultural products means that the smaller the amount of agricultural water consumed the more water resources that can be used in other industries will be conducive to the increase of regional economic output value to understand the development trend of the total amount of virtual water for agricultural products in a region it is particularly important to find out the drivers of the change in the total amount of virtual water in agricultural products in mainland china research on virtual water and related theories at home and abroad is mainly focused on the issue of agricultural products especially food scholars from various countries have conducted in depth discussions on the driving factors of virtual water trade flow from the actual conditions of their own countries ma et al 2006 wang et al 2015 kumar and singh 2005 hoekstra 2003a b c the proposition of the concept of virtual water causes the diversion of the study on water resource issues from water entity to generalized water which promotes the system innovation of water resources and makes a second configuration of water resources come true and in the meantime it broadens the research field of water resources and lays a solid foundation for solving of regional water resource issues by employing the concept and method of macro water resources development system and has remarkably practical significance on the studies of rational allocation carrying capacity and efficient use of water resources in china virtual water flow represents the volume of water that is embedded in traded commodities chouchane et al 2018 water traded in this way is referred to as virtual water and constitutes a significant portion of global water consumption hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the flows of virtual water should be considered when designing national strategies regarding water and agriculture and when evaluating guidelines pertaining to international trade duarte et al 2014 shi et al 2014 zoumides et al 2014 virtual water trade in mainly agricultural products can be considered as a substitute for trade in freshwater or non virtual water the theory of comparative advantage suggests that if two countries have relative differences in production processes expressed as differences in opportunity costs there will be scope for trade that will benefit both countries wichelns 2010 the virtual water trade process may prove significant for improving global water use efficiency and alleviating pressure on local water resources goswami and nishad 2015 the development process of global virtual water trade is shown in fig 1 while the globalization of food trading and the digitization of metering system as the signs of the development of new water resources have greatly propelled the process of virtual water trade the concept of water footprint is similar to the concept of virtual water in many cases the water footprint of product and the virtual water contained in the product can be exchanged people often used the concept of water footprint when investigating the consumption of water resources by production and consumption activities in the region the concept of virtual water was often used when studying the consumption of water resources in cross regional consumption and trade lenzen 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 when product is exported its water footprint becomes virtual water trade or transfer to realize the water balance among different countries aldaya et al 2012 suggested water footprint should instead of virtual water for a product the concept of water footprint is defined for a product volume of freshwater appropriated to produce the product considering the volumes of water consumed and polluted in the different steps of the supply chain therefore we can determine the amount of water necessary to produce a series of products table 1 several authors began calculating the water foot prints of goods and services a few years after the notion of virtual water was introduced with the goal of describing the direct and indirect water use by consumers and producers hoekstra et al 2011 ercin and hoekstra 2014 brindha 2017 the water footprint of virtual water consumption and trades are interrelated relationship which is illustrated in fig 2 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the water footprint relates virtual water with the actual water consumption of human beings truly reflecting the demand for and occupancy of water resources by the population and the degree of human pressures on water resources systems in the field of water footprint assessment with most studies carried out at the watershed national and global level application at the urban level is at its infancy yu et al 2010 developed a regional input output model to assess domestic water footprint for various consumption categories for the southeast and the northeast of england paterson et al 2015 provide the first review of research on the water footprint of cities and a range of methods for estimating the water footprint of consumption is being used rushforth and ruddell 2015 quantify the water footprint of the phoenix metropolitan area in arizona contributing methodologically by calculating intra metropolitan areavirtual water flows using commodity and labor flows de miguel et al 2015a considers water footprint at the river basin level by considering the sustainability of the water footprint of crop production in the duero river basin in spain the various countries in the world are not entirely equal in virtual water trading the virtual water strategy refers to the purchase of water intensive products from the water enriched countries regions by the water shortage countries regions by way of trade which is to guarantee water and food security water withdrawals for irrigation are limited by water scarcity in major river basins from mexico to north africa west asia central asia and north china brown et al 2009 it is widely agreed that virtual water trade as a strategy is likely to play a more prominent role in the future in global food production measuring virtual water is a useful concept in assessing water management as it permits the comparison of crops and livestock from the perspective of embedded to evaluate trade offs in water allocation in countries like canada with large regional variability in climate virtual water should be calculated on a watershed scale european environment agency 2012 china has one of the most intensive agricultural systems in the world and is a major importer of virtual water in the form of meat schmidt and benítez sanz 2012 the global virtual water trade evaluation lists the usa australia and canada as the largest virtual water exporters in the world while japan the netherlands south korea and china are the largest virtual water importers lamastra et al 2017 countries that have additional capacity to produce food usa canada brazil and argentina will likely increase their virtual water exports particularly in the form of meat which is more water demanding than grains this paper is structured as illustrated below we first provide an overview and comprehensive analysis of the virtual water trade water footprint and virtual water strategy following the recent literature section 2 details our accounting approach and the virtual water data that we use section 3 present a case study and discuss the results finally we present our conclusions and comments on the issue 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the study region contains 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland china but doesn t include hong kong macao and taiwan the study region is divided into two primary regions and eight sub regions in accordance with geographical location climatic conditions and agricultural production conditions the

and an earth system science data sharing platform the figure information is public 2 2 methods the consumption of goods and services often creates stress on the water resources of production sites empirical studies suggest that a range of economic hydro climatic and political factors is important for the occurrence of conflicts over water ye et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 the potential for conflict is decreased by virtual water trade if the water abundant country uses a sufficiently small share of the resource ansink 2010 the virtual water trade import export was calculated as the food trade volume t yr times its virtual water content m3 t the virtual water content of an agricultural product m3 t is estimated from the volume of water used during the crop s growth period m3 hm2 called the crop water requirement hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 the volume of water used by a crop has two components green water and blue water the use of green water in agriculture is related to more sustainable practices than the use of blue water aldaya et al 2008 there are two widely accepted categories of methodology for virtual water accounting the down top approach works well when providing detailed and separate virtual water information of specific goods such as rice meat or even t shirt vanham and bidoglio 2013 as item by item approach the first step is to collect the data of all the individual goods or services that are consumed by the given region or population then the virtual water is obtained by the summation of all the multiplication of the consumed goods and services by their respective virtual water intensities hoekstra 2009 the virtual water content of crop products is the key to measure virtual water the calculation method for the virtual water content of primary crops is limited by inferior territorial ratione materiae reproducibility and comparability the virtual water content of non water intensive products was calculated in line with the balanced nutrition rule in general the steps to calculate the virtual water trade import export for the major grain crops are shown in fig 4 grey water footprint is a method of quantitatively describing the state of water environment pollution hoekstra 2003a b c first proposed its concept in 2002 which is defined as the amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants loading to the maximum concentration allowed by the standard based on a certain water quality standard the grey water footprint considers that the same water body can dilute different pollutants the grey water footprint quantitatively shows the impact of water pollution on the quantity of water resources and provides a new method for the sustainable study of water resources research on the gray water footprint is still at the primary stage at present research abroad mainly focuses on the calculation and analysis of gray water footprints of industrial and agricultural products calculation and analysis of gray water footprints in national regions or watershed and evaluation of water resources sustainability based on grey water footprint measurement et al mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 vanham and bidoglio 2014 chapagain and hoekstra 2011 ercin and hoekstra 2014 the study of greywater footprint domestic is mainly about the study and application of abroad research methods based on the gray water footprint theory the study of effective assessment of regional real water pollution remains to be further discussed in the future therefore the paper only calculated the blue and green water footprint 2 2 1 virtual water flow the basic estimate of water embodied in external trade is to multiply the import and export trade figures and the corresponding water intensity coefficients the imported virtual water iw is the sum of virtual water embodied in imported goods iwg and imported services iws chen and li 2015 the iw can be calculated as 1 i w i w g i w s i j m i j n i j where mij is the imported item i from j country region nij is the corresponding virtual water intensity of import i from j country region the exported virtual water ew can be calculated by virtual water embodied in exported goods ewg and exported services ews lamastra et al 2017 the ew can be calculated as 2 e w e w g e w s k m k n k where mk represent the export k and nk is the corresponding virtual water content of k the virtual water is computed using eq 3 3 v w i w e w 2 2 2 volume of virtual water this paragraph provided a more detailed calculation process to evaluate the virtual water volume embedded in food trade between different regions under a rain fed scenario green water is equal to the total virtual water of the crop sun et al 2013 the per unit water value virtual water content which refers to the value per unit water value was calculated for the analysis of virtual water strategy shao et al 2017 the virtual water content is used as the reference value for the tracking of water movement across international boundaries in the agricultural and industry product trades the virtual water content of primary crops can be calculated according to the methodology as follows hoekstra and hung 2002 4 v w c w r c y c where vwc is the virtual water content of the primary crop m3 t wrc is the crop water requirement m3 ha yc is the crop yield per unit area t ha the wrc is the evapotranspiration etc mm d over the crop growing period hoekstra and hung 2002 5 w r c 10 d 1 l p e t c where factor 10 is intended to convert water depth into water volume per land surface 1mm m3 ha lp is the number of days throughout the growing season d the evapotranspiration etc over the crop growing period mm is calculated as follows 6 e t c e t 0 k c where kc is the crop coefficient et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm the et 0 is calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation as follows 7 e t 0 δ r n g ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where rn is the net radiation

saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship γ is the psychrometric constant and rs and ra are the bulk surface and aerodynamic resistances the values for green and blue water in virtual water are calculated by computing the accumulation of daily evapotranspiration over the crop growing period ercin et al 2013 the virtual water flow related to crop water requirement wrcg wrcb can be calculated as follows 8 v w c g w r c g y c 10 e t g y c v w c b w r c b y c 10 e t b y c where vwcg and vwcb are the green and blue components of virtual water content for a crop m3 t respectively wrcg and wrcb are green and blue water consumption over the crop growing period m3 ha etg and etb are green and blue water evapotranspiration over the crop growing period mm etg and etb during the crop growing period can be estimated using the fao s equation hoekstra et al 2011 9 e t g min e t c p e e t b max 0 e t c p e where pe is the effective rainfall over the crop growing period mm understanding the pattern of china s virtual water trade and exploring virtual water policy is one of the important ways to achieve optimal allocation of water resources it can provide a new perspective for china to ease water conflicts and solve the water crisis we estimated the international trade volume of virtual water 1 calculating the overall international trade volume of virtual water according to the data of china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 we obtained grain import and export volume in the international trade of grain in the past 8 years in china we calculated the virtual water content of the three crops rice wheat and maize and their import and export volume and obtained the import and export trade volume of virtual water 2 virtual water trade of unit crops rice wheat and maize in international trade according to the data of china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 we obtained the number of imports and exports of a certain crop in the international trade of grain in china in the past 8 years the unit virtual water content of a certain crop was multiplied by its import and export volume to obtain the corresponding virtual water imports exports and net imports 2 3 data climate data were taken from the climwat database which were available from www fao org nr water infores databases climwat html the data include monthly average maximum temperature monthly average minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and precipitation from 2003 2010 we obtained the data from china meteorological administration as well as the provinces autonomous regions and municipalities bureau of meteorology agricultural data includes farmland area agricultural inputs fertilizers pesticides agricultural machinery etc irrigation data and crop yield which were taken from the china statistical yearbook and chinese agricultural statistics data et al we got agricultural inputs data from the china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 and china rural statistics yearbook 2004 2011 the irrigation data were obtained from china water resources bulletin 2003 2011 and yearbook of china water resources 2004 2011 the crop yield and farmland area come from china rural statistics yearbook 2004 2011 virtual water trade data were obtained from the faostat database http faostat fao org site 406 default aspx we reconstructed 8 years 2003 2010 of international global trade data for 32 crops and animal products the food trade data for each commodity were converted into virtual water trade values hoekstra et al 2011 3 results and discussion although there are many quantification studies on virtual water there are still some problems in its calculation methods as for the virtual water content of agricultural products many researches lacked relevant meteorological data and water data and the experimental equipment and technical conditions for measuring crop water requirements were relatively backward therefore in practice many years average values or common reference values were often used yang et al 2015 however due to the spatial and temporal differences in climate the degree of dryness and humidity in different regions and different years was different even if the water demand of the same type of crop was different the virtual water content of the calculated agricultural product may have large errors from the perspective of the virtual water change mechanism analysis method the current method is not strict enough to identify virtual water change factors in most studies water use efficiency industrial structure and production scale are selected as the main factors for analysis too few factors cause the decomposition analysis to be too simple and general which has limited significance for the practical work of guiding the virtual water strategy due to the lack of trade statistics a large number of product trades between regions were estimated through historical data or economic models rather than actual surveys which directly leaded to the deviations in the calculation of total virtual water 3 1 virtual water of different crops the virtual water content doesn t depend on the actual condition of crop growth except the climate condition there is less related to the state of irrigation seed agriculture technology and so on the virtual water content of crop crops is in correlation with the crop quality water consumption quota yield geographical conditions of growth conversion efficiency of products in different regions differences of water and cultivated land resources led to differences in grain production and water use between regions sun et al 2016 the matching of the geographical distribution of the virtual farmland of agricultural products in china and the economic and economic elements of each resource is not high this paper analyzed the virtual water of china s primary agricultural product trade the main goal is to find out the volume of virtual water trade in different regions in china and calculate the value of the virtual water import and export in agricultural trade with other countries in the future to effectively use the international market to solve the problem of water resources shortage we use grain production and water use for grain production in mainland china to calculate the water requirement water resources content of different crops the range and average value of water resources content of major crop is given in table 2 in china rice wheat and maize are the three major crops and the rice has the largest cultivated area based on our calculation water resources content for rice is about 4440 m3 ha and the percolation for rice ranges from 2300 m3 ha to 6670 m3 ha zhang et al 2016 therefore the national average of 8000 m3 ha was used as the water resources content of rice in china owing to the differences in climatic condition crop yields and crop management between regions the regional differences of virtual water content for the same crop were significant the average virtual water content 2003 2010 was calculated by dividing the crop water resources content with the average crop yield during this period wrcg wrcb annual virtual water content was used for calculating virtual water trade in the corresponding year table 3 shows the green and blue virtual water content of major three crops in each region the highest value and lowest value of wheat virtual water content was 2303 1438 m3 t respectively the national average virtual water content of wheat rice and maize were as follows wheat 1307 m3 t rice 1604 m3 t and maize 1061 m3 t these results are approximately consistent with the results of former studies sun et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which were wheat 1071 m3 t rice 1294 m3 t and maize 830 m3 t the virtual water content of grain crops in the northern and southern china was 1293 m3 t and 942 m3 t respectively the national average value was 1117 m3 t and shows that the regional differences of virtual water content for crop were significant taking wheat as an example the virtual water content of wheat was relatively low in huang huai hai region parts of the south china which were less than 1000 m3 t the high values of virtual water content for wheat were mainly distributed in northeast china the north china and part of northwest china and were more than 2000 m3 t the virtual water content of maize was between 850 and 1342 m3 t and the spatial distribution was slightly different from that of wheat as rice production needs more water and heat the high values of virtual water content for rice located in the south china and north china in the west of inner mongolia which were more than 1400 m3 t the vwcg proportion for wheat maize and rice was increased gradually from northern to southern regions 3 2 virtual water trade 3 2 1 transfer between regions in china water scarcity has become an increasingly pressing constraint to agricultural production in china there is a mismatch between the distribution of water and the cultivated land resources in china water resources in southern china account for more than 80 of china s total water resources however while cultivated land is mainly in the northern regions wang et al 2014 we analyzed according to the information provided by the china national grain and oil information center the export regions of wheat were mainly located in huang huaihai region northwest and southwest china the north china northeast china huang huai hai region northwest china and southwest china were the main output regions of maize and the surplus regions of rice were distributed in northeast china the middle and lower yangtze river region and southwest china based on the calculation results of virtual water content for wheat maize and rice combining with the grain trade data among different regions in china the transfer of virtual water flows was given in table 4 the calculation results are like the literature sun et al 2013 2016 northeast china huang huai hai region and northwest china are the major grain production regions as well as the major virtual water export regions the virtual water content output from the three regions accounts for nearly 85 of the total virtual water content output from the grain export regions the virtual water outflow with grain export is 24 07 108m3 in the northeast and 15 44 108m3 in the huang huai hai regions the southeast china south china and north china regions are the major grain virtual water content import regions which were 19 48 108 19 13 108 and 11 12 108 m3 respectively the virtual water content reaches 49 73 108 m3 above three regions the virtual water content import of southeast china south china and north china were 19 78 108 19 42 108 and 11 29 108 m3 respectively sun et al 2013 the growth of maize mainly relies on green water therefore the average green water proportion of virtual water content for maize was the highest about 68 78 followed by rice and wheat precipitation is concentrated mostly in summer and autumn and maize need a large quantity of water to grow during the period therefore the green water proportion in maize virtual water content was higher china s inter regional virtual water trade is not consistent with water resource endowments expectations the relatively abundant water resources in south china do not become a comparative advantage in terms of producing water intensive products to trade with other regions in china antonelli et al 2017 uneven economic development across regions is an important factor as east coastal regions are the most developed areas in china they depend heavily on raw materials for production and food and export less water intensive and high value added products and services to other regions the spatial distribution of water intensive production activities is determined by multiple production factors therefore the uneven distribution of land and water resources and irrational planting pattern structure of regional crops would consume large quantities of water and put pressure on water resources of northern regions thus the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the water resources sustainable utilization and exacerbate the situation of water resources shortage in northern regions 3 2 2 transfer between nations in the world the research object of virtual water accounting could be either the virtual water contained in an intermediate product or final product in the production chain or the virtual water contained in all products consumed or produced by consumers or producers different virtual water concepts have corresponding virtual water accounting methods therefore the virtual water content in different spatial scale such as industrial parks watersheds regions administrative regions countries or the world and time scales is different the virtual water content of each crop imports is not as same as in china however in order to compare the calculated results we used the same value for the virtual water content of the same crop the virtual water calculation method adopted in this paper mainly considered direct water use in agricultural production and ignored the virtual water of intermediate products products supplied to other producers in the industrial chain hoekstra et al 2011 since the amount of water used by agriculture itself was much greater than the amount of water used by these intermediate products research on agricultural virtual water could virtually ignore the virtual water of intermediate products most of the international virtual water trade relates to trade in food the virtual water balance can lead to the export and import data of water by country there are many developed countries that import more virtual water than they export even if they are typically in water balance surplus or exporting countries in conventional hydrological terms there are also countries conventionally viewed as water scarce where there is net virtual water export hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 agriculture accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawals and 85 of consumptions worldwide chapagain and hoekstra estimated that 895 billion m3 yr are transferred inter regionally ercin et al 2013 this compares with world annual water withdrawals and consumption of 4430 billion m3 and 2304 billion m3 respectively and annual desalination of 0 017 billion m3 international desalination association 2011 the increasing focus on interactions between water land food and climate leads to a call to consider water land carbon and other footprints more coherently and put the different footprints in the context of local regional or global planetary boundaries hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 fang et al 2015 have taken up the challenge to connect the environmental footprint literature to the planetary boundaries literature in a comprehensive study putting the carbon water and land footprints of 28 selected nations in the context of allocated planetary boundaries by analyzing the virtual water balance among different countries total virtual water import and export at the scale of the globe balanced to zero in the world water exporters are the usa south america india and australia the importers are western europe north africa japan mexico and the middle east the virtual water trade in the world has increased considerably over time and high value exports is beneficial for low income countries from a regional economic water efficiency perspective clark et al 2015 jackson et al 2015 many studies have attempted to quantify the link between china s wto accession and agricultural outcomes comparative advantage in agriculture will lead china to increase the export of labor intensive products and the import of land intensive products liao et al 2008 the community structure of virtual water trade also reflects some of the trade partnerships resulting from political alliances and that some of the changes associated with political events considering both water resource constraints and political considerations a more plausible scenario is that china will increase imports of wheat and maize while exporting vegetables on the base of analyzing china s international virtual water flows of agricultural products trade from 2003 to 2010 china was trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products the exported virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the exported imported virtual water flows of china from 2003 to 2010 was shown in table 5 due to the different opportunity costs and impacts of the green and blue water footprints the water footprint in the global virtual water trade and product production process should be calculated separately the green and blue water footprint of crop products was mainly calculated by formulas 8 9 based on crop water requirement growth period precipitation and irrigation water volume using cropwat model estimation or field test data under drought conditions the evapotranspiration of blue water within the crop growth period is 0 mm and the actual water consumption etc of the crop is the green water evapotranspiration etg mm the water consumption in the facility is the blue water evapotranspiration the amount of blue water evapotranspiration can be calculated based on the principle of soil water balance in the facility different countries or regions have great differences in terms of geography climate production technology and production therefore the estimation of the average global water footprint of agricultural products is difficult to truly reflect the actual situation in different countries or regions for example the water footprint of spanish pork production and processing is 19 5 billion m3 yr the green water blue water and gray water footprints account for 82 8 and 10 respectively de miguel et al 2015b the calculation method and calculation results for the global average water footprint is obviously different in the lack of detailed spatial geography and other information as well as the results of the global scale water footprint literature study cannot accurately reflect the changes in the global water footprint to reduce the uncertainty of the calculation results we used the same virtual water content between china s grain and the imported grain at present china has played an important role in the field of global water resources the agricultural products virtual water that china exported to the world was 50 billion m3 and 24 billion m3 in 2003 and 2013 the agricultural products virtual water total amount was 252 billion m3 the average was 31 5 billion m3 yr approximately 73 4 green water 26 6 blue water the total virtual water green water blue water china exported per year were on the decline the main exported virtual water was from crop products approximately 89 of the total and livestock products accounted for 11 zhang et al 2016 virtual water flows of china mainly exported to northeast asia and southeast asia accounting for 30 and 20 of total exported virtual water china plays a more important role in the world trade market and imports more virtual water every year the agricultural products virtual water that china imported from the world was 90 billion m3 and 210 billion m3 in 2001 and 2013 the agricultural products virtual water total amount was 1160 billion m3 from 2003 to 2010 the average was 145 billion m3 yr approximately 91 green water 9 blue water green water was the most important water resource in agricultural production the tendency of total virtual water green water blue water and gray water that china imported per year were on the rising the massive imports of agricultural products led to the decline of self sufficiency rate of domestic agricultural products the agricultural products virtual water flows of china mainly imported from america and southeast asia accounting for 60 and 20 of total exported virtual water imported virtual water flows of china was relative concentration the net import of virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 compared to water consumption in 2010 318 22 billion m3 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2011 the net import in 2010 accounted for 56 net import of virtual water was in a rising trend for the virtual water trade with other countries china is basically in a state of surplus therefore virtual water water footprint are two closely inter connected activities it becomes an opportunity to realize the liberalization of international commerce from 2003 to 2010 the agricultural products virtual water trade in china s grain international trade has been maintaining a large deficit in 8 years the cumulative net imported virtual water through grain international trade is 573 63 billion m3 which is equivalent to saving the same amount of grain production water consumption which effectively relieved the contradiction of water shortage in china at the practical application level the calculation of the virtual water content of a specific product is an important content of virtual water research in the world in recent years at present the virtual water accounting of the global agriculture forestry animal products and its derivatives has been relatively perfect and the virtual water content for some industrial products and tertiary industry services have also been studied from the point of virtual water calculation method for industrial and tertiary industries the calculation of the virtual water content involved in the production process is a complicated process the differences in production technology production scale and production environment all caused the inaccurate of virtual water calculation therefore even if the distribution of virtual water in the products and services of various industries and tertiary industries was avoided or omitted or repeated the result of the calculation may also have large errors future research should continue to improve the accuracy of calculation methods and enrich the types of factors considered in order to obtain more accurate virtual water accounting results china us south asia and india are the most important countries in the international virtual water trade hoekstra s study found that north america south america and australia are the main agricultural production virtual water resources outflow regions while africa east asia and europe are the main virtual water inflow regions fracasso 2014 used the gravitational model to study the virtual water trade in 145 countries and considered that the flow of virtual water was affected by the country s trade level the endowment of water resources water pressure and other factors the virtual water import from agricultural production is increasing in china from 2003 china s agricultural virtual water trade shows china is the net importer of agricultural production virtual water china did not use the whole import virtual water for local consumption and used a part of to supply the manufacturing industry as an intermediate input china s manufacturing industry is in a net export state and in 2003 2007 net exports of virtual water accelerated year by year however since 2008 the net exports of virtual water from the manufacturing industry have fallen while agriculture was still accelerating its net imports as a result the net imports of virtual water from agricultural production continued to rise although agriculture is a major consumer of water in the national economy the importance of agricultural production is self evident because of the needs of the national life and the raw materials for industrial products therefore the virtual water net import status of agriculture can not only satisfy china s huge demand for agricultural products but also save a large amount of domestic water resources the virtual water export of united states is increasing from 2003 despite its large water footprint per capita 1688 m3 yr the u s is the leading net virtual water exporting country 5 billion m3 but this mask interstate flows of 191 billion m3 per year of virtual water larger than withdrawals in many states virtual water flows are large compared to total water withdrawals evapotranspiration from rain fed crops or total water footprint in nearly every state with several eastern states importing roughly half their water footprint and some midwestern states exporting more virtual water than they withdraw or consume domestically mubako and lant 2013 4 conclusions as a new water source conception for the 21st century agricultural virtual water has become the strategic decision to solve the global water resources and crop security issues on the base of analyzing the virtual water trade water footprint and virtual water strategy following the recent literature the paper details our accounting approach and the virtual water data that we use the virtual water calculation includes virtual water flow and virtual water volume the virtual water of different crops and virtual water trade were discussion the virtual water content of grain crops in the northern and southern china was 1293 m3 t and 942 m3 t from 2003 to 2010 the national average value was 1117 m3 t the regional differences of virtual water content for crop were significant china s inter regional virtual water trade is not consistent with water resource endowments expectations the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the water resources sustainable utilization and exacerbate the situation of water resources shortage in northern regions china was trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products from 2003 to 2010 the exported agricultural products virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the net import of agricultural products virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 net import of agricultural products virtual water was in a rising trend the paper supplied a comprehensive analysis of china s domestic and international agricultural products virtual water trade of agricultural products the structure of calculating interregional and international agricultural products virtual water flows and changes was feasible however the subjects were highly concentrated on several trade partners and agricultural products while the virtual water trade of agricultural products in china has received more attention the studies on the international trade need to be enriched in the future the paper used virtual water strategy analysis to optimize the agricultural water use structure analyzed the current direction of virtual water changes in various agricultural production based on driving factors and reduced the consumption of local water resources based on the results we obtained policy implications and provided new thinking for china s water resources management regional development and ecological security the introduction of water management methods that integrating physical water and virtual water and the establishment of a virtual water compensation mechanism to coordinate regional development maintain the ecological security of the balance between green water and blue water south asia and india mainly focuses on the qualitative research on the role of virtual water and virtual farmland few scholars quantitatively analyzed the value of international virtual resource flows combining the virtual water and virtual cultivated land research the analysis of the economic benefits generated by the flow of virtual resources between regions is the key direction for future research

11372,agriculture is the main consumer of freshwater in the world the paper described the process of virtual water content and flow in crops differences in climatic conditions of different regions in china result in large differences in water consumption during crop growth the virtual water trade in crops connects water flows within and between regions linking the actual water consumption with the invisible water trade as a whole the objective of the paper was supplying the agricultural products virtual water trade evaluation system determining quantitatively the virtual water flow within the region regional using meteorological and agricultural data from 2003 to 2010 a comprehensive analysis of china s domestic international virtual water trade of agricultural products has been undertaken the virtual water for the three primary crops and virtual water trade are discussed the virtual water content of grain crops in northern southern china was 1293 m3 t 942 m3 t respectively the national average value was 1117 m3 t and the regional differences in virtual water content for each crop were significant china s inter regional agricultural products virtual water trade was not consistent with water resource endowment expectations the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the sustainable utilization of water resources and would exacerbate water resources shortages in northern regions china had a trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products the exported agricultural products virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and the imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the net import of virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 it is further concluded that the trend for agricultural products total virtual water green water and blue water is that china is increasing its imports year on year a large increase in imports of agricultural products has led to a decline in the rate of self sufficiency in domestic agricultural production the paper provided the basis for the comprehensive evaluation of crop planting structure adjustment grain import export and the potential of regional water resources development and utilization keywords virtual water virtual water flow virtual water trade china 1 introduction the populations of most nations consume products of both domestic and foreign origin importing together with the products the water which is expended abroad for their production termed virtual water allan 1994 the scholar tony allan 1997 first proposed the concept of virtual water which was further extended by hoekstra 2003a b c to the currently recognized concept of virtual water the quantity of water needed to produce goods and services the related theory of virtual water has provided new ideas for solving the problem of water resources in china agricultural virtual water refers to the water consumed during the production of agricultural products including crops and livestock products the virtual water as non real water yield congealed in products and services is internalized in product in the form of virtual i e embedded water or exogenous water the virtual water is derived with the development of merchandise trade based on resource flow resource substitution and comparative advantage theory since the israeli economists stated the diseconomy to the development of high water consumption agriculture in water shortage countries regions in the 1980s the decision making guidance role of virtual water as countries regions to alleviate water resource shortages has been highlighted with the increasing globalization of commodity exchange trading hoekstra further expanded virtual water as the amount of water resources needed to produce commodities and services hoekstra and hung 2002 since 2002 the theories of virtual water have been internationally expanded while the quantitative calculation system has been gradually elaborated therefore for a region the smaller the total amount of virtual water for agricultural products means that the smaller the amount of agricultural water consumed the more water resources that can be used in other industries will be conducive to the increase of regional economic output value to understand the development trend of the total amount of virtual water for agricultural products in a region it is particularly important to find out the drivers of the change in the total amount of virtual water in agricultural products in mainland china research on virtual water and related theories at home and abroad is mainly focused on the issue of agricultural products especially food scholars from various countries have conducted in depth discussions on the driving factors of virtual water trade flow from the actual conditions of their own countries ma et al 2006 wang et al 2015 kumar and singh 2005 hoekstra 2003a b c the proposition of the concept of virtual water causes the diversion of the study on water resource issues from water entity to generalized water which promotes the system innovation of water resources and makes a second configuration of water resources come true and in the meantime it broadens the research field of water resources and lays a solid foundation for solving of regional water resource issues by employing the concept and method of macro water resources development system and has remarkably practical significance on the studies of rational allocation carrying capacity and efficient use of water resources in china virtual water flow represents the volume of water that is embedded in traded commodities chouchane et al 2018 water traded in this way is referred to as virtual water and constitutes a significant portion of global water consumption hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the flows of virtual water should be considered when designing national strategies regarding water and agriculture and when evaluating guidelines pertaining to international trade duarte et al 2014 shi et al 2014 zoumides et al 2014 virtual water trade in mainly agricultural products can be considered as a substitute for trade in freshwater or non virtual water the theory of comparative advantage suggests that if two countries have relative differences in production processes expressed as differences in opportunity costs there will be scope for trade that will benefit both countries wichelns 2010 the virtual water trade process may prove significant for improving global water use efficiency and alleviating pressure on local water resources goswami and nishad 2015 the development process of global virtual water trade is shown in fig 1 while the globalization of food trading and the digitization of metering system as the signs of the development of new water resources have greatly propelled the process of virtual water trade the concept of water footprint is similar to the concept of virtual water in many cases the water footprint of product and the virtual water contained in the product can be exchanged people often used the concept of water footprint when investigating the consumption of water resources by production and consumption activities in the region the concept of virtual water was often used when studying the consumption of water resources in cross regional consumption and trade lenzen 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 when product is exported its water footprint becomes virtual water trade or transfer to realize the water balance among different countries aldaya et al 2012 suggested water footprint should instead of virtual water for a product the concept of water footprint is defined for a product volume of freshwater appropriated to produce the product considering the volumes of water consumed and polluted in the different steps of the supply chain therefore we can determine the amount of water necessary to produce a series of products table 1 several authors began calculating the water foot prints of goods and services a few years after the notion of virtual water was introduced with the goal of describing the direct and indirect water use by consumers and producers hoekstra et al 2011 ercin and hoekstra 2014 brindha 2017 the water footprint of virtual water consumption and trades are interrelated relationship which is illustrated in fig 2 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the water footprint relates virtual water with the actual water consumption of human beings truly reflecting the demand for and occupancy of water resources by the population and the degree of human pressures on water resources systems in the field of water footprint assessment with most studies carried out at the watershed national and global level application at the urban level is at its infancy yu et al 2010 developed a regional input output model to assess domestic water footprint for various consumption categories for the southeast and the northeast of england paterson et al 2015 provide the first review of research on the water footprint of cities and a range of methods for estimating the water footprint of consumption is being used rushforth and ruddell 2015 quantify the water footprint of the phoenix metropolitan area in arizona contributing methodologically by calculating intra metropolitan areavirtual water flows using commodity and labor flows de miguel et al 2015a considers water footprint at the river basin level by considering the sustainability of the water footprint of crop production in the duero river basin in spain the various countries in the world are not entirely equal in virtual water trading the virtual water strategy refers to the purchase of water intensive products from the water enriched countries regions by the water shortage countries regions by way of trade which is to guarantee water and food security water withdrawals for irrigation are limited by water scarcity in major river basins from mexico to north africa west asia central asia and north china brown et al 2009 it is widely agreed that virtual water trade as a strategy is likely to play a more prominent role in the future in global food production measuring virtual water is a useful concept in assessing water management as it permits the comparison of crops and livestock from the perspective of embedded to evaluate trade offs in water allocation in countries like canada with large regional variability in climate virtual water should be calculated on a watershed scale european environment agency 2012 china has one of the most intensive agricultural systems in the world and is a major importer of virtual water in the form of meat schmidt and benítez sanz 2012 the global virtual water trade evaluation lists the usa australia and canada as the largest virtual water exporters in the world while japan the netherlands south korea and china are the largest virtual water importers lamastra et al 2017 countries that have additional capacity to produce food usa canada brazil and argentina will likely increase their virtual water exports particularly in the form of meat which is more water demanding than grains this paper is structured as illustrated below we first provide an overview and comprehensive analysis of the virtual water trade water footprint and virtual water strategy following the recent literature section 2 details our accounting approach and the virtual water data that we use section 3 present a case study and discuss the results finally we present our conclusions and comments on the issue 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the study region contains 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland china but doesn t include hong kong macao and taiwan the study region is divided into two primary regions and eight sub regions in accordance with geographical location climatic conditions and agricultural production conditions the eight sub regions are north china northeast china huang huai hai region northwest china southeast china the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river south china and southwest china ma et al 2006 1 the north china contains beijing city tianjin city and shanxi province 2 the northeast china contains heilongjiang jilin liaoning province and inner mongolia autonomous region 3 the huang huai hai region contains hebei henan shandong and anhui province 4 the northwest china contains shaanxi gansu qinghai province the ningxia hui autonomous region and the xinjiang uygur autonomous region 5 the southeast china includes shanghai city zhejiang and fujian province 6 the middle and lower yangtze river region includes jiangsu hubei hunan and jiangxi province 7 the south china includes guangdong province hainan province and guangxi zhuang autonomous region 8 the southwest china includes chongqing city sichuan guizhou yunnan province and the tibet autonomous region fig 3 the northern region includes the region from 1 to 4 the southern region includes the region from 5 to 8 the figure has been supplied by www geodata cn which is a national science and technology basic conditions platform and an earth system science data sharing platform the figure information is public 2 2 methods the consumption of goods and services often creates stress on the water resources of production sites empirical studies suggest that a range of economic hydro climatic and political factors is important for the occurrence of conflicts over water ye et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 the potential for conflict is decreased by virtual water trade if the water abundant country uses a sufficiently small share of the resource ansink 2010 the virtual water trade import export was calculated as the food trade volume t yr times its virtual water content m3 t the virtual water content of an agricultural product m3 t is estimated from the volume of water used during the crop s growth period m3 hm2 called the crop water requirement hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 the volume of water used by a crop has two components green water and blue water the use of green water in agriculture is related to more sustainable practices than the use of blue water aldaya et al 2008 there are two widely accepted categories of methodology for virtual water accounting the down top approach works well when providing detailed and separate virtual water information of specific goods such as rice meat or even t shirt vanham and bidoglio 2013 as item by item approach the first step is to collect the data of all the individual goods or services that are consumed by the given region or population then the virtual water is obtained by the summation of all the multiplication of the consumed goods and services by their respective virtual water intensities hoekstra 2009 the virtual water content of crop products is the key to measure virtual water the calculation method for the virtual water content of primary crops is limited by inferior territorial ratione materiae reproducibility and comparability the virtual water content of non water intensive products was calculated in line with the balanced nutrition rule in general the steps to calculate the virtual water trade import export for the major grain crops are shown in fig 4 grey water footprint is a method of quantitatively describing the state of water environment pollution hoekstra 2003a b c first proposed its concept in 2002 which is defined as the amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants loading to the maximum concentration allowed by the standard based on a certain water quality standard the grey water footprint considers that the same water body can dilute different pollutants the grey water footprint quantitatively shows the impact of water pollution on the quantity of water resources and provides a new method for the sustainable study of water resources research on the gray water footprint is still at the primary stage at present research abroad mainly focuses on the calculation and analysis of gray water footprints of industrial and agricultural products calculation and analysis of gray water footprints in national regions or watershed and evaluation of water resources sustainability based on grey water footprint measurement et al mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 vanham and bidoglio 2014 chapagain and hoekstra 2011 ercin and hoekstra 2014 the study of greywater footprint domestic is mainly about the study and application of abroad research methods based on the gray water footprint theory the study of effective assessment of regional real water pollution remains to be further discussed in the future therefore the paper only calculated the blue and green water footprint 2 2 1 virtual water flow the basic estimate of water embodied in external trade is to multiply the import and export trade figures and the corresponding water intensity coefficients the imported virtual water iw is the sum of virtual water embodied in imported goods iwg and imported services iws chen and li 2015 the iw can be calculated as 1 i w i w g i w s i j m i j n i j where mij is the imported item i from j country region nij is the corresponding virtual water intensity of import i from j country region the exported virtual water ew can be calculated by virtual water embodied in exported goods ewg and exported services ews lamastra et al 2017 the ew can be calculated as 2 e w e w g e w s k m k n k where mk represent the export k and nk is the corresponding virtual water content of k the virtual water is computed using eq 3 3 v w i w e w 2 2 2 volume of virtual water this paragraph provided a more detailed calculation process to evaluate the virtual water volume embedded in food trade between different regions under a rain fed scenario green water is equal to the total virtual water of the crop sun et al 2013 the per unit water value virtual water content which refers to the value per unit water value was calculated for the analysis of virtual water strategy shao et al 2017 the virtual water content is used as the reference value for the tracking of water movement across international boundaries in the agricultural and industry product trades the virtual water content of primary crops can be calculated according to the methodology as follows hoekstra and hung 2002 4 v w c w r c y c where vwc is the virtual water content of the primary crop m3 t wrc is the crop water requirement m3 ha yc is the crop yield per unit area t ha the wrc is the evapotranspiration etc mm d over the crop growing period hoekstra and hung 2002 5 w r c 10 d 1 l p e t c where factor 10 is intended to convert water depth into water volume per land surface 1mm m3 ha

saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship γ is the psychrometric constant and rs and ra are the bulk surface and aerodynamic resistances the values for green and blue water in virtual water are calculated by computing the accumulation of daily evapotranspiration over the crop growing period ercin et al 2013 the virtual water flow related to crop water requirement wrcg wrcb can be calculated as follows 8 v w c g w r c g y c 10 e t g y c v w c b w r c b y c 10 e t b y c where vwcg and vwcb are the green and blue components of virtual water content for a crop m3 t respectively

crop growing period can be estimated using the fao s equation hoekstra et al 2011 9 e t g min e t c p e e t b max 0 e t c p e where pe is the effective rainfall over the crop growing period mm understanding the pattern of china s virtual water trade and exploring virtual water policy is one of the important ways to achieve optimal allocation of water resources it can provide a new perspective for china to ease water conflicts and solve the water crisis we estimated the international trade volume of virtual water 1 calculating the overall international trade volume of virtual water according to the data of china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 we obtained grain import and export volume in the international trade of grain in the past 8 years in china we calculated the virtual water content of the three crops rice wheat and maize and their import and export volume and obtained the import and export trade volume of virtual water 2 virtual water trade of unit crops rice wheat and maize in international trade according to the data of china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 we obtained the number of imports and exports of a certain crop in the international trade of grain in china in the past 8 years the unit virtual water content of a certain crop was multiplied by its import and export volume to obtain the corresponding virtual water imports exports and net imports 2 3 data climate data were taken from the climwat database which were available from www fao org nr water infores databases climwat html the data include monthly average maximum temperature monthly average minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and precipitation from 2003 2010 we obtained the data from china meteorological administration as well as the provinces autonomous regions and municipalities bureau of meteorology agricultural data includes farmland area agricultural inputs fertilizers pesticides agricultural machinery etc irrigation data and crop yield which were taken from the china statistical yearbook and chinese agricultural statistics data et al we got agricultural inputs data from the china statistical yearbook 2004 2011 and china rural statistics yearbook 2004 2011 the irrigation data were obtained from china water resources bulletin 2003 2011 and yearbook of china water resources 2004 2011 the crop yield and farmland area come from china rural statistics yearbook 2004 2011 virtual water trade data were obtained from the faostat database http faostat fao org site 406 default aspx we reconstructed 8 years 2003 2010 of international global trade data for 32 crops and animal products the food trade data for each commodity were converted into virtual water trade values hoekstra et al 2011 3 results and discussion although there are many quantification studies on virtual water there are still some problems in its calculation methods as for the virtual water content of agricultural products many researches lacked relevant meteorological data and water data and the experimental equipment and technical conditions for measuring crop water requirements were relatively backward therefore in practice many years average values or common reference values were often used yang et al 2015 however due to the spatial and temporal differences in climate the degree of dryness and humidity in different regions and different years was different even if the water demand of the same type of crop was different the virtual water content of the calculated agricultural product may have large errors from the perspective of the virtual water change mechanism analysis method the current method is not strict enough to identify virtual water change factors in most studies water use efficiency industrial structure and production scale are selected as the main factors for analysis too few factors cause the decomposition analysis to be too simple and general which has limited significance for the practical work of guiding the virtual water strategy due to the lack of trade statistics a large number of product trades between regions were estimated through historical data or economic models rather than actual surveys which directly leaded to the deviations in the calculation of total virtual water 3 1 virtual water of different crops the virtual water content doesn t depend on the actual condition of crop growth except the climate condition there is less related to the state of irrigation seed agriculture technology and so on the virtual water content of crop crops is in correlation with the crop quality water consumption quota yield geographical conditions of growth conversion efficiency of products in different regions differences of water and cultivated land resources led to differences in grain production and water use between regions sun et al 2016 the matching of the geographical distribution of the virtual farmland of agricultural products in china and the economic and economic elements of each resource is not high this paper analyzed the virtual water of china s primary agricultural product trade the main goal is to find out the volume of virtual water trade in different regions in china and calculate the value of the virtual water import and export in agricultural trade with other countries in the future to effectively use the international market to solve the problem of water resources shortage we use grain production and water use for grain production in mainland china to calculate the water requirement water resources content of different crops the range and average value of water resources content of major crop is given in table 2 in china rice wheat and maize are the three major crops and the rice has the largest cultivated area based on our calculation water resources content for rice is about 4440 m3 ha and the percolation for rice ranges from 2300 m3 ha to 6670 m3 ha zhang et al 2016 therefore the national average of 8000 m3 ha was used as the water resources content of rice in china owing to the differences in climatic condition crop yields and crop management between regions the regional differences of virtual water content for the same crop were significant the average virtual water content 2003 2010 was calculated by dividing the crop water resources content with the average crop yield during this period wrcg wrcb annual virtual water content was used for calculating virtual water trade in the corresponding year table 3 shows the green and blue virtual water content of major three crops in each region the highest value and lowest value of wheat virtual water content was 2303 1438 m3 t respectively the national average virtual water content of wheat rice and maize were as follows wheat 1307 m3 t rice 1604 m3 t and maize 1061 m3 t these results are approximately consistent with the results of former studies sun et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which were wheat 1071 m3 t rice 1294 m3 t and maize 830 m3 t the virtual water content of grain crops in the northern and southern china was 1293 m3 t and 942 m3 t respectively the national average value was 1117 m3 t and shows that the regional differences of virtual water content for crop were significant taking wheat as an example the virtual water content of wheat was relatively low in huang huai hai region parts of the south china which were less than 1000 m3 t the high values of virtual water content for wheat were mainly distributed in northeast china the north china and part of northwest china and were more than 2000 m3 t the virtual water content of maize was between 850 and 1342 m3 t and the spatial distribution was slightly different from that of wheat as rice production needs more water and heat the high values of virtual water content for rice located in the south china and north china in the west of inner mongolia which were more than 1400 m3 t the vwcg proportion for wheat maize and rice was increased gradually from northern to southern regions 3 2 virtual water trade 3 2 1 transfer between regions in china water scarcity has become an increasingly pressing constraint to agricultural production in china there is a mismatch between the distribution of water and the cultivated land resources in china water resources in southern china account for more than 80 of china s total water resources however while cultivated land is mainly in the northern regions wang et al 2014 we analyzed according to the information provided by the china national grain and oil information center the export regions of wheat were mainly located in huang huaihai region northwest and southwest china the north china northeast china huang huai hai region northwest china and southwest china were the main output regions of maize and the surplus regions of rice were distributed in northeast china the middle and lower yangtze river region and southwest china based on the calculation results of virtual water content for wheat maize and rice combining with the grain trade data among different regions in china the transfer of virtual water flows was given in table 4 the calculation results are like the literature sun et al 2013 2016 northeast china huang huai hai region and northwest china are the major grain production regions as well as the major virtual water export regions the virtual water content output from the three regions accounts for nearly 85 of the total virtual water content output from the grain export regions the virtual water outflow with grain export is 24 07 108m3 in the northeast and 15 44 108m3 in the huang huai hai regions the southeast china south china and north china regions are the major grain virtual water content import regions which were 19 48 108 19 13 108 and 11 12 108 m3 respectively the virtual water content reaches 49 73 108 m3 above three regions the virtual water content import of southeast china south china and north china were 19 78 108 19 42 108 and 11 29 108 m3 respectively sun et al 2013 the growth of maize mainly relies on green water therefore the average green water proportion of virtual water content for maize was the highest about 68 78 followed by rice and wheat precipitation is concentrated mostly in summer and autumn and maize need a large quantity of water to grow during the period therefore the green water proportion in maize virtual water content was higher china s inter regional virtual water trade is not consistent with water resource endowments expectations the relatively abundant water resources in south china do not become a comparative advantage in terms of producing water intensive products to trade with other regions in china antonelli et al 2017 uneven economic development across regions is an important factor as east coastal regions are the most developed areas in china they depend heavily on raw materials for production and food and export less water intensive and high value added products and services to other regions the spatial distribution of water intensive production activities is determined by multiple production factors therefore the uneven distribution of land and water resources and irrational planting pattern structure of regional crops would consume large quantities of water and put pressure on water resources of northern regions thus the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the water resources sustainable utilization and exacerbate the situation of water resources shortage in northern regions 3 2 2 transfer between nations in the world the research object of virtual water accounting could be either the virtual water contained in an intermediate product or final product in the production chain or the virtual water contained in all products consumed or produced by consumers or producers different virtual water concepts have corresponding virtual water accounting methods therefore the virtual water content in different spatial scale such as industrial parks watersheds regions administrative regions countries or the world and time scales is different the virtual water content of each crop imports is not as same as in china however in order to compare the calculated results we used the same value for the virtual water content of the same crop the virtual water calculation method adopted in this paper mainly considered direct water use in agricultural production and ignored the virtual water of intermediate products products supplied to other producers in the industrial chain hoekstra et al 2011 since the amount of water used by agriculture itself was much greater than the amount of water used by these intermediate products research on agricultural virtual water could virtually ignore the virtual water of intermediate products most of the international virtual water trade relates to trade in food the virtual water balance can lead to the export and import data of water by country there are many developed countries that import more virtual water than they export even if they are typically in water balance surplus or exporting countries in conventional hydrological terms there are also countries conventionally viewed as water scarce where there is net virtual water export hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 agriculture accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawals and 85 of consumptions worldwide chapagain and hoekstra estimated that 895 billion m3 yr are transferred inter regionally ercin et al 2013 this compares with world annual water withdrawals and consumption of 4430 billion m3 and 2304 billion m3 respectively and annual desalination of 0 017 billion m3 international desalination association 2011 the increasing focus on interactions between water land food and climate leads to a call to consider water land carbon and other footprints more coherently and put the different footprints in the context of local regional or global planetary boundaries hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 fang et al 2015 have taken up the challenge to connect the environmental footprint literature to the planetary boundaries literature in a comprehensive study putting the carbon water and land footprints of 28 selected nations in the context of allocated planetary boundaries by analyzing the virtual water balance among different countries total virtual water import and export at the scale of the globe balanced to zero in the world water exporters are the usa south america india and australia the importers are western europe north africa japan mexico and the middle east the virtual water trade in the world has increased considerably over time and high value exports is beneficial for low income countries from a regional economic water efficiency perspective clark et al 2015 jackson et al 2015 many studies have attempted to quantify the link between china s wto accession and agricultural outcomes comparative advantage in agriculture will lead china to increase the export of labor intensive products and the import of land intensive products liao et al 2008 the community structure of virtual water trade also reflects some of the trade partnerships resulting from political alliances and that some of the changes associated with political events considering both water resource constraints and political considerations a more plausible scenario is that china will increase imports of wheat and maize while exporting vegetables on the base of analyzing china s international virtual water flows of agricultural products trade from 2003 to 2010 china was trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products the exported virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the exported imported virtual water flows of china from 2003 to 2010 was shown in table 5 due to the different opportunity costs and impacts of the green and blue water footprints the water footprint in the global virtual water trade and product production process should be calculated separately the green and blue water footprint of crop products was mainly calculated by formulas 8 9 based on crop water requirement growth period precipitation and irrigation water volume using cropwat model estimation or field test data under drought conditions the evapotranspiration of blue water within the crop growth period is 0 mm and the actual water consumption etc of the crop is the green water evapotranspiration etg mm the water consumption in the facility is the blue water evapotranspiration the amount of blue water evapotranspiration can be calculated based on the principle of soil water balance in the facility different countries or regions have great differences in terms of geography climate production technology and production therefore the estimation of the average global water footprint of agricultural products is difficult to truly reflect the actual situation in different countries or regions for example the water footprint of spanish pork production and processing is 19 5 billion m3 yr the green water blue water and gray water footprints account for 82 8 and 10 respectively de miguel et al 2015b the calculation method and calculation results for the global average water footprint is obviously different in the lack of detailed spatial geography and other information as well as the results of the global scale water footprint literature study cannot accurately reflect the changes in the global water footprint to reduce the uncertainty of the calculation results we used the same virtual water content between china s grain and the imported grain at present china has played an important role in the field of global water resources the agricultural products virtual water that china exported to the world was 50 billion m3 and 24 billion m3 in 2003 and 2013 the agricultural products virtual water total amount was 252 billion m3 the average was 31 5 billion m3 yr approximately 73 4 green water 26 6 blue water the total virtual water green water blue water china exported per year were on the decline the main exported virtual water was from crop products approximately 89 of the total and livestock products accounted for 11 zhang et al 2016 virtual water flows of china mainly exported to northeast asia and southeast asia accounting for 30 and 20 of total exported virtual water china plays a more important role in the world trade market and imports more virtual water every year the agricultural products virtual water that china imported from the world was 90 billion m3 and 210 billion m3 in 2001 and 2013 the agricultural products virtual water total amount was 1160 billion m3 from 2003 to 2010 the average was 145 billion m3 yr approximately 91 green water 9 blue water green water was the most important water resource in agricultural production the tendency of total virtual water green water blue water and gray water that china imported per year were on the rising the massive imports of agricultural products led to the decline of self sufficiency rate of domestic agricultural products the agricultural products virtual water flows of china mainly imported from america and southeast asia accounting for 60 and 20 of total exported virtual water imported virtual water flows of china was relative concentration the net import of virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 compared to water consumption in 2010 318 22 billion m3 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2011 the net import in 2010 accounted for 56 net import of virtual water was in a rising trend for the virtual water trade with other countries china is basically in a state of surplus therefore virtual water water footprint are two closely inter connected activities it becomes an opportunity to realize the liberalization of international commerce from 2003 to 2010 the agricultural products virtual water trade in china s grain international trade has been maintaining a large deficit in 8 years the cumulative net imported virtual water through grain international trade is 573 63 billion m3 which is equivalent to saving the same amount of grain production water consumption which effectively relieved the contradiction of water shortage in china at the practical application level the calculation of the virtual water content of a specific product is an important content of virtual water research in the world in recent years at present the virtual water accounting of the global agriculture forestry animal products and its derivatives has been relatively perfect and the virtual water content for some industrial products and tertiary industry services have also been studied from the point of virtual water calculation method for industrial and tertiary industries the calculation of the virtual water content involved in the production process is a complicated process the differences in production technology production scale and production environment all caused the inaccurate of virtual water calculation therefore even if the distribution of virtual water in the products and services of various industries and tertiary industries was avoided or omitted or repeated the result of the calculation may also have large errors future research should continue to improve the accuracy of calculation methods and enrich the types of factors considered in order to obtain more accurate virtual water accounting results china us south asia and india are the most important countries in the international virtual water trade hoekstra s study found that north america south america and australia are the main agricultural production virtual water resources outflow regions while africa east asia and europe are the main virtual water inflow regions fracasso 2014 used the gravitational model to study the virtual water trade in 145 countries and considered that the flow of virtual water was affected by the country s trade level the endowment of water resources water pressure and other factors the virtual water import from agricultural production is increasing in china from 2003 china s agricultural virtual water trade shows china is the net importer of agricultural production virtual water china did not use the whole import virtual water for local consumption and used a part of to supply the manufacturing industry as an intermediate input china s manufacturing industry is in a net export state and in 2003 2007 net exports of virtual water accelerated year by year however since 2008 the net exports of virtual water from the manufacturing industry have fallen while agriculture was still accelerating its net imports as a result the net imports of virtual water from agricultural production continued to rise although agriculture is a major consumer of water in the national economy the importance of agricultural production is self evident because of the needs of the national life and the raw materials for industrial products therefore the virtual water net import status of agriculture can not only satisfy china s huge demand for agricultural products but also save a large amount of domestic water resources the virtual water export of united states is increasing from 2003 despite its large water footprint per capita 1688 m3 yr the u s is the leading net virtual water exporting country 5 billion m3 but this mask interstate flows of 191 billion m3 per year of virtual water larger than withdrawals in many states virtual water flows are large compared to total water withdrawals evapotranspiration from rain fed crops or total water footprint in nearly every state with several eastern states importing roughly half their water footprint and some midwestern states exporting more virtual water than they withdraw or consume domestically mubako and lant 2013 4 conclusions as a new water source conception for the 21st century agricultural virtual water has become the strategic decision to solve the global water resources and crop security issues on the base of analyzing the virtual water trade water footprint and virtual water strategy following the recent literature the paper details our accounting approach and the virtual water data that we use the virtual water calculation includes virtual water flow and virtual water volume the virtual water of different crops and virtual water trade were discussion the virtual water content of grain crops in the northern and southern china was 1293 m3 t and 942 m3 t from 2003 to 2010 the national average value was 1117 m3 t the regional differences of virtual water content for crop were significant china s inter regional virtual water trade is not consistent with water resource endowments expectations the transfer of crops from northern to southern regions would have a significant impact on the water resources sustainable utilization and exacerbate the situation of water resources shortage in northern regions china was trade surplus in global virtual water trade of agricultural products from 2003 to 2010 the exported agricultural products virtual water amounted to 31 5 billion m3 yr and imported amount was 145 billion m3 yr the net import of agricultural products virtual water embedded in agricultural products increased from 44 billion m3 yr in 2003 to 178 billion m3 yr in 2010 net import of agricultural products virtual water was in a rising trend the paper supplied a comprehensive analysis of china s domestic and international agricultural products virtual water trade of agricultural products the structure of calculating interregional and international agricultural products virtual water flows and changes was feasible however the subjects were highly concentrated on several trade partners and agricultural products while the virtual water trade of agricultural products in china has received more attention the studies on the international trade need to be enriched in the future the paper used virtual water strategy analysis to optimize the agricultural water use structure analyzed the current direction of virtual water changes in various agricultural production based on driving factors and reduced the consumption of local water resources based on the results we obtained policy implications and provided new thinking for china s water resources management regional development and ecological security the introduction of water management methods that integrating physical water and virtual water and the establishment of a virtual water compensation mechanism to coordinate regional development maintain the ecological security of the balance between green water and blue water south asia and india mainly focuses on the qualitative research on the role of virtual water and virtual farmland few scholars quantitatively analyzed the value of international virtual resource flows combining the virtual water and virtual cultivated land research the analysis of the economic benefits generated by the flow of virtual resources between regions is the key direction for future research

11373,there is a growing interest in developing suitable biodegradable films for mulching crops to minimize the environmental impacts of polyethylene pe film in order to verify whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops six treatments were conducted including four different ratios of starch polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat biodegradable films mulching containing 0 b1 10 b2 15 b3 and 20 b4 starch respectively and pe film mulching and no mulching a randomized complete block design with three replications was used to compare their effects on soil temperature and moisture and peanut yield the results indicated that soil temperature under the b3 treatment was higher than those under other three biodegradable films for the entire grow season b3 mulching can warm the soil similar to pe film before 60 days after sowing das however lowers soil temperature by about 0 4 1 4 c after that soil moisture of b3 was similar to that under the pe film at 0 40 cm depth at 20 das lower at 40 60 and 120 das however higher at 80 100 das with the infiltration of rains because of biodegradation with less b1 and b2 or more starch b4 the soil temperature and soil water was lower in whole stage than b3 compared with other treatments peanuts mulched with b3 maintained higher lai chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate at late growth stages the pod yield under b3 was similar however economic benefit was a bit lower than that of pe film because of the higher present cost of biodegradable film thus the results revealed that suitable biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons the findings suggest that creating more suitable biodegradable mulches to meet the changing needs will be a new direction for maximizing the use of biodegradable film and reducing the long term plastic pollution i e white pollution keywords controlled biodegradable film net photosynthetic rate leaf area index pod yield economic benefit 1 introduction arid and semiarid regions comprise almost 45 of the world s land area and dryland farming systems are indispensable to food production in the world yang et al 2015 limited water resources especially combined with lower soil temperatures during the seeding stage are the main factors limiting field crop production in these regions liu et al 2009 use of plastic mulches can reduce soil evaporation increase soil temperature tarara 2000 ramakrishna et al 2006 gan et al 2013 improve water use efficiency wue fisher 1995 mo et al 2016 and increase plant growth and yield dong et al 2009 therefore polyethylene pe mulches have been widely used in agriculture for over half a century throughout the world lamont 2005 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 however the dramatic increase in use of pe films has focused public attention on the environmental accumulation and pollution problems which could persist for centuries lopez et al 2007 moreno and moreno 2008 more and more pe films residue are left in the soil because of the difficulty for picking up after application resulting in soil hardness changes in permeability and decline in soil fertility he et al 2009 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 dong et al 2013 because biodegradable films can be decomposed by microorganisms eventually into co2 and h2o kapanen et al 2008 li et al 2014 thus they are desirable alternatives to traditional pe films for use as mulches in agroecosystems kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 dintcheva and la mantia 2007 however biodegradation is governed by different factors that include polymer characteristics type of organisms and nature of pretreatment kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 more important the suitable soil moisture and temperature for crops is changing in different growing stages for example peanut a mainstay of the livelihoods of millions of farmers in semi arid regions of the world is sensitive to drought and heat mwale et al 2007 koolachart et al 2013 rosas anderson et al 2014 however more than two thirds of the peanut worldwide is grown under rainfed conditions liu et al 2009 singh et al 2014 drought reduced pod yield of 22 53 songsri et al 2008 when peanut was exposed to drought at seed filling stage yield reductions were recorded up to 56 85 koolachart et al 2013 meanwhile maintaining soil temperatures at specified levels 27 32 c is vital to improve growth and pod yield sorensen and wright 2002 awal and ikeda 2002b 2003a 2003b to control the soil conditions for peanut film mulching has been a common cultivation practice in the world since 1970 s dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 yet peanuts exposed to soil temperatures above 35 c during the reproductive period could cause significant yield losses vara prasad et al 2000 using a biodegradable film can get lower soil temperature than that under pe mulches which could be favorable in areas and seasons characterized by supra optimal soil high temperatures responsible for damages to the crops however using pe may be advantageous in areas with cooler soil conditions moreno and moreno 2008 in comparison with the use of pe film average soil temperature under biodegradable mulch can be 2 3 c lower at 10 cm soil depth in the late stage however water storing capacity can also be reduced when the degradation of biodegradable film is faster zhao et al 2011 review of the available literature shows that research data about biodegradable films specially designed for use on agronomic crops i e peanut to moderate the soil moisture and temperature regimes is scarce thus it is vital to test whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops controllable biodegradations can be achieved from biodegradable films made from a mixture of starch and pbat olivato et al 2012 although starch is an excellent raw material having the characteristics of regeneration cheap easy to store and transport guilbert and gontard 2005 films with starch only are fragile and it is necessary to decrease the rigidity by blending with other biodegradable materials brandelero et al 2011 the mixture of hydrophobically modified starch and pbat a thermoplastic biodegradable polymer with a slow degradation rate may produce a high quality biodegradable plastic film muller et al 2001 however the suitable starch proportion in pbat based biomulches for dynamically changing soil conditions to meet the needs of crops is still unknown the objectives of this study were to use peanut as a model crop to test whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different growing stages of crops therefore we evaluated i the effects of biodegradable films of different capacity for degradation based on four ratios of pbat starch on soil temperature and moisture regimes ii influence of changes in soil temperature and moisture regimes on the lai chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate and yield of peanut and iii the economic benefits under different biodegradable films 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area and materials field experiments were conducted during 2013 and 2014 at the experimental farm of the peanut research institute of shandong province laixi shandong province china the study area has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 635 8 mm the mean annual temperature is 11 7 c the total annual sunshine is 2656 3 h the frost free period is 183 days the water requirement of peanut is 361 439 mm su et al 2002 abou kheira 2009 precipitation during the peanut growing periods amounted to 494 6 mm in 2013 and 422 7 mm in 2014 fig 1 however the precipitation distribution was significantly different over the two growing seasons e g excessive rain fell during 60 90 days after mulching in 2013 whereas most of the rainfall was distributed over 80 90 days in 2014 during 2013 the high temperature ranged between 21 and 36 c and the low between 15 and 25 c during 2014 the high temperature ranged between 16 and 37 c and the low between 8 and 25 c predominant soil at the experimental site is a silt loam with sand 73 9 silt 21 8 and clay 4 3 the properties at the 0 20 cm depth prior to experiment in 2013 were ph 5 3 soil bulk density of 1 36 g cm 3 soil organic matter 14 9 g kg 1 available n 45 7 mg kg 1 available p 124 0 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k 147 3 mg kg 1 soil gravimetric moisture contents at wilting point and field capacity were determined to be 3 52 and 23 77 respectively using the pressure plate method the peanut variety huayu 22 provided by the shandong peanut research institute and approved by the shandong province crop variety approval committee in february 2003 was grown in this study the variety is an early maturing erect common type with concentrated pods and with a growth period of approximately 130 days its disease resistance and tolerance to drought and waterlogging are moderate the tested biodegradable films which were all developed by shandong agricultural university and manufactured by shandong

iii biodegradable film with 85 pbat and 15 starch b3 and iv biodegradable film with 80 pbat and 20 starch b4 the pe film was also manufactured by shandong penguin plastic group co ltd all test films were 0 008 mm thick and 90 cm wide and they were all clear and colorless 2 2 experimental design the field experiments included six treatments pe b1 b2 b3 b4 and an unmulched plot as a control no all the treatments were arranged into a randomized complete block design with three replications the width of the ridge was 0 5 m and the triangular furrow between the two ridges was 0 5 m wide and 0 15 m deep two rows of peanuts were sown on each ridge on 4 may 2013 and 29 april 2014 at a density of 125 000 hills ha 1 two seeds were planted in each hill with 25 cm inter row and 16 cm intra row spacings the ridges of the mulching treatments were covered by film by machine immediately after sowing each plot was 4 10 m2 the peanuts were harvested on 10 september 2013 and 7 september 2014 respectively before ridging 500 kg ha 1 of triple compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 15 k2o was applied the herbicide oxadiazon acetochlor 42 ec was applied at 1 0 kg a i ha 1 to all treatments before mulching peanut holes were sprayed with 30 phoxim microcapsules suspension at 12 kg ha 1 when sown to control peanut grubs and other soil insects the stands were free from pathogenic infections no irrigation was applied during the entire growth period 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 film degradation rate and strength film degradation grades were recorded every 10 days after mulching a film degradation graded index was used according to the method of yang and tang 1996 level 0 cracks do not appear level 1 cracks begin to appear level 2 hairline cracks in 25 of the mulch level 3 2 2 5 cm cracks appear in the film level 4 film cracks appear as a uniform mesh with no large pieces of film existing level 5 film cleavage with fragments 4 4 cm2 or less the film degradation rates were calculated by the weight of a 1 m long piece of biodegradable film or pe film before mulching and after harvesting the collected films were washed dried and weighed and then the film mass loss rates were calculated all the films were weighed by an electronic balance with a precision of 0 0001 g 2 3 2 soil sampling and measurements weather data were obtained from the weather station at the experimental site soil temperatures at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm and 20 cm depths were measured with l shaped mercury thermometers placed between two adjacent plants with three replicates soil temperatures were recorded at 8 00 h and 14 00 h daily for 3 consecutive days every 20 days all the temperature data of each measurement were obtained within ten minutes the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the mean of the two daily readings soil moisture was measured at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth by the gravimetric method at 20 day intervals with three replicates soil from different depths was sampled using a soil auger at three locations in the middle of two peanut rows of the same ridge and mixed as one sample soil samples were transferred into self sealing plastic bags in the field and upon arrival in the laboratory each sample was immediately placed in an aluminum box all soil samples were weighed within 1 h after collection to obtain fresh weights and then oven dried at 105 c to a constant weight to determine the gravimetric moisture content 2 3 3 growth parameters leaf photosynthesis was determined using the third fully expanded leaf on the main stem of five plants for each experimental plot at the flowering stage pod setting stage pod filling stage and maturity on clear days between 11 00 and 14 00 h the rates of photosynthesis were determined using a portable photosynthesis meter li 6400xt li cor usa leaf chlorophyll content was also determined using a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 plus konika minolta japan on the third top leaf of the peanut plant the leaf area index lai was sampled randomly by hand over five plants per experimental plot at 20 day intervals the measurements of leaf area were used a leaf area meter li 3100c li cor usa by measuring all leaf area of each plant nageswara rao et al 2001 at harvest five hills per plot were sampled to determine the numbers of mature immature and juvenile pods per plant the pod yield was determined by harvesting an area of 10 m2 in the center of each plot pods were air dried for one week and then the pod number per kg was calculated 2 4 economic benefits analysis benefit was calculated according to the average global market price in 2014 because other inputs were the same only the benefit increase relative to no treatment was analyzed according to peanut yield and film cost the film cost included the cost for buying and laying film for pe mulch it also included the cost for removal the film from field 1 benefit increase yuan ha 1 yield increase relative to no kg ha 1 price yuan kg 1 film cost 2 5 statistical analysis the treatments and monitoring date were considered as fixed effects and the replication was considered as a random effect all data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the proc glm procedure in sas sas institute 2001 mean comparisons were performed using fisher s least significant difference lsd test at a probability level of 0 05 the figures were created using origin 8 0 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 film degradation rates and degradable degrees in 2013 the film degradation rates increased with the increase in proportion of starch figs 2 and 3 the films under b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments started to craze at 80 das 60 das 40 das and 30 das respectively at peanut harvest the degradation classification index of the films under b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments were 3 4 5 and 5 respectively the film cleavage fragments under b3 and b4 treatments were 4 4 cm2 or smaller at the harvest stage same trends were found in 2014 as those in 2013 although the degradation rates of the films in 2014 were slower than those in 2013 the degradation of b3 coincided with the peanut growth period in 2013 and 2014 with increase in proportion of starch the film mass loss rate of the biodegradable plastic films increased at harvest the film mass loss rates of the b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments were 34 0 44 6 51 2 and 55 6 respectively during 2013 and 32 1 41 6 50 2 and 54 6 respectively during 2014 table 1 3 2 soil temperature the biodegradable films could warm the soil similar to that under the pe film before 60 das fig 4 however the soil temperature of biodegradable films was 0 4 2 9 c 0 8 2 8 c 0 6 2 0 c and 0 1 1 3 c lower after that than pe film at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm and 20 cm soil depth respectively interestingly soil temperature under the b3 treatment was significantly higher than that under other three biodegradable films for the entire grow season furthermore no significant differences were observed among b1 b2 and b4 treatments compared with pe film b3 film could similarly warm the soil before 60 das however cool the soil after that and the soil temperature under the b3 treatment was 0 4 1 4 c lower than that of the pe film at 5 cm soil depth which was benefit for peanut growth 3 3 soil moisture content at 20 das soil moisture content under the different film mulching treatments at 0 40 cm depth was higher than that of no but the differences among the film mulching treatments were not significant table 2 with the passage of time the biodegradable film began to degrade and the effect on water retention was reduced at 40 60 and 120 das in 2013 and 2014 soil moisture content of the biodegradable films was lower than that of the pe film at 0 40 cm depth and the soil moisture under the different biodegradable films followed the order of b1 b2 b3 b4 there is a seasonal dry at 60 das in both years which is slightly higher than the wilting point 3 52 however with the on set of rains fig 1 rupture of the biodegradable film also increased water infiltration thus soil moisture content at 80 100 das under the biodegradable films was higher than that under the pe film at 0 40 cm depth but was lower than that for the no further soil moisture content under different biodegradable films followed the order of b4 b3 b2 b1 at 80 100 das 3 4 leaf area index mulching could increase the leaf area index when compared with the no treatment fig 5 at 20 das the lai under the biodegradable films did not differ significantly from that of the pe film over time the lai under the biodegradable films were lower than that of the pe film while that under the b3 treatment was similar with that of the pe film this trend shows that the biodegradable film under the b3 had the same effect as that of the pe film on the leaf area index of peanut 3 5 chlorophyll spad the chlorophyll spad under the film mulching treatments was higher than that of the no treatment fig 6 at the flowering stage the chlorophyll spad of the biodegradable films was lower than that of the pe film however as the peanut plants grew the chlorophyll spad under the biodegradable films was significantly increased when compared with that of the pe film at the pod setting and pod filling stages there were no significant differences between the b3 treatment and the pe film during the two years at maturity all biodegradable films had higher chlorophyll spad than that of the pe film the b3 treatment had the highest chlorophyll spad which was 2 55 and 3 32 higher than that of the pe film during 2013 and 2014 respectively 3 6 net photosynthetic rate the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the film mulching treatments were higher than that in the no treatment fig 6 at the flowering and pod setting stages the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the biodegradable films were lower than that in the pe film at the pod filling stage the net photosynthetic rate of peanut in the b3 treatment was slightly lower than that in the pe film treatment at maturity the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the biodegradable films were higher than that in the pe film treatment 3 7 pod yield plant productivity and benefit pod yields under the mulching treatments were all significantly greater than that of no treatment table 3 however the yields under the biodegradable films were lower than that of the pe film but the difference between the b3 and the pe film was not significant the pod yields under the b1 b2 and b4 were 7 9 5 8 and 9 2 lower respectively than that under the pe film treatment during 2013 and 9 1 4 6 and 8 5 lower respectively during 2014 pods per plant mature pod numbers and juvenile pod number under biodegradable films were lower than those under the pe film however the immature pod number were not significantly different between them although number of pods per plant for b3 was lower than those of the pe film there were no significant differences in mature pod numbers immature pod number and pods kg 1 compared with no treatment the benefit increases of pe and b3 are 2886 3396 yuan ha 1 and 2457 2528 yuan ha 1 respectively because the high cost of biodegradable films the benefit of b3 was 358 939 yuan ha 1 lower than pe treatment 4 discussions 4 1 degradation of biodegradable films the degradation rate of biodegradable films primarily depends on materials and environmental conditions kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 the films either break down too slowly resulting in problems with persistent small fragments of residual mulch or too quickly leaving the crop unprotected wang et al 2004 tachibana et al 2009 zhan et al 2010 shen et al 2012 in this study the rate of degradation of biodegradable films increased with the increasing proportion of starch and the films weight loss rates also gradually increased the degradation of the pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch coincided with the peanut growth period these results are in accord with those reported by kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 who reported that the degradation of starch filled blends depend on the starch content ie higher starch content accelerates film degradation the degradation of pbat one of the best studied and widely used biodegradable plastics is relatively slow witt et al 1999 muller et al 2001 blending starch with pbat can quicken the rate of degradation of the biodegradable films lorcks 1998 moreno and moreno 2008 ning et al 2010 4 2 soil temperature crop canopies affect the amount of heat that the soil receives from solar radiation thus affecting soil temperature at the seedling stage of crop development the lai of peanut was small fig 5 which allowed most area of the films to receive solar energy and the topsoil to warm up which led to the soil temperature of film mulching treatments was higher than that of no mulching treatment fig 4 in the later growth stage many study showed that the effect of mulch will decrease with the full establishment of the plant canopy which led to the soil temperature hardly increasing brault et al 2002 zhao et al 2012 but in this study there were still significant differences in soil temperature in different treatments fig 4 this may be caused by various reasons on the one hand the rapid growth of peanuts during the rainy season in july resulted in rapid growth of peanut plant heights from 20 to 30 cm to 50 60 cm at 60 80 das however the canopy of peanuts did not cover all the mulching film fig 3 as a result the mulch still received solar radiation directly on the other hand as the leaves gradually fell the leaf area decreased fig 5 which reduces radiation interception by the plant canopy and the topsoil temperature increased under the film mulch wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 these resulted in significant differences in soil temperature at different mulching treatments in the late growth period of peanuts some of the reasons for the differences in soil temperature in different mulching treatments can be attributed to differences in soil moisture treatment the change in soil temperature caused by receiving a certain amount of heat in the soil is mainly determined by the thermal properties of the soil itself soil heat capacity soil thermal conductivity and soil thermal diffusivity the size of soil heat capacity is mainly determined by the amount of soil moisture content the more soil moisture the greater the heat capacity the slower the temperature increase on the contrary the less soil moisture the smaller the heat capacity the faster the temperature increases chen et al 2009 this study could confirm this point that the ranges of soil water content differences in different treatments were 1 1 4 5 in 2013 and 0 7 1 4 in 2014 table 2 mulching can increase the average soil temperature zhao et al 2012 li et al 2013 dong et al 2014 warm the soil is often a desirable effect of agricultural mulches but can also contribute to physiological stress in warm climates e g peanut growth later period and root disease in saturated soils díaz pérez and batal 2002 the data presented herein showed that mulching with biodegradable films e g pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch can warm the soil similar to pe film before 60 das but soil temperature decreased after that the warming effect of biodegradable film similar to the pe film was primarily because mulch acts as a greenhouse by receiving and retaining daytime solar radiation and reducing the heat loss at night producing a mini greenhouse effect subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 waterer 2010 shen et al 2012 with the degradation of film the warming effect decreased because of the heat loss from the soil through the film and the thermal insulation effects of biodegradable films were reduced soil temperature of the biodegradable film containing 15 starch was 0 4 1 4 c lower than that of pe film after 60 das at 5 cm soil depth fig 4 similar results were reported by zhao et al 2011 who observed that soil temperature covered with biodegradable mulch was lower than that covered with pe film at the late growth stage of cotton so in the situations where soil warming is not desired biodegradable films may provide growers with an alternative to pe film that is potentially degradable in soil 4 3 soil moisture content by reducing soil evaporation mulching increases soil moisture content sauer et al 1996 huang et al 2005 anikwe et al 2007 mulumba and lal 2008 the data presented support the hypothesis that biodegradable film can produce similar effects as pe film on soil moisture content during the early stage and also contain soil moisture content during the late stage mulching with pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch resulted in similar soil moisture content as that under pe film before 80 das and also containing higher soil moisture content from 80 to 100 das this trend was primarily due to the formation of cracks which increase the infiltration of rain at 80 and 100 das and reduces soil moisture content under the biodegradable films compared to pe film at 40 60 and 120 das increase the proportion of starch in the mulch increased the rate of degradation and subsequently the soil moisture content is high at 80 and 100 das however zhao et al 2011 observed that moisture storage capacity of soil covered with biodegradable mulch was reduced because of the degradability of the films used yang et al 2015 in comparison with no however lower soil moisture content was observed for the mulched treatments at 80 and 100 das because some soil moisture might have evaporated directly from the film surface before light rainfall infiltrated into the soil zhou et al 2009 the lowest soil water content value 4 54 was found in 0 10 cm soil layer at 60 das under treatment of no in 2014 which meant all data in our experiment are higher than wilting point 3 52 thangthong et al 2016 also reported that peanut can grow under a drought stress of the soil moisture low to 2 4 at 0 25 cm soil layer in the field with the wilting point of 3 4 our result supported that biodegradable film can maintain higher soil moisture even in the driest season than no mulching meanwhile soil moisture loss may also occur through the cracks of biodegradable film thus the degradation stage and characteristics are important to better controlling soil moisture regime 4 4 pod yield and photosynthesis characters pod yields in the mulched treatments especially the pe mulched treatment were higher than that in the no treatment similar results were also reported by wang et al 2004 and waterer 2010 soil temperature and moisture regimes are important determinants of peanut yield ramakrishna et al 2006 awal and ikeda 2002a 2002b 2003a 2003b warmer soil is positively related to peanut seedling emergence and phenological development canopy formation radiation use efficiency and pod yield further higher soil moisture content can significantly increase chlorophyll pigments photosynthesis wue and pod yield of peanut thus because of the increasing soil temperature and moisture content under the mulching treatments in the present study the lai spad values and net photosynthetic rate were all higher than those under the no treatment furthermore higher photosynthetic also promoted the accumulation of peanut dry matter and thus improved the yield of the peanuts biodegradable film containing 15 starch had the highest photosynthesis capacity pods plant 1 pods kg 1 and yield among the four biodegradable films because of improvements in soil temperature and moisture regimes however the biodegradable film containing 20 starch degraded too fast and although the cracks could increase rainfall infiltration the rapid loss of soil water adversely affected the peanut yield in the region with high ratio of evaporation to precipitation 5 conclusions suitable biodegradable film containing 15 starch produced similar effects on soil temperature and moisture regimes during the early stage compared to pe film but cooled the soil and maintained more available soil water during the late stage a similar yield can be achieved by using this biodegradable film which is in part due to higher photosynthetic capacity during the late stage compared to pe film and its economic benefit was only slightly lower than that of pe film because of the higher present cost of biodegradable film these results revealed that suitable biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops thus creating more suitable biodegradable mulches to meet the changing needs of soil conditions and increase crop productivity is a new direction for maximizing the beneficial effects of biodegradable film and reducing the white pollution acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national scientific and technological support plan 2012bad11b01 the special research funding for public benefit

11373,there is a growing interest in developing suitable biodegradable films for mulching crops to minimize the environmental impacts of polyethylene pe film in order to verify whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops six treatments were conducted including four different ratios of starch polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat biodegradable films mulching containing 0 b1 10 b2 15 b3 and 20 b4 starch respectively and pe film mulching and no mulching a randomized complete block design with three replications was used to compare their effects on soil temperature and moisture and peanut yield the results indicated that soil temperature under the b3 treatment was higher than those under other three biodegradable films for the entire grow season b3 mulching can warm the soil similar to pe film before 60 days after sowing das however lowers soil temperature by about 0 4 1 4 c after that soil moisture of b3 was similar to that under the pe film at 0 40 cm depth at 20 das lower at 40 60 and 120 das however higher at 80 100 das with the infiltration of rains because of biodegradation with less b1 and b2 or more starch b4 the soil temperature and soil water was lower in whole stage than b3 compared with other treatments peanuts mulched with b3 maintained higher lai chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate at late growth stages the pod yield under b3 was similar however economic benefit was a bit lower than that of pe film because of the higher present cost of biodegradable film thus the results revealed that suitable biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons the findings suggest that creating more suitable biodegradable mulches to meet the changing needs will be a new direction for maximizing the use of biodegradable film and reducing the long term plastic pollution i e white pollution keywords controlled biodegradable film net photosynthetic rate leaf area index pod yield economic benefit 1 introduction arid and semiarid regions comprise almost 45 of the world s land area and dryland farming systems are indispensable to food production in the world yang et al 2015 limited water resources especially combined with lower soil temperatures during the seeding stage are the main factors limiting field crop production in these regions liu et al 2009 use of plastic mulches can reduce soil evaporation increase soil temperature tarara 2000 ramakrishna et al 2006 gan et al 2013 improve water use efficiency wue fisher 1995 mo et al 2016 and increase plant growth and yield dong et al 2009 therefore polyethylene pe mulches have been widely used in agriculture for over half a century throughout the world lamont 2005 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 however the dramatic increase in use of pe films has focused public attention on the environmental accumulation and pollution problems which could persist for centuries lopez et al 2007 moreno and moreno 2008 more and more pe films residue are left in the soil because of the difficulty for picking up after application resulting in soil hardness changes in permeability and decline in soil fertility he et al 2009 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 dong et al 2013 because biodegradable films can be decomposed by microorganisms eventually into co2 and h2o kapanen et al 2008 li et al 2014 thus they are desirable alternatives to traditional pe films for use as mulches in agroecosystems kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 dintcheva and la mantia 2007 however biodegradation is governed by different factors that include polymer characteristics type of organisms and nature of pretreatment kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 more important the suitable soil moisture and temperature for crops is changing in different growing stages for example peanut a mainstay of the livelihoods of millions of farmers in semi arid regions of the world is sensitive to drought and heat mwale et al 2007 koolachart et al 2013 rosas anderson et al 2014 however more than two thirds of the peanut worldwide is grown under rainfed conditions liu et al 2009 singh et al 2014 drought reduced pod yield of 22 53 songsri et al 2008 when peanut was exposed to drought at seed filling stage yield reductions were recorded up to 56 85 koolachart et al 2013 meanwhile maintaining soil temperatures at specified levels 27 32 c is vital to improve growth and pod yield sorensen and wright 2002 awal and ikeda 2002b 2003a 2003b to control the soil conditions for peanut film mulching has been a common cultivation practice in the world since 1970 s dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 yet peanuts exposed to soil temperatures above 35 c during the reproductive period could cause significant yield losses vara prasad et al 2000 using a biodegradable film can get lower soil temperature than that under pe mulches which could be favorable in areas and seasons characterized by supra optimal soil high temperatures responsible for damages to the crops however using pe may be advantageous in areas with cooler soil conditions moreno and moreno 2008 in comparison with the use of pe film average soil temperature under biodegradable mulch can be 2 3 c lower at 10 cm soil depth in the late stage however water storing capacity can also be reduced when the degradation of biodegradable film is faster zhao et al 2011 review of the available literature shows that research data about biodegradable films specially designed for use on agronomic crops i e peanut to moderate the soil moisture and temperature regimes is scarce thus it is vital to test whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops controllable biodegradations can be achieved from biodegradable films made from a mixture of starch and pbat olivato et al 2012 although starch is an excellent raw material having the characteristics of regeneration cheap easy to store and transport guilbert and gontard 2005 films with starch only are fragile and it is necessary to decrease the rigidity by blending with other biodegradable materials brandelero et al 2011 the mixture of hydrophobically modified starch and pbat a thermoplastic biodegradable polymer with a slow degradation rate may produce a high quality biodegradable plastic film muller et al 2001 however the suitable starch proportion in pbat based biomulches for dynamically changing soil conditions to meet the needs of crops is still unknown the objectives of this study were to use peanut as a model crop to test whether biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different growing stages of crops therefore we evaluated i the effects of biodegradable films of different capacity for degradation based on four ratios of pbat starch on soil temperature and moisture regimes ii influence of changes in soil temperature and moisture regimes on the lai chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate and yield of peanut and iii the economic benefits under different biodegradable films 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area and materials field experiments were conducted during 2013 and 2014 at the experimental farm of the peanut research institute of shandong province laixi shandong province china the study area has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 635 8 mm the mean annual temperature is 11 7 c the total annual sunshine is 2656 3 h the frost free period is 183 days the

the treatments were arranged into a randomized complete block design with three replications the width of the ridge was 0 5 m and the triangular furrow between the two ridges was 0 5 m wide and 0 15 m deep two rows of peanuts were sown on each ridge on 4 may 2013 and 29 april 2014 at a density of 125 000 hills ha 1 two seeds were planted in each hill with 25 cm inter row and 16 cm intra row spacings the ridges of the mulching treatments were covered by film by machine immediately after sowing each plot was 4 10 m2 the peanuts were harvested on 10 september 2013 and 7 september 2014 respectively before ridging 500 kg ha 1 of triple compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 15 k2o was applied the herbicide oxadiazon acetochlor 42 ec was applied at 1 0 kg a i ha 1 to all treatments before mulching peanut holes were sprayed with 30 phoxim microcapsules suspension at 12 kg ha 1 when sown to control peanut grubs and other soil insects the stands were free from pathogenic infections no irrigation was applied during the entire growth period 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 film degradation rate and strength film degradation grades were recorded every 10 days after mulching a film

calculated by the weight of a 1 m long piece of biodegradable film or pe film before mulching and after harvesting the collected films were washed dried and weighed and then the film mass loss rates were calculated all the films were weighed by an electronic balance with a precision of 0 0001 g 2 3 2 soil sampling and measurements weather data were obtained from the weather station at the experimental site soil temperatures at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm and 20 cm depths were measured with l shaped mercury thermometers placed between two adjacent plants with three replicates soil temperatures were recorded at 8 00 h and 14 00 h daily for 3 consecutive days every 20 days all the temperature data of each measurement were obtained within ten minutes the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the mean of the two daily readings soil moisture was measured at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth by the gravimetric method at 20 day intervals with three replicates soil from different depths was sampled using a soil auger at three locations in the middle of two peanut rows of the same ridge and mixed as one sample soil samples were transferred into self sealing plastic bags in the field and upon arrival in the laboratory each sample was immediately placed in an aluminum box all soil samples were weighed within 1 h after collection to obtain fresh weights and then oven dried at 105 c to a constant weight to determine the gravimetric moisture content 2 3 3 growth parameters leaf photosynthesis was determined using the third fully expanded leaf on the main stem

yield was determined by harvesting an area of 10 m2 in the center of each plot pods were air dried for one week and then the pod number per kg was calculated 2 4 economic benefits analysis benefit was calculated according to the average global market price in 2014 because other inputs were the same only the benefit increase relative to no treatment was analyzed according to peanut yield and film cost the film cost included the cost for buying and laying film for pe mulch it also included the cost for removal the film from field 1 benefit increase yuan ha 1 yield increase relative to no kg ha

in proportion of starch figs 2 and 3 the films under b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments started to craze at 80 das 60 das 40 das and 30 das respectively at peanut harvest the degradation classification index of the films under b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments were 3 4 5 and 5 respectively the film cleavage fragments under b3 and b4 treatments were 4 4 cm2 or smaller at the harvest stage same trends were found in 2014 as those in 2013 although the degradation rates of the films in 2014 were slower than those in 2013 the degradation of b3 coincided with the peanut growth period in 2013 and 2014 with increase in proportion of starch the film mass loss rate of the biodegradable plastic films increased at harvest the film mass loss rates of the b1 b2 b3 and b4 treatments were 34 0 44 6 51 2 and 55 6 respectively during 2013 and 32 1 41 6 50 2 and 54 6 respectively during 2014 table 1 3 2 soil temperature the biodegradable films could warm the soil similar to that under the pe film before 60 das fig 4 however the soil temperature of biodegradable films was 0 4 2 9 c 0 8 2 8 c 0 6 2 0 c and 0 1 1 3 c lower after that than pe film at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm and 20 cm soil depth respectively interestingly soil temperature under the b3 treatment was significantly higher than that under other three biodegradable films for the entire grow season furthermore no significant differences were observed among b1 b2 and b4 treatments compared with pe film b3 film could similarly warm the soil before 60 das however cool the soil after that and the soil temperature under the b3 treatment was 0 4 1 4 c lower than that of the pe film at 5 cm soil depth which was benefit for peanut growth 3 3 soil moisture content at 20 das soil moisture content under the different film mulching treatments at 0 40 cm depth was higher than that of no but the differences among the film mulching treatments were not significant table 2 with the passage of time the biodegradable film began to degrade and the effect on water retention was reduced at 40 60 and 120 das in 2013 and 2014 soil moisture content of the biodegradable films was lower than that of the pe film at 0 40 cm depth and the soil moisture under the different biodegradable films followed the order of b1 b2 b3 b4 there is a seasonal dry at 60 das in both years which is slightly higher than the wilting point 3 52 however with the on set of rains fig 1 rupture of the biodegradable film also increased water infiltration thus soil moisture content at 80 100 das under the biodegradable films was higher than that under the pe film at 0 40 cm depth but was lower than that for the no further soil moisture content under different biodegradable films followed the order of b4 b3 b2 b1 at 80 100 das 3 4 leaf area index mulching could increase the leaf area index when compared with the no treatment fig 5 at 20 das the lai under the biodegradable films did not differ significantly from that of the pe film over time the lai under the biodegradable films were lower than that of the pe film while that under the b3 treatment was similar with that of the pe film this trend shows that the biodegradable film under the b3 had the same effect as that of the pe film on the leaf area index of peanut 3 5 chlorophyll spad the chlorophyll spad under the film mulching treatments was higher than that of the no treatment fig 6 at the flowering stage the chlorophyll spad of the biodegradable films was lower than that of the pe film however as the peanut plants grew the chlorophyll spad under the biodegradable films was significantly increased when compared with that of the pe film at the pod setting and pod filling stages there were no significant differences between the b3 treatment and the pe film during the two years at maturity all biodegradable films had higher chlorophyll spad than that of the pe film the b3 treatment had the highest chlorophyll spad which was 2 55 and 3 32 higher than that of the pe film during 2013 and 2014 respectively 3 6 net photosynthetic rate the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the film mulching treatments were higher than that in the no treatment fig 6 at the flowering and pod setting stages the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the biodegradable films were lower than that in the pe film at the pod filling stage the net photosynthetic rate of peanut in the b3 treatment was slightly lower than that in the pe film treatment at maturity the net photosynthetic rates of peanut in the biodegradable films were higher than that in the pe film treatment 3 7 pod yield plant productivity and benefit pod yields under the mulching treatments were all significantly greater than that of no treatment table 3 however the yields under the biodegradable films were lower than that of the pe film but the difference between the b3 and the pe film was not significant the pod yields under the b1 b2 and b4 were 7 9 5 8 and 9 2 lower respectively than that under the pe film treatment during 2013 and 9 1 4 6 and 8 5 lower respectively during 2014 pods per plant mature pod numbers and juvenile pod number under biodegradable films were lower than those under the pe film however the immature pod number were not significantly different between them although number of pods per plant for b3 was lower than those of the pe film there were no significant differences in mature pod numbers immature pod number and pods kg 1 compared with no treatment the benefit increases of pe and b3 are 2886 3396 yuan ha 1 and 2457 2528 yuan ha 1 respectively because the high cost of biodegradable films the benefit of b3 was 358 939 yuan ha 1 lower than pe treatment 4 discussions 4 1 degradation of biodegradable films the degradation rate of biodegradable films primarily depends on materials and environmental conditions kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 the films either break down too slowly resulting in problems with persistent small fragments of residual mulch or too quickly leaving the crop unprotected wang et al 2004 tachibana et al 2009 zhan et al 2010 shen et al 2012 in this study the rate of degradation of biodegradable films increased with the increasing proportion of starch and the films weight loss rates also gradually increased the degradation of the pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch coincided with the peanut growth period these results are in accord with those reported by kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 who reported that the degradation of starch filled blends depend on the starch content ie higher starch content accelerates film degradation the degradation of pbat one of the best studied and widely used biodegradable plastics is relatively slow witt et al 1999 muller et al 2001 blending starch with pbat can quicken the rate of degradation of the biodegradable films lorcks 1998 moreno and moreno 2008 ning et al 2010 4 2 soil temperature crop canopies affect the amount of heat that the soil receives from solar radiation thus affecting soil temperature at the seedling stage of crop development the lai of peanut was small fig 5 which allowed most area of the films to receive solar energy and the topsoil to warm up which led to the soil temperature of film mulching treatments was higher than that of no mulching treatment fig 4 in the later growth stage many study showed that the effect of mulch will decrease with the full establishment of the plant canopy which led to the soil temperature hardly increasing brault et al 2002 zhao et al 2012 but in this study there were still significant differences in soil temperature in different treatments fig 4 this may be caused by various reasons on the one hand the rapid growth of peanuts during the rainy season in july resulted in rapid growth of peanut plant heights from 20 to 30 cm to 50 60 cm at 60 80 das however the canopy of peanuts did not cover all the mulching film fig 3 as a result the mulch still received solar radiation directly on the other hand as the leaves gradually fell the leaf area decreased fig 5 which reduces radiation interception by the plant canopy and the topsoil temperature increased under the film mulch wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 these resulted in significant differences in soil temperature at different mulching treatments in the late growth period of peanuts some of the reasons for the differences in soil temperature in different mulching treatments can be attributed to differences in soil moisture treatment the change in soil temperature caused by receiving a certain amount of heat in the soil is mainly determined by the thermal properties of the soil itself soil heat capacity soil thermal conductivity and soil thermal diffusivity the size of soil heat capacity is mainly determined by the amount of soil moisture content the more soil moisture the greater the heat capacity the slower the temperature increase on the contrary the less soil moisture the smaller the heat capacity the faster the temperature increases chen et al 2009 this study could confirm this point that the ranges of soil water content differences in different treatments were 1 1 4 5 in 2013 and 0 7 1 4 in 2014 table 2 mulching can increase the average soil temperature zhao et al 2012 li et al 2013 dong et al 2014 warm the soil is often a desirable effect of agricultural mulches but can also contribute to physiological stress in warm climates e g peanut growth later period and root disease in saturated soils díaz pérez and batal 2002 the data presented herein showed that mulching with biodegradable films e g pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch can warm the soil similar to pe film before 60 das but soil temperature decreased after that the warming effect of biodegradable film similar to the pe film was primarily because mulch acts as a greenhouse by receiving and retaining daytime solar radiation and reducing the heat loss at night producing a mini greenhouse effect subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 waterer 2010 shen et al 2012 with the degradation of film the warming effect decreased because of the heat loss from the soil through the film and the thermal insulation effects of biodegradable films were reduced soil temperature of the biodegradable film containing 15 starch was 0 4 1 4 c lower than that of pe film after 60 das at 5 cm soil depth fig 4 similar results were reported by zhao et al 2011 who observed that soil temperature covered with biodegradable mulch was lower than that covered with pe film at the late growth stage of cotton so in the situations where soil warming is not desired biodegradable films may provide growers with an alternative to pe film that is potentially degradable in soil 4 3 soil moisture content by reducing soil evaporation mulching increases soil moisture content sauer et al 1996 huang et al 2005 anikwe et al 2007 mulumba and lal 2008 the data presented support the hypothesis that biodegradable film can produce similar effects as pe film on soil moisture content during the early stage and also contain soil moisture content during the late stage mulching with pbat biodegradable film containing 15 starch resulted in similar soil moisture content as that under pe film before 80 das and also containing higher soil moisture content from 80 to 100 das this trend was primarily due to the formation of cracks which increase the infiltration of rain at 80 and 100 das and reduces soil moisture content under the biodegradable films compared to pe film at 40 60 and 120 das increase the proportion of starch in the mulch increased the rate of degradation and subsequently the soil moisture content is high at 80 and 100 das however zhao et al 2011 observed that moisture storage capacity of soil covered with biodegradable mulch was reduced because of the degradability of the films used yang et al 2015 in comparison with no however lower soil moisture content was observed for the mulched treatments at 80 and 100 das because some soil moisture might have evaporated directly from the film surface before light rainfall infiltrated into the soil zhou et al 2009 the lowest soil water content value 4 54 was found in 0 10 cm soil layer at 60 das under treatment of no in 2014 which meant all data in our experiment are higher than wilting point 3 52 thangthong et al 2016 also reported that peanut can grow under a drought stress of the soil moisture low to 2 4 at 0 25 cm soil layer in the field with the wilting point of 3 4 our result supported that biodegradable film can maintain higher soil moisture even in the driest season than no mulching meanwhile soil moisture loss may also occur through the cracks of biodegradable film thus the degradation stage and characteristics are important to better controlling soil moisture regime 4 4 pod yield and photosynthesis characters pod yields in the mulched treatments especially the pe mulched treatment were higher than that in the no treatment similar results were also reported by wang et al 2004 and waterer 2010 soil temperature and moisture regimes are important determinants of peanut yield ramakrishna et al 2006 awal and ikeda 2002a 2002b 2003a 2003b warmer soil is positively related to peanut seedling emergence and phenological development canopy formation radiation use efficiency and pod yield further higher soil moisture content can significantly increase chlorophyll pigments photosynthesis wue and pod yield of peanut thus because of the increasing soil temperature and moisture content under the mulching treatments in the present study the lai spad values and net photosynthetic rate were all higher than those under the no treatment furthermore higher photosynthetic also promoted the accumulation of peanut dry matter and thus improved the yield of the peanuts biodegradable film containing 15 starch had the highest photosynthesis capacity pods plant 1 pods kg 1 and yield among the four biodegradable films because of improvements in soil temperature and moisture regimes however the biodegradable film containing 20 starch degraded too fast and although the cracks could increase rainfall infiltration the rapid loss of soil water adversely affected the peanut yield in the region with high ratio of evaporation to precipitation 5 conclusions suitable biodegradable film containing 15 starch produced similar effects on soil temperature and moisture regimes during the early stage compared to pe film but cooled the soil and maintained more available soil water during the late stage a similar yield can be achieved by using this biodegradable film which is in part due to higher photosynthetic capacity during the late stage compared to pe film and its economic benefit was only slightly lower than that of pe film because of the higher present cost of biodegradable film these results revealed that suitable biodegradable film can satisfy the changing needs of soil conditions in different seasons of crops thus creating more suitable biodegradable mulches to meet the changing needs of soil conditions and increase crop productivity is a new direction for maximizing the beneficial effects of biodegradable film and

11374,in this research cropping pattern optimization models have been developed to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential negative effects of quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of unconventional surface water treated wastewater and groundwater in agricultural irrigation three objective functions were considered maximizing the benefits from crop patterns reducing nitrogen leaching and improving the rate of aquifer recharge the developed models use particle swarm optimization pso integrated with an additive weighting method and a multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm for different single and three objective optimization scenarios in the varamin irrigation network in iran and then the results of the models were compared the solutions resulting from the three objective model using the pso algorithm with the additive weighting method indicated that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were increased by 7 49 and 20 respectively meanwhile the conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 35 and 88 respectively the solutions resulting from the three objective model using the mopso algorithm forming pareto front and then using topsis to select the optimal solution from among the non dominated solutions showed that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were increased by 7 47 and 15 respectively the objectives of conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 36 and 89 respectively the difference between the objective function values of the two algorithms is about 0 4 to 4 which shows the proximity of the models in finding the optimal solution the results of this research can be used to optimize the use of water resources increase farmers benefits and decrease nitrogen leaching from irrigation and drainage networks keywords groundwater mopso multi objective optimization treated wastewater varamin irrigation network 1 introduction in recent years treated wastewater has been considered for use as a supplementary water supply for irrigation and thus the potentially higher rate of nitrogen leaching into soil and aquifer from chemical fertilizers and treated wastewater needs to be decreased while nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for crop production its overuse increases the risk of greenhouse gases and groundwater contamination the amount of applied nitrogen fertilizer should be determined based on the existing nitrogen quantity in water resources and soil and the plant requirements during the growing season however many farmers use high levels of water and nitrogen to make sure they meet the plant requirements thus soil becomes vulnerable to leaching and transferring nitrogen to groundwater resources ramos et al 2012 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1997 has stated that one of the most important sources of nitrate contamination is the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural lands these fertilizers have the potential to contaminate groundwater by leaching and cause adverse health effects on consumers meanwhile many previous research studies show the benefits of using treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation for example oron et al 2007 metcalf et al 2007 and ghasemi et al 2011 reported that the using treated wastewater for irrigation provides a cheap and permanent source of water reduces the costs of treatment reserves water resources with good quality for other uses reduces the cost of chemical fertilizers and reduces the adverse effects of treated wastewater disposal on other water resources the world health organization who 2006 reported that treated wastewater irrigation at a rate of 5 1 cubic meters per year provides 225 kg of nitrogen per hectare for irrigated lands which could minimize or completely eliminate the use of organic and chemical fertilizers singh et al 2001 proposed a linear programming model to determine the optimal crop pattern in a region in india that would maximize the net benefit from available water khare and jat 2006 developed a linear economic engineering optimization model to evaluate the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in indonesia using different hydrological and management constraints their results showed that the conjunctive use options can increase the benefits from agriculture davijani et al 2016a and davijani et al 2016b presented a multi objective optimization model to allocate water resources in arid regions of iran for maximizing job creation in industrial agricultural and municipal water sectors using a pso algorithm results indicated that optimal allocation of water resources increased the employment rate and benefit by 13 and 54 respectively banihabib et al 2015 developed a non linear programming model of water allocation and cropping patterns for deficit irrigation condition in the tehran and alborz provinces in iran the results of the optimization model showed that in the most optimal state changing the cultivated area and using deficit irrigation methods can improve the economic benefits of the agricultural sector by 36 compared to the current situation karamouz et al 2005 proposed a methodology for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources using genetic algorithms gas and artificial neural networks anns with an emphasis on water quality issues and applied this method in southern tehran capital of iran later karamouz et al 2010 developed and used a ga model to optimize the cropping pattern of eight irrigation networks in tehran province according to water allocation priorities and water availability the results showed that significant changes must be made in the cultivated area of different crops to achieve maximum economic benefit alizade et al 2012 performed a cropping pattern optimization in a 10 year planning period for balancing water resources in the mashhad chenaran plain in iran al khamisi et al 2013 studied conjunctive use of groundwater and reclaimed water rw in cropping rotations the results indicated that conjunctive use can increase cropping areas compared to using rw only joodavi et al 2015 developed an optimization model for the firouzabad aquifer in iran by considering crop patterns and conjunctive use for groundwater management the results showed that the optimal cropping pattern is different from the current cropping pattern and that the cultivated areas of some crops should be reduced singh 2012 applied a linear optimization model for land and water resources to maximize net agricultural benefits in an area in india using production functions singh estimated the crop yield under different salinity levels in irrigation water the results indicated that optimizing land and water resources would increase groundwater use and decrease the problems of waterlogging and salinity in the study area singh and panda 2013 developed a linear programming optimization model for a region in india that allocates land and water resources to maximize the annual net benefit by eliminating salinity problems using the results of the optimization model they implemented a groundwater simulation model to determine the long term impacts of different water management strategies on the aquifer balance based on the results a change in cropping patterns and an increase in groundwater withdrawals were suggested moghadasi et al 2008 used non linear programming nlp a genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso approaches to maximize income in the zayanderud irrigation system in esfahan iran davijani et al 2012 developed an optimizing water resource allocation model in the agricultural industrial and service sectors using the gapso algorithm which is a combination of ga and pso algorithms according to the results employing deficit irrigation patterns changing cropping patterns eliminating the cultivated area of some products and using water resources in the industrial sector could raise revenues in iran s central desert by 56 compared to the current situation mehdipour and hadad 2011 evaluated the optimal operation of reservoirs with various objectives such as hydroelectric power generation downstream demands and flood control purposes they used nlp and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso methods and the comparison of results showed that the mopso algorithm has more capability to obtain an optimum solution reddy and kumar 2007 presented an optimization model for water consumption to maximize the economic benefit by allocating irrigation water within a certain period and for multiple crops they used pso to solve this problem rezaei et al 2017 developed a combination of mopso and fuzzy system f mopso for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in the najafabad plain in iran the comparison of the results indicated that the fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization performed better than mopso the previous studies on the application of mopso algorithm in reservoir operation problems models for water resources allocation and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater management showed the capability and effectiveness of this algorithm for solving multi objective and complex optimization problems the ability of this algorithm to optimize the quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater has not been addressed in previous research but it was investigated in this study in all of the above mentioned research cropping pattern optimizations were performed with quantitative objectives such as an increase in benefit or groundwater balance and the groundwater salinity was controlled by the constraints of the optimization models given the importance of reducing the amount of nitrogen entering to the soil and groundwater research that optimizes the amount of nitrogen leaching to soil and aquifers from the use of treated wastewater and nitrogen fertilizers is essential previous research only considered economic and water resources aspects in cropping pattern optimization but we need to consider environmental aspects of controlling the nitrogen leaching as well this study has two main goals 1 develop and apply the three objective cropping pattern optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater to maximize benefits from crop patterns reduce nitrogen leaching and improve the rate of aquifer recharge in irrigation and drainage networks and 2 compare the single objective pso algorithm using the additive weighting method and the mopso algorithm in solving the problem of optimizing the conjunctive use of water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the varamin plain is in northern iran on the southern slopes of the alborz mountains south east of tehran province the average annual precipitation in this plain is about 145 mm the varamin irrigation network covers an area of 52 ha the main channel named oabc has nine secondary channels that branch from the points o a b and c this research considers the land served by the secondary channel au which has an area of 3053 ha fig 1 shows the varamin irrigation network and channel locations 2 1 1 water resources of the varamin network table 1 shows the water resources in the area covered by the au channel in the 2012 2013 water year 2 1 2 soil properties in order to determine soil nitrogen balance the soil texture salinity nitrate nitrogen and soil organic matters were tested by random sampling in two stages at the beginning and end of the 2015 2016 growing season the results are presented in table 2 2 1 3 measuring treated wastewater and groundwater properties the amount of nitrate and total nitrogen in treated wastewater and groundwater was determined by samples taken at the upstream of the network and the amount of nitrate in groundwater was obtained by monthly sampling at the main wells in the region during 2012 2013 the results are presented in table 3 to extend the point measurement data from sampled wells to entire the aquifer the nitrate iso contours were drawn using gis software monitoring points and nitrate iso contours are shown in fig 1 detailed information on the methods used to estimate water requirements fertilizer needs and crop yields in the varamin irrigation network can be found in yousefi et al 2016 2 2 the optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater as mentioned previously this study included developing a mopso optimization model and comparing its results with three single objective pso models and an additive weighted three objective pso model the optimization models were developed using three objective functions the first objective function considers the economic view of the farmers maximizing their benefits by increasing the cultivated area for highly economically productive crops the second objective function considers an environmental viewpoint of the network operation this objective function reduces the total nitrogen leaching into the soil environment and aquifer the third objective function considers the water resource managers concerns in network operation this objective function improves the rate of aquifer recharge the mopso optimization model and additive weighted three objective pso model use all three objective functions whereas each of the single objective pso models uses one of the objective functions the objective functions and constraints are presented as follows 2 2 1 objective functions the first objective function eq 1 optimizes the benefits from crop patterns in this objective function the benefits from crop yields are deducted from the costs of treated wastewater and groundwater withdrawals as well as the costs of fertilizer used to achieve the net benefit of the cultivated area the costs of fertilizer used include the cost of supplying nitrogen fertilizer to cover shortages of nitrogen content potentially available to the plant from treated wastewater

objective optimization problem the additive weighting method was applied to integrate the results of the single objective pso models in this research the general form of the weighted three objective

objectives three objective of the optimization are supposed to have similar significant and were weighted equally in this study 2 2 3 constraints the constraint on the fertilizer needs of crops eq 6

delivered to the crops 2 2 5 suggested scenarios regarding the objective functions and solving algorithm this study considered six scenarios the model for these scenarios is presented in table 4 the one objective scenarios 1 3 were implemented by the pso algorithm scenario 4 was performed by pso using an additive weighting method and scenario 5 was solved by the mopso algorithm scenarios 4 and 5 are multi objective optimization model to elaborate the advantages of these models the results of these models were compared with single objective optimization models of scenarios 1 3 2 2 6 method of solving the optimization models the developed models were solved using two approaches the pso algorithm and the mopso algorithm the optimal solution of the mopso algorithm was determined by the topsis multi criteria decision making mcdm method and then the results of the models were compared 2 2 7 particle swarm optimization pso particle swarm optimization pso is a simulation of the social behavior of birds and fish the main idea of pso was inspired by birds flocking or fish schooling this algorithm like other evolutionary optimization techniques uses a population of potential solutions to the problem to explore the search space the main idea of this algorithm is that in each of the animals each member can use the observations and experiences of all the members during the quest to achieve the goal in this method each particle has a velocity vector that is used for changing the position of that particle to explore between available solutions if the search space is the d dimensional

and shi 1998 2 2 8 multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso in this research the mopso algorithm was used to solve the multi objective optimization problem this algorithm starts searching by generating random sets for the number of objectives with identical properties particle numbers and size and uniform distribution its structure is similar to the method that was introduced by parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 called evaluation vector of vepso algorithm in this method a set is produced for each objective and its related gbest is selected in each repetition each set then moves its gbest to the next set while pbest is obtained for each set individually finally after a certain number of repetitions the set that is obtained from last set is selected as the final set and its non dominant points are introduced as the solution set or pareto front in this paper a multicriteria decision making mcdm model topsis was used to find the optimal solution from the obtained non dominant solutions 2 2 9 the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis the topsis method was introduced by hwang and yoon 1981 and it is one of the most widely used mcdm models the topsis model ranks the solutions based on the distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis by considering the weight of criteria and the ideal and anti ideal solutions it selects the solution that has the shortest distance from the pis and farthest distance from the nis the topsis method consists of the following steps 1 form the decision matrix in each cell of this matrix f i j introduce the importance of each alternative based on each criteria 2 normalize the decision matrix to eliminate the impact that changes within each criteria have on other criteria and to make the values comparable normalize the decision matrix values and convert all the numbers to the interval 0 1 the following equation is used for this purpose 14 π i j f i j f i

matrix 15 f i j π i j w i 4 specify the values of the pis and nis these values may be directly determined by the decision maker or may be achieved by maximizing and minimizing each criteria in this way the largest value for each of the alternatives under the different criteria is selected as pis for positive criteria and the smallest values for each of the alternatives under the different criteria is selected as nis eqs 16 and 17 respectively 16 a f 1 f 2 f n 17 a f 1 f 2 f n 5 at this stage use eqs 18 and 19 to calculate the distances for each solution alternative to the pis and nis respectively 18 d j i 1 n f i j f i 2 1 2 19 d j i 1 n f i j f i 2 1 2 6 calculate the relative closeness obtain the number representing the relative closeness of each alternative with respect to the

discussion 3 1 pso algorithm in this research the three objective model was developed by using the pso algorithm and the additive weighting method in matlab fig 2 shows the convergence of the pso algorithm for various iterations the pso algorithm achieved convergence after about 100 iterations when the population and number of iterations is increased more time is needed to meet convergence the following parameters in the pso algorithm were determined the number of the population 100 c1 0 5 c2 0 5 x 1 wmin 0 1 and w max 1 1 the parameters used in the algorithm were adopted from the values proposed by previous researchers moghadasi et al 2008 reddy and kumar 2007 3 2 mopso algorithm the mopso code in matlab was able to run 100 iterations in about 3 min however when the number of population and iterations was increased more time was needed to meet convergence the repository size of the non dominated solutions from mopso was considered to be 0 1 of the number of particles reddy and kumar 2007 fig 3 shows the optimal pareto front obtained by mopso the optimal point of the pareto front topsis result and the solution of the psossss algorithm using the additive weighting method are also shown on the pareto front the good agreement between the pso and mopso results shows the capability of the two algorithms in solving the three objective model the mean ideal distance mid index was used to select the optimal pareto front in different iterations this index was used for measuring closeness to the pareto optimal and it is calculated by eq 21 21 m i d i 1 n c i n in this equation n is the number of solutions in the optimal pareto set and c i is the euclidean distance between each member of pareto set and ideal point which is obtained by eq 22 22 c i f 1 i f 1 2 f 2 i f 2 2 f m i f m 2 where f m i denotes the value of the mth objective function in the ith solution for the compared pareto optimal sets a smaller value for this index increases its desirability kalyanmoy 2001 the mid was calculated for different iterations of the mopso algorithm as shown in fig 4 the values of the index in various iterations are relatively stable and the variation is negligible the mid index stabilized on 0 99987 after 500 iterations the objective functions and the decision variables in the current situation using pso and mopso algorithms are presented in table 5 the comparison between the scenarios and the current situation scenario 0 are shown in fig 5 for different indicators including total cultivated area cultivated area of crops amounts of groundwater and surface water withdrawals fertilizer consumption improvement in aquifer recharge decrease in nitrogen leaching total net benefit and water consumption productivity 1 1 the benefit of the crop per unit of consumed water which is obtained by dividing the profit in terms of ir rial by the volume of consumed water in cubic meters note that the indicators are the ratio of optimal variables total cultivated area cultivated area of crops fertilizer consumption etc to the value of variables in the current situation the results showed that the optimal cultivated areas in all scenarios were less than the scenario 0 area this result could be due to consideration of allowable treated wastewater and groundwater withdrawal limits limits of permissible changes in cultivated area decreases in the total nitrogen leaching and improvement of aquifer recharge scenarios 2 and 3 show more than 50 reductions the reduction of total nitrogen leaching and the improvements in aquifer recharge had important roles in reducing the above indicators while the optimal cultivated area in scenario 5 by the mopso model decreased compared to scenario 4 pso using weighted sum model the cropping pattern was optimized in such a way that despite of decrease in cultivated area the benefits and water consumption productivity equal the pso model and the amount of nitrogen leaching improved compared to the implementation of pso model consequently the results of scenario 5 using mopso showed clear improvements compared to scenario 4 using pso for most indices the water supply from treated wastewater was reduced in all scenarios except for scenario 3 in comparison to current situation this is due to the treated wastewater withdrawal limits which consequently reduce the total nitrogen leaching in scenario 3 the model with a maximum withdrawal from treated wastewater attempts to reduce groundwater withdrawal and consequently increase in aquifer recharge in all scenarios the groundwater withdrawal was decreased compared to the current situation which could be considered an important outcome for aquifer recovery in scenario 3 which aimed to improve aquifer recharge the groundwater withdrawal approached zero the model tried to improve the condition of the aquifer by reducing water withdrawal from the aquifer since its balance is currently negative in all scenarios the recharge rate from both of the models pso and mopso improved compared to the current situation among the reasons for improvements in the aquifer recharge indicator are a decrease in the cultivated area a selected combination of cultivation with lower water requirements and consequently a reduction in groundwater withdrawals the indicator for reduced fertilizer consumption is one of the important indicators for the environment in all scenarios the required fertilizer was significantly reduced in comparison with the current situation in scenarios 4 and 5 selecting the optimum combination of cultivation and meeting the three objectives together allows the fertilization potential of treated wastewater and groundwater to be used this leads to an 88 reduction in nitrogen fertilizer consumption in the pso model using the additive weighting method and an 89 reduction in the mopso model the pso and mpso models showed similar reductions in the amounts of leaching in the different scenarios the water consumption productivity in the models was higher than the current situation in scenarios 1 4 and 5 and was reduced by about 20 compared to the current situation in scenario 2 scenario 1 had the highest benefit due to the selection of a cropping pattern with more economical crops scenarios 2 and 3 showed a reduced benefit because of a significant reduction in cultivated areas to minimize nitrogen leaching and maximize aquifer recharge in scenario 4 the pso plus additive weighting method both the water consumption productivity and the net benefit were increased by 7 and 49 respectively compared to the current situation moreover in scenario 5 mopso model these values were increased by 7 and 47 respectively note that the water consumption productivity indicator in scenarios 4 and 5 is about 1 to 2 higher than scenario 1 which represents improvement in net benefit per unit of water consumed in the condition of merging the three objectives furthermore the difference between the objective function values from the pso algorithm using the additive weighting method and mopso using the topsis method was about 0 4 to 4 which shows the similarity of the results from the single objective and multi objective pso algorithms in finding the optimal solution therefore the accuracy of solving the model by the pso algorithm using the weighted sum method is acceptable compared with the mopso algorithm 4 conclusions the results of the three objective optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater showed that modifying the cropping patterns and optimal conjunctive use in addition to effective use of the fertilizer potential of groundwater and treated wastewater reduced the amount of nitrogen leaching into the soil and groundwater and also improved the aquifer balance furthermore the net benefit from agricultural production as well as the water consumption productivity increased the nonlinear multi objective model developed in this study was solved using the single objective pso algorithm with additive weighting and also with the mopso algorithm the results were then compared the results of the multi objective model using the pso algorithm indicated that the benefits obtained from cropping pattern optimization water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were improved by 7 49 and 20 respectively while the conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 35 and 88 respectively by comparison the results of the three objective model using the mopso algorithm and forming the pareto front and then selecting the optimal solution by the topsis method showed that the benefit obtained from cropping pattern optimization the water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were improved by 7 47 and 15 respectively while the objectives of conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 36 and 89 respectively the difference between the objective function values of the pso and mopso algorithms was about 0 4 to 4 which indicated that the single objective and multi objective pso algorithms resulted in optimal solutions that were very close to each other since mopso algorithm suggest better values for the objective function the model proposed in this research can be useful for improving the integrated quantitative qualitative management of irrigation water and treated wastewater resources in irrigation and drainage networks particularly in terms of controlling the environmental impacts of nitrogen leaching into soil and groundwater environments 
11374,in this research cropping pattern optimization models have been developed to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential negative effects of quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of unconventional surface water treated wastewater and groundwater in agricultural irrigation three objective functions were considered maximizing the benefits from crop patterns reducing nitrogen leaching and improving the rate of aquifer recharge the developed models use particle swarm optimization pso integrated with an additive weighting method and a multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm for different single and three objective optimization scenarios in the varamin irrigation network in iran and then the results of the models were compared the solutions resulting from the three objective model using the pso algorithm with the additive weighting method indicated that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were increased by 7 49 and 20 respectively meanwhile the conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 35 and 88 respectively the solutions resulting from the three objective model using the mopso algorithm forming pareto front and then using topsis to select the optimal solution from among the non dominated solutions showed that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were increased by 7 47 and 15 respectively the objectives of conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 36 and 89 respectively the difference between the objective function values of the two algorithms is about 0 4 to 4 which shows the proximity of the models in finding the optimal solution the results of this research can be used to optimize the use of water resources increase farmers benefits and decrease nitrogen leaching from irrigation and drainage networks keywords groundwater mopso multi objective optimization treated wastewater varamin irrigation network 1 introduction in recent years treated wastewater has been considered for use as a supplementary water supply for irrigation and thus the potentially higher rate of nitrogen leaching into soil and aquifer from chemical fertilizers and treated wastewater needs to be decreased while nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for crop production its overuse increases the risk of greenhouse gases and groundwater contamination the amount of applied nitrogen fertilizer should be determined based on the existing nitrogen quantity in water resources and soil and the plant requirements during the growing season however many farmers use high levels of water and nitrogen to make sure they meet the plant requirements thus soil becomes vulnerable to leaching and transferring nitrogen to groundwater resources ramos et al 2012 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1997 has stated that one of the most important sources of nitrate contamination is the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural lands these fertilizers have the potential to contaminate groundwater by leaching and cause adverse health effects on consumers meanwhile many previous research studies show the benefits of using treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation for example oron et al 2007 metcalf et al 2007 and ghasemi et al 2011 reported that the using treated wastewater for irrigation provides a cheap and permanent source of water reduces the costs of treatment reserves water resources with good quality for other uses reduces the cost of chemical fertilizers and reduces the adverse effects of treated wastewater disposal on other water resources the world health organization who 2006 reported that treated wastewater irrigation at a rate of 5 1 cubic meters per year provides 225 kg of nitrogen per hectare for irrigated lands which could minimize or completely eliminate the use of organic and chemical fertilizers singh et al 2001 proposed a linear programming model to determine the optimal crop pattern in a region in india that would maximize the net benefit from available water khare and jat 2006 developed a linear economic engineering optimization model to evaluate the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in indonesia using different hydrological and management constraints their results showed that the conjunctive use options can increase the benefits from agriculture davijani et al 2016a and davijani et al 2016b presented a multi objective optimization model to allocate water resources in arid regions of iran for maximizing job creation in industrial agricultural and municipal water sectors using a pso algorithm results indicated that optimal allocation of water resources increased the employment rate and benefit by 13 and 54 respectively banihabib et al 2015 developed a non linear programming model of water allocation and cropping patterns for deficit irrigation condition in the tehran and alborz provinces in iran the results of the optimization model showed that in the most optimal state changing the cultivated area and using deficit irrigation methods can improve the economic benefits of the agricultural sector by 36 compared to the current situation karamouz et al 2005 proposed a methodology for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources using genetic algorithms gas and artificial neural networks anns with an emphasis on water quality issues and applied this method in southern tehran capital of iran later karamouz et al 2010 developed and used a ga model to optimize the cropping pattern of eight irrigation networks in tehran province according to water allocation priorities and water availability the results showed that significant changes must be made in the cultivated area of different crops to achieve maximum economic benefit alizade et al 2012 performed a cropping pattern optimization in a 10 year planning period for balancing water resources in the mashhad chenaran plain in iran al khamisi et al 2013 studied conjunctive use of groundwater and reclaimed water rw in cropping rotations the results indicated that conjunctive use can increase cropping areas compared to using rw only joodavi et al 2015 developed an optimization model for the firouzabad aquifer in iran by considering crop patterns and conjunctive use for groundwater management the results showed that the optimal cropping pattern is different from the current cropping pattern and that the cultivated areas of some crops should be reduced singh 2012 applied a linear optimization model for land and water resources to maximize net agricultural benefits in an area in india using production functions singh estimated the crop yield under different salinity levels in irrigation water the results indicated that optimizing land and water resources would increase groundwater use and decrease the problems of waterlogging and salinity in the study area singh and panda 2013 developed a linear programming optimization model for a region in india that allocates land and water resources to maximize the annual net benefit by eliminating salinity problems using the results of the optimization model they implemented a groundwater simulation model to determine the long term impacts of different water management strategies on the aquifer balance based on the results a change in cropping patterns and an increase in groundwater withdrawals were suggested moghadasi et al 2008 used non linear programming nlp a genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso approaches to maximize income in the zayanderud irrigation system in esfahan iran davijani et al 2012 developed an optimizing water resource allocation model in the agricultural industrial and service sectors using the gapso algorithm which is a combination of ga and pso algorithms according to the results employing deficit irrigation patterns changing cropping patterns eliminating the cultivated area of some products and using water resources in the industrial sector could raise revenues in iran s central desert by 56 compared to the current situation mehdipour and hadad 2011 evaluated the optimal operation of reservoirs with various objectives such as hydroelectric power generation downstream demands and flood control purposes they used nlp and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso methods and the comparison of results showed that the mopso algorithm has more capability to obtain an optimum solution reddy and kumar 2007 presented an optimization model for water consumption to maximize the economic benefit by allocating irrigation water within a certain period and for multiple crops they used pso to solve this problem rezaei et al 2017 developed a combination of mopso and fuzzy system f mopso for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in the najafabad plain in iran the comparison of the results indicated that the fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization performed better than mopso the previous studies on the application of mopso algorithm in reservoir operation problems models for water resources allocation and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater management showed the capability and effectiveness of this algorithm for solving multi objective and complex optimization problems the ability of this algorithm to optimize the quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater has not been addressed in previous research but it was investigated in this study in all of the above mentioned research cropping pattern optimizations were performed with quantitative objectives such as an increase in benefit or groundwater balance and the groundwater salinity was controlled by the constraints of the optimization models given the importance of reducing the amount of nitrogen entering to the soil and groundwater research that optimizes the amount of nitrogen leaching to soil and aquifers from the use of treated wastewater and nitrogen fertilizers is essential previous research only considered economic and water resources aspects in cropping pattern optimization but we need to consider environmental aspects of controlling the nitrogen leaching as well this study has two main goals 1 develop and apply the three objective cropping pattern optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater to maximize benefits from crop patterns reduce nitrogen leaching and improve the rate of aquifer recharge in irrigation and drainage networks and 2 compare the single objective pso algorithm using the additive weighting method and the mopso algorithm in solving the problem of optimizing the conjunctive use of water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the varamin plain is in northern iran on the southern slopes of the alborz mountains south east of tehran province the average annual precipitation in this plain

resources in the area covered by the au channel in the 2012 2013 water year 2 1 2 soil properties in order to determine soil nitrogen balance the soil texture salinity nitrate nitrogen and soil organic matters were tested by random sampling in two stages at the beginning and end of the 2015 2016 growing season the results are presented in table 2 2 1 3 measuring treated wastewater and groundwater properties the amount of nitrate and total nitrogen in treated wastewater and groundwater was determined by samples taken at the upstream of the network and the amount of nitrate in groundwater was obtained by monthly sampling at the main wells in the region during 2012 2013 the results are presented in table 3 to extend the point measurement data from sampled wells to entire the aquifer the nitrate iso contours were drawn using gis software monitoring points and nitrate iso contours are shown in fig 1 detailed information on the methods used to estimate water requirements fertilizer needs and crop yields in the varamin irrigation network can be found in yousefi et al 2016 2 2 the optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater as mentioned previously this study included developing a mopso optimization model and comparing its results with three single objective pso models and an additive weighted three objective pso model the optimization models were developed using three objective functions the first objective function considers the economic view of the farmers maximizing their benefits by increasing the cultivated area for highly economically productive crops the second objective function considers an environmental viewpoint of the network operation this objective function reduces the total nitrogen leaching into the soil environment and aquifer the third objective function considers the water resource managers concerns in network operation this objective function improves the rate of aquifer recharge the mopso optimization model and additive weighted three objective pso model use all three objective functions whereas each of the single objective pso models uses one of the objective functions the objective functions and constraints are presented as follows 2 2 1 objective functions the first objective function eq 1 optimizes the benefits from crop patterns in this objective function the benefits from crop yields are deducted from the costs of treated wastewater and groundwater withdrawals as well as the costs of fertilizer used to achieve the net benefit of the cultivated area the costs of fertilizer used include the cost of supplying nitrogen fertilizer to cover shortages of nitrogen content potentially available to the plant from treated wastewater

objective optimization problem the additive weighting method was applied to integrate the results of the single objective pso models in this research the general form of the weighted three objective

one objective scenarios 1 3 were implemented by the pso algorithm scenario 4 was performed by pso using an additive weighting method and scenario 5 was solved by the mopso algorithm scenarios 4 and 5 are multi objective optimization model to elaborate the advantages of these models the results of these models were compared with single objective optimization models of scenarios 1 3 2 2 6 method of solving the optimization models the developed models were solved using two approaches the pso algorithm and the mopso algorithm the optimal solution of the mopso algorithm was determined by the topsis multi criteria decision making mcdm method and then the results of the models were compared 2 2 7 particle swarm optimization pso particle swarm optimization pso is a simulation of the social behavior of birds and fish the main idea of pso was inspired by birds flocking or fish schooling this algorithm like other evolutionary optimization techniques uses a population of potential solutions to the problem to explore the search space the main idea of this algorithm is that in each of the animals each member can use the observations and experiences of all the members during the quest to achieve the goal in this method each particle has a velocity vector that is used for changing the position of that particle to explore between available solutions if the search space is the d dimensional space of the population the particle i is shown with a d dimensional vector x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d velocity vector v i v i 1 v i 2 v i d and best previous position of the particle i p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d and g represents the index of the best particle in the entire population the particle population moves in accordance with the following two equations 12 v i d n 1 x w v i d n c 1 r 1 n p i d n x i d n c 2 r 2 n p p g n x i d n 13 x i d n 1 x i d n v i d n 1 where d 1 2 d i 1 2 n with n being the population size n is the number of repetitions w is inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are two positive constants named cognitive and social factors x is a shrinkage factor that can be used like w to limit velocity and r 1 and r 2 are random numbers with uniform distribution in the interval 0 1 eberhart and shi 1998 2 2 8 multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso in this research the mopso algorithm was used to solve the multi objective optimization problem this algorithm starts searching by generating random sets for the number of objectives with identical properties particle numbers and size and uniform distribution its structure is similar to the method that was introduced by parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 called evaluation vector of vepso algorithm in this method a set is produced for each objective and its related gbest is selected in each repetition each set then moves its gbest to the next set while pbest is obtained for each set individually finally after a certain number of repetitions the set that is obtained from last set is selected as the final set and its non dominant points are introduced as the solution set or pareto front in this paper a multicriteria decision making mcdm model topsis was used to find the optimal solution from the obtained non dominant solutions 2 2 9 the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis the topsis method was introduced by hwang and yoon 1981 and it is one of the most widely used mcdm models the topsis model ranks the solutions based on the distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis by considering the weight of criteria and the ideal and anti ideal solutions it selects the solution that has the shortest distance from the pis and farthest distance from the nis the topsis method consists of the following steps 1 form the decision matrix in each cell of this matrix f i j introduce the importance of each alternative based on each criteria 2 normalize the decision matrix to eliminate the impact that changes within each criteria have on other criteria and to make the values comparable normalize the decision matrix values and convert all the numbers to the interval 0 1 the following equation is used for this purpose 14 π i j f i j f i

discussion 3 1 pso algorithm in this research the three objective model was developed by using the pso algorithm and the additive weighting method in matlab fig 2 shows the convergence of the pso algorithm for various iterations the pso algorithm achieved convergence after about 100 iterations when the population and number of iterations is increased more time is needed to meet convergence the following parameters in the pso algorithm were determined the number of the population 100 c1 0 5 c2 0 5 x 1 wmin 0 1 and w max 1 1 the parameters used in the algorithm were adopted from the values proposed by previous researchers moghadasi et al 2008 reddy and kumar 2007 3 2 mopso algorithm the mopso code in matlab was able to run 100 iterations in about 3 min however when the number of population and iterations was increased more time was needed to meet convergence the repository size of the non dominated solutions from mopso was considered to be 0 1 of the number of particles reddy and kumar 2007 fig 3 shows the optimal pareto front obtained by mopso the optimal point of the pareto front topsis result and the solution of the psossss algorithm using the additive weighting method are also shown on the pareto front the good agreement between the pso and mopso results shows the capability of the two algorithms in solving the three objective model the mean ideal distance mid index was used to select the optimal pareto front in different iterations this index was used for measuring closeness to the pareto optimal and it is calculated by eq 21 21 m i d i 1 n c i n in this equation n is the number of solutions in the optimal pareto set and c i is the euclidean distance between each member of pareto set and ideal point which is obtained by eq 22 22 c i f 1 i f 1 2 f 2 i f 2 2 f m i f m 2 where f m i denotes the value of the mth objective function in the ith solution for the compared pareto optimal sets a smaller value for this index increases its desirability kalyanmoy 2001 the mid was calculated for different iterations of the mopso algorithm as shown in fig 4 the values of the index in various iterations are relatively stable and the variation is negligible the mid index stabilized on 0 99987 after 500 iterations the objective functions and the decision variables in the current situation using pso and mopso algorithms are presented in table 5 the comparison between the scenarios and the current situation scenario 0 are shown in fig 5 for different indicators including total cultivated area cultivated area of crops amounts of groundwater and surface water withdrawals fertilizer consumption improvement in aquifer recharge decrease in nitrogen leaching total net benefit and water consumption productivity 1 1 the benefit of the crop per unit of consumed water which is obtained by dividing the profit in terms of ir rial by the volume of consumed water in cubic meters note that the indicators are the ratio of optimal variables total cultivated area cultivated area of crops fertilizer consumption etc to the value of variables in the current situation the results showed that the optimal cultivated areas in all scenarios were less than the scenario 0 area this result could be due to consideration of allowable treated wastewater and groundwater withdrawal limits limits of permissible changes in cultivated area decreases in the total nitrogen leaching and improvement of aquifer recharge scenarios 2 and 3 show more than 50 reductions the reduction of total nitrogen leaching and the improvements in aquifer recharge had important roles in reducing the above indicators while the optimal cultivated area in scenario 5 by the mopso model decreased compared to scenario 4 pso using weighted sum model the cropping pattern was optimized in such a way that despite of decrease in cultivated area the benefits and water consumption productivity equal the pso model and the amount of nitrogen leaching improved compared to the implementation of pso model consequently the results of scenario 5 using mopso showed clear improvements compared to scenario 4 using pso for most indices the water supply from treated wastewater was reduced in all scenarios except for scenario 3 in comparison to current situation this is due to the treated wastewater withdrawal limits which consequently reduce the total nitrogen leaching in scenario 3 the model with a maximum withdrawal from treated wastewater attempts to reduce groundwater withdrawal and consequently increase in aquifer recharge in all scenarios the groundwater withdrawal was decreased compared to the current situation which could be considered an important outcome for aquifer recovery in scenario 3 which aimed to improve aquifer recharge the groundwater withdrawal approached zero the model tried to improve the condition of the aquifer by reducing water withdrawal from the aquifer since its balance is currently negative in all scenarios the recharge rate from both of the models pso and mopso improved compared to the current situation among the reasons for improvements in the aquifer recharge indicator are a decrease in the cultivated area a selected combination of cultivation with lower water requirements and consequently a reduction in groundwater withdrawals the indicator for reduced fertilizer consumption is one of the important indicators for the environment in all scenarios the required fertilizer was significantly reduced in comparison with the current situation in scenarios 4 and 5 selecting the optimum combination of cultivation and meeting the three objectives together allows the fertilization potential of treated wastewater and groundwater to be used this leads to an 88 reduction in nitrogen fertilizer consumption in the pso model using the additive weighting method and an 89 reduction in the mopso model the pso and mpso models showed similar reductions in the amounts of leaching in the different scenarios the water consumption productivity in the models was higher than the current situation in scenarios 1 4 and 5 and was reduced by about 20 compared to the current situation in scenario 2 scenario 1 had the highest benefit due to the selection of a cropping pattern with more economical crops scenarios 2 and 3 showed a reduced benefit because of a significant reduction in cultivated areas to minimize nitrogen leaching and maximize aquifer recharge in scenario 4 the pso plus additive weighting method both the water consumption productivity and the net benefit were increased by 7 and 49 respectively compared to the current situation moreover in scenario 5 mopso model these values were increased by 7 and 47 respectively note that the water consumption productivity indicator in scenarios 4 and 5 is about 1 to 2 higher than scenario 1 which represents improvement in net benefit per unit of water consumed in the condition of merging the three objectives furthermore the difference between the objective function values from the pso algorithm using the additive weighting method and mopso using the topsis method was about 0 4 to 4 which shows the similarity of the results from the single objective and multi objective pso algorithms in finding the optimal solution therefore the accuracy of solving the model by the pso algorithm using the weighted sum method is acceptable compared with the mopso algorithm 4 conclusions the results of the three objective optimization model for quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater showed that modifying the cropping patterns and optimal conjunctive use in addition to effective use of the fertilizer potential of groundwater and treated wastewater reduced the amount of nitrogen leaching into the soil and groundwater and also improved the aquifer balance furthermore the net benefit from agricultural production as well as the water consumption productivity increased the nonlinear multi objective model developed in this study was solved using the single objective pso algorithm with additive weighting and also with the mopso algorithm the results were then compared the results of the multi objective model using the pso algorithm indicated that the benefits obtained from cropping pattern optimization water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were improved by 7 49 and 20 respectively while the conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 35 and 88 respectively by comparison the results of the three objective model using the mopso algorithm and forming the pareto front and then selecting the optimal solution by the topsis method showed that the benefit obtained from cropping pattern optimization the water consumption productivity and aquifer recharge were improved by 7 47 and 15 respectively while the objectives of conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 36 and 89 respectively the difference between the objective function values of the pso and mopso algorithms was about 0 4 to 4 which indicated that the single objective and multi objective pso algorithms resulted in optimal solutions that were very close to each other since mopso algorithm suggest better values for the objective function the model proposed in this research can be useful for improving the integrated quantitative qualitative management of irrigation water and treated wastewater resources in irrigation and drainage networks particularly in terms of controlling the environmental impacts of nitrogen leaching into soil and groundwater environments
