16785,the discovery of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox and more recently aerobic bacteria common in many natural and engineered systems that oxidize ammonia completely to nitrate comammox have significantly altered our understanding of the global nitrogen cycle a high affinity for ammonia km app nh3 63nm and oxygen place comammox nitrospira inopinata the first described isolate in the same trophic category as organisms such as some ammonia oxidizing archaea however n inopinata has a relatively low affinity for nitrite km no2 449 2μm suggesting it would be less competitive for nitrite than other nitrite consuming aerobes and anaerobes we examined the ecological relevance of the disparate substrate affinities by coupling it with the anammox bacterium candidatus brocadia anammoxidans synthetic communities of the two were established in hydrogel granules in which comammox grew in the aerobic outer layer to provide anammox with nitrite in the inner anoxic core to form dinitrogen gas this spatial organization was confirmed with fish imaging supporting a mutualistic or commensal relationship the functional significance of interspecies spatial organization was informed by the hydrogel encapsulation format broadening our limited understanding of the interplay between these two species the resulting low nitrate formation and the competitiveness of comammox over other aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers sets this ecological cooperation apart and points to potential biotechnological applications since nitrate is an undesirable product of wastewater treatment effluents the comammox anammox symbiosis may be of economic and ecological importance to reduce nitrogen contamination of receiving waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract

nh3 and nh4 along with nitrite to form dinitrogen gas jetten et al 2009 kartal et al 2010 2014 kuypers et al 2003 strous et al 1999 they are widely distributed in oxygen depleted environments across both marine and freshwater habitats where they often partner with aerobic ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa to obtain the nitrite required for growth gao et al 2018 oshiki et al 2016 yan et al 2012 this association is thought to be favored in oligotrophic environments such as the oxygen minimum zones omzs lam et al 2007 pitcher et al 2011 straka et al 2019b yan et al 2012 by the high affinities of the marine aoa for ammonia and oxygen ranging from an extremely low km app nh3 3 nm for the marine nitrosopumilus maritimus to a km app nh3 5 µm for the terrestrial moderate thermophile nitrosotenius uzonensis kits et al 2017 könneke et al 2014 leininger et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2009 qin et al 2017 wuchter et al 2006 the unique physiology of anammox has also found utility in nitrogen removal from high tn wastewater where they generally partner with putatively r strategist ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob having generally lower affinities for ammonium km app nh4 500 µm nh4 but much higher growth rates than the aoa jia and conrad 2009 kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 in these systems the organisms generally grow together as biogranules in which growth of oxygen consuming aob near the surface functions to sustain an inner anammox sub oxic core hawley et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing nitrospira species comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which possess ammonia km app nh3 63 nm kits et al 2017 and oxygen affinities likely near that of aoa suggests that they may also couple with anammox in low tn environments and have possible functions in nitrogen removal in other treatment applications comammox species are common in many natural and engineered systems including forest and agricultural soils freshwater and brackish sediments and waste and drinking water treatment plants camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 spasov et al 2020 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2020 comammox organisms produce nitrate as a product of ammonia oxidation with nitrite as an intermediate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the co occurrence of two comammox species n nitrosa and n nitrificans with anammox bacteria brocadia in an enrichment culture suggested that the intermediate nitrite is feeding anammox hence yielding in a functional relationship between these two organisms van kessel et al 2015 comammox was also found to coexist with aob and anammox in a sequencing batch reactor for sludge digester liquor treatment and responsible for 25 nitrogen removal wu et al 2019 although it is as yet unclear how much comammox contributes to tn and nitrite oxidation in water resources recovery facilities wrrfs recent analyses suggest that nitrospira can become the dominant ammonia oxidizer in wrrfs operated at low dissolved oxygen do concentrations and so offer more energy efficient nitrification roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 currently municipal waste water treatment plants generate approximately 2 billion in annual electric costs of which pumping and aeration are responsible for about two thirds of facilities energy consumption lemar and de fontaine 2017 while energy demand of water reclamation facilities is expected to grow with the population increase and water quality standards improvements anammox technology offers a 50 reduction in aeration cost in comparison to conventional treatment systems van dongen et al 2001 however the ubiquitous lithotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob create a significant obstacle for anammox implementation in mainstream full scale waste water treatment installations due to their competition with anammox for the no2 supplied by conventional aob species daims et al 2016 kent et al 2019 koops and pommerening röser 2001 third et al 2001 the higher growth rate of characterized comammox bacteria relative to aoa kits et al 2017 suggest they would function well in the mainstream therefore a pairing of anammox with an organism such as comammox that can supply no2 and have high affinities for both dissolved oxygen and tn would suppress nob and achieve low effluent nitrogen concentrations this pairing would offer an operational advantage in treatment systems relying on nitrification by lowering aeration requirements lower production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o by comammox relative to aob would offer a secondary advantage kits et al 2019 however in order for the comammox anammox pairing to stably cooperate a delicate balancing of tn and oxygen supply is imperative mathematical models have indicated that oxygen and tn concentrations are major niche differentiating factors for anammox and aoa or anammox and aob for example the association between aob aoa and anammox is often disrupted by nob competing with anammox for nitrite kent et al 2019 third et al 2001 resulting in a lower conversion of ammonia to n2 and an increase in nitrate formation thus there is clear need to resolve competitive and cooperative relationships among comammox anammox aoa aob and nob in order to develop a better predictive understanding of their roles in the global nitrogen cycle and to better define possible applications in engineered systems straka et al 2019b the comammox relationship with anammox is of specific interest since both bacteria utilize ammonia and nitrite and are active in low do environments however comparative laboratory analyses of organisms that function cooperatively at the boundary between oxic and anoxic environments have been limited for lack of appropriate experimental systems suspended microbial cultures do not form the oxygen gradient essential for partnership chemostat studies must balance the conflicting nutrient requirements for cooperative growth and are prone to washout we here use synthetic community assemblies of comammox n inopinata and anammox dominant species candidatus brocadia anammoxidans immobilized in hydrogel granules to evaluate environmental conditions supporting their partnership the hydrogel format which is a three dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers has been successfully implemented to immobilize active nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria santos et al 1996 wijffels et al 1995 denitrifying cultures xu et al 2017 anaerobes originating from hydrothermal vents landreau et al 2016 ali et al 2015 and anammox ali et al 2015 landreau et al 2020 the gels can also be formed to resemble naturally occurring biogranules flemming and wingender 2010 flemming et al 2007 in which comammox and anammox can be entrapped in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps that promotes the formation of stable nutrient gradients and microbial interactions on a micrometer scale using a synthetic hydrogel set up to achieve conditions for both aerobic and anaerobic growth we now demonstrate the formation of a stable partnership in which comammox competitively excludes the aob to supply nitrite to anammox and in turn anammox lowers nitrite to a non inhibitory concentration this is the first clear evidence for possible ecological relevance of an association that should be useful for various biotechnological applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial strains and growth comammox nitrospira inopinata strain was incubated in limited mineral media aerobically at 37 c ph 7 5 in the presence of 1mm nh4 daims et al 2015 anammox biomass was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in rotterdam sluisjesdijk the netherlands and was maintained anaerobically in a plug flow glass column supplied with 1mm nh4 and 1 3 mm no2 and operated at 30 c the dominant anammox organism in this sludge was reported to be candidatus brocadia anammoxidans van der star et al 2007 the

10 polyvinyl alcohol pva w v and 2 sodium alginate sa w v solution in water was prepared and sterilized as previously described landreau et al 2020 comammox nitrospira inopinata culture was concentrated 100 fold via 0 1 µm tangential filtration cassette millipore sigma comammox viability after filtration was assessed via incubation in the mineral medium with subsequent quantification of nitrification activity granules enriched in anammox were disaggregated using a blender for 2 minutes and resuspended in the mineral medium suspensions of comammox and anammox bacteria were mixed in a 1 1 ratio and then interspersed with the pva sa polymer solution to achieve 6 pva and 1 sa concentrations using the 0 1 mm diameter tips pva sa bacteria mixture was dropped into a 2 w v barium chloride bacl2 bath in order to form spherical hydrogel particles the hydrogel beads were allowed to harden in the bacl2 solution for 1 hour before rinsing several times in a sodium chloride solution 0 9 to remove excess polymer all solutions and medium used for the hydrogel bead production were prepared anaerobically to minimize anammox exposure to oxygen the granules were incubated in batch bottles containing an ammonia mineral media daims et al 2015 without organic carbon and their activity was monitored for 86 days three sets of comammox anammox beads were set up as biological replicates and incubated in parallel the co culture was oxygenated with ca 4 mgo2 l 3 times per week and ammonium was replenished when depleted the microbial activity was measured using colorimetric analysis of nitrogen species concentration in the growth media throughout the incubation period two additional batch bottles were set up to separately assess the independent growth of comammox and anammox bacteria respectively dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored with oxygen sensor spots pyroscience gmbh oxsp5 2 3 microbial activity measurements ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3

kit dneasy power biofilm kit qiagen following manufacturer instructions dna extraction and analysis are described in supplementary materials 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization fixation and hybridization of the bacterial hydrogel beads samples was carried as previously described nielsen et al 2009 with the following modifications hydrogel beads were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for 3 16 hours at 4 c and washed with ethanol pbs 50 50 w v three times if not processed immediately samples were stored in pbs ethanol 50 50 solution at 20 c fixed hydrogel beads were submerged in oct compound agar scientific or neg 50 tm richard allan scientific tm overnight and then frozen at 20 c for 3 16 hours prior to sectioning thin 20 30 nm sections of hydrogel beads were produced using a

air dried and stored at 20 c using liquid blocker pap pen life technologies carlsbad ca usa a hydrophobic barrier was applied to glass slides containing thin cryosections oligonucleotide probes are summarized in suppl table 2 and were applied in equimolar concentration to the thin sections and incubated at 46 c for 2 hours all probes were purchased from eurofins louisville ky the slides were mounted in the vectashield antifade mounting medium cole parmer a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm700 carl zeiss germany equipped with an axio cam 503 mono camera was used to visualize hybridized cryosections with 488 543 and 633 nm lasers a 10x 0 45 objective was used to image large regions of the sections 40x 1 3 and 100 1 46 oil ph3 plan apochromat oil objectives were used in order to obtain higher resolution images the images were collected in the zen blue software 2 6 quantitative pcr in order to quantify comammox anammox aob and nob in hydrogel beads a quantitative pcr qpcr analysis was performed all specific primers and thermocycling conditions for qpcr assays are described in the reference articles suppl table 2 and were performed on roche lightcycler 480 high throughput real time pcr system in white lightcycler 480 multiwell tubes and associated lightcycler 480 transparent caps roche molecular systems inc pleasanton ca united states triplicate reactions were performed for each sample amplification was performed according to protocols described by fowler et al 2018 fowler et al 2018 details are described in supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 comammox and anammox bacteria establish cooperation within synthetic granules in batch cultures a hydrogel formulation was developed to entrap high numbers of the only available comammox pure culture n inopinata and an anammox enrichment dominant organism candidatus brocadia anammoxidans in synthetic polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa hydrogel beads comammox anammox beads demonstrated a constant rate of ammonium consumption over the study period of 86 days resulting in complete nitrogen removal from the system fig 1 a since no external nitrite was supplied comammox activity was the sole source of nitrite for anammox we did not observe measurable nitrite or nitrate accumulation throughout the incubation period as would be expected from comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 or anammox van de graaf et al 1996 strous et al 1999 metabolism alone beads containing only comammox stoichiometrically oxidized ammonia to nitrate with transient accumulation of nitrite fig 1b and beads containing only the anammox enrichment converted ammonium to n2 when supplied with ammonia and nitrite at the ratio of 1 1 3 fig 1c 3 2 qpcr supports anammox and comammox cooperation in hydrogel beads total bacterial abundance as measured by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna gene ranged from 105 to 106 gene copies ng 1 of granule material sampled at the beginning and the end of the incubation period from both entrapped and planktonic communities suppl fig s1 quantification of the amoa of comammox and betaproteobacterial aob and of anammox 16s rrna genes demonstrated that comammox and anammox bacteria dominated the ammonia oxidizer population in the hydrogel beads fig 2 in contrast betaproteobacterial aob were near the limit of detection in all hydrogel samples and persisted only in the fraction of non immobilized planktonic bacteria fig 2 the planktonic fraction contained mostly heterotrophic species suppl fig s1 and low amounts in amoa of comammox nitrospira inopinata and 16s rrna gene copies of anammox if compared to the bead fraction indicating that comammox and anammox were retained in the bead fraction fig 2 3 3 16s rrna sequencing demonstrated comammox n inopinata and anammox presence after the incubation period while aob and nob remained low but constant the community composition of pva sa hydrogels at the beginning and end of incubation was investigated using amplicon sequencing of the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene suppl fig s2 in total 409 operational taxonomic units otus were identified there was a substantial increase in the relative abundances of otus assigned to xanthomonadales burkholderiales rhodocyclales and rhizobiales over time indicating growth conditions favorable to heterotrophic organisms even in the absence of supplied organic carbon in the media suppl fig s2 the increase in abundance of otus for heterotrophic populations resulted in overall decreasing relative abundances for otus assigned to candidatus brocadiaceae anammox nitrospira inopinata comammox nitrosomonas aob nitrosopumilis or nitrososphaera aoa and other nitrospira nob that were not assigned to the nitrospira inopinata otu between the initial biomass and after 86 days suppl fig s3 the comammox otu accounted for 20 3 reads at the beginning of the incubation and averaged 5 15 7 73 s d n 3 at termination canonical aob aoa and nob accounted for only 0 060 0 010 and 0 020 of the reads initially and remained low throughout the experimental period with final average relative abundances of 0 010 0 017 and 0 0033 respectively s d 0 01 after 86 days of cultivation under nitrifying conditions suppl fig 3 a single otu assigned to n inopinata was the only nitrifier otu of substantial relative abundance thus it can be inferred that it alone was responsible for the observed nitrification activity fig 1 a b together this indicated that comammox was responsible for partial nitrification in support of anammox the observed apparent loss of anammox in pva sa hydrogels after 86 days as represented by 7 68 of the reads in the initial beads and 0 32 0 05 s d n 3 of the final biomass suppl fig s3 likely reflected a combination of degradative loss in the nutrient limited interior and by oxygen exposure near the outer boundary of the granules increased heterotroph abundance and poor extraction of dna from anammox cells embedded deep within hydrogel granules additionally pcr biases for the v4 v5 16s rrna gene primers may preferentially amplify other taxa that increased in abundance during incubation skewing relative abundance data orschler et al 2019 3 4 comammox and anammox species are spatially segregated within hydrogel beads given the efficient removal of nitrogen by this community we further examined the population structure using rrna targeted fish imaging and qpcr fluorescent probe amx368 hybridized anammox bacteria were detected in the initial bead samples as well as at the end of the incubation period fig 3 confirming anammox persistence within hydrogel beads following initial bead fabrication cells were dispersed in the polymer matrix while they mainly appeared on the peripheral layer of the beads after 86 days of incubation fig 3 while the comammox organisms n inopinata green was randomly distributed just after immobilization it formed a thin layer at or near the hydrogel surface following the incubation period in particular comammox cells resided in between the oxygenated edge of the hydrogel beads and the anammox cells red which were situated in a deeper presumably anoxic layer visually we observed a higher abundance not quantified of anammox using fish probes than from either amplicon or qpcr amplicon analysis probe nso1225 specific for betaproteobacterial aob did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal fig 3 suppl fig s5 4 discussion the ability of comammox microorganisms to survive under low substrate concentrations kits et al 2017 allows them to occupy oligotrophic environments cooperation with anammox bacteria has been reported in bioreactor studies van kessel et al 2015 lücker et al 2010 here we used a unique hydrogel format to pair comammox and anammox in a granule like structure engineered to promote the formation of nutrient gradients theorized to foster their co occurrence within natural habitats microbial activities in natural biofilms or biogranules generate substrate gradients allowing aerobic organisms like comammox to grow on the biofilm periphery and anaerobes like anammox in the oxygen depleted adjacent inner layers aqeel et al 2019 weber et al 2007 the hydrogel format promotes a similar relationship in a controlled laboratory setting therefore we fabricated synthetic hydrogel granules harboring a single species of comammox nitrospira inopinata and an enrichment of anammox related to brocadia the beads remained intact throughout the 86 day incubation period as previously shown in our study demonstrating retention of active aoa in hydrogel constructs landreau et al 2020 cooperation was confirmed by a nearly total nitrogen removal and negligible production of nitrate fig 1 this is the first reported encapsulation of comammox organism alone or combined with anammox consortium into hydrogels previously mentioned advantages of synthetic hydrogels combined with kinetic and metabolic potential of comammox bacteria therefore suggest a practical application of comammox comammox co cultures in manufacturing highly oxygen efficient wang et al 2019 hydrogels for nitrogen removal in engineered systems in order to confirm that observed ammonia oxidation and nitrogen removal resulted from the activity of comammox and anammox organisms and not from other ammonia oxidizers we conducted a population analysis by sequencing the hydrogel beads samples 16s rrna analysis of microbial populations from the initial beads versus those incubated for 86 days beads revealed that n inopinata remained the major aerobic ammonia oxidizer other nitrifying organisms aoa aob and nob accounted for only a small fraction of the otus 0 06 and slightly decreased in relative abundance after the incubation of 86 days suppl fig s3 these data contrasts with a previous study of a sequencing batch reactor reporting 0 1 relative abundance of anammox and high relative abundances of aob 18 vs less than 1 of comammox wu et al 2019 which did not fully support the proposed cooperation between comammox and anammox in our study however comammox was demonstrated to be responsible for partial nitrification in the constructed hydrogel beads as deduced from the virtual absence of other known ammonia oxidizing organisms on the other hand the presence of heterotrophic populations originating from the anammox enrichment culture suppl fig s2 may also have been of functional significance members of the ignavibacteria taxa some of which are capable of performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra under anoxic conditions han et al 2020 remained stable throughout the batch test also of possible relevance to nitrogen loss was the activity of populations assigned to four proteobacterial orders xanthomonadales burkholderiales rhodocyclales and rhizobiales all of which are known to contain species capable of facultative anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification finkmann et al 2000 lycus et al 2017 low nitrate concentrations in the effluent might in part be attributed to the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers relying on organic carbon from degradation of alginate biomass decay okabe et al 2005 or small organic acids produced by autotrophic organisms martiny et al 2005 rittmann et al 1994 alginate did not appear to provide a significant source of carbon since bead integrity remained stable throughout the study period and the observed nitrate consumption was inconsistent with alginate being a significant carbon source for denitrifying heterotrophs suppl table 1 although it is unclear what nutrients supported heterotopic growth the high abundance of aerobic heterotrophs suggests that oxygen and not nitrate served as the primary terminal electron acceptor as suggested by retention of sinabacteraceae zhou et al 2008 and chloroflexi tian et al 2015 bacteria which would lead to a competition between heterotrophs and n inopinata for oxygen in the outer edges of the hydrogel granules and utilizing nitrate if any within the anaerobic core volume of the granules therefore it cannot be excluded that some nitrate produced by comammox or anammox was first reduced to nitrite by denitrifiers and then utilized by anammox a more detailed analysis of the nitrogen flow through this system with n labeled compounds is warranted in order to untangle the multiple n cycle process that are may be co occurring in this system pcr based methods are known to have potential bias due to unequal amplification and cloning efficiency particularly for anammox detection using both 16s rrna regions and functional genes amplification cai et al 2020 additionally pcr biases for the v4 v5 16s rrna gene primers may preferentially amplify other taxa that increased in abundance during incubation skewing relative abundance data orschler et al 2019 thus in addition to confirming by qpcr the retention of comammox and anammox and an insignificant contribution of aob and nob fig 3 we demonstrated their expected spatial relationship using pcr independent fluorescent probes specific to the associated bacterial families fig 3 the fluorescent ntsp662 oligonucleotide probe specific to nitrospira showed that comammox cells were most abundant in the outer layer of the beads as dictated by the oxygen dependence of aerobic ammonia oxidation the few comammox cells observed deeper in the granule interior may be an artifact of introducing bacteria into the interior during the slicing procedure possibly reflecting the ability of comammox to grow at lower substrate concentrations typically present in deeper regions or inactive comammox retaining high ribosome content detectable by fish the anammox bacteria were detected using fluorescent amx368 probe and were distributed in small aggregates throughout the inner core space similarly to landreau et al 2016 but mostly clustered immediately below comammox towards the edge of the bead where substrate supply is highest predicted high affinity for oxygen therefore can explain comammox spatial localization within the outer layer of the hydrogel beads and supports a cooperative relationship between comammox and anammox in sub oxic environments demonstrating their possible ecological relevance a few variables in our cooperation model can potentially affect the performance of comammox anammox cooperation since kinetic parameters define the fitness of the strains under specific conditions straka et al 2019a a low total ammonia concentration can be limiting to anammox bacteria leading to slower conversion rates especially if the anammox species was obtained from an ammonia laden system as it is typically the case for wastewater side stream treatment systems smeulders et al 2020 additionally comammox and anammox may have differential sensitivity to various abiotic factors such as temperature ph and salinity affecting both comammox and anammox performance thus a delicate balance of these parameters has to be achieved for a stable cooperation in order to grow comammox and anammox in low ammonia environments such as the mainstream at high rate a future goal must be to enrich high affinity strains from the environment in large quantities instead of using low affinity strains from the side stream and apply them at low substrate environments straka et al 2019a together these results suggest that nitrite was consumed by anammox and not further oxidized by comammox this is in alignment with reported nitrite affinities of k m app no2 48 µm for anammox and k m app no2 449 2 μm for n inopinata suggesting that a higher rate of nitrite consumption by anammox provided a competitive advantage we also determined the nitrite half inhibition constant ki no2 0 31 0 19 mm nitrite of n inopinata and at concentrations similar to those measured in the running experiment 0 1 mm we did not observe a noticeable inhibition effect suppl fig s4 this suggests a symbiotic partnership in which anammox maintains nitrite concentrations at non inhibitory levels and comammox serves anammox by consuming oxygen and providing an anaerobic environment while also supplying nitrite however a novel comammox species candidatus nitrospira kreftii was recently identified displaying physiological characteristics distinct from n inopinata particularly candidatus n kreftii has a higher nitrite affinity k m app no2 13 µm altering its potential interactions with other nitrifiers and denitrifies sakoula et al 2021 thus for specific engineering solutions it is important to understand the kinetic parameters of different comammox species follow up studies using other anammox and comammox species once available in culture should be carried out to further investigate their co existence and activities in bioreactors the stability of comammox anammox association is suggestive of other interactions such as the release of small organic compounds e g formate from autotrophic anammox freitag et al 1987 koch et al 2015 lawson et al 2017 serving as electron donors for heterotrophs or the possible mixotrophic lifestyle of comammox in fact some nitrospira stains nitrospira moscovinensis have been reported capable of utilizing formate along with nitrate koch et al 2015 and it cannot be excluded that comammox can also follow an anaerobic lifestyle in which formate and nitrate both produced by anammox could give them a contemplative edge over other nitrifiers low nitrate accumulation sets the cooperation described here apart from previously studied systems of aob aoa and anammox or aob aoa and nob in which significant nitrate was produced while comammox co culture with anammox acts essentially similar to aob anammox system by generating nitrite for anammox consumption there are advantages of using comammox over aob in water treatment facilities comammox can possibly outcompete aob as they likely have a higher affinity for oxygen than many aob roots et al 2019 however comammox affinity for oxygen may be very similar to canonical nob since both groups belong to nitrospira and share terminal oxidases palomo et al 2018 therefore it remains to be investigated if the presence of comammox nitrospira deters nob species that usually cause operational problems in aob anammox reactors by producing undesirable nitrate as a final product our results demonstrate very little nob growth in hydrogels after 86 days of incubation supporting this hypothesis from this perspective comammox may be better adapted than aoa or aob for these engineered systems and could therefore be paired with anammox for possibly complete n removal in these systems 5 conclusions our results suggest that the recently described complete ammonia oxidizing organism n inopinata can establish a cooperative relationship with anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a synthetic granule format the spatial organization of the two organisms was consistent with their physiology demonstrating that even though these organisms may not be optimal partners they do establish a relationship that points to ecological relevance this novel cooperation was documented by the low nitrate formation and the competitiveness of the comammox organism over other aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers since nitrate is an undesirable product in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants the comammox anammox symbiosis may be of economic and ecological importance to reduce nitrogen contamination of receiving waters however heterotrophic denitrification contribution needs to be further evaluated credit

both marine and freshwater habitats where they often partner with aerobic ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa to obtain the nitrite required for growth gao et al 2018 oshiki et al 2016 yan et al 2012 this association is thought to be favored in oligotrophic environments such as the oxygen minimum zones omzs lam et al 2007 pitcher et al 2011 straka et al 2019b yan et al 2012 by the high affinities of the marine aoa for ammonia and oxygen ranging from an extremely low km app nh3 3 nm for the marine nitrosopumilus maritimus to a km app nh3 5 µm for the terrestrial moderate thermophile nitrosotenius uzonensis kits et al 2017 könneke et al 2014 leininger et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2009 qin et al 2017 wuchter et al 2006 the unique physiology of anammox has also found utility in nitrogen removal from high tn wastewater where they generally partner with putatively r strategist ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob having generally lower affinities for ammonium km app nh4 500 µm nh4 but much higher growth rates than the aoa jia and conrad 2009 kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 in these systems the organisms generally grow together as biogranules in which growth of oxygen consuming aob near the surface functions to sustain an inner anammox sub oxic core hawley et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing nitrospira species comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which possess ammonia km app nh3 63 nm kits et al 2017 and oxygen affinities likely near that of aoa suggests that they may also couple with anammox in low tn environments and have possible functions in nitrogen removal in other treatment applications comammox species are common in many natural and engineered systems including forest and agricultural soils freshwater and brackish sediments and waste and drinking water treatment plants camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 spasov et al 2020 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2020 comammox organisms produce nitrate as a product of ammonia oxidation with nitrite as an intermediate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the co occurrence of two comammox species n nitrosa and n nitrificans with anammox bacteria brocadia in an enrichment culture suggested that the intermediate nitrite is feeding anammox hence yielding in a functional relationship between these two organisms van kessel et al 2015 comammox was also found to coexist with aob and anammox in a sequencing batch reactor for sludge digester liquor treatment and responsible for 25 nitrogen removal wu et al 2019 although it is as yet unclear how much comammox contributes to tn and nitrite oxidation in water resources recovery facilities wrrfs recent analyses suggest that nitrospira can become the dominant ammonia oxidizer in wrrfs operated at low dissolved oxygen do concentrations and so offer more energy efficient nitrification roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 currently municipal waste water treatment plants generate approximately 2 billion in annual electric costs of which pumping and aeration are responsible for about two thirds of facilities energy consumption lemar and de fontaine 2017 while energy demand of water reclamation facilities is expected to grow with the population increase and water quality standards improvements anammox technology offers a 50 reduction in aeration cost in comparison to conventional treatment systems van dongen et al 2001 however the ubiquitous lithotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob create a significant obstacle for anammox implementation in mainstream full scale waste water treatment installations due to their competition with anammox for the no2 supplied by conventional aob species daims et al 2016 kent et al 2019 koops and pommerening röser 2001 third et al 2001 the higher growth rate of characterized comammox bacteria relative to aoa kits et al 2017 suggest they would function well in the mainstream therefore a pairing of anammox with an organism such as comammox that can supply no2 and have high affinities for both dissolved oxygen and tn would suppress nob and achieve low effluent nitrogen concentrations this pairing would offer an operational advantage in treatment systems relying on nitrification by lowering aeration requirements lower production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o by comammox relative to aob would offer a secondary advantage kits et al 2019 however in order for the comammox anammox pairing to stably cooperate a delicate balancing of tn and oxygen supply is imperative mathematical models have indicated that oxygen and tn concentrations are major niche differentiating factors for anammox and aoa or anammox and aob for example the association between aob aoa and anammox is often disrupted by nob competing with anammox for nitrite kent et al 2019 third et al 2001 resulting in a lower conversion of ammonia to n2 and an increase in nitrate formation thus there is clear need to resolve competitive and cooperative relationships among comammox anammox aoa aob and nob in order to develop a better predictive understanding of their roles in the global nitrogen cycle and to better define possible applications in engineered systems straka et al 2019b the comammox relationship with anammox is of specific interest since both bacteria utilize ammonia and nitrite and are active in low do environments however comparative laboratory analyses of organisms that function cooperatively at the boundary between oxic and anoxic environments have been limited for lack of appropriate experimental systems suspended microbial cultures do not form the oxygen gradient essential for partnership chemostat studies must balance the conflicting nutrient requirements for cooperative growth and are prone to washout we here use synthetic community assemblies of comammox n inopinata and anammox dominant species candidatus brocadia anammoxidans immobilized in hydrogel granules to evaluate environmental conditions supporting their partnership the hydrogel format which is a three dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers has been successfully implemented to immobilize active nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria santos et al 1996 wijffels et al 1995 denitrifying cultures xu et al 2017 anaerobes originating from hydrothermal vents landreau et al 2016 ali et al 2015 and anammox ali et al 2015 landreau et al 2020 the gels can also be formed to resemble naturally occurring biogranules flemming and wingender 2010 flemming et al 2007 in which comammox and anammox can be entrapped in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps that promotes the formation of stable nutrient gradients and microbial interactions on a micrometer scale using a synthetic hydrogel set up to achieve conditions for both aerobic and anaerobic growth we now demonstrate the formation of a stable partnership in which comammox competitively excludes the aob to supply nitrite to anammox and in turn anammox lowers nitrite to a non inhibitory concentration this is the first clear evidence for possible ecological relevance of an association that should be useful for various biotechnological applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial strains and growth comammox nitrospira inopinata strain was incubated in limited mineral media aerobically at 37 c ph 7 5 in the presence of 1mm nh4 daims et al 2015 anammox biomass was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in rotterdam sluisjesdijk the netherlands and was maintained anaerobically in a plug flow glass column supplied with 1mm nh4 and 1 3 mm no2 and operated at 30 c the dominant anammox organism in this sludge was reported to be candidatus brocadia anammoxidans van der star et al 2007 the

10 polyvinyl alcohol pva w v and 2 sodium alginate sa w v solution in water was prepared and sterilized as previously described landreau et al 2020 comammox nitrospira inopinata culture was concentrated 100 fold via 0 1 µm tangential filtration cassette millipore sigma comammox viability after filtration was assessed via incubation in the mineral medium with subsequent quantification of nitrification activity granules enriched in anammox were disaggregated using a blender for 2 minutes and resuspended in the mineral medium suspensions of comammox and anammox bacteria were mixed in a 1 1 ratio and then interspersed with the pva sa polymer solution to achieve 6 pva and 1 sa concentrations using the 0 1 mm diameter tips pva sa bacteria mixture was dropped into a 2 w v barium chloride bacl2 bath in order to form spherical hydrogel particles the hydrogel beads were allowed to harden in the bacl2 solution for 1 hour before rinsing several times in a sodium chloride solution 0 9 to remove excess polymer all solutions and medium used for the hydrogel bead production were prepared anaerobically to minimize anammox exposure to oxygen the granules were incubated in batch bottles containing an ammonia mineral media daims et al 2015 without organic carbon and their activity was monitored for 86 days three sets of comammox anammox beads were set up as biological replicates and incubated in parallel the co culture was oxygenated with ca 4 mgo2 l 3 times per week and ammonium was replenished when depleted the microbial activity was measured using colorimetric

summarized in suppl table 2 and were applied in equimolar concentration to the thin sections and incubated at 46 c for 2 hours all probes were purchased from eurofins louisville ky the slides were mounted in the vectashield antifade mounting medium cole parmer a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm700 carl zeiss germany equipped with an axio cam 503 mono camera was used to visualize

comammox and anammox bacteria establish cooperation within synthetic granules in batch cultures a hydrogel formulation was developed to entrap high numbers of the only available comammox pure culture n inopinata and an anammox enrichment dominant organism candidatus brocadia anammoxidans in synthetic polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa hydrogel beads comammox anammox beads demonstrated a constant rate of ammonium consumption over the study period of 86 days resulting in complete nitrogen removal from the system fig 1 a since no external nitrite was supplied comammox activity was the sole source of nitrite for anammox we did not observe measurable nitrite or nitrate accumulation throughout the incubation period as would be expected from comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 or anammox van de graaf et al 1996 strous et al 1999 metabolism alone beads containing only comammox stoichiometrically oxidized ammonia to nitrate with transient accumulation of nitrite fig 1b and beads containing only the anammox enrichment converted ammonium to n2 when supplied with ammonia and nitrite at the ratio of 1 1 3 fig 1c 3 2 qpcr supports anammox and comammox cooperation in hydrogel beads total bacterial abundance as measured by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna gene ranged from 105 to 106 gene copies ng 1 of granule material sampled at the beginning and the end of the incubation period from both entrapped and planktonic communities suppl fig s1 quantification of the amoa of comammox and betaproteobacterial aob and of anammox 16s rrna genes demonstrated that comammox and anammox bacteria dominated the ammonia oxidizer population in the hydrogel beads fig 2 in contrast betaproteobacterial aob were near the limit of detection in all hydrogel samples and persisted only in the fraction of non immobilized planktonic bacteria fig 2 the planktonic fraction contained mostly heterotrophic species suppl fig s1 and low amounts in amoa of comammox nitrospira inopinata and 16s rrna gene copies of anammox if compared to the bead fraction indicating that comammox and anammox were retained in the bead fraction fig 2 3 3 16s rrna sequencing demonstrated comammox n inopinata and anammox presence after the incubation period while aob and nob remained low but constant the community composition of pva sa hydrogels at the beginning and end of incubation was investigated using amplicon sequencing of the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene suppl fig s2 in total 409 operational taxonomic units otus were identified there was a substantial increase in the relative abundances of otus assigned to xanthomonadales burkholderiales rhodocyclales and rhizobiales over time indicating growth conditions favorable to heterotrophic organisms even in the absence of supplied organic carbon in the media suppl fig s2 the increase in abundance of otus for heterotrophic populations resulted in overall decreasing relative abundances for otus assigned to candidatus brocadiaceae anammox nitrospira inopinata comammox nitrosomonas aob nitrosopumilis or nitrososphaera aoa and other nitrospira nob that were not assigned to the nitrospira inopinata otu between the initial biomass and after 86 days suppl fig s3 the comammox otu accounted for 20 3 reads at the beginning of the incubation and averaged 5 15 7 73 s d n 3 at termination canonical aob aoa and nob accounted for only 0 060 0 010 and 0 020 of the reads initially and remained low throughout the experimental period with final average relative abundances of 0 010 0 017 and 0 0033 respectively s d 0 01 after 86 days of cultivation under nitrifying conditions suppl fig 3 a single otu assigned to n inopinata was the only nitrifier otu of substantial relative abundance thus it can be inferred that it alone was responsible for the observed nitrification activity fig 1 a b together this indicated that comammox was responsible for partial nitrification in support of anammox the observed apparent loss of anammox in pva sa hydrogels after 86 days as represented by 7 68 of the reads in the initial beads and 0 32 0 05 s d n 3 of the final biomass suppl fig s3 likely reflected a combination of degradative loss in the nutrient limited interior and by oxygen exposure near the outer boundary of the granules increased heterotroph abundance and poor extraction of dna from anammox cells embedded deep within hydrogel granules additionally pcr biases for the v4 v5 16s rrna gene primers may preferentially amplify other taxa that increased in abundance during incubation skewing relative abundance data orschler et al 2019 3 4 comammox and anammox species are spatially segregated within hydrogel beads given the efficient removal of nitrogen by this community we further examined the population structure using rrna targeted fish imaging and qpcr fluorescent probe amx368 hybridized anammox bacteria were detected in the initial bead samples as well as at the end of the incubation period fig 3 confirming anammox persistence within hydrogel beads following initial bead fabrication cells were dispersed in the polymer matrix while they mainly appeared on the peripheral layer of the beads after 86 days of incubation fig 3 while the comammox organisms n inopinata green was randomly distributed just after immobilization it formed a thin layer at or near the hydrogel surface following the incubation period in particular comammox cells resided in between the oxygenated edge of the hydrogel beads and the anammox cells red which were situated in a deeper presumably anoxic layer visually we observed a higher abundance not quantified of anammox using fish probes than from either amplicon or qpcr amplicon analysis probe nso1225 specific for betaproteobacterial aob did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal fig 3 suppl fig s5 4 discussion the ability of comammox microorganisms to survive under low substrate concentrations kits et al 2017 allows them to occupy oligotrophic environments cooperation with anammox bacteria has been reported in bioreactor studies van kessel et al 2015 lücker et al 2010 here we used a unique hydrogel format to pair comammox and anammox in a granule like structure engineered to promote the formation of nutrient gradients theorized to foster their co occurrence within natural habitats microbial activities in natural biofilms or biogranules generate substrate gradients allowing aerobic organisms like comammox to grow on the biofilm periphery and anaerobes like anammox in the oxygen depleted adjacent inner layers aqeel et al 2019 weber et al 2007 the hydrogel format promotes a similar relationship in a controlled laboratory setting therefore we fabricated synthetic hydrogel granules harboring a single species of comammox nitrospira inopinata and an enrichment of anammox related to brocadia the beads remained intact throughout the 86 day incubation period as previously shown in our study demonstrating retention of active aoa in hydrogel constructs landreau et al 2020 cooperation was confirmed by a nearly total nitrogen removal and negligible production of nitrate fig 1 this is the first reported encapsulation of comammox organism alone or combined with anammox consortium into hydrogels previously mentioned advantages of synthetic hydrogels combined with kinetic and metabolic potential of comammox bacteria therefore suggest a practical application of comammox comammox co cultures in manufacturing highly oxygen efficient wang et al 2019 hydrogels for nitrogen removal in engineered systems in order to confirm that observed ammonia oxidation and nitrogen removal resulted from the activity of comammox and anammox organisms and not from other ammonia oxidizers we conducted a population analysis by sequencing the hydrogel beads samples 16s rrna analysis of microbial populations from the initial beads versus those incubated for 86 days beads revealed that n inopinata remained the major aerobic ammonia oxidizer other nitrifying organisms aoa aob and nob accounted for only a small fraction of the otus 0 06 and slightly decreased in relative abundance after the incubation of 86 days suppl fig s3 these data contrasts with a previous study of a sequencing batch reactor reporting 0 1 relative abundance of anammox and high relative abundances of aob 18 vs less than 1 of comammox wu et al 2019 which did not fully support the proposed cooperation between comammox and anammox in our study however comammox was demonstrated to be responsible for partial nitrification in the constructed hydrogel beads as deduced from the virtual absence of other known ammonia oxidizing organisms on the other hand the presence of heterotrophic populations originating from the anammox enrichment culture suppl fig s2 may also have been of functional significance members of the ignavibacteria taxa some of which are capable of performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra under anoxic conditions han et al 2020 remained stable throughout the batch test also of possible relevance to nitrogen loss was the activity of populations assigned to four proteobacterial orders xanthomonadales burkholderiales rhodocyclales and rhizobiales all of which are known to contain species capable of facultative anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification finkmann et al 2000 lycus et al 2017 low nitrate concentrations in the effluent might in part be attributed to the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers relying on organic carbon from degradation of alginate biomass decay okabe et al 2005 or small organic acids produced by autotrophic organisms martiny et al 2005 rittmann et al 1994 alginate did not appear to provide a significant source of carbon since bead integrity remained stable throughout the study period and the observed nitrate consumption was inconsistent with alginate being a significant carbon source for denitrifying heterotrophs suppl table 1 although it is unclear what nutrients supported heterotopic growth the high abundance of aerobic heterotrophs suggests that oxygen and not nitrate served as the primary terminal electron acceptor as suggested by retention of sinabacteraceae zhou et al 2008 and chloroflexi tian et al 2015 bacteria which would lead to a competition between heterotrophs and n inopinata for oxygen in the outer edges of the hydrogel granules and utilizing nitrate if any within the anaerobic core volume of the granules therefore it cannot be excluded that some nitrate produced by comammox or anammox was first reduced to nitrite by denitrifiers and then utilized by anammox a more detailed analysis of the nitrogen flow through this system with n labeled compounds is warranted in order to untangle the multiple n cycle process that are may be co occurring in this system pcr based methods are known to have potential bias due to unequal amplification and cloning efficiency particularly for anammox detection using both 16s rrna regions and functional genes amplification cai et al 2020 additionally pcr biases for the v4 v5 16s rrna gene primers may preferentially amplify other taxa that increased in abundance during incubation skewing relative abundance data orschler et al 2019 thus in addition to confirming by qpcr the retention of comammox and anammox and an insignificant contribution of aob and nob fig 3 we demonstrated their expected spatial relationship using pcr independent fluorescent probes specific to the associated bacterial families fig 3 the fluorescent ntsp662 oligonucleotide probe specific to nitrospira showed that comammox cells were most abundant in the outer layer of the beads as dictated by the oxygen dependence of aerobic ammonia oxidation the few comammox cells observed deeper in the granule interior may be an artifact of introducing bacteria into the interior during the slicing procedure possibly reflecting the ability of comammox to grow at lower substrate concentrations typically present in deeper regions or inactive comammox retaining high ribosome content detectable by fish the anammox bacteria were detected using fluorescent amx368 probe and were distributed in small aggregates throughout the inner core space similarly to landreau et al 2016 but mostly clustered immediately below comammox towards the edge of the bead where substrate supply is highest predicted high affinity for oxygen therefore can explain comammox spatial localization within the outer layer of the hydrogel beads and supports a cooperative relationship between comammox and anammox in sub oxic environments demonstrating their possible ecological relevance a few variables in our cooperation model can potentially affect the performance of comammox anammox cooperation since kinetic parameters define the fitness of the strains under specific conditions straka et al 2019a a low total ammonia concentration can be limiting to anammox bacteria leading to slower conversion rates especially if the anammox species was obtained from an ammonia laden system as it is typically the case for wastewater side stream treatment systems smeulders et al 2020 additionally comammox and anammox may have differential sensitivity to various abiotic factors such as temperature ph and salinity affecting both comammox and anammox performance thus a delicate balance of these parameters has to be achieved for a stable cooperation in order to grow comammox and anammox in low ammonia environments such as the mainstream at high rate a future goal must be to enrich high affinity strains from the environment in large quantities instead of using low affinity strains from the side stream and apply them at low substrate environments straka et al 2019a together these results suggest that nitrite was consumed by anammox and not further oxidized by comammox this is in alignment with reported nitrite affinities of k m app no2 48 µm for anammox and k m app no2 449 2 μm for n inopinata suggesting that a higher rate of nitrite consumption by anammox provided a competitive advantage we also determined the nitrite half inhibition constant ki no2 0 31 0 19 mm nitrite of n inopinata and at concentrations similar to those measured in the running experiment 0 1 mm we did not observe a noticeable inhibition effect suppl fig s4 this suggests a symbiotic partnership in which anammox maintains nitrite concentrations at non inhibitory levels and comammox serves anammox by consuming oxygen and providing an anaerobic environment while also supplying nitrite however a novel comammox species candidatus nitrospira kreftii was recently identified displaying physiological characteristics distinct from n inopinata particularly candidatus n kreftii has a higher nitrite affinity k m app no2 13 µm altering its potential interactions with other nitrifiers and denitrifies sakoula et al 2021 thus for specific engineering solutions it is important to understand the kinetic parameters of different comammox species follow up studies using other anammox and comammox species once available in culture should be carried out to further investigate their co existence and activities in bioreactors the stability of comammox anammox association is suggestive of other interactions such as the release of small organic compounds e g formate from autotrophic anammox freitag et al 1987 koch et al 2015 lawson et al 2017 serving as electron donors for heterotrophs or the possible mixotrophic lifestyle of comammox in fact some nitrospira stains nitrospira moscovinensis have been reported capable of utilizing formate along with nitrate koch et al 2015 and it cannot be excluded that comammox can also follow an anaerobic lifestyle in which formate and nitrate both produced by anammox could give them a contemplative edge over other nitrifiers low nitrate accumulation sets the cooperation described here apart from previously studied systems of aob aoa and anammox or aob aoa and nob in which significant nitrate was produced while comammox co culture with anammox acts essentially similar to aob anammox system by generating nitrite for anammox consumption there are advantages of using comammox over aob in water treatment facilities comammox can possibly outcompete aob as they likely have a higher affinity for oxygen than many aob roots et al 2019 however comammox affinity for oxygen may be very similar to canonical nob since both groups belong to nitrospira and share terminal oxidases palomo et al 2018 therefore it remains to be investigated if the presence of comammox nitrospira deters nob species that usually cause operational problems in aob anammox reactors by producing undesirable nitrate as a final product our results demonstrate very little nob growth in hydrogels after 86 days of incubation supporting this hypothesis from this perspective comammox may be better adapted than aoa or aob for these engineered systems and could therefore be paired with anammox for possibly complete n removal in these systems 5 conclusions our results suggest that the recently described complete ammonia oxidizing organism n inopinata can establish a cooperative relationship with anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a synthetic granule format the spatial organization of the two organisms was consistent with their physiology demonstrating that even though these organisms may not be optimal partners they do establish a relationship that points to ecological relevance this novel cooperation was documented by the low nitrate formation and the competitiveness of the comammox organism over other aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers since nitrate is an undesirable product in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants the comammox anammox symbiosis may be of economic and ecological importance to reduce nitrogen contamination of receiving waters however heterotrophic denitrification contribution needs to be further evaluated credit

16786,phosphorus p extraction from human urine is a potential strategy to address global resource shortage but few approaches are able to obtain high quality liquid p products in this study we introduced an innovative flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi system also called ion capture electrochemical system ices for selectively extracting p and n i e urea from fresh human urine simply by integrating a liquid membrane chamber lmc using a pair of anion exchange membrane aem in the charging process negatively charged p ions i e hpo4 2 and h2po4 can be captured by acidic extraction solutions e g solutions of hcl hno3 and h2so4 on their way to the anode chamber leading to the conversion of p ions to uncharged h3po4 while other undesired ions such as cl and so4 2 are expelled simultaneously uncharged urea molecules remain in the urine effluent with the removal of salt thus high purity phosphoric acid and urea solutions can be obtained in the lmc and spacer chambers respectively the purification of p in an acidic environment is ascribed largely to the competitive migration and protonation of ions the latter contributes 27 for the selective capture of p

for additional chemicals such as mg sources and the low quality products make this crystallization process less economically attractive volpin et al 2019 particularly because of the challenge of finding markets for the recovered products trimmer and guest 2018 withers 2019 alternatively concentrating urine as liquid fertilizer for agricultural application through processes such as reverse osmosis ro membrane distillation md and freeze thawing is technologically and economically feasible naidu et al 2020 pradhan et al 2017 ray et al 2019 van der ham et al 1998 wilfert et al 2020 however the presence of potentially harmful substances such as antibiotics pathogens and viruses larsen and wigginton 2020 thapa and hanigan 2020 tortajada and van rensburg 2020 withers 2019 in concentrated products may pose longer term or uncertain environmental safety and human health risks placing greater pressure on wastewater treatment plants wwtps to make the concentrated products harmless using more complex processes arola et al 2019 therefore there is a critical need to develop simple and readily available technologies to obtain high quality p products flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi although initially proposed as an alternative salt water separation technology is emerging as an energy efficient approach for extracting nutrients from various wastewater streams bian et al 2019 fang et al 2018 xing et al 2020b xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2018 the technology has the high adsorption capability of conventional electric field driven desalination jeon et al 2013 xing et al 2020a benefits from the compact modular configuration for scale up ma et al 2020b xu et al 2021a and is also expected to be more stable during long term operation than electrodialysis ed ma et al 2018 tang et al 2017 xu et al 2021c however fcdi suffers from several inherent limitations that result in very low selectivity and complex operations specifically the selective separation of undesired ions e g cl and so4 2 the two main anions in urine from p ions is very difficult and the simultaneous separation of n resources is even more so hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c 2018 more recently selective p recovery from wastewater via protonation first proposed by wu s group xu et al 2021d has been recognized as a promising alternative technology to address these limitations a value added p rich solution was successfully obtained by simply adjusting the charging and discharging processes of fcdi using commercial components such as electrodes and ion exchange membranes iems only besides the separation process does not require use of any special chemicals under an acidic environment i e ph pk a1 2 15 while negatively charged cl ions are expelled from the flow electrode chamber uncharged h3po4 is blocked by an anion exchange membrane aem such a strategy was also demonstrated by epshtein et al 2020 for h3po4 recovery from acidic wastewater containing high concentrations of cl and so4 2 because the migration of p ions in electric field is controllable through the responsiveness of the thermodynamic equilibrium of p to ph changes bian et al 2020 epshtein et al 2020 huang et al 2017 although the technology is highly competitive with other approaches for the selective recovery of p from wastewater the selectivity product quality and cell configuration can be further improved in this study a liquid membrane chamber lmc is introduced in a conventional fcdi cell and is employed for the selective recovery of p and n i e urea from source separated fresh urine the lmc sandwiched between the spacer chamber and the anode chamber is created using two aems placed in parallel in charging process negatively charged p ions are trapped by the lmc on the way to the flow electrode chamber forming a high value added phosphoric acid solution simultaneously a urea rich solution can be obtained with the removal of charged ions from the urine stream the effects of different operating parameters such as the ratio of urine volume to extraction solution v u v ext urine hydraulic retention time hrt current density j and the type of extraction solution on the performance of fcdi were evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility for p and n recovery additionally a specific execution strategy for continuous operation of fcdi was performed ultimately this work demonstrated the opportunity for considerable improvement in selective separation and continuous operation via system design initiating a new research dimension by presenting a new strategy for p extraction from wastewater using lmc configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the fresh urine used in this study was collected from a men s toilet placed at the school of environmental science and engineering at tongji university siping road shanghai the collected fresh urine was immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm filter to remove any undissolved particles and was then stored in a cold refrigerator 4 c until use in the experiment the characteristics of the fresh urine are listed in table s1 in the supporting information si synthetic urine a su a was prepared on the basis of the elemental concentrations in fresh urine the chemical composition of su a included 1 7 g l sodium sulfate na2so4 3 35 g l potassium chloride kcl 2 9 g l sodium chloride nacl 2 65 g l sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o and 15 0 g l urea nh2 2co synthetic urine b su b was prepared by halving the concentrations of na2so4 kcl and nacl in su a the initial ph values of su a and su b were adjusted to 6 6 0 1 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl flow electrode slurry containing 5 wt carbon was prepared by mixing 4 5 wt activated carbon ac powder yec 200d yihuan china 0 5 wt

working chambers i e a pair of flow electrode chambers a spacer chamber and lmc is shown in fig s1 the lmc 56 mm 56 mm 0 5 mm consisting of two aems lf g0014 thickness 0 24 mm lvhe china was sandwiched between the spacer chamber 56 mm 56 mm 0 5 mm and the anode chamber a 100 mesh titanium mesh 56 mm 56 mm 0 15 mm was placed in the spacer chamber located between the aem and cation exchange membrane cem lf g1204 thickness 0 28 mm lvhe china to uniformly distribute the feed stream a winding flow channel total length 50 cm width 4 mm maximum depth 3 mm was carved on the surface of the graphite current collector gcc to form the flow electrode chamber fig s2 the effective contact area a eff between the iems and flow electrodes was approximately 15 0 cm2 2 3 experimental conditions flow electrode slurry was pumped into the flow electrode chambers in short circuited closed cycle scc mode at a constant volume flow of 30 ml min fig s1 thus the ions stored in the electric double layers edls were released by the mixing and neutralization of the oppositely charged electrode particles to continuously regenerate the electrodes in the external reservoir because the fcdi was operated at laboratory scale extraction solution and urine were pumped into the lmc and spacer chamber respectively in closed cycle mode i e batch mode in charging process gccs were connected to a dc power supply dp821a rigol china equipped with a voltage acquisition module unless otherwise specified the fcdi system was operated at a constant j of 20 a m2 calculated by j i a eff the electrical conductivity in the flow electrode reservoir and the urine tank were continuously monitored using conductivity meters u cds400 connected to a data acquisition system edislab pro hongrui china ph values of the urine effluent phu and extraction solution phext were monitored using a ph meter hq30d hach american in the experimental test first the feasibility of the lmc assembled fcdi system for recovering high purity p and urea was evaluated using su a according to the results the fcdi system was then optimized using su b under different conditions including the ratio of v u v ext hrt of urine stream j and different extraction solutions the significance of proton h for p extraction was investigated by comparing non proton nacl and proton hcl extraction solutions with the same ion concentration in single pass mode 70 ml urine was continuously pumped into the spacer chamber under a constant volume flow q u of 2 ml min in all experiment test the extraction solutions were circulated between the fcdi cell and the external reservoir at a volume flow q ext of 2 ml min finally the long term performance of the fcdi system for p and urea recovery was evaluated under the optimal operation conditions over 37 5 h of continuous operation a customized operation strategy in which the extraction solution was replaced when the solution ph increased to threshold was proposed all experiments were carried out at room temperature 2 4 calculations and analytical methods p purity ρ p extraction efficiency η and coexisting ion removal efficiency r c were calculated as follows

phosphorus and urea recovery fresh human urine is rich in p and n both of which exist in soluble form thapa and hanigan 2020 first the feasibility of fcdi for the recovery of p and urea from synthetic urine was investigated in charging process ions such as na k cl and h x po4 x 3 0 x 2 were separated from urine under an electric field fig 1 a leading to a decrease in the conductivity of the synthetic urine from 10 1 ms cm to below 1 0 ms cm fig s3 and the residual concentrations of cl and so4 2 decreased to 143 9 and 1 6 mg l respectively fig s4 in comparison uncharged urea molecules remained in the urine solution to form a deionized urea rich solution although unavoidable diffusion of urea 5 occurred volpin et al 2020 the purified urea rich solution could be a high quality n fertilizer alternative for direct use in agricultural production hilton et al 2021 ray et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the separation of p in the spacer chamber varied much differently than did the coexisting ions i e cl and so4 2 accordingly the charging process can be divided into two stages fig 1c initially 120 min less than 8 6 of p was removed from synthetic urine resulting in a very low capture of p 50 mg l in the extraction solution this result can be explained by the dominant contribution of coexisting anions to the ionic current due to their concentrations and preferential migration epshtein et al 2020 as the proportion of p in the total anions of synthetic urine increased fig 1d the removal rate of p increased meanwhile p ions entering the lmc were immediately converted to uncharged phosphoric acid h3po4 as they consumed free h fig s5 according to the ionization equilibria of p species h3po4 h2po4 h pka1 2 15 othman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a unlike p ion cl ion does not undergo speciation change as a function of ph thus additional cl ions are transferred to the anode chamber on account of the electric neutral equilibrium in the lmc stage 2 fig 1c ultimately the purity of p in the extraction solution increased with the capture of p and the expulsion of cl fig 1d all of the removed ions except p captured in the flow electrode electrolyte forming a brine stream fig s3 3 2 optimization of fcdi for phosphorus and urea recovery 3 2 1 volume ratios of urine to extraction solution due to the high concentration of coexisting ions i e cl and so4 2 will completely inhibit the migration of p su b was used to further evaluate the performance of fcdi for p and urea recovery at different v u v ext ratios the hrt was controlled at 7 0 min i e 140 230 and 320 min for 30 30 50 30 and 70 30 ml respectively note that su b was prepared according to the instantaneous ion concentration in su a after 120 min of charging fig 1b because competition from coexisting ions was substantially reduced as shown in figs 2 a and s6a the conductivity of urine at different ratios decreased from 5800 to 400 μs cm as the hrt increased to 7 0 min in addition the variations in the p concentration in urine at different ratios were also similar fig 2b for example a p removal efficiency of 77 1 1 1 was attained when the hrt was 6 5 min indicating that the removal of ions was positively correlated with hrt rather than the v u v ext ratio in cc mode a longer charging time enables more p ions to migrate from the spacer chamber to the lmc and thereby more p can be captured in the lmc we found that the concentration of p increased from 407 to 906 mg l with increasing v u v ext ratios from 30 30 to 70 30 fig 2d when the hrt was 7 0 leading to more cl being removed from the extraction solution fig 2c thus the final purity of the p products increased from 24 0 to 81 2 moreover the variation in phext was highly consistent with the increase in p concentration fig 2d indicating that the consumption of h was primarily dependent on the protonation of p ions once p ions entered the lmc the proton in the extraction solution was acquired by the p ions for conversion to neutral h3po4 fig 1c paltrinieri et al 2019 rotta et al 2019 therefore a v u v ext ratio of 70 30 ml was identified as optimal and the phext value is recommended as an alternative indicator of p purity in the practical application of the fcdi system 3 2 2 interaction effects of hydraulic retention time and current density fig 3 shows the performance of the fcdi system for salt removal and p recovery as a function of hrt and j note that the hrt was adjusted by adjusting v u because the urine stream was operated in batch mode the experimental design and fitting models of the response surface method rsm are shown in table s2 and text s1 respectively as shown in fig 3a the removal of coexisting anions contour line was consistent with the decrease of urine conductivity colors due to the dominant contribution of inorganic ions such as na k cl and so4 2 in the su b volpin et al 2020 as the hrt from 2 5 to 7 5 min and j from 10 to 25 a m2 increased the coexisting anions and conductivity fig s7 are expected to be completely removed moreover a higher recovery of p from extraction solution requires the removal of more p from urine fig 3b for example as the removal of p increased to 90 4 when the hrt and j were 7 5 min and 25 a m2 respectively 342 8 mg l p was recovered clearly a gradual increase of p concentration in extraction solution was accompanied by the increase in phext fig 3c even though the phext and purity were not optimal because there were not enough p ions entering the lmc a universal correlation between phext and the concentration of p was observed as shown in fig s8 the energy consumption of fcdi for salt removal and p recovery was also evaluated fig 3d shows that the energy consumption per cubic meter of urine treatment sec kwh m3 obviously increased with the increase in cell voltage at different hrts and j values fig s9 in addition sec could be a direct reflection of the desalination performance of the fcdi system because the removal of anions including p was mainly dependent on the system current and charging duration fig s8b in comparison the normalized energy consumption for per kilogram of p recovery nec kwh kg p was demonstrated to be a better way to evaluate the performance of fcdi for p recovery as the adverse effects of coexisting ions were weakened as much as possible the recovery of p was readily improved even if a higher voltage was required to support the migration of p ions fig s9a thus a low energy consumption of nec 15 kwh kg p was attained when the hrt exceeded 5 8 min in summary consideration of the desalination performance p concentration p purity and energy consumption indicated that an hrt of 7 0 min and a j of 20 a m2 were the optimal conditions for p and n recovery 3 3 significance of protonation for phosphorous recovery the commercial value of the p product derived from wastewater primarily depends on its quality i e concentration and purity thus minimized p loss and maximized undesired ion elimination are required in charging process p ions migrated together with coexisting anions and were captured by the lmc on their way to the anode gcc in this section the mechanisms of p extraction and purification in the lmc were explained by comparing the migration and transformation processes of p in non proton nacl and proton hcl extraction solutions the nonproton and proton systems clearly exhibited similar p removal figs s10a and s10b and recovery fig 4 a for both systems the concentration of p in the extraction solution firstly increased and then decreased with charging time increased and the peak concentrations of p increased up to 854 non proton and 684 mg l proton respectively this result can be explained by the difference of p migration rate from the spacer chamber to the lmc that is the migration of p at acidic environment was limited by the protonation of p ions fig s10b moreover the similar variations of phu indicates that the transfer of h between aems can be ignored figs s11a and s11b the gradual decrease in phu was probably ascribed to the splitting of water at the membrane dilute solution interface and the generation of h ions from the dissociation of p species belashova et al 2017 similar results were observed by rotta et al 2019 and xu et al 2021d after 320 min of charging fig 4b only 70 of coexisting ions i e cl were removed from the nonproton system compared to more than 96 in the proton system notably the p ions captured by nonproton extraction solution were still present as negatively charged p ions i e h2po4 and hpo4 2 pka2 7 20 xu et al 2021d thus the purification of the p product in the extraction solution was primarily ascribed to the concentration gap and innate differences in migration rate between coexisting ions and p ions i e competitive migration effect fig 4c previous studies have demonstrated that cl is preferentially driven over singly charged h2po4 by an electric field because of the smaller ionic hydration radius ihr of cl bian et al 2020 gamaethiralalage et al 2020 huang et al 2017 in the proton system however p ions entering the lmc were immediately converted to uncharged h3po4 and an additional amount of cl was expelled from the extraction solution due to the charge equilibrium gamaethiralalage et al 2020 additionally it was found that the equilibrium of p species shifted toward h2po4 when phext was higher than pka1 fig s11b with the gradual increase in the contribution of p ions to the ionic current i e the contribution of coexisting ions decreased the concentrations of cl and so4 2 in the nonproton system cannot be eliminated fig s12 as a result fig 4c a higher purity of the phosphoric acid product maximum ρ 90 0 was attained in the proton system than in the nonproton system maximum ρ 63 5 thus it can be concluded that the protonation effect contributes 27 to the selective capture of p in the lmc fig s13 furthermore the concentration of so4 2 in extraction solution shows a similar variation behavior fig s12b to the concentration of p due to the competition effect and the protonation of so4 2 i e so4 2 hso4 pka2 1 99 rotta et al 2019 although the transformation of divalent so4 2 to monovalent hso4 results in a decrease in the electromigration rate of so4 2 species charged hso4 can still be removed from extraction solution with the removal of coexisting ions to further evaluate the protonation behavior of p in the lmc under different h concentrations i e ph0 2 00 1 70 1 43 and 1 20 the su b was pumped into the spacer chamber in a single pass mode to maintain a constant separation rate of ion in feed stream it was clearly found that the recovery rate of p in the lmc gradually decreased until the maximum concentration is reached compared to the batch mode this result should be ascribed to the consumption of h in the extraction solution fig 4f thus the ceiling concentrations of p were increased from 300 to 1900 mg l with the h concentrations calculated by h 10 ph0 mol l increased from 0 01 to 0 063 mol l fig 4d meanwhile coexisting ions in the extraction solution were eliminated with charging time increased until the system reached equilibrium the capture rate of ions is equal to their removal rate leading to the increase of ρ to exceed 70 figs 4e and s14 although the concentration and purity of p products are expected to be further increase with h concentration increases the trade off between the p concentration and purity should be considered in the application of fcdi to urine treatment furthermore h leakage could not be avoided as the concentration difference between the two sides of the aem increased therefore phext 2 0 was chosen as the threshold to obtain acceptable p product the concentration and purity of p were 620 mg l and 90 0 respectively at hrt 6 8 min at this juncture fig s15 only a very low proportion 7 5 of p was remained in urine stream 3 4 alternative extraction solutions for phosphoric acid recovery in the above experiments dilute hydrochloric acid was used as an extraction solution for p extraction from synthetic urine the results indicated that the protons provided by hcl enables the transformation of negatively charged p ions to uncharged h3po4 molecules cl ions as coexisting anions were effectively removed from the extraction solution to realize the purification of phosphoric acid to further evaluate the potential of fcdi in practical applications three alternative solutions i e hno3 h2so4 and mixed acid solutions were evaluated at a same h concentration i e ph0 1 43 note that the mixture was prepared by mixing the same volumes of hcl hno3 and h2so4 as shown in fig 5 all four extraction solutions exhibited good extraction and purification with charging time increased from 290 to 350 min i e the hrt increased from 6 2 to 7 5 min the residual p concentrations in urine i e su b were decreased to 44 3 34 5 38 and 27 3 mg l for hcl hno3 h2so4 and mixed acid systems respectively at hrt 6 9 min the concentration of p in all four systems reached the peak values which were 898 5 889 900 5 and 1008 mg l above phext 2 0 figs s16 a d the capture concentrations fig 5 a d and extraction efficiencies fig 5 e h of p began to decline due to the deprotonation of h3po4 notably the purities of p obtained with the four extraction solutions were eventually increased to 86 2 87 0 87 8 and 91 9 suggesting that hcl hno3 and h2so4 can be used as alternative extraction solutions for p recovery a high concentration and high purity of phosphoric acid can be obtained at phext of 2 0 consequently further purification of the extraction solution was primarily dependent on the protons provided by the acidic extraction solution rather than the coexisting ions i e cl no3 and so4 2 furthermore it is expected that various acidic wastewaters can also be used as alternative extraction solutions to reduce the operating cost of fcdi systems in practical applications 3 5 execution strategy for fcdi during long term operation on the basis of the results obtained from the above experiments a continuous operation t 2250 min experiment was performed to verify the feasibility of fcdi for phosphoric acid and urea recovery from fresh human urine under the optimal operating conditions i e v u v ext 70 30 ph0 1 43 j 20 a m2 and threshold phext 2 0 the main components of the fresh urine are listed in table s1 to realize continuous recovery of high purity phosphoric acid the extraction solution was replaced with fresh solution when phext was increased to the threshold as shown in fig 6 a the conductivity of fresh urine linearly decreased from 16 0 to 1 43 ms cm after 2250 min of charging while 72 5 7 4 g l urea remained in the fresh urine compared to that in synthetic urine urea in fresh urine underwent hydrolysis to form ammonium and bicarbonate due to urease enzymes naturally present in fresh urine fig s17a mccartney et al 2020 volpin et al 2020 resulting in an increase in phu fig s17b apart from the electromigration of nh4 the elimination of nh4 n from urine is partly result of the transformation of ammonium into ammonia gas as phu and temperature increase pradhan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 when the charging time exceeded 1800 min the hydrolysis of urea became more violent probably due to the growth of bacteria at room temperature ray et al 2019 in the first stage t 1380 min the concentration of p in fresh urine slightly decreased due to the competition with coexisting ions for the ionic current causing a very low capture of p 120 mg l in the extraction solution meanwhile the slightly increases in the concentrations of cl and so4 2 figs s17c and s17d can be explained by the spontaneous diffusion of ions through the iems because of concentration polarization tanaka 2004 to reach charge equilibrium of ions in the lmc phext was decreased from 1 46 to 1 41 fig 6b when the conductivity of fresh urine was decreased to below 6 0 ms cm the migration of p became more competitive these results are consistent with the above experiments using synthetic urine with the capture of p by the extraction solution negatively charged p ions were transformed to neutral h3po4 molecules by acquiring proton from hcl resulting in an increase in phext the maximum concentration of p c p e x t 811 mg l was attained with an increase of phext from 1 43 to 1 95 notably further prolongation of the charging time to 2130 min enabled ρ increased to 92 85 due to the further removal of coexisting ions figs s17c and s17d however once phext exceeded the threshold the concentration of p and the η start to decrease therefore the phosphoric acid product i e the original extraction solution was replaced with a fresh extraction solution ph0 1 46 v ext 30 ml as expected high purity phosphoric acid c p e x t 522 mg l and ρ 73 0 was obtained as the phext increased to 2 1 these results verified the feasibility and long term stability of fcdi for phosphoric acid and urea recovery from fresh human urine a threshold ph is proposed as an intuitive parameter to determine the quality of the p product however the continuous operation of fcdi in practical applications would be limited by the occurrence of membrane fouling because the composition of fresh human urine is very complex additional cell voltage was required to support the migration of ions and caused considerably high energy consumption as shown in fig 6 c l aem fouling occurred on the surface and inside the membrane specifically the former can be ascribed to the deposition of ca s and mg s compounds for the latter the generation of mg p compounds make the ion channel of aem prone to clogging in addition the hydrolysis of urea should be prevented as much as possible as the production of carbonate bicarbonate will cause the precipitation of ca2 and mg2 therefore a pretreatment process to remove ca mg and organics from fresh human urine is recommended before fcdi operation hilton et al 2021 among the existing techniques adjusting urine ph to alkalinity can not only remove ca and mg by precipitation but also effectively inhibit the hydrolysis of urea 4 conclusions human urine is considered a potential nutrient resource rather than a wastewater but there are few approaches to simultaneously achieve selective recovery of p and n the results of this study indicated that the developed fcdi system is an alternative promising technology for phosphorus and urea recovery from fresh urine the urea rich solution obtained in the spacer chamber can be directly used as value added liquid urea fertilizer due to the removal of salts pradhan et al 2017 volpin et al 2019 with the capture of p ions and the removal of coexisting ions the p product in the acidic extraction solution was gradually concentrated and purified to form high quality phosphoric acid nonetheless the trade off between selectivity and extraction efficiency should be considered in the practical application of fcdi for p recovery from urine it is expected that the phosphoric acid with a purity of more than 90 can be obtained at the expense of portion of the concentration and extraction efficiency to maximize the recovery performance of p a threshold ph of 2 0 is proposed as an intuitive indicator to determine the quality of the p product it was demonstrated that the capture of p does not significantly decrease provided that the p product is replaced periodically such that the deprotonation of trapped p is inhibited fig 6 while this study is focused on the selective recovery of p from fresh urine containing large amounts of coexisting anions as a technological example the mechanistic insights revealed in this study can be expanded to other ion separation processes such as those for nh4 and short chain fatty acids e g hcoo and ch3coo by integrating lmc configuration into other electrochemical systems such as membrane cdi mcdi and ed therefore we hereby refer to the devices with lmc configuration or similar separation principle as ion capture electrochemical system ices it is also envisaged that the developed ices can achieve continuous and steady operation by controlling the urine stream and extraction solution in single pass mode however challenges related to optimizing the separation performance i e ion selectivity salt removal rate and adsorption capability system design i e electrodes current collectors and cell configuration and long term stability i e electrode electrolyte separation membrane fouling flow channel clogging and electrode capacity fading must be overcome in future studies liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020a xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021a of particular interest however is the low energy consumption as the preferential elimination of ca2 and mg2 from fresh human urine reduces the cell voltage requirement dramatically

16786,phosphorus p extraction from human urine is a potential strategy to address global resource shortage but few approaches are able to obtain high quality liquid p products in this study we introduced an innovative flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi system also called ion capture electrochemical system ices for selectively extracting p and n i e urea from fresh human urine simply by integrating a liquid membrane chamber lmc using a pair of anion exchange membrane aem in the charging process negatively charged p ions i e hpo4 2 and h2po4 can be captured by acidic extraction solutions e g solutions of hcl hno3 and h2so4 on their way to the anode chamber leading to the conversion of p ions to uncharged h3po4 while other undesired ions such as cl and so4 2 are expelled simultaneously uncharged urea molecules remain in the urine effluent with the removal of salt thus high purity phosphoric acid and urea solutions can be obtained in the lmc and spacer chambers respectively the purification of p in an acidic environment is ascribed largely to the competitive migration and protonation of ions the latter contributes 27 for the selective capture of p

is estimated that trapping all of the p in human excreta i e urine and feces could meet approximately 20 of the worldwide p fertilizer demand elser and bennett 2011 withers 2019 in addition human urine is rich in nitrogen n resources 5 kg m3 randall et al 2016 volpin et al 2019 making the extraction of nutrients from urine even more environmentally and economically significant and providing a way to protect precious freshwater supplies from contamination alewell et al 2020 despite these beneficial aspects several technological challenges exist for the practical recovery of p from human urine chemical crystallization methods producing slow release p fertilizers such as struvite mg p vivianite fe p and hydroxyapatite ca p are broadly implemented for p and n recovery from wastewater lei et al 2017 wilfert et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the feasibility of using struvite technology has been demonstrated in full scale applications desmidt et al 2015 sikosana et al 2017 however the need for additional chemicals such as mg sources and the low quality products make this crystallization process less economically attractive volpin et al 2019 particularly because of the challenge of finding markets for the recovered products trimmer and guest 2018 withers 2019 alternatively concentrating urine as liquid fertilizer for agricultural application through processes such as reverse osmosis ro membrane distillation md and freeze thawing is technologically and economically feasible naidu et al 2020 pradhan et al 2017 ray et al 2019 van der ham et al 1998 wilfert et al 2020 however the presence of potentially harmful substances such as antibiotics pathogens and viruses larsen and wigginton 2020 thapa and hanigan 2020 tortajada and van rensburg 2020 withers 2019 in concentrated products may pose longer term or uncertain environmental safety and human health risks placing greater pressure on wastewater treatment plants wwtps to make the concentrated products harmless using more complex processes arola et al 2019 therefore there is a critical need to develop simple and readily available technologies to obtain high quality p products flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi although initially proposed as an alternative salt water separation technology is emerging as an energy efficient approach for extracting nutrients from various wastewater streams bian et al 2019 fang et al 2018 xing et al 2020b xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2018 the technology has the high adsorption capability of conventional electric field driven desalination jeon et al 2013 xing et al 2020a benefits from the compact modular configuration for scale up ma et al 2020b xu et al 2021a and is also expected to be more stable during long term operation than electrodialysis ed ma et al 2018 tang et al 2017 xu et al 2021c however fcdi suffers from several inherent limitations that result in very low selectivity and complex operations specifically the selective separation of undesired ions e g cl and so4 2 the two main anions in urine from p ions is very difficult and the simultaneous separation of n resources is even more so hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c 2018 more recently selective p recovery from wastewater via protonation first proposed by wu s group xu et al 2021d has been recognized as a promising alternative technology to address these limitations a value added p rich solution was successfully obtained by simply adjusting the charging and discharging processes of fcdi using commercial components such as electrodes and ion exchange membranes iems only besides the separation process does not require use of any special chemicals under an acidic environment i e ph pk a1 2 15 while negatively charged cl ions are expelled from the flow electrode chamber uncharged h3po4 is blocked by an anion exchange membrane aem such a strategy was also demonstrated by epshtein et al 2020 for h3po4 recovery from acidic wastewater containing high concentrations of cl and so4 2 because the migration of p ions in electric field is controllable through the responsiveness of the thermodynamic equilibrium of p to ph changes bian et al 2020 epshtein et al 2020 huang et al 2017 although the technology is highly competitive with other approaches for the selective recovery of p from wastewater the selectivity product quality and cell configuration can be further improved in this study a liquid membrane chamber lmc is introduced in a conventional fcdi cell and is employed for the selective recovery of p and n i e urea from source separated fresh urine the lmc sandwiched between the spacer chamber and the anode chamber is created using two aems placed in parallel in charging process negatively charged p ions are trapped by the lmc on the way to the flow electrode chamber forming a high value added phosphoric acid solution simultaneously a urea rich solution can be obtained with the removal of charged ions from the urine stream the effects of different operating parameters such as the ratio of urine volume to extraction solution v u v ext urine hydraulic retention time hrt current density j and the type of extraction solution on the performance of fcdi were evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility for p and n recovery additionally a specific execution strategy for continuous operation of fcdi was performed ultimately this work demonstrated the opportunity for considerable improvement in selective separation and continuous operation via system design initiating a new research dimension by presenting a new strategy for p extraction from wastewater using lmc configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the fresh urine used in this study was collected from a men s toilet placed at the school of environmental science and engineering at tongji university siping road shanghai the collected fresh urine was immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm filter to remove any undissolved particles and was then stored in a cold refrigerator 4 c until use in the experiment the characteristics of the fresh urine are listed in table s1 in the supporting information si synthetic urine a su a was prepared on the basis of the elemental concentrations in fresh urine the chemical composition of su a included 1 7 g l sodium sulfate na2so4 3 35 g l potassium chloride kcl 2 9 g l sodium chloride nacl 2 65 g l sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o and 15 0 g l urea nh2 2co synthetic urine b su b was prepared by halving the concentrations of na2so4 kcl and nacl in su a the initial ph values of su a and su b were adjusted to 6 6 0 1 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl flow electrode slurry containing 5 wt carbon was prepared by mixing 4 5 wt activated carbon ac powder yec 200d yihuan china 0 5 wt

sandwiched between the spacer chamber 56 mm 56 mm 0 5 mm and the anode chamber a 100 mesh titanium mesh 56 mm 56 mm 0 15 mm was placed in the spacer chamber located between the aem and cation exchange membrane cem lf g1204 thickness 0 28 mm lvhe china to uniformly distribute the feed stream a winding flow channel total length 50 cm width 4 mm maximum depth 3 mm was carved on the surface of the graphite current collector gcc to form the flow electrode chamber fig s2 the effective contact area a eff between the iems and flow electrodes was approximately 15 0 cm2 2 3 experimental conditions flow electrode slurry was pumped into the flow electrode chambers in short circuited closed cycle scc mode at a constant volume flow of 30 ml min fig s1 thus the ions stored in the electric double layers edls were released by the mixing and neutralization of the oppositely charged electrode particles to continuously regenerate the electrodes in the external reservoir because the fcdi was operated at laboratory scale extraction solution and urine were pumped into the lmc and spacer chamber respectively in closed cycle mode i e batch mode in charging process gccs were connected to a dc power supply dp821a rigol china equipped with a voltage acquisition module unless otherwise specified the fcdi system was operated at a constant j of 20 a m2 calculated by j i a eff the electrical conductivity in the flow electrode reservoir and the urine tank were continuously monitored using conductivity meters u cds400 connected to a data acquisition system edislab pro hongrui china ph values of the urine effluent phu and extraction solution phext were monitored using a ph meter hq30d hach american in the experimental test first the feasibility of the lmc assembled fcdi system for recovering high purity p and urea was evaluated using su a according to the results the fcdi system was then optimized using su b under different conditions including the ratio of v u v ext hrt of urine stream j and different extraction solutions the significance of proton h for p extraction was investigated by comparing non proton nacl and proton hcl extraction solutions with the same ion concentration in single pass mode 70 ml urine was continuously pumped into the spacer chamber under a constant volume flow q u of 2 ml min in all experiment test the extraction solutions were circulated between the fcdi cell and the external reservoir at a volume flow q ext of 2 ml min finally the long term performance of the fcdi system for p and urea recovery was evaluated under the optimal operation conditions over 37 5 h of continuous operation a customized operation strategy in which the extraction solution was replaced when the solution ph increased to threshold was proposed all experiments were carried out at room temperature 2 4 calculations and analytical methods p purity ρ p extraction efficiency η and coexisting ion removal efficiency r c were calculated as follows

phosphorus and urea recovery fresh human urine is rich in p and n both of which exist in soluble form thapa and hanigan 2020 first the feasibility of fcdi for the recovery of p and urea from synthetic urine was investigated in charging process ions such as na k cl and h x po4 x 3 0 x 2 were separated from urine under an electric field fig 1 a leading to a decrease in the conductivity of the synthetic urine from 10 1 ms cm to below 1 0 ms cm fig s3 and the residual concentrations of cl and so4 2 decreased to 143 9 and 1 6 mg l respectively fig s4 in comparison uncharged urea molecules remained in the urine solution to form a deionized urea rich solution although unavoidable diffusion of urea 5 occurred volpin et al 2020 the purified urea rich solution could be a high quality n fertilizer alternative for direct use in agricultural production hilton et al 2021 ray et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the separation of p in the spacer chamber varied much differently than did the coexisting ions i e cl and so4 2 accordingly the charging process can be divided into two stages fig 1c initially 120 min less than 8 6 of p was removed from synthetic urine resulting in a very low capture of p 50 mg l in the extraction solution this result can be explained by the dominant contribution of coexisting anions to the ionic current due to their concentrations and preferential migration epshtein et al 2020 as the proportion of p in the total anions of synthetic urine increased fig 1d the removal rate of p increased meanwhile p ions entering the lmc were immediately converted to uncharged phosphoric acid h3po4 as they consumed free h fig s5 according to the ionization equilibria of p species h3po4 h2po4 h pka1 2 15 othman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a unlike p ion cl ion does not undergo speciation change as a function of ph thus additional cl ions are transferred to the anode chamber on account of the electric neutral equilibrium in the lmc stage 2 fig 1c ultimately the purity of p in the extraction solution increased with the capture of p and the expulsion of cl fig 1d all of the removed ions except p captured in the flow electrode electrolyte forming a brine stream fig s3 3 2 optimization of fcdi for phosphorus and urea recovery 3 2 1 volume ratios of urine to extraction solution due to the high concentration of coexisting ions i e cl and so4 2 will completely inhibit the migration of p su b was used to further evaluate the performance of fcdi for p and urea recovery at different v u v ext ratios the hrt was controlled at 7 0 min i e 140 230 and 320 min for 30 30 50 30 and 70 30 ml respectively note that su b was prepared according to the instantaneous ion concentration in su a after 120 min of charging fig 1b because competition from coexisting ions was substantially reduced as shown in figs 2 a and s6a the conductivity of urine at different ratios decreased from 5800 to 400 μs cm as the hrt increased to 7 0 min in addition the variations in the p concentration in urine at different ratios were also similar fig 2b for example a p removal efficiency of 77 1 1 1 was attained when the hrt was 6 5 min indicating that the removal of ions was positively correlated with hrt rather than the v u v ext ratio in cc mode a longer charging time enables more p ions to migrate from the spacer chamber to the lmc and thereby more p can be captured in the lmc we found that the concentration of p increased from 407 to 906 mg l with increasing v u v ext ratios from 30 30 to 70 30 fig 2d when the hrt was 7 0 leading to more cl being removed from the extraction solution fig 2c thus the final purity of the p products increased from 24 0 to 81 2 moreover the variation in phext was highly consistent with the increase in p concentration fig 2d indicating that the consumption of h was primarily dependent on the protonation of p ions once p ions entered the lmc the proton in the extraction solution was acquired by the p ions for conversion to neutral h3po4 fig 1c paltrinieri et al 2019 rotta et al 2019 therefore a v u v ext ratio of 70 30 ml was identified as optimal and the phext value is recommended as an alternative indicator of p purity in the practical application of the fcdi system 3 2 2 interaction effects of hydraulic retention time and current density fig 3 shows the performance of the fcdi system for salt removal and p recovery as a function of hrt and j note that the hrt was adjusted by adjusting v u because the urine stream was operated in batch mode the experimental design and fitting models of the response surface method rsm are shown in table s2 and text s1 respectively as shown in fig 3a the removal of coexisting anions contour line was consistent with the decrease of urine conductivity colors due to the dominant contribution of inorganic ions such as na k cl and so4 2 in the su b volpin et al 2020 as the hrt from 2 5 to 7 5 min and j from 10 to 25 a m2 increased the coexisting anions and conductivity fig s7 are expected to be completely removed moreover a higher recovery of p from extraction solution requires the removal of more p from urine fig 3b for example as the removal of p increased to 90 4 when the hrt and j were 7 5 min and 25 a m2 respectively 342 8 mg l p was recovered clearly a gradual increase of p concentration in extraction solution was accompanied by the increase in phext fig 3c even though the phext and purity were not optimal because there were not enough p ions entering the lmc a universal correlation between phext and the concentration of p was observed as shown in fig s8 the energy consumption of fcdi for salt removal and p recovery was also evaluated fig 3d shows that the energy consumption per cubic meter of urine treatment sec kwh m3 obviously increased with the increase in cell voltage at different hrts and j values fig s9 in addition sec could be a direct reflection of the desalination performance of the fcdi system because the removal of anions including p was mainly dependent on the system current and charging duration fig s8b in comparison the normalized energy consumption for per kilogram of p recovery nec kwh kg p was demonstrated to be a better way to evaluate the performance of fcdi for p recovery as the adverse effects of coexisting ions were weakened as much as possible the recovery of p was readily improved even if a higher voltage was required to support the migration of p ions fig s9a thus a low energy consumption of nec 15 kwh kg p was attained when the hrt exceeded 5 8 min in summary consideration of the desalination performance p concentration p purity and energy consumption indicated that an hrt of 7 0 min and a j of 20 a m2 were the optimal conditions for p and n recovery 3 3 significance of protonation for phosphorous recovery the commercial value of the p product derived from wastewater primarily depends on its quality i e concentration and purity thus minimized p loss and maximized undesired ion elimination are required in charging process p ions migrated together with coexisting anions and were captured by the lmc on their way to the anode gcc in this section the mechanisms of p extraction and purification in the lmc were explained by comparing the migration and transformation processes of p in non proton nacl and proton hcl extraction solutions the nonproton and proton systems clearly exhibited similar p removal figs s10a and s10b and recovery fig 4 a for both systems the concentration of p in the extraction solution firstly increased and then decreased with charging time increased and the peak concentrations of p increased up to 854 non proton and 684 mg l proton respectively this result can be explained by the difference of p migration rate from the spacer chamber to the lmc that is the migration of p at acidic environment was limited by the protonation of p ions fig s10b moreover the similar variations of phu indicates that the transfer of h between aems can be ignored figs s11a and s11b the gradual decrease in phu was probably ascribed to the splitting of water at the membrane dilute solution interface and the generation of h ions from the dissociation of p species belashova et al 2017 similar results were observed by rotta et al 2019 and xu et al 2021d after 320 min of charging fig 4b only 70 of coexisting ions i e cl were removed from the nonproton system compared to more than 96 in the proton system notably the p ions captured by nonproton extraction solution were still present as negatively charged p ions i e h2po4 and hpo4 2 pka2 7 20 xu et al 2021d thus the purification of the p product in the extraction solution was primarily ascribed to the concentration gap and innate differences in migration rate between coexisting ions and p ions i e competitive migration effect fig 4c previous studies have demonstrated that cl is preferentially driven over singly charged h2po4 by an electric field because of the smaller ionic hydration radius ihr of cl bian et al 2020 gamaethiralalage et al 2020 huang et al 2017 in the proton system however p ions entering the lmc were immediately converted to uncharged h3po4 and an additional amount of cl was expelled from the extraction solution due to the charge equilibrium gamaethiralalage et al 2020 additionally it was found that the equilibrium of p species shifted toward h2po4 when phext was higher than pka1 fig s11b with the gradual increase in the contribution of p ions to the ionic current i e the contribution of coexisting ions decreased the concentrations of cl and so4 2 in the nonproton system cannot be eliminated fig s12 as a result fig 4c a higher purity of the phosphoric acid product maximum ρ 90 0 was attained in the proton system than in the nonproton system maximum ρ 63 5 thus it can be concluded that the protonation effect contributes 27 to the selective capture of p in the lmc fig s13 furthermore the concentration of so4 2 in extraction solution shows a similar variation behavior fig s12b to the concentration of p due to the competition effect and the protonation of so4 2 i e so4 2 hso4 pka2 1 99 rotta et al 2019 although the transformation of divalent so4 2 to monovalent hso4 results in a decrease in the electromigration rate of so4 2 species charged hso4 can still be removed from extraction solution with the removal of coexisting ions to further evaluate the protonation behavior of p in the lmc under different h concentrations i e ph0 2 00 1 70 1 43 and 1 20 the su b was pumped into the spacer chamber in a single pass mode to maintain a constant separation rate of ion in feed stream it was clearly found that the recovery rate of p in the lmc gradually decreased until the maximum concentration is reached compared to the batch mode this result should be ascribed to the consumption of h in the extraction solution fig 4f thus the ceiling concentrations of p were increased from 300 to 1900 mg l with the h concentrations calculated by h 10 ph0 mol l increased from 0 01 to 0 063 mol l fig 4d meanwhile coexisting ions in the extraction solution were eliminated with charging time increased until the system reached equilibrium the capture rate of ions is equal to their removal rate leading to the increase of ρ to exceed 70 figs 4e and s14 although the concentration and purity of p products are expected to be further increase with h concentration increases the trade off between the p concentration and purity should be considered in the application of fcdi to urine treatment furthermore h leakage could not be avoided as the concentration difference between the two sides of the aem increased therefore phext 2 0 was chosen as the threshold to obtain acceptable p product the concentration and purity of p were 620 mg l and 90 0 respectively at hrt 6 8 min at this juncture fig s15 only a very low proportion 7 5 of p was remained in urine stream 3 4 alternative extraction solutions for phosphoric acid recovery in the above experiments dilute hydrochloric acid was used as an extraction solution for p extraction from synthetic urine the results indicated that the protons provided by hcl enables the transformation of negatively charged p ions to uncharged h3po4 molecules cl ions as coexisting anions were effectively removed from the extraction solution to realize the purification of phosphoric acid to further evaluate the potential of fcdi in practical applications three alternative solutions i e hno3 h2so4 and mixed acid solutions were evaluated at a same h concentration i e ph0 1 43 note that the mixture was prepared by mixing the same volumes of hcl hno3 and h2so4 as shown in fig 5 all four extraction solutions exhibited good extraction and purification with charging time increased from 290 to 350 min i e the hrt increased from 6 2 to 7 5 min the residual p concentrations in urine i e su b were decreased to 44 3 34 5 38 and 27 3 mg l for hcl hno3 h2so4 and mixed acid systems respectively at hrt 6 9 min the concentration of p in all four systems reached the peak values which were 898 5 889 900 5 and 1008 mg l above phext 2 0 figs s16 a d the capture concentrations fig 5 a d and extraction efficiencies fig 5 e h of p began to decline due to the deprotonation of h3po4 notably the purities of p obtained with the four extraction solutions were eventually increased to 86 2 87 0 87 8 and 91 9 suggesting that hcl hno3 and h2so4 can be used as alternative extraction solutions for p recovery a high concentration and high purity of phosphoric acid can be obtained at phext of 2 0 consequently further purification of the extraction solution was primarily dependent on the protons provided by the acidic extraction solution rather than the coexisting ions i e cl no3 and so4 2 furthermore it is expected that various acidic wastewaters can also be used as alternative extraction solutions to reduce the operating cost of fcdi systems in practical applications 3 5 execution strategy for fcdi during long term operation on the basis of the results obtained from the above experiments a continuous operation t 2250 min experiment was performed to verify the feasibility of fcdi for phosphoric acid and urea recovery from fresh human urine under the optimal operating conditions i e v u v ext 70 30 ph0 1 43 j 20 a m2 and threshold phext 2 0 the main components of the fresh urine are listed in table s1 to realize continuous recovery of high purity phosphoric acid the extraction solution was replaced with fresh solution when phext was increased to the threshold as shown in fig 6 a the conductivity of fresh urine linearly decreased from 16 0 to 1 43 ms cm after 2250 min of charging while 72 5 7 4 g l urea remained in the fresh urine compared to that in synthetic urine urea in fresh urine underwent hydrolysis to form ammonium and bicarbonate due to urease enzymes naturally present in fresh urine fig s17a mccartney et al 2020 volpin et al 2020 resulting in an increase in phu fig s17b apart from the electromigration of nh4 the elimination of nh4 n from urine is partly result of the transformation of ammonium into ammonia gas as phu and temperature increase pradhan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 when the charging time exceeded 1800 min the hydrolysis of urea became more violent probably due to the growth of bacteria at room temperature ray et al 2019 in the first stage t 1380 min the concentration of p in fresh urine slightly decreased due to the competition with coexisting ions for the ionic current causing a very low capture of p 120 mg l in the extraction solution meanwhile the slightly increases in the concentrations of cl and so4 2 figs s17c and s17d can be explained by the spontaneous diffusion of ions through the iems because of concentration polarization tanaka 2004 to reach charge equilibrium of ions in the lmc phext was decreased from 1 46 to 1 41 fig 6b when the conductivity of fresh urine was decreased to below 6 0 ms cm the migration of p became more competitive these results are consistent with the above experiments using synthetic urine with the capture of p by the extraction solution negatively charged p ions were transformed to neutral h3po4 molecules by acquiring proton from hcl resulting in an increase in phext the maximum concentration of p c p e x t 811 mg l was attained with an increase of phext from 1 43 to 1 95 notably further prolongation of the charging time to 2130 min enabled ρ increased to 92 85 due to the further removal of coexisting ions figs s17c and s17d however once phext exceeded the threshold the concentration of p and the η start to decrease therefore the phosphoric acid product i e the original extraction solution was replaced with a fresh extraction solution ph0 1 46 v ext 30 ml as expected high purity phosphoric acid c p e x t 522 mg l and ρ 73 0 was obtained as the phext increased to 2 1 these results verified the feasibility and long term stability of fcdi for phosphoric acid and urea recovery from fresh human urine a threshold ph is proposed as an intuitive parameter to determine the quality of the p product however the continuous operation of fcdi in practical applications would be limited by the occurrence of membrane fouling because the composition of fresh human urine is very complex additional cell voltage was required to support the migration of ions and caused considerably high energy consumption as shown in fig 6 c l aem fouling occurred on the surface and inside the membrane specifically the former can be ascribed to the deposition of ca s and mg s compounds for the latter the generation of mg p compounds make the ion channel of aem prone to clogging in addition the hydrolysis of urea should be prevented as much as possible as the production of carbonate bicarbonate will cause the precipitation of ca2 and mg2 therefore a pretreatment process to remove ca mg and organics from fresh human urine is recommended before fcdi operation hilton et al 2021 among the existing techniques adjusting urine ph to alkalinity can not only remove ca and mg by precipitation but also effectively inhibit the hydrolysis of urea 4 conclusions human urine is considered a potential nutrient resource rather than a wastewater but there are few approaches to simultaneously achieve selective recovery of p and n the results of this study indicated that the developed fcdi system is an alternative promising technology for phosphorus and urea recovery from fresh urine the urea rich solution obtained in the spacer chamber can be directly used as value added liquid urea fertilizer due to the removal of salts pradhan et al 2017 volpin et al 2019 with the capture of p ions and the removal of coexisting ions the p product in the acidic extraction solution was gradually concentrated and purified to form high quality phosphoric acid nonetheless the trade off between selectivity and extraction efficiency should be considered in the practical application of fcdi for p recovery from urine it is expected that the phosphoric acid with a purity of more than 90 can be obtained at the expense of portion of the concentration and extraction efficiency to maximize the recovery performance of p a threshold ph of 2 0 is proposed as an intuitive indicator to determine the quality of the p product it was demonstrated that the capture of p does not significantly decrease provided that the p product is replaced periodically such that the deprotonation of trapped p is inhibited fig 6 while this study is focused on the selective recovery of p from fresh urine containing large amounts of coexisting anions as a technological example the mechanistic insights revealed in this study can be expanded to other ion separation processes such as those for nh4 and short chain fatty acids e g hcoo and ch3coo by integrating lmc configuration into other electrochemical systems such as membrane cdi mcdi and ed therefore we hereby refer to the devices with lmc configuration or similar separation principle as ion capture electrochemical system ices it is also envisaged that the developed ices can achieve continuous and steady operation by controlling the urine stream and extraction solution in single pass mode however challenges related to optimizing the separation performance i e ion selectivity salt removal rate and adsorption capability system design i e electrodes current collectors and cell configuration and long term stability i e electrode electrolyte separation membrane fouling flow channel clogging and electrode capacity fading must be overcome in future studies liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020a xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021a of particular interest however is the low energy consumption as the preferential elimination of ca2 and mg2 from fresh human urine reduces the cell voltage requirement dramatically

in untreated groundwater of private wells used for drinking and or agricultural practices in rural alberta were studied using the qpcr panel assay integrated cell culture with qpcr and cell culture in the volume of 500 liters per sample through serial sampling seven viruses were assessed including adenovirus rotavirus norovirus astrovirus sapovirus reovirus and jc virus five viruses were detected with an overall positive detection rate of 6 33 45 of 711 samples the most frequently detected virus was adenovirus 48 9 22 45 followed by rotavirus 44 4 20 45 reovirus 20 9 45 jc virus 6 7 3 45 and norovirus 6 7 3 45 there was no significant difference in the positive detection rates ranging from 1 1 to 3 4 by various well settings used for broiler farms cow calf farms feedlots and rural acreages effects of well characteristics aquifer type well depth static level of water well seal and well completion lithology on potential viral contamination of groundwater of private wells were also analyzed upon available data the findings demonstrate that occurrence of enteric viruses is low and viral contamination is sporadic in groundwater of private wells in rural alberta conventional fecal bacterial indicators coliform and or e coli were not a representative marker for viral contamination in groundwater wells in rural alberta graphic abstract image graphical abstract key words enteric viruses quantitative pcr viral culture groundwater private wells bacterial fecal indicators well characteristics rural alberta introduction while treated surface water serves as a major source of drinking water for people living in large urban areas untreated groundwater is an essential source of water for people dwelling in rural and remote communities as well as for their livestock approximately 8 9 million canadians currently rely on groundwater for domestic use and 3 8 million canadians are served by private groundwater supplies charrois 2010 it was estimated that 11 of dwelling s main source of water was from a private well for their drinking water supplies which was roughly equal to 114 000 homes in the province of alberta statistics canada 2017 groundwater is often consumed without treatment therefore the microbiological quality of groundwater has become an important concern for drinking water safety for residents and food security of agricultural products such as food animals and vegetables waterborne and foodborne viral gastroenteritis is the most common illness associated with exposure to contaminated water and food borchardt et al 2012 human enteric viruses are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in one study that investigated human enteric viruses in groundwater in canada viruses were not often detected in groundwater from 25 municipal wells across 3 provinces locas et al 2008 the presence and levels of enteric virus contamination in groundwater in rural alberta is largely unknown imposing a challenge for the development of regulatory and practical standards for drinking water safety especially in consideration that well water is the main source for human use in rural area it has been reported that enteric viruses can survive a long time in deep aquifers therefore their presence may not always be associated with conventional bacterial indicators such as total coliform and escherichia coli e coli fout et al 2017 several studies have reported the detection of enteric viruses in wells with different depths types and purposes for uses however results varied significantly fongaro et al 2015 gotkowitz et al 2016 prevalence of enteric viruses appeared to be higher in groundwater serving as public drinking water before regulated treatment 27 than in untreated groundwater from private wells in rural areas used for irrigation 15 6 fout et al 2017 stokdyk et al 2020 it is difficult to compare these studies to conclude a clear trend of general presence and levels of viral contamination in groundwater due to significant differences in methodology specifically these studies differed in detection targets viruses or surrogate indicators sample volumes 100 to 2000 liters sampling protocols repeat or snapshot sampling and viral concentration processes haramoto et al 2018 further studies using a larger cohort of wells and repeat sampling are needed to improve understanding of factors related to viral contamination of groundwater wastewater surface water grazing animals agricultural activities and hydrogeology are some potential factors contributing to viral contamination of groundwater in rural areas manure runoff close et al 2008 land application of human wastewater derived biosolids or sludge gerba and smith 2005 leakage from rural septic tanks hynds et al 2012 and contaminated surface water are possible sources of direct enteric virus contamination in groundwater of private wells as identified in a comprehensive review of the studies on contamination of enteric pathogens in groundwater in the us and canada from 1990 to 2013 knowledge gaps exist in the prevalence of enteric viruses in groundwater related disease burdens and associated risks with hydrogeology well characteristics and usages hynds et al 2014 as one of a series of studies focusing on enteric viruses in environmental waters qiu et al 2018 pang et al 2019 this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of enteric viruses in untreated groundwater in private wells serving single households that are used primarily for drinking and or agricultural practices in rural alberta through serial sampling approach another objective was to evaluate the factors associated potentially with viral contamination relating specifically to use of the well well construction characteristics and aquifer vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design recruitment and sample collections the study includes two components phase i was a pilot study for method development and validation and phase ii a full scale study study recruitment in phase i targeted private wells on acreages n 5 and public wells for local community halls n 4 or camping grounds n 4 in rural areas the locations of wells were near the bonnyville region in the north of alberta and suburbs of the city of edmonton thirteen wells were entered into phase i with weekly sampling and testing for each well from june 2013 to december 2014 among the wells eight wells were for community use the phase ii was part of a project assessing water quality microbial risks and waterborne pathogens in rural alberta using a one health framework hall and cork 2016 study recruitment targeted private owners of wells in acreages broiler chicken and cattle farms and feedlots the major area of interest was the foodnet canada alberta sentinel site in central alberta where livestock operations were concentrated fig 1 the recruitments of phase ii extended from southern alberta to the suburbs of edmonton in the north beyond the alberta sentinel site the recruitment process is explained in detail elsewhere caffrey et al 2020 participants in this study n 49 were a subset of those recruited to examine bacterial contamination of well water n 97 briefly livestock owners were recruited through veterinary practices targeting broiler farmers cow calf farmers and feedlot operators additional recruitment efforts were made using advertisements and social media targeting acreage owners premises that had agreed to participate in the bacterial contamination study were asked if they would consent to being contacted about further research projects the research team contacted consenting participants as they were enrolled generally within 2 months of their initial recruitment into the study of bacterial contamination recruitment was continued until the target sample size was reached at the end 49 wells were recruited in phase ii with monthly sampling and testing for each well for 12 consecutive months between july 2015 to march 2018 all 49 wells were used for private households the study was approved by the health research ethics board of the university of alberta prov00053656 a water sampling device wsd was specially designed and validated for sample collection of well water for viral detection 500 liters was chosen as the sample volume in this study the wsd was connected to a discharge tap attached to the house or on the well head on the premise during the on site sampling sampled water did not go through the house plumbing system the flowmeter of the wsd measures the volume of water flowing through the electropositive nanoceram vs 2 5 5 cylindrical cartridge filters argonide corp sanford fl usa the times to collect 500 litres from each well varied depending on the well pressure and flow rates ranging from 4 5 to 23 l min 1 upon completion of sample collection the filter with retained viruses was placed in sterile double bags stored between 1 10 c using cooling packs and transported to the testing lab for processing within 48 hours after sample collection a total of 118 and 593 groundwater samples were collected in the phase i and phase ii study respectively in addition to 500 liters of the well water sample 200 ml of well water was also collected from the kitchen tap of each well owner s home or barn on the same date in phase ii study these samples were sent for analysis of bacterial indicators including total coliforms e coli enterococcus spp using colilert and enterolert testing kits 06 12999 09 and 06 02150 15 idexx laboratories inc westbrook me usa at public health laboratory south alberta precision laboratory calgary hydrogeological data and characteristics of the participating wells including aquifers depth of well static water level and well seal were extracted from well drilling reports available through the alberta environment and parks database http groundwater alberta ca waterwells d the ages of wells enrolled in the study were from 1962 to 2015 based on the original drilling reports that were available from the participants caffrey et al 2020 2 2 virus concentration from water sample an adsorption elution method was used to concentrate viruses captured on post sample filters the elution and flocculation steps were conducted to concentrate the viruses retained on the filter as described previously pang et al 2012 in brief viruses retained by the positively charged filter were eluted with 1 l of 1 5 beef extract be buffer ph 9 75 followed by flocculation with fecl3 solution at ph 3 5 then centrifugation the concentrated sample was suspended in glycine buffer 0 5 mol l glycine ph 9 0 with a final volume of 15 ml the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 2 0 2 the concentrated sample was aliquoted and stored at 70 o c until testing 2 3 nucleic acid extraction and qpcr detection total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 µl of concentrated sample and eluted in 50 µl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa according to the manufacturer s instruction two step reaction including reverse transcription rt and real time quantitative pcr qpcr were used to detect all the viruses including norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus reovirus adenovirus and jc virus an external standard curve was established for quantification of all viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of norovirus genogroup ii gii by 10 fold dilution from 100 to 10 106 copies qiu et al 2018 optimization of panel qpcr assay for the targeting viruses was performed by adjusting thermal cycler condition and concentration of primers and or probes to achieve similar qpcr efficiencies based on the standard curves and the ct values the concentration of virus was expressed as genome equivalent ge copies l qiu et al 2015 the primers and probes used for qpcr were published previously pang et al 2012 and 2014 the qpcr assay was performed using abi prism 7500 sequence detection system abi sequencing of reovirus detected with relatively high ge copies n 1 was performed using 890 bps of reovirus genomic segment s4 to identify its origin 2 4 virus cell culture presence of infectious culturable viruses in concentrated samples was assessed using cell culture with buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm and african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma104 as previously described qiu et al 2015 although majority of enteric viruses had tropism for both bgm and ma104 cell lines differences in the replicating capacity of viruses between cell lines were observed during earlier experiments thus both cell lines were used to increase the sensitivity for detecting infectious viruses viral replication was determined by monitoring for cytopathic effects cpe in the cell cultures integrated cell culture with qpcr icc qpcr assay was used to increase the sensitivity to detect infectious rotavirus adenovirus and reovirus 2 5 data analysis and statistics chi square test performed using stata version 13 was used to compare the positive detection rates of enteric viruses between phase i and ii and to study the association between positive detection rates of enteric viruses with different characteristics of the wells including aquifer types lithology of sediments depth static water level and seal of wells level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 validation of wsd and volume of groundwater sample for viral detection five hundred liters of groundwater using the wsd was validated in the phase i study for the qpcr based detection of enteric viruses and viral culture the limit of detection lod for the qpcr virus panel assay was 5 ge copies per pcr equivalent to 60 ge copies l of water the wsd is easy to set up regardless of weather condition and location providing accurate readings of sample volumes sampling time using wsd varied from 25 to 120 minutes depending on the pressure of each well thirteen wells were sampled during phase i study four wells were excluded from the 53 wells owners consented to the study initially during phase ii because the main water supplies in their premises were identified to be surface water instead of ground water forty nine wells with groundwater were included in the final analysis of the phase ii study 3 2 prevalence and levels of enteric viruses in groundwater from private wells in study areas viruses were detected in 18 out of 118 samples 15 25 and 27 out of 593 samples 4 6 using qpcr in phase i and ii study respectively table 1 overall the most frequently detected virus was adenovirus 48 9 22 45 followed by rotavirus 44 4 20 45 reovirus 20 9 45 jc virus 6 7 3 45 and norovirus 6 7 3 45 the virus positive detection rate was much higher in phase i 15 3 than phase ii 4 6 of the study p 0 01 in the phase i viruses were detected in 7 wells where three wells had the virus detected by qpcr only in 1 sample two wells detected in 2 samples one well detected in 3 samples and one well detected in all 8 samples respectively among a serial of weekly samples from each well table 2 viruses were detected consistently in all 8 samples well id 11 including rotavirus n 8 adenovirus n 8 norovirus n 3 and jc virus n 1 virus concentration in the majority of viral positive samples was non quantifiable quantifiable levels of rotaviruses and adenoviruses ranged from 77 2 to 5952 5 ge copies liter in the well with consistent positive n 8 and from 84 0 to 385 3 ge copies liter in the other 12 wells n 5 respectively no infectious viruses virions were detected by viral culture icc qpcr in the phase i study since icc qpcr was more sensitive than viral culture for identifying viable or infectious viruses negative result of icc qpcr indicated that there was not virion from all direct qpcr positive and quantifiable samples the ge copy numbers of rotaviruses and adenoviruses demonstrated presence of viral nucleic acids likely from non infectious viruses rather than the virions in the phase ii study 22 out of the 49 wells had the viruses detected by qpcr eighteen wells had virus detected only in 1 sample three wells detected in 2 samples and one well detected in 3 samples using all 3 assays respectively table 2 the level of quantifiable enteric viruses detected by qpcr was lower in phase ii compared to phase i study ranging from 52 8 to 85 8 ge liter for adenoviruses n 4 22 2 ge copies liter for rotavirus n 1 33 6 ge copies liter for reovirus n 1 and 67 7 ge copies liter for jc virus n 1 respectively infectious adenovirus and reovirus were detected in 8 and 4 samples by icc qpcr from 11 wells respectively and strong cytopathogenic effect cpe was only observed in 1 of the reovirus positive samples by cell culture reovirus detected from this specific sample was sequenced with 890 bps of reovirus genomic segment s4 indicating 99 similarity to reovirus strain isolated from mink genebank kc462158 3 3 settings of wells and the presence of enteric viruses and bacterial indicators in well water samples the private wells sampled in phase ii were categorized by the type of setting into broiler farm cow calf farm feedlot and rural acreage there was no significant difference in the positive detection rates of enteric viruses ranging from 1 1 to 3 4 by various settings the positive rate of total coliforms detected was higher 10 9 than the positive rate of e coli 1 6 and enterococcus 1 0 detected in the well water samples collected from kitchen taps table 3 none of the well water samples from which enteric viruses were detected were positive for all three bacterial indicators in the corresponding samples collected from the taps at the same time the majority of premises used conventional septic tank and field waste disposal systems n 32 68 other methods used included open discharge ejector systems n 3 septic tank with sand mound n 2 and a septic tank with a pump out n 1 information was not available for all premises four wells did not meet the setback requirement for the distance between the well and the septic tank 10 metres two of these wells had a sample that was positive for a virus via direct qpcr 3 4 well and hydrogeological characteristics and presence of enteric viruses prevalence of enteric viruses in well water samples was analyzed to examine potential effects of well characteristics and lithology on viral contamination of groundwater in private wells of study area the depth of the wells and aquifer types limited numbers in unconfined aquifers showed no association with positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples wells with static water level over 100 feet had higher positivity rates 8 3 than wells with levels ranging from 40 to 100 feet 3 6 but there was no significant statistical difference p 0 26 chi square test 8 3 of enteric virus positive rate were found in wells completed in gravel sediments which was greater than that with sediments of sand and sandstone shale shale and sandstone mixture from 5 6 to 4 2 p 0 75 there was a difference of positivity rates of enteric viruses between a good seal 4 2 and a questionable seal 9 4 of wells p 0 17 table 4 4 discussion due to the low occurrence of viruses in groundwater of the private wells in study areas of rural alberta adequate sample volume is critical to provide accurate detection of enteric virus during phase i the feasibility of using a wsd and the sample volumes of 500 liters of groundwater for detection of enteric viruses using the qpcr panel assay were confirmed by a weekly sampling from 13 wells in north alberta over two summer fall periods viruses were detected in 7 out of 13 wells using this system demonstrating that sample volume was suitable for virus assessment in groundwater using the qpcr panel assay with the sensitivity of detection of limit at 5 ge copies per qpcr before we proceeded with a larger scale study in phase ii combining the results from both phase i and ii this large cohort study showed that overall prevalence of enteric viruses was low 6 3 in groundwater from private wells in studied rural areas of alberta enteric viruses were detected by qpcr in one sample in 72 of wells 21 out of 29 wells and two wells 6 9 2 out of 29 wells were virus positive in 3 samples these results indicate that the presence of enteric viruses in private groundwater wells was likely sporadic and not continuous in rural alberta a review of 55 studies on the detection of enteric pathogens in groundwater in canada and us showed that enteric pathogens including viruses was more frequently detected in municipal wells than private wells hynds et al 2014 stokdyk et al reported that 18 genetic targets of bacteria and viruses were detected at least once in 96 of 145 private wells and 58 of 964 samples collected from public wells supplying drinking water stokdyk et al 2020 these observations were contradictory from our finding of higher positive detection rates of enteric viruses in community groundwater wells during phase i 15 25 compared to those in private groundwater wells during phase ii 4 55 furthermore most of positive groundwater samples with enteric viruses in the phase ii were unquantifiable by direct qpcr assay the highest levels of quantifiable adenoviruses 85 8 ge copies l and rotaviruses 22 2 ge copies l were also lower in phase ii as compared to the levels of adenoviruses 5952 5 ge copies l and rotaviruses 380 2 ge copies l in phase i respectively our results agreed with the prevalence of enteric viruses in different environmental waters in other study haramoto et al 2018 the mean levels of enteric viruses in infected individuals could range from 105 to 1012 genomic copies of virus per gram of faeces gerba 2000 the estimated levels of the viruses detected by qpcr in groundwater from private wells in rural alberta would be equivalent to 1 5 10 5 to 8 6 10 11 gram of faecal contamination in one liter of contaminated water using this calculation sporadic contamination of private groundwater wells with extremely low levels of detectable and not always quantifiable enteric viruses presents a challenge for the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra which relies on the assessment of quantifiable and viable viruses virions this sporadic and low level of viral contamination of groundwater may still be an exposure risk for drinking water safety in rural alberta when further data is available a quantitative microbial risk assessment will be beneficial to better evaluate its associated risk among the seven enteric virus targets in the qpcr panel assay five were detected in groundwater collected from private wells adenovirus and rotavirus were the most frequently detected viruses in this study which was also reported from other studies fongro et al 2015 stokdyk et al 2020 haramoto et al 2012 in one of our previous studies all seven enteric viruses were detected in six major rivers across alberta qiu et al 2018 since all private wells in rural alberta in study areas were located a far distance from the major rivers the enteric virus detected sporadically would not be directly associated with enteric viruses in rivers but likely associated with local livestock especially rotavirus and reovirus this deduction is supported by reports that enteric pathogens from livestock were five times more likely to be present when adjacent to agricultural activities hynds et al 2014 further study is needed to source track the enteric virus detected in groundwater in rural alberta two factors were considered as possible causes for the significantly higher positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater during phase i pilot study for method development and validation first the presence of four enteric viruses was persistent in all 8 samples from well 11 in phase i including rotavirus adenovirus norovirus and jc virus the numbers of viral positives in this single well presented an outlier in analysis leading to a remarkable increase of the overall positive detection rate of viruses further investigation revealed that this well was owned by a local community hall where an aged septic tank was nearby septic systems have been associated with contaminated well water blaschke et al 2016 gotkowitz et al 2016 moreover there were many bored wells with large diameters typically constructed in shallow aquifers and subjected to contamination by buffalo and other animals in the vicinity of this well lutterodt et al 2018 secondly samples were collected from each well weekly from june to november during phase i rainfall during the warmer months in alberta might wash surface contaminates to bored wells in that area increasing viral contamination of well water gotkowitz et al 2016 murphy et al 2020 in addition eight out of 13 wells in phase i were used for community use 4 community halls and 4 camping grounds whereas all 49 wells in phase ii were used for private household purposes the comparison provided evidence that private wells may be less vulnerable to viral contamination than the wells for public use in studied rural areas of alberta since most of the wells in phase ii were scattered throughout the alberta sentinel site association between the prevalence of enteric viruses in groundwater with settings of the wells was further investigated there was no difference of positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples among broiler farms cow calf farms feedlots and rural residencies indicating that the different uses of wells have no significant impact on the virus contamination of well water in their premises the positive detection rates of bacterial fecal indicators in untreated well water in phase ii were similar as previously reported in another study on well water in rural alberta invik et al 2017 bacterial fecal indicators were positive more frequently than the viruses in the samples collected from the tap on the same date from the same wells this result was not in agreement with findings from the systematic review of groundwater studies which showed viral presence was significantly higher than both bacteria or protozoa hynds et al 2014 also none of the wells with positive results of enteric viruses had total coliform and or e coli detected in the water samples collected from the kitchen taps on the same day this finding indicates that conventional fecal bacterial indicators for microbiological quality of water are not a reliable marker for viral contamination especially in groundwater wells locas et al 2008 fout et al 2017 hynds et al 2014 using bacterial fecal indicators could misrepresent the presence and level of enteric viruses one possible explanation for increased positivity of total coliform and e coil in the same well water collected from the kitchen and barn taps in this study was different locations of the sampling taps for bacterial and viral testing most of the samples for bacterial testing were collected from taps in the kitchens or barns inside a building while the majority of well water samples for viral testing were collected from taps close to the wellhead or garden tap outside the house since bacterial fecal indicators were not tested in well water samples collected from the wellhead or garden taps we were unable to assess difference of bacterial contaminations between sampling taps inside and outside of buildings in this study among numerous factors that affect groundwater contamination by viruses hydrogeology and well design construction and maintenance of the wells are important to consider alberta is in hydrogeological region of the cordillera and western sedimentary basin where aquifers are mainly mixed with sand gravel shallow fractured rock and glacial sediments sharpe et al 2014 in this large cohort study of private wells we explored the relationship between the positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples and hydrogeological and well characteristics including aquifer type depth of well static water level and well seal from available well drilling reports obtained from property owners or from the alberta water wells database the results showed that the well with a questionable seal were over 2 times more likely to be enteric virus positive compared to those with a good well seal this observation was different from hynds findings that inadequately designed constructed wells were not associated with viral contamination in groundwater but were associated with bacterial and protozoan contamination hynds et al 2014 the wells completed in gravel sediments had slightly higher positive detection rates of viruses than those with sand and sandstone shale shale and sandstone mixture fout et al 2017 blaschke et al 2016 different lithology found throughout an aquifer affect the permeability associated with groundwater recharge which can alter the transportation of viruses van cuyk and siegrist 2007 rasmuson et al 2020 however no significant association of lithology with viral contamination of groundwater was observed in this study this suggests that localized source specific contamination occurring at the source is a predominant mechanism of groundwater contamination rather than contamination of all or part of the aquifer hand dug wells and springs are typically associated with inadequate design and construction leading to an increased permeability of enteric pathogens to well water the depth of well and static level of water was not associated with viral contamination in groundwater of the private wells although a higher prevalence of enteric pathogens in shallow groundwater sources was reported previously hynds et al 2012 a large number of aquifers in the alberta sentinel sites are deep and confined aquifers sharpe et al 2014 confined aquifers are commonly assumed to be protected from microbial contaminants because of low permeability of the aquitard however confined aquifers could be more vulnerable to viral contamination than commonly believed borchardt et al 2007 the effect of aquifer type and well seal on the presence of enteric viruses in groundwater of private wells was not conclusive because there was a limited number of wells in unconfined aquifers and some of wells had questionable seals in this study other limitations of this study include 1 source tracking of enteric viruses detected in groundwater samples and qmra were not performed because the low level of enteric viruses detected by qpcr in the majority of samples was not amiable for cloning and sequencing the direct pcr was not able to identify genetic materials in the viral positive sample from an infectious virion or dead virus thus the source and ratio of viral contamination in groundwater from animal or human sources still need to be explored although reovirus detected by qpcr and confirmed as viable reovirus by cell culture in one sample was identified as animal source and 2 bacterial fecal indicators were not directly tested from aliquots of well water samples 500 liters collected for viral testing as mentioned above with the latter potentially representative of the true bacterial contamination of groundwater from well conclusion using the validated methods from the phase i study we concluded that the occurrence of enteric viruses in private groundwater wells of study areas was low and the viral contamination of wells was sporadic through a large cohort of phase ii study on virological quality of groundwater in rural alberta total coliform and e coli were not associated with the presence of enteric viruses in groundwater direct measurement of enteric viruses or using reliable viral indicators are recommended for monitoring of enteric viruses in groundwater samples viral contamination of groundwater in study rural areas is likely related to well construction and management so intervention at the source such as appropriate well location design construction maintenance and periodic testing is of importance to address the microbial contamination of private well water in rural alberta contributors xiaoli pang co leader of this study

in untreated groundwater of private wells used for drinking and or agricultural practices in rural alberta were studied using the qpcr panel assay integrated cell culture with qpcr and cell culture in the volume of 500 liters per sample through serial sampling seven viruses were assessed including adenovirus rotavirus norovirus astrovirus sapovirus reovirus and jc virus five viruses were detected with an overall positive detection rate of 6 33 45 of 711 samples the most frequently detected virus was adenovirus 48 9 22 45 followed by rotavirus 44 4 20 45 reovirus 20 9 45 jc virus 6 7 3 45 and norovirus 6 7 3 45 there was no significant difference in the positive detection rates ranging from 1 1 to 3 4 by various well settings used for broiler farms cow calf farms feedlots and rural acreages effects of well characteristics aquifer type well depth static level of water well seal and well completion lithology on potential viral contamination of groundwater of private wells were also analyzed upon available data the findings demonstrate that occurrence of enteric viruses is low and viral contamination is sporadic in groundwater of private wells in rural alberta conventional fecal bacterial indicators coliform and or e coli were not a representative marker for viral contamination in groundwater wells in rural alberta graphic abstract image graphical abstract key words enteric viruses quantitative pcr viral culture groundwater private wells bacterial fecal indicators well characteristics rural alberta introduction while treated surface water serves as a major source of drinking water for people living in large urban areas untreated groundwater is an essential source of water for people dwelling in rural and remote communities as well as for their livestock approximately 8 9 million canadians currently rely on groundwater for domestic use and 3 8 million canadians are served by private groundwater supplies charrois 2010 it was estimated that 11 of dwelling s main source of water was from a private well for their drinking water supplies which was roughly equal to 114 000 homes in the province of alberta statistics canada 2017 groundwater is often consumed without treatment therefore the microbiological quality of groundwater has become an important concern for drinking water safety for residents and food security of agricultural products such as food animals and vegetables waterborne and foodborne viral gastroenteritis is the most common illness associated with exposure to contaminated water and food borchardt et al 2012 human enteric viruses are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in one study that investigated human enteric viruses in groundwater in canada viruses were not often detected in groundwater from 25 municipal wells across 3 provinces locas et al 2008 the presence and levels of enteric virus contamination in groundwater in rural alberta is largely unknown imposing a challenge for the development of regulatory and practical standards for drinking water safety especially in consideration that well water is the main source for human use in rural area it has been reported that enteric viruses can survive a long time in deep aquifers therefore their presence may not always be associated with conventional bacterial indicators such as total coliform and escherichia coli e coli fout et al 2017 several studies have reported the detection of enteric viruses in wells with different depths types and purposes for uses however results varied significantly fongaro et al 2015 gotkowitz et al 2016 prevalence of enteric viruses appeared to be higher in groundwater serving as public drinking water before regulated treatment 27 than in untreated groundwater from private wells in rural areas used for irrigation 15 6 fout et al 2017 stokdyk et al 2020 it is difficult to compare these studies to conclude a clear trend of general presence and levels of viral contamination in groundwater due to significant differences in methodology specifically these studies differed in detection targets viruses or surrogate indicators sample volumes 100 to 2000 liters sampling protocols repeat or snapshot sampling and viral concentration processes haramoto et al 2018 further studies using a larger cohort of wells and repeat sampling are needed to improve understanding of factors related to viral contamination of groundwater wastewater surface water grazing animals agricultural activities and hydrogeology are some potential factors contributing to viral contamination of groundwater in rural areas manure runoff close et al 2008 land application of human wastewater derived biosolids or sludge gerba and smith 2005 leakage from rural septic tanks hynds et al 2012 and contaminated surface water are possible sources of direct enteric virus contamination in groundwater of private wells as identified in a comprehensive review of the studies on contamination of enteric pathogens in groundwater in the us and canada from 1990 to 2013 knowledge gaps exist in the prevalence of enteric viruses in groundwater related disease burdens and associated risks with hydrogeology well characteristics and usages hynds et al 2014 as one of a series of studies focusing on enteric viruses in environmental waters qiu et al 2018 pang et al 2019 this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of enteric viruses in untreated groundwater in private wells serving single households that are used primarily for drinking and or agricultural practices in rural alberta through serial sampling approach another objective was to evaluate the factors associated potentially with viral contamination relating specifically to use of the well well construction characteristics and aquifer vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design recruitment and sample collections the study includes two components phase i was a pilot study for method development and validation and phase ii a full scale study study recruitment in phase i targeted private wells on acreages n 5 and public wells for local community halls n 4 or camping grounds n 4 in rural areas the locations of wells were near the bonnyville region in the north of alberta and suburbs of the city of edmonton thirteen wells were entered into phase i with weekly sampling and testing for each well from june 2013 to december 2014 among the wells eight wells were for community use the phase ii was part of a project assessing water quality microbial risks and waterborne pathogens in rural alberta using a one health framework hall and cork 2016 study recruitment targeted private owners of wells in acreages broiler chicken and cattle farms and feedlots the major area of interest was the foodnet canada alberta sentinel site in central alberta where livestock operations were concentrated fig 1 the recruitments of phase ii extended from southern alberta to the suburbs of edmonton in the north beyond the alberta sentinel site the recruitment process is explained in detail elsewhere caffrey et al 2020 participants in this study n 49 were a subset of those recruited to examine bacterial contamination of well water n 97 briefly livestock owners were recruited through veterinary practices targeting broiler farmers cow calf farmers and feedlot operators additional recruitment efforts were made using advertisements and social media targeting acreage owners premises that had agreed to participate in the bacterial contamination study were asked if they would consent to being contacted about further research projects the research team contacted consenting participants as they were enrolled generally within 2 months of their initial recruitment into the study of bacterial contamination recruitment was continued until the target sample size was reached at the end 49 wells were recruited in phase ii with monthly sampling and testing for each well for 12 consecutive months between july 2015 to march 2018 all 49 wells were used for private households the study was approved by the health research ethics board of the university of alberta prov00053656 a water sampling device wsd was specially designed and validated for sample collection of well water for viral detection 500 liters was chosen as the sample volume in this study the wsd was connected to a discharge tap attached to the house or on the well head on the premise during the on site sampling sampled water did not go through the house plumbing system the flowmeter of the wsd measures the volume of water flowing through the electropositive nanoceram vs 2 5 5 cylindrical cartridge filters argonide corp sanford fl usa the times to collect 500 litres from each well varied depending on the well pressure and flow rates ranging from 4 5 to 23 l min 1 upon completion of sample collection the filter with retained viruses was placed in sterile double bags stored between 1 10 c using cooling packs and transported to the testing lab for processing within 48 hours after sample collection a total of 118 and 593 groundwater samples were collected in the phase i and phase ii study respectively in addition to 500 liters of the well water sample 200 ml of well water was also collected from the kitchen tap of each well owner s home or barn on the same date in phase ii study these samples were sent for analysis of bacterial indicators including total coliforms e coli enterococcus spp using colilert and enterolert testing kits 06 12999 09 and 06 02150 15 idexx laboratories inc westbrook me usa at public health laboratory south alberta precision laboratory calgary hydrogeological data and characteristics of the participating wells including aquifers depth of well static water level and well seal were extracted from well drilling reports available through the alberta environment and parks database http groundwater alberta ca waterwells d the ages of wells enrolled in the study were from 1962 to 2015 based on the original drilling reports that were available from the participants caffrey et al 2020 2 2 virus concentration from water sample an adsorption elution method was used to concentrate viruses captured on post sample filters the elution and flocculation steps were conducted to concentrate the viruses retained on the filter as described previously pang et al 2012 in brief viruses retained by the positively charged filter were eluted with 1 l of 1 5 beef extract be buffer ph 9 75 followed by flocculation with fecl3 solution at ph 3 5 then centrifugation the concentrated sample was suspended in glycine buffer 0 5 mol l glycine ph 9 0 with a final volume of 15 ml the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 2 0 2 the concentrated sample was aliquoted and stored at 70 o c until testing 2 3 nucleic acid extraction and qpcr detection total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 µl of concentrated sample and eluted in 50 µl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa according to the manufacturer s instruction two step reaction including reverse transcription rt and real time quantitative pcr qpcr were used to detect all the viruses including norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus reovirus adenovirus and jc virus an external standard curve was established for quantification of all viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of norovirus genogroup ii gii by 10 fold dilution from 100 to 10 106 copies qiu et al 2018 optimization of panel qpcr assay for the targeting viruses was performed by adjusting thermal cycler condition and concentration of primers and or probes to achieve similar qpcr efficiencies based on the standard curves and the ct values the concentration of virus was expressed as genome equivalent ge copies l qiu et al 2015 the primers and probes used for qpcr were published previously pang et al 2012 and 2014 the qpcr assay was performed using abi prism 7500 sequence detection system abi sequencing of reovirus detected with relatively high ge copies n 1 was performed using 890 bps of reovirus genomic segment s4 to identify its origin 2 4 virus cell culture presence of infectious culturable viruses in concentrated samples was assessed using cell culture with buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm and african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma104 as previously described qiu et al 2015 although majority of enteric viruses had tropism for both bgm and ma104 cell lines differences in the replicating capacity of viruses between cell lines were observed during earlier experiments thus both cell lines were used to increase the sensitivity for detecting infectious viruses viral replication was determined by monitoring for cytopathic effects cpe in the cell cultures integrated cell culture with qpcr icc qpcr assay was used to increase the sensitivity to detect infectious rotavirus adenovirus and reovirus 2 5 data analysis and statistics chi square test performed using stata version 13 was used to compare the positive detection rates of enteric viruses between phase i and ii and to study the association between positive detection rates of enteric viruses with different characteristics of the wells including aquifer types lithology of sediments depth static water level and seal of wells level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 validation of wsd and volume of groundwater sample for viral detection five hundred liters of groundwater using the wsd was validated in the phase i study for the qpcr based detection of enteric viruses and viral culture the limit of detection lod for the qpcr virus panel assay was 5 ge copies per pcr equivalent to 60 ge copies l of water the wsd is easy to set up regardless of weather condition and location providing accurate readings of sample volumes sampling time using wsd varied from 25 to 120 minutes depending on the pressure of each well thirteen wells were sampled during phase i study four wells were excluded from the 53 wells owners consented to the study initially during phase ii because the main water supplies in their premises were identified to be surface water instead of ground water forty nine wells with groundwater were included in the final analysis of the phase ii study 3 2 prevalence and levels of enteric viruses in groundwater from private wells in study areas viruses were detected in 18 out of 118 samples 15 25 and 27 out of 593 samples 4 6 using qpcr in phase i and ii study respectively table 1 overall the most frequently detected virus was adenovirus 48 9 22 45 followed by rotavirus 44 4 20 45 reovirus 20 9 45 jc virus 6 7 3 45 and norovirus 6 7 3 45 the virus positive detection rate was much higher in phase i 15 3 than phase ii 4 6 of the study p 0 01 in the phase i viruses were detected in 7 wells where three wells had the virus detected by qpcr only in 1 sample two wells detected in 2 samples one well detected in 3 samples and one well detected in all 8 samples respectively among a serial of weekly samples from each well table 2 viruses were detected consistently in all 8 samples well id 11 including rotavirus n 8 adenovirus n 8 norovirus n 3 and jc virus n 1 virus concentration in the majority of viral positive samples was non quantifiable quantifiable levels of rotaviruses and adenoviruses ranged from 77 2 to 5952 5 ge copies liter in the well with consistent positive n 8 and from 84 0 to 385 3 ge copies liter in the other 12 wells n 5 respectively no infectious viruses virions were detected by viral culture icc qpcr in the phase i study since icc qpcr was more sensitive than viral culture for identifying viable or infectious viruses negative result of icc qpcr indicated that there was not virion from all direct qpcr positive and quantifiable samples the ge copy numbers of rotaviruses and adenoviruses demonstrated presence of viral nucleic acids likely from non infectious viruses rather than the virions in the phase ii study 22 out of the 49 wells had the viruses detected by qpcr eighteen wells had virus detected only in 1 sample three wells detected in 2 samples and one well detected in 3 samples using all 3 assays respectively table 2 the level of quantifiable enteric viruses detected by qpcr was lower in phase ii compared to phase i study ranging from 52 8 to 85 8 ge liter for adenoviruses n 4 22 2 ge copies liter for rotavirus n 1 33 6 ge copies liter for reovirus n 1 and 67 7 ge copies liter for jc virus n 1 respectively infectious adenovirus and reovirus were detected in 8 and 4 samples by icc qpcr from 11 wells respectively and strong cytopathogenic effect cpe was only observed in 1 of the reovirus positive samples by cell culture reovirus detected from this specific sample was sequenced with 890 bps of reovirus genomic segment s4 indicating 99 similarity to reovirus strain isolated from mink genebank kc462158 3 3 settings of wells and the presence of enteric viruses and bacterial indicators in well water samples the private wells sampled in phase ii were categorized by the type of setting into broiler farm cow calf farm feedlot and rural acreage there was no significant difference in the positive detection rates of enteric viruses ranging from 1 1 to 3 4 by various settings the positive rate of total coliforms detected was higher 10 9 than the positive rate of e coli 1 6 and enterococcus 1 0 detected in the well water samples collected from kitchen taps table 3 none of the well water samples from which enteric viruses were detected were positive for all three bacterial indicators in the corresponding samples collected from the taps at the same time the majority of premises used conventional septic tank and field waste disposal systems n 32 68 other methods used included open discharge ejector systems n 3 septic tank with sand mound n 2 and a septic tank with a pump out n 1 information was not available for all premises four wells did not meet the setback requirement for the distance between the well and the septic tank 10 metres two of these wells had a sample that was positive for a virus via direct qpcr 3 4 well and hydrogeological characteristics and presence of enteric viruses prevalence of enteric viruses in well water samples was analyzed to examine potential effects of well characteristics and lithology on viral contamination of groundwater in private wells of study area the depth of the wells and aquifer types limited numbers in unconfined aquifers showed no association with positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples wells with static water level over 100 feet had higher positivity rates 8 3 than wells with levels ranging from 40 to 100 feet 3 6 but there was no significant statistical difference p 0 26 chi square test 8 3 of enteric virus positive rate were found in wells completed in gravel sediments which was greater than that with sediments of sand and sandstone shale shale and sandstone mixture from 5 6 to 4 2 p 0 75 there was a difference of positivity rates of enteric viruses between a good seal 4 2 and a questionable seal 9 4 of wells p 0 17 table 4 4 discussion due to the low occurrence of viruses in groundwater of the private wells in study areas of rural alberta adequate sample volume is critical to provide accurate detection of enteric virus during phase i the feasibility of using a wsd and the sample volumes of 500 liters of groundwater for detection of enteric viruses using the qpcr panel assay were confirmed by a weekly sampling from 13 wells in north alberta over two summer fall periods viruses were detected in 7 out of 13 wells using this system demonstrating that sample volume was suitable for virus assessment in groundwater using the qpcr panel assay with the sensitivity of detection of limit at 5 ge copies per qpcr before we proceeded with a larger scale study in phase ii combining the results from both phase i and ii this large cohort study showed that overall prevalence of enteric viruses was low 6 3 in groundwater from private wells in studied rural areas of alberta enteric viruses were detected by qpcr in one sample in 72 of wells 21 out of 29 wells and two wells 6 9 2 out of 29 wells were virus positive in 3 samples these results indicate that the presence of enteric viruses in private groundwater wells was likely sporadic and not continuous in rural alberta a review of 55 studies on the detection of enteric pathogens in groundwater in canada and us showed that enteric pathogens including viruses was more frequently detected in municipal wells than private wells hynds et al 2014 stokdyk et al reported that 18 genetic targets of bacteria and viruses were detected at least once in 96 of 145 private wells and 58 of 964 samples collected from public wells supplying drinking water stokdyk et al 2020 these observations were contradictory from our finding of higher positive detection rates of enteric viruses in community groundwater wells during phase i 15 25 compared to those in private groundwater wells during phase ii 4 55 furthermore most of positive groundwater samples with enteric viruses in the phase ii were unquantifiable by direct qpcr assay the highest levels of quantifiable adenoviruses 85 8 ge copies l and rotaviruses 22 2 ge copies l were also lower in phase ii as compared to the levels of adenoviruses 5952 5 ge copies l and rotaviruses 380 2 ge copies l in phase i respectively our results agreed with the prevalence of enteric viruses in different environmental waters in other study haramoto et al 2018 the mean levels of enteric viruses in infected individuals could range from 105 to 1012 genomic copies of virus per gram of faeces gerba 2000 the estimated levels of the viruses detected by qpcr in groundwater from private wells in rural alberta would be equivalent to 1 5 10 5 to 8 6 10 11 gram of faecal contamination in one liter of contaminated water using this calculation sporadic contamination of private groundwater wells with extremely low levels of detectable and not always quantifiable enteric viruses presents a challenge for the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra which relies on the assessment of quantifiable and viable viruses virions this sporadic and low level of viral contamination of groundwater may still be an exposure risk for drinking water safety in rural alberta when further data is available a quantitative microbial risk assessment will be beneficial to better evaluate its associated risk among the seven enteric virus targets in the qpcr panel assay five were detected in groundwater collected from private wells adenovirus and rotavirus were the most frequently detected viruses in this study which was also reported from other studies fongro et al 2015 stokdyk et al 2020 haramoto et al 2012 in one of our previous studies all seven enteric viruses were detected in six major rivers across alberta qiu et al 2018 since all private wells in rural alberta in study areas were located a far distance from the major rivers the enteric virus detected sporadically would not be directly associated with enteric viruses in rivers but likely associated with local livestock especially rotavirus and reovirus this deduction is supported by reports that enteric pathogens from livestock were five times more likely to be present when adjacent to agricultural activities hynds et al 2014 further study is needed to source track the enteric virus detected in groundwater in rural alberta two factors were considered as possible causes for the significantly higher positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater during phase i pilot study for method development and validation first the presence of four enteric viruses was persistent in all 8 samples from well 11 in phase i including rotavirus adenovirus norovirus and jc virus the numbers of viral positives in this single well presented an outlier in analysis leading to a remarkable increase of the overall positive detection rate of viruses further investigation revealed that this well was owned by a local community hall where an aged septic tank was nearby septic systems have been associated with contaminated well water blaschke et al 2016 gotkowitz et al 2016 moreover there were many bored wells with large diameters typically constructed in shallow aquifers and subjected to contamination by buffalo and other animals in the vicinity of this well lutterodt et al 2018 secondly samples were collected from each well weekly from june to november during phase i rainfall during the warmer months in alberta might wash surface contaminates to bored wells in that area increasing viral contamination of well water gotkowitz et al 2016 murphy et al 2020 in addition eight out of 13 wells in phase i were used for community use 4 community halls and 4 camping grounds whereas all 49 wells in phase ii were used for private household purposes the comparison provided evidence that private wells may be less vulnerable to viral contamination than the wells for public use in studied rural areas of alberta since most of the wells in phase ii were scattered throughout the alberta sentinel site association between the prevalence of enteric viruses in groundwater with settings of the wells was further investigated there was no difference of positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples among broiler farms cow calf farms feedlots and rural residencies indicating that the different uses of wells have no significant impact on the virus contamination of well water in their premises the positive detection rates of bacterial fecal indicators in untreated well water in phase ii were similar as previously reported in another study on well water in rural alberta invik et al 2017 bacterial fecal indicators were positive more frequently than the viruses in the samples collected from the tap on the same date from the same wells this result was not in agreement with findings from the systematic review of groundwater studies which showed viral presence was significantly higher than both bacteria or protozoa hynds et al 2014 also none of the wells with positive results of enteric viruses had total coliform and or e coli detected in the water samples collected from the kitchen taps on the same day this finding indicates that conventional fecal bacterial indicators for microbiological quality of water are not a reliable marker for viral contamination especially in groundwater wells locas et al 2008 fout et al 2017 hynds et al 2014 using bacterial fecal indicators could misrepresent the presence and level of enteric viruses one possible explanation for increased positivity of total coliform and e coil in the same well water collected from the kitchen and barn taps in this study was different locations of the sampling taps for bacterial and viral testing most of the samples for bacterial testing were collected from taps in the kitchens or barns inside a building while the majority of well water samples for viral testing were collected from taps close to the wellhead or garden tap outside the house since bacterial fecal indicators were not tested in well water samples collected from the wellhead or garden taps we were unable to assess difference of bacterial contaminations between sampling taps inside and outside of buildings in this study among numerous factors that affect groundwater contamination by viruses hydrogeology and well design construction and maintenance of the wells are important to consider alberta is in hydrogeological region of the cordillera and western sedimentary basin where aquifers are mainly mixed with sand gravel shallow fractured rock and glacial sediments sharpe et al 2014 in this large cohort study of private wells we explored the relationship between the positive detection rates of enteric viruses in groundwater samples and hydrogeological and well characteristics including aquifer type depth of well static water level and well seal from available well drilling reports obtained from property owners or from the alberta water wells database the results showed that the well with a questionable seal were over 2 times more likely to be enteric virus positive compared to those with a good well seal this observation was different from hynds findings that inadequately designed constructed wells were not associated with viral contamination in groundwater but were associated with bacterial and protozoan contamination hynds et al 2014 the wells completed in gravel sediments had slightly higher positive detection rates of viruses than those with sand and sandstone shale shale and sandstone mixture fout et al 2017 blaschke et al 2016 different lithology found throughout an aquifer affect the permeability associated with groundwater recharge which can alter the transportation of viruses van cuyk and siegrist 2007 rasmuson et al 2020 however no significant association of lithology with viral contamination of groundwater was observed in this study this suggests that localized source specific contamination occurring at the source is a predominant mechanism of groundwater contamination rather than contamination of all or part of the aquifer hand dug wells and springs are typically associated with inadequate design and construction leading to an increased permeability of enteric pathogens to well water the depth of well and static level of water was not associated with viral contamination in groundwater of the private wells although a higher prevalence of enteric pathogens in shallow groundwater sources was reported previously hynds et al 2012 a large number of aquifers in the alberta sentinel sites are deep and confined aquifers sharpe et al 2014 confined aquifers are commonly assumed to be protected from microbial contaminants because of low permeability of the aquitard however confined aquifers could be more vulnerable to viral contamination than commonly believed borchardt et al 2007 the effect of aquifer type and well seal on the presence of enteric viruses in groundwater of private wells was not conclusive because there was a limited number of wells in unconfined aquifers and some of wells had questionable seals in this study other limitations of this study include 1 source tracking of enteric viruses detected in groundwater samples and qmra were not performed because the low level of enteric viruses detected by qpcr in the majority of samples was not amiable for cloning and sequencing the direct pcr was not able to identify genetic materials in the viral positive sample from an infectious virion or dead virus thus the source and ratio of viral contamination in groundwater from animal or human sources still need to be explored although reovirus detected by qpcr and confirmed as viable reovirus by cell culture in one sample was identified as animal source and 2 bacterial fecal indicators were not directly tested from aliquots of well water samples 500 liters collected for viral testing as mentioned above with the latter potentially representative of the true bacterial contamination of groundwater from well conclusion using the validated methods from the phase i study we concluded that the occurrence of enteric viruses in private groundwater wells of study areas was low and the viral contamination of wells was sporadic through a large cohort of phase ii study on virological quality of groundwater in rural alberta total coliform and e coli were not associated with the presence of enteric viruses in groundwater direct measurement of enteric viruses or using reliable viral indicators are recommended for monitoring of enteric viruses in groundwater samples viral contamination of groundwater in study rural areas is likely related to well construction and management so intervention at the source such as appropriate well location design construction maintenance and periodic testing is of importance to address the microbial contamination of private well water in rural alberta contributors xiaoli pang co leader of this study

16788,for most micropollutants mps present in surface waters such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals the contribution of biotransformation to their overall removal from lake ecosystems is largely unknown this study aims at empirically determining the biotransformation rate constants for 35 mps at different periods of the year and depths of a meso eutrophic lake we then tested statistically the association of environmental parameters and microbial community composition with the biotransformation rate constants obtained biotransformation was observed for 14 out of 35 studied mps for at least one sampling time large variations in biotransformation rate constants were observed over the seasons and between compounds overall the transformation of mps was mostly influenced by the lake s temperature phytoplankton density and bacterial diversity however some individual mps were not following the general trend or association with microorganism biomass the antidepressant mianserin for instance was transformed in all experiments and depths but did not show any relationship with measured environmental parameters suggesting the importance of specific microorganisms in its transformation the results presented here contribute to our understanding of the fate of mps in surface waters and thus support improved risk assessment of contaminants in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotransformation pharmaceuticals pesticides microbial community phytoplankton random forest 1 introduction european lakes are subject to the input of a large range of micropollutants mps ranging from pesticides to pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and personal care products these chemicals can reach surface waters through diffuse sources e g runoff or leaching of pesticides from soils sandin et al 2018 or point sources e g discharge from wastewater treatment plants after incomplete removal eggen et al 2014 as a consequence mps may be found in lake environments at concentrations in the range of several hundred ng l for instance the three common pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole have been measured in lake tegel germany in concentrations of 750 950 and 1200 ng l respectively schimmelpfennig et al 2016 in a lake used as major drinking water supply i e lake mälaren in sweden a total of 46 organic mps have been detected with the highest concentration found being 140 ng l for the anti epileptic lamotrigine rehrl et al 2020 mps can harm aquatic organisms especially in complex mixtures where they might potentially show synergistic effects shao et al 2019 in molluscs for instance antidepressants have been shown to affect spawning and larval release fong and ford 2013 additionally the presence of antibiotic residues even at low concentrations could lead to an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria novo et al 2013 finally these mps can eventually reach drinking water plants luo et al 2014 where they may still be present in considerable concentrations e g up to 600 ng l carbamazepine in finished drinking water kleywegt et al 2011 once they reach lake ecosystems these mps can be dissipated through several known pathways such as flushing sorption and phototransformation tixier et al 2003 the role and importance of biotransformation as a relevant removal process however has received little attention li and mclachlan 2019 showed that some pharmaceuticals were removed at different rates in two different lakes being up to 4 5 times slower in lake mälaren compared to lake norra bergundasjön the authors speculated that this discrepancy was due to a much lower microbial activity in lake mälaren the same study also showed that the pharmaceuticals already present in lake water were transformed faster and without any lag phase compared to those spiked into lake water at elevated concentrations of 50 µg l li and mclachlan 2019 conversely mps dissipated faster in lake water close to the effluent discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant than further away from the facility where their concentrations were diluted blunt et al 2018 in this case the higher biotransformation rates correlated with more active microbial communities together these studies suggest that there might be adaptation of local microbial communities to degrade mps that have a constant input into a lake environment microbial diversity has been identified as another factor potentially influencing mp biotransformation in different contexts e g activated sludge biofilms or phytoplankton cultures the biotransformation rate constants have been found to be higher when the microorganism community was more diverse johnson et al 2015 stravs et al 2019 torresi et al 2016 yet it may be possible that a few specific groups of microorganisms are particularly active in the transformation of specific compounds for instance cyanobacteria were suspected to play an important role in the dissipation of the pesticide glyphosate in lake greifen huntscha et al 2018 despite these new findings there are still large knowledge gaps regarding the potential for biotransformation in lakes for most mps particularly with a few exceptions blunt et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2019 there is hardly any systematic investigation of the spatial and temporal variation of mp biotransformation and how it relates to variation in environmental parameters and microbial community density and composition while concentrations of mps in lake waters have previously been observed to decrease during summer months when the lake is warmer and the microorganisms more abundant huntscha et al 2018 rehrl et al 2020 the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased microbial biotransformation or rather sunlight induced phototransformation could not be resolved in most cases e g huntscha et al 2018 tixier et al 2003 in addition the effects of many physico chemical parameters e g temperature ph dissolved oxygen nutrients on biotransformation rates have been studied in the past see review by fenner et al 2016 but rarely in combination hence increased knowledge about the extent variation and factors influencing biotransformation rate constants of mps in lakes would enable a better prediction of mp dissipation or persistence in natural surface waters and thus improved risk assessment in addition as there is increasing interest in microalgae based wastewater treatment e g da silva rodrigues et al 2020 our study would also inform on the optimal conditions for mp biotransformation and hence foster a better management of contaminated effluents prior to their discharge into the environment this study therefore had two main objectives i to evaluate the importance and variation of biotransformation for a diverse set of relevant mps in a lake ecosystem during different seasons of the year and at different water depths and ii to identify associations between the biotransformation rate constants and different physico chemical parameters of the water samples and microbial community characteristics such as microorganism density composition and diversity by contrasting the effects of the environment including microorganism density and composition at each sampling time and depth we aim to identify the most important drivers of mp biotransformation in a lake ecosystem to this end we sampled a study lake five times between may and october at 3 and 6 metres depth and spiked the lake water with a mixture of 40 mps biotransformation rate constants were derived from the decrease in spiked mp concentrations over time a machine learning approach random forest was used to rank the most important environmental or microbial community variables predicting biotransformation rate constants 2 experimental methods 2 1 chemical and reagents micropollutants were selected to be environmentally relevant i e commonly measured in european watercourses and to cover a variety of

september 11 and october 16 in 2018 at around 9 am dates were selected to be about one month apart this study focused on the warmer months of the year so the microorganism s density and activity would be the largest lake water was collected next to the monitoring station in 3 replicates at a depth of 3 m and 6 m using a 5 l niskin bottle water was filtered through a 80 µm mesh membrane to exclude zooplankton and the filtrate was collected directly in an autoclaved glass bottle that was then kept in a cooler box until all samples were brought back to the laboratory less than 2 hours later all samples were processed that same day a subsample of lake water was used for chemical analysis at the analytic and training laboratory of eawag aua analytik und ausbildungslabor ammonium nitrate

light intensity observed in lake greifen at each sampling time see supplementary information si section s5 a light setup using a combination of large spectrum lights philips master led tube uo 24w 830 t8 and green filters lee filters were used to replicate the light intensity and light spectrum measured in lake greifen at 3 m and 6 m depths fig s2 s3 the temperature of the chamber was set as the average between the 3 m and 6 m lake water temperature on each sampling date for each triplicate of lake water samples a subsample of 400 ml of the raw lake water was used for the biotransformation experiment in a 500 ml wide opening beaker another subsample of 400 ml of the lake water was filtered at 0 2 µm to exclude microorganisms and used in similar beakers as abiotic controls all beakers were covered with a plastic film to reduce evaporation and penetration of dust and microorganisms but not completely sealed to allow air exchange they were placed on a shaker at 120 rpm under a light

experiments were muffled at 550 c for 4 hours prior to the experiment to remove any trace of organic contaminants the biotic abiotic and sorption flasks were spiked with the micropollutant spiking mix to a final concentration of 100 ng l containing 0 0002 v v etoh beakers and bottles were gently swirled and the first sample 1 ml for time 0 was taken immediately after further samples were then taken after 4 h 24 h 3 d 7 d 10 d 14 d and 21 d 19 d in the case of the august experiment the october experiment had an additional sample taken after 28 d in the july and august experiments a non spiked control containing lake water and 0 0002 v v etoh was added to the sets of controls to monitor the transformation of mps already present in lake greifen water 2 5 chemical analysis samples from the experimental beakers and bottles were transferred to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 min to remove cells and suspended particles 500 µl of the supernatant was transferred in a glass lc vial and spiked with 20 µl of the internal standard solution final concentration of 80 ng l for each analyte the samples were kept at 4 c until they were directly injected on an agilent

quantification and determination of loq the calculation of the loq is slightly different for these compounds and detailed in si section s3 2 6 dna extraction and isolation on each sampling date section 2 3 biomass was also collected for dna extraction to that end lake water 400 ml was filtered on a 0 22 µm sterivex cartridge millipore corporation billerica usa in a biological cabinet using sterile syringes the cartridge was immediately cracked open using a clean pvc pipe cutter and the filter was delicately removed from its support using a scalpel and forceps according to the method of cruaud et al 2017 when the biomass of the lake water was too high and blocking the sterivex a prefiltration on a whatman 47 mm gf a sigma aldrich was done all filters sterivex and gf a were placed in

extraction the total genomic dna was extracted according to allprep dna rna mini kit qiagen cat no 80204 protocol with the modifications detailed in si section s7 two sets of 16s variable regions v1 v3 and v3 v4 and 18s primers variable regions v4 and v8 v9 were used to amplify the samples genomic dna sigma aldrich details of library preparation are available in si section s7 polymerase chain reaction pcr was run on a thermal cycler sensoquest applied biosystems and amplified regions were cleaned with ampure beads beckman coulter after quality checks and dna concentration quantification samples were normalized and pooled before sequencing using the paired end 2 300 600 cycle protocol v3 on a miseq platform illumina at the genomic diversity centre at the eth in zurich switzerland the demultiplexed raw read data is available at the european nucleotide archive ena at embl ebi under accession number prjeb41377 2 7 sequencing data processing sequencing data preparation was performed on the eth euler cluster the workflow used to process the demultiplexed raw data into z otu tables is described in more details in the supplementary information section s15 1 in short after a data quality evaluation to determine the optimal workflow parameters in a first processing step the read ends were trimmed and the read pairs merged we used an in silico pcr approach to remove the primer site on both ends the merged and trimmed reads were quality filtered and size selected we used the classical otu clustering approach uparse2 with a 97 identity threshold and the newer zero otu zotu amplicon sequence variant approach unoise3 both methods are implemented in usearch and well documented in si section s15 1 we used sintax and the silva ssu version 128 16s and pr2 version 4 10 0 18s references to predict taxonomic associations for z otus 2 8 kinetic analysis from the resulting mp concentration time series first order biotransformation rate constants were derived from the linear regression applied to the logarithmic concentrations of mps against experimental time using the software r version 3 5 1 biotransformation rate constants were only considered valid if the degradation percentage was higher than 10 and the r2 of the linear regression was 0 6 below these values the decrease in mp concentrations was considered hidden in the analytical uncertainty or not following a first order kinetic these considerations led to a limit of detection for biotransformation rate constants in our current system of 0 005 day 1 which is equivalent to a half life of approx 140 days any transformation slower than that could not be reported a micropollutant multifunctionality score mpmf was calculated by scaling the rate constants of the individual compounds to an average value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 mpmf was then calculated as the average of all the biotransformed micropollutants scaled biotransformation rate constants for each sampling time and depth separately johnson et al 2015 this mpmf represents the relative biotransformation efficiency of each water sample across all mps exhibiting a quantifiable degree of transformation 2 9 association analysis all environmental variables recorded for the lake at each sampling time are reported in table s2 for downstream analysis they were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to account for the large differences in unit size between the different variables before performing a principal component analysis r package vegan the annotated z otu count tables obtained after data processing were further analysed using r and various r packages see si sections s15 2 and s15 3 only the region v3 v4 of the 16s rrna amplicon and region v8 v9 of the 18s rrna amplicon were kept for further analysis the 16s v3 v4 had more taxonomic assignments than the 16s v1 v3 region and the 18s v4 region primers did not amplify the selected 18s region for many samples to evaluate and rank the most important environmental or microbial community variables predicting biotransformation rate constants we used a random forest model as it seemed appropriate for the type and amount of data generated in our study random forest is a robust machine learning algorithm able to afford non parametric regression analysis of ecological data feld et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2017 it can handle a large number of correlated variables and low number of observations and is suited to analyse non linear relationships and complex interactions even with numerous missing values breiman 2001 it provides variable importance measures highlighting the most important predictors which was used in this study to identify the environmental parameters that were influencing mps biotransformation most the random forest model was developed and validated using the method described in supplementary information section s15 4 3 results discussion 3 1 transformation of micropollutants in lake water out of the 35 compounds analysed in the biotransformation experiments 15 compounds listed in the legend of fig 1 except chlorpyrifos showed a decrease in concentration of more than 10 over the experimental time period i e 19 28 days in at least one of the experiments fig s6 the experimental conditions tried to mirror the lake conditions as much as feasible see supplementary information sections s5 s6 for more details to distinguish between the effect of biotic and abiotic processes in the biotransformation experiments abiotic degradation and sorption controls were run in parallel with the lake water experiments chlorpyrifos showed dissipation in the abiotic and sorption controls to the same extent as in the biotic beakers figs s8 s11 and its dissipation in all beakers was thus ascribed to abiotic hydrolysis and or evaporation it has been shown previously that chlorpyrifos is susceptible to hydrolysis and its half life depends on ph but also salinity and metal concentration e g copper in surface water liu et al 2001 for gabapentin slow dissipation was observed in the different controls at a similar rate average of 0 005 d 1 this abiotic dissipation rate constant was lower than the lake water biotic dissipation rates and therefore subtracted from the lake water biotransformation rate constants to yield estimated biotransformation rate constants verapamil was strongly sorbing during the first day after spiking however the sorbed fraction was very similar for all experiments 15 variation between day 1 concentration values verapamil then showed a first order decrease until day 14 after which its concentrations fell below the limit of quantification since this dissipation could still be compared between the different experiments biotransformation rate constants were calculated between day 1 and day 14 for this compound the remaining 12 compounds did not show any significant dissipation in the controls as shown in figs s8 s11 and their first order rate constants were used without further modification for the following analyses in two experiments july and august non spiked controls were used to determine the biotransformation of mps already present in lake greifen the rate constants obtained were generally not significantly different between spiked and non spiked microcosms fig s12 the biotransformation rate constant values and the tss normalized rate constants for the 14 compounds showing biotransformation are presented in fig 1 and tables s4 s5 the rate constant values obtained were often very low in the 0 005 0 2 d 1 range suggesting generally slow biotransformation in lake water this might be related to the low biomass concentration in the water column tss values of 0 5 8 mg l obtained in lake greifen compared to 1 12 4 g l typically used in activated sludge experiments achermann et al 2018 helbling et al 2012 men et al 2017 however once normalized to the tss content rate constant values for the compounds with observable degradation in the lake water are on the same order of magnitude as those observed in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants achermann et al 2018 falås et al 2016 for a comparison of values see table s5 in the si the half lives for the biotransformed compounds are presented in table 1 the transformation rates and calculated half lives varied by one order of magnitude for the same compound under different conditions i e month sampled or depth for instance the half life of valsartan varies between non detectable in may and june and only 5 6 days in the september experiment metolachor biotransformation was only quantifiable in the august experiment at 3 m but non detectable in all the other experiments gabapentin s half lives measured were 121 days at 3 m but only 19 4 days at 6 m in the august experiment many compounds showed higher biotransformation rates during the august or september period fig 1 when the phytoplankton was growing or around its peak density in lake greifen fig 2 these results qualitatively support the notion that biomass concentration is an important factor in the transformation of these compounds however biomass concentration is not explaining the higher transformation rate constants of some compounds such as mianserin and asulam in may or july or the depth related differences in half lives other parameters such as microbial composition thus need to be considered for the 20 compounds that did not show detectable biotransformation in our study some of them are usually considered persistent in surface waters such as carbamazepine and venlafaxine boix et al 2016 li and mclachlan 2019 löffler et al 2005 tixier et al 2003 others have been found to be transformed in some studies but not in others such as trimethoprim jasper et al 2014 jewell et al 2016 trimethoprim s biotransformation was shown to be taking place at low dissolved oxygen concentrations and is thought to be related to certain heterotrophic microorganisms thriving under sub or anoxic conditions khunjar et al 2011 since our microcosms were not tightly closed and continuously shaken they were operating under aerobic conditions thus perhaps preventing conditions that would favour its biotransformation finally many compounds are known to be biodegradable but no transformation rate could be observed or calculated in our study caffeine for example has been shown to be transformed in lake greifen under similar conditions buerge et al 2003 however the transformation rate they measured was very close to our limit of detection for biotransformation their calculated value being 0 004 0 006 d 1 while our limit of detection was 0 005 d 1 for other compounds a lag phase has previously been observed when 50 µg l were spiked into experimental systems with surface waters in one study for caffeine it took more than 20 days to start seeing a decrease after which the transformation was very fast li and mclachlan 2019 it is possible that the duration of the experiments in our study was not long enough to see the adaptation of microorganisms to the spiked mp concentrations and subsequent onset of biotransformation in the case of gabapentin for instance a lag phase of 10 days was observed in the august experiment followed by a rapid transformation at a rate of 0 112 d 1 from day 10 to day 19 concomitantly with an increase in the experimental replicates variation this phenomenon has also been observed in biotransformation experiments with suspended sediment seller et al 2020 and demonstrates that a differential evolution of the communities in the microcosms could lead to a changing biotransformation potential over time concentrating the biomass or running the experiments for a longer time could have helped detecting slower biotransformation but would also have steered the experimental conditions away from the original lake conditions even more making the microcosms less representative of a real lake ecosystem 3 2 environmental and microbial parameters during sampling times lake greifen was closely monitored during the sampling period in terms of environmental parameters microorganism density and diversity the summer of 2018 was exceptionally dry and warm in switzerland with average temperatures 1 5 c above the average from 1981 2010 and only 59 of the normal precipitation in the northern part of the country météosuisse 2019 during the sampling period there was one major phytoplankton bloom noted starting in august and ending in november fig 2 data on temperature dissolved oxygen ph total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorous nitrite nitrate and ammonium for each sampling time are provided in table s2 the may samples were mainly characterised by high ammonium and nitrate concentrations and comparably low biomass of microorganisms the august september and october samples had high chlorophyll a total organic carbon and total suspended solids tss content as expected given the observed phytoplankton bloom results from a principal component analysis of environmental variables pca fig 3 shows that samples from each sampling time point e g may july cluster well together while each month is clearly separated from the other months this demonstrates that every sampling time had distinct environmental characteristics the pca also shows which environmental conditions most strongly explain the observed variability in the samples fig 3 the two depths 3 m and 6 m typically clustered well together for most experiments demonstrating a good mixing of the water column above the thermocline see temperature and chlorophyll a profiles in fig s1 however in august and september a peak of chlorophyll a was observed at 3 m which is also reflected by higher values of dissolved oxygen tss and toc hence leading to a larger separation between the two studied depths the density of bacteria and phytoplankton cells quantified using flow cytometry are presented in fig s13 the phytoplankton cell density increases over the year with its maximal density in september 13 times higher than in may this result is consistent with the increase in chlorophyll a measured in the lake fig 2 in contrast the bacteria cell density shows only minor fluctuations over the entire period with only a 2 7 fold difference between the lowest density in may and the highest density in october at 3 m depth while not showing a peak during the phytoplankton bloom of september fig s13 there could be a delayed response in bacteria density to the bloom since the highest densities are observed during the decay of microalgae cells in october it is not uncommon to find relatively stable densities of bacteria in lakes during summer arndt and nixdorf 1991 the cell densities for both bacteria and phytoplankton were not significantly different between the 3 m and 6 m samples except for july and september samples in which bacteria were 1 3 times more abundant at 3 m than 6 m fig 4 shows the different shannon α diversity indices for bacteria and eukaryotes at every sampling time even though the bacteria density abundance of cells was not strongly influenced by the phytoplankton bloom the diversity of bacteria number of taxa identified found in the water samples was peaking in august when the phytoplankton cells were on the increase the α diversity of bacteria has been shown to be highest during a diatom bloom previously zhang et al 2018 in contrast while the density of eukaryotes was strongly increasing during that time the observed diversity of eukaryotes stayed relatively constant demonstrating that a few species dominated the bloom because of these contrasting dynamics the diversities indices derived from 16s and 18s rrna amplicon sequences did not correlate with each other during the bloom of phytoplankton and its subsequent decay august to october planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia are particularly relevant in terms of their relative proportions fig s14 these two bacterial phyla are involved in the degradation of polysaccharides and thus often abundant during phytoplankton blooms fuerst 2017 martinez garcia et al 2012 their large suite of enzymes martinez garcia et al 2012 could potentially lead to micropollutant biotransformation as a co metabolic outcome although further research is required to confirm this hypothesis 3 3 statistical association of biotransformation rate constants with lake environmental parameters microorganism density and diversity in order to understand the influence of environmental parameters on the dissipation of mps in lake greifen a random forest model was applied to the biotransformation rates obtained using all the environmental variables including the microorganism densities and diversity indices presented above as descriptors random forest models work by fitting thousands of decision trees to a training data set a subset of the whole data set and averaging the prediction the model then measures the predictive ability of the final decision tree in correctly classifying the outcome here the biotransformation rate constants when using the random forest model to predict the overall mp biotransformation potential the mpmf the model obtained explained 72 of the variance the variable importance i e the best predictors of biotransformation rates is presented here as the mean decrease accuracy which is a measure of how much accuracy the model losses by excluding each variable hence the most relevant variables are the lake temperature conductivity 16s shannon diversity index followed by nitrate concentration and indicators of phytoplankton density such as number of phytoplankton cells per ml and chlorophyll a concentration the most important variables are presented in fig 5 full ordered list in fig s17 the partial dependence plots help understand the causal relationship between specific variables e g temperature conductivity and the mpmf prediction lake temperature was thus identified as the descriptor that best explained the variance in mp biotransformation followed by ions and nutrients indicators such as conductivity and nitrate biomass indicators such as phytoplankton cell density and tss and bacteria diversity as the metabolic potential for biotransformation resides mostly in enzymes krah et al 2016 it seems logical that temperature would affect transformation rates either by increasing microorganism growth rate and or enzymatic activity there was a large increase in the overall mp transformation rate mpmf when the water temperature got over 18 c fig 5 and this might be a tipping point where the activity or abundance of microorganism is high enough to catalyse more transformation reactions meynet et al 2020 it should also be noted that the temperature in the environmental chamber used in this study was kept constant at the temperature measured at the time of sampling hence biotransformation rates in lake greifen could differ from our study due to daily and weekly changes in temperature conductivity and nitrate have inverse relationships with the mpmf fig 5 in many instances high conductivity is related to large input of nutrients and ions into a watercourse often due to the discharge of wastewater or run off from agriculture fields gali et al 2012 in our study however the high nutrient concentrations are most likely related to the enhanced nutrient remineralization following the heavy phytoplankton grazing of the spring and low microorganism density of the may samples weithoff and gaedke 2016 fig 3 although less abundant than bacteria in terms of cell number phytoplankton are larger and heavier and represent the bulk of the lake s microorganism total biomass for micropollutants with non specific transformation pathways i e transformed by enzymes widely present in microorganisms crude biomass could be the best predictor of biotransformation this seems to be the case for sulfonamide compounds whose transformation is either correlating strongly with microorganism density or had similar values when normalised for biomass achermann et al 2018 meynet et al 2020 analogously to temperature when the bacteria diversity reaches a certain threshold here a shannon diversity index of 3 5 fig 5 the overall micropollutant biotransformation increases substantially micropollutant biotransformation rate constants in activated sludge sourced from different wastewater treatment plants have been shown to positively correlate with the communities microbial and functional diversity achermann et al 2018 johnson et al 2015 similarly it was shown that the diversity of phytoplankton species also had a positive influence on the transformation of several mps stravs et al 2019 blunt et al 2018 studied the biotransformation of 27 pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting substances along a wastewater effluent flume gradient in lake mead and found that biotransformation rate constants were higher close to the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant which is also where the bacterial metabolic capacity measured by different carbon sources utilization rates with a biolog ecoplates and species diversity were highest 16s rrna sequencing using spearman rank s correlation we can also confirm that the mpmf is significantly correlating with the 16s shannon diversity index but not with the 18s shannon diversity index fig s16 this finding suggests that procaryote diversity has a stronger impact on biotransformation of micropollutants than eukaryote diversity the random forest approach was also applied to those individual mps that had a complete set of biotransformation rate constants table s4 when investigating relationships between lake parameters and rate constants for individual micropollutants some compounds are closely following the mpmf for propachlor for instance temperature and biomass are again the best predictors explaining the observed variance in rate constants fig s18 however other compounds show some differences in the factors influencing their specific transformation rate constants for atenolol total phosphorous total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon are better predictors of their biotransformation than temperature fig s19 since total phosphorous is measured in unfiltered water it includes the amount found in biomass especially the phytoplankton indeed the highest concentration of total phosphorous is concomitant with the peak of phytoplankton bloom fig 3 table s2 it has been shown by stravs et al 2017 that some microalgae and cyanobacteria could transform atenolol to atenolol acid through enzymatic hydrolysis which potentially explains its larger transformation rate at the peak of phytoplankton density finally the biotransformation rate constants of mianserin are poorly explained by the parameters included in the model only 32 of explained variance fig s20 and this might be due to specific microorganisms needed for its degradation mianserin and asulam have previously been shown to be transformed by ammonia and or nitrite oxidizing microorganisms men et al 2016 yu et al 2018 both compounds have high biotransformation rate constants in may when lake greifen went through a phase called clear water phase during which zooplankton grazing heavily on the spring bloom of phytoplankton release large quantities of ammonia in the water weithoff and gaedke 2016 this is consistent with the higher measured ammonia concentrations in may relative to all other time points table s2 thus increased activity of ammonia oxidizers might explain the increased transformation potential for mianserin and asulam in may 4 conclusions this study measured the biotransformation of 35 compounds at five different sampling dates and two lake water depths and presents a unique dataset of 78 biotransformation rate constants above our detection limit of 0 005 day 1 this project thus provides valuable data for modelling the fate of mps in a lake ecosystem and to support improved risk assessment of contaminants in surface waters the rate constants obtained were in a similar range as those of other dissipation processes such as sedimentation and phototransformation in lakes e g tixier et al 2003 demonstrating that microbial biotransformation is a non negligible process for mp fate in large surface water bodies the rates at which mps were transformed were largely influenced by the lake temperature and the phytoplankton bloom and concurrent increase in bacteria diversity that started in august with eutrophication rise in atmospheric co2 concentration and climate warming blooms of microalgae and cyanobacteria are expected to be more frequent gobler 2020 warmer lakes might lead to higher microorganism biomass and hence to higher overall mp biotransformation this suggests that one of the few silver linings of climate change could be a faster degradation of anthropogenic contaminants in lakes if the majority of the compounds transformed faster under higher temperature and phytoplankton biomass divergence from this general pattern was observed for some compounds e g mianserin asulam their biotransformation rate constants seemed to depend more exclusively on specialized sometimes rare types of microorganisms prior knowledge on involved strains and enzymatic pathways and a high throughput combination of field

16788,for most micropollutants mps present in surface waters such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals the contribution of biotransformation to their overall removal from lake ecosystems is largely unknown this study aims at empirically determining the biotransformation rate constants for 35 mps at different periods of the year and depths of a meso eutrophic lake we then tested statistically the association of environmental parameters and microbial community composition with the biotransformation rate constants obtained biotransformation was observed for 14 out of 35 studied mps for at least one sampling time large variations in biotransformation rate constants were observed over the seasons and between compounds overall the transformation of mps was mostly influenced by the lake s temperature phytoplankton density and bacterial diversity however some individual mps were not following the general trend or association with microorganism biomass the antidepressant mianserin for instance was transformed in all experiments and depths but did not show any relationship with measured environmental parameters suggesting the importance of specific microorganisms in its transformation the results presented here contribute to our understanding of the fate of mps in surface waters and thus support improved risk assessment of contaminants in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotransformation pharmaceuticals pesticides microbial community phytoplankton random forest 1 introduction european lakes are subject to the input of a large range of micropollutants mps ranging from pesticides to pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and personal care products these chemicals can reach surface waters through diffuse sources e g runoff or leaching of pesticides from soils sandin et al 2018 or point sources e g discharge from wastewater treatment plants after incomplete removal eggen et al 2014 as a consequence mps may be found in lake environments at concentrations in the range of several hundred ng l for instance the three common pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole have been measured in lake tegel germany in concentrations of 750 950 and 1200 ng l respectively schimmelpfennig et al 2016 in a lake used as major drinking water supply i e lake mälaren in sweden a total of 46 organic mps have been detected with the highest concentration found being 140 ng l for the anti epileptic lamotrigine rehrl et al 2020 mps can harm aquatic organisms especially in complex mixtures where they might potentially show synergistic effects shao et al 2019 in molluscs for instance antidepressants have been shown to affect spawning and larval release fong and ford 2013 additionally the presence of antibiotic residues even at low concentrations could lead to an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria novo et al 2013 finally these mps can eventually reach drinking water plants luo et al 2014 where they may still be present in considerable concentrations e g up to 600 ng l carbamazepine in finished drinking water kleywegt et al 2011 once they reach lake ecosystems these mps can be dissipated through several known pathways such as flushing sorption and phototransformation tixier et al 2003 the role and importance of biotransformation as a relevant removal process however has received little attention li and mclachlan 2019 showed that some pharmaceuticals were removed at different rates in two different lakes being up to 4 5 times slower in lake mälaren compared to lake norra bergundasjön the authors speculated that this discrepancy was due to a much lower microbial activity in lake mälaren the same study also showed that the pharmaceuticals already present in lake water were transformed faster and without any lag phase compared to those spiked into lake water at elevated concentrations of 50 µg l li and mclachlan 2019 conversely mps dissipated faster in lake water close to the effluent discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant than further away from the facility where their concentrations were diluted blunt et al 2018 in this case the higher biotransformation rates correlated with more active microbial communities together these studies suggest that there might be adaptation of local microbial communities to degrade mps that have a constant input into a lake environment microbial diversity has been identified as another factor potentially influencing mp biotransformation in different contexts e g activated sludge biofilms or phytoplankton cultures the biotransformation rate constants have been found to be higher when the microorganism community was more diverse johnson et al 2015 stravs et al 2019 torresi et al 2016 yet it may be possible that a few specific groups of microorganisms are particularly active in the transformation of specific compounds for instance cyanobacteria were suspected to play an important role in the dissipation of the pesticide glyphosate in lake greifen huntscha et al 2018 despite these new findings there are still large knowledge gaps regarding the potential for biotransformation in lakes for most mps particularly with a few exceptions blunt et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2019 there is hardly any systematic investigation of the spatial and temporal variation of mp biotransformation and how it relates to variation in environmental parameters and microbial community density and composition while concentrations of mps in lake waters have previously been observed to decrease during summer months when the lake is warmer and the microorganisms more abundant huntscha et al 2018 rehrl et al 2020 the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased microbial biotransformation or rather sunlight induced phototransformation could not be resolved in most cases e g huntscha et al 2018 tixier et al 2003 in addition the effects of many physico chemical parameters e g temperature ph dissolved oxygen nutrients on biotransformation rates have been studied in the past see review by fenner et al 2016 but rarely in combination hence increased knowledge about the extent variation and factors influencing biotransformation rate constants of mps in lakes would enable a better prediction of mp dissipation or persistence in natural surface waters and thus improved risk assessment in addition as there is increasing interest in microalgae based wastewater treatment e g da silva rodrigues et al 2020 our study would also inform on the optimal conditions for mp biotransformation and hence foster a better management of contaminated effluents prior to their discharge into the environment this study therefore had two main objectives i to evaluate the importance and variation of biotransformation for a diverse set of relevant mps in a lake ecosystem during different seasons of the year and at different water depths and ii to identify associations between the biotransformation rate constants and different physico chemical parameters of the water samples and microbial community characteristics such as microorganism density composition and diversity by contrasting the effects of the environment including microorganism density and composition at each sampling time and depth we aim to identify the most important drivers of mp biotransformation in a lake ecosystem to this end we sampled a study lake five times between may and october at 3 and 6 metres depth and spiked the lake water with a mixture of 40 mps biotransformation rate constants were derived from the decrease in spiked mp concentrations over time a machine learning approach random forest was used to rank the most important environmental or microbial community variables predicting biotransformation rate constants 2 experimental methods 2 1 chemical and reagents micropollutants were selected to be environmentally relevant i e commonly measured in european watercourses and to cover a variety of chemical structures and potential pathways of transformation the full list is available in table s1 five compounds were excluded from further data processing because of instrumentation analytical

stock solutions of the spiking mixture were prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 2 mg l these stock solutions were further diluted to 100 µg l in milli q water just before each experiment the spiking solution contained 0 2 etoh 2 2 study site lake greifen is an alpine meso eutrophic lake of about 8 46 km2 and a depth of 32 m at its deepest point at the sampling point the lake is 20 m deep

september 11 and october 16 in 2018 at around 9 am dates were selected to be about one month apart this study focused on the warmer months of the year so the microorganism s density and activity would be the largest lake water was collected next to the monitoring station in 3 replicates at a depth of 3 m and 6 m using a 5 l niskin bottle water was filtered through a 80 µm mesh membrane to exclude zooplankton and the filtrate was collected directly in an autoclaved glass bottle that was then kept in a cooler box until all samples were brought back to the laboratory less than 2 hours later all samples were processed that same day a subsample of lake water was used for chemical analysis at the analytic and training laboratory of eawag aua analytik und ausbildungslabor ammonium nitrate

light intensity observed in lake greifen at each sampling time see supplementary information si section s5 a light setup using a combination of large spectrum lights philips master led tube uo 24w 830 t8 and green filters lee filters were used to replicate the light intensity and light spectrum measured in lake greifen at 3 m and 6 m depths fig s2 s3 the temperature of the chamber was set as the average between the 3 m and 6 m lake water temperature on each sampling date for each triplicate of lake water samples a subsample of 400 ml of the raw lake water was used for the biotransformation experiment in a 500 ml wide opening beaker another subsample of 400 ml of the lake water was filtered at 0 2 µm to exclude microorganisms and used in similar beakers as abiotic controls all beakers were covered with a plastic film to reduce evaporation and penetration of dust and microorganisms but not completely sealed to allow air exchange they were placed on a shaker at 120 rpm under a light intensity of 70 µmol photons m 2 s 1 for the 3 m depth samples and 10 µmol photons m 2 s 1 for the 6 m depth and a photoperiod of 14 h light 10 h dark another 150 ml subsample was autoclaved at 120 c for 20 min in a glass nalgene bottle and used as sorption control the sorption controls were kept in tightly closed bottles in the dark also on a shaker at 120 rpm all glassware used for sampling and experiments were muffled at 550 c for 4 hours prior to the experiment to remove any trace of organic contaminants the biotic abiotic and sorption flasks were spiked with the micropollutant spiking mix to a final concentration of 100 ng l containing 0 0002 v v etoh beakers and bottles were gently swirled and the first sample 1 ml for time 0 was taken immediately after further samples were then taken after 4 h 24 h 3 d 7 d 10 d 14 d and 21 d 19 d in the case of the august experiment the october experiment had an additional sample taken after 28 d in the july and august experiments a non spiked control containing lake water and 0 0002 v v etoh was added to the sets of controls to monitor the transformation of mps already present in lake greifen water 2 5 chemical analysis samples from the experimental beakers and bottles were transferred to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 min to remove cells and suspended particles 500 µl of the supernatant was transferred in a glass lc vial and spiked with 20 µl of the internal standard solution final concentration of 80 ng l for each analyte the samples were kept at 4 c until they were directly injected on an agilent

quantification and determination of loq the calculation of the loq is slightly different for these compounds and detailed in si section s3 2 6 dna extraction and isolation on each sampling date section 2 3 biomass was also collected for dna extraction to that end lake water 400 ml was filtered on a 0 22 µm sterivex cartridge millipore corporation billerica usa in a biological cabinet using sterile syringes the cartridge was immediately cracked open using a clean pvc pipe cutter and the filter was delicately removed from its support using a scalpel and forceps according to the method of cruaud et al 2017 when the biomass of the lake water was too high and blocking the sterivex a prefiltration on a whatman 47 mm gf a sigma aldrich was done all filters sterivex and gf a were placed in individual 2 ml screw cap centrifuge tubes containing 0 5 g of glass beads 106 µm sigma aldrich the filters were covered with 1 5 ml of rna later solution sigma aldrich and kept at 20 c until extraction the total genomic dna was extracted according to allprep dna rna mini kit qiagen cat no 80204 protocol with the modifications detailed in si section s7 two sets of 16s variable regions v1 v3 and v3 v4 and 18s primers variable regions v4 and v8 v9 were used to amplify the samples genomic dna sigma aldrich details of library preparation are available in si section s7 polymerase chain reaction pcr was run on a thermal cycler sensoquest applied biosystems and amplified regions were cleaned with ampure beads beckman coulter after quality checks and dna concentration quantification samples were normalized and pooled before sequencing using the paired end 2 300 600 cycle protocol v3 on a miseq platform illumina at the genomic diversity centre at the eth in zurich switzerland the demultiplexed raw read data is available at the european nucleotide archive ena at embl ebi under accession number prjeb41377 2 7 sequencing data processing sequencing data preparation was performed on the eth euler cluster the workflow used to process the demultiplexed raw data into z otu tables is described in more details in the supplementary information section s15 1 in short after a data quality evaluation to determine the optimal workflow parameters in a first processing step the read ends were trimmed and the read pairs merged we used an in silico pcr approach to remove the primer site on both ends the merged and trimmed reads were quality filtered and size selected we used the classical otu clustering approach uparse2 with a 97 identity threshold and the newer zero otu zotu amplicon sequence variant approach unoise3 both methods are implemented in usearch and well documented in si section s15 1 we used sintax and the silva ssu version 128 16s and pr2 version 4 10 0 18s references to predict taxonomic associations for z otus 2 8 kinetic analysis from the resulting mp concentration time series first order biotransformation rate constants were derived from the linear regression applied to the logarithmic concentrations of mps against experimental time using the software r version 3 5 1 biotransformation rate constants were only considered valid if the degradation percentage was higher than 10 and the r2 of the linear regression was 0 6 below these values the decrease in mp concentrations was considered hidden in the analytical uncertainty or not following a first order kinetic these considerations led to a limit of detection for biotransformation rate constants in our current system of 0 005 day 1 which is equivalent to a half life of approx 140 days any transformation slower than that could not be reported a micropollutant multifunctionality score mpmf was calculated by scaling the rate constants of the individual compounds to an average value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 mpmf was then calculated as the average of all the biotransformed micropollutants scaled biotransformation rate constants for each sampling time and depth separately johnson et al 2015 this mpmf represents the relative biotransformation efficiency of each water sample across all mps exhibiting a quantifiable degree of transformation 2 9 association analysis all environmental variables recorded for the lake at each sampling time are reported in table s2 for downstream analysis they were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to account for the large differences in unit size between the different variables before performing a principal component analysis r package vegan the annotated z otu count tables obtained after data processing were further analysed using r and various r packages see si sections s15 2 and s15 3 only the region v3 v4 of the 16s rrna amplicon and region v8 v9 of the 18s rrna amplicon were kept for further analysis the 16s v3 v4 had more taxonomic assignments than the 16s v1 v3 region and the 18s v4 region primers did not amplify the selected 18s region for many samples to evaluate and rank the most important environmental or microbial community variables predicting biotransformation rate constants we used a random forest model as it seemed appropriate for the type and amount of data generated in our study random forest is a robust machine learning algorithm able to afford non parametric regression analysis of ecological data feld et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2017 it can handle a large number of correlated variables and low number of observations and is suited to analyse non linear relationships and complex interactions even with numerous missing values breiman 2001 it provides variable importance measures highlighting the most important predictors which was used in this study to identify the environmental parameters that were influencing mps biotransformation most the random forest model was developed and validated using the method described in supplementary information section s15 4 3 results discussion 3 1 transformation of micropollutants in lake water out of the 35 compounds analysed in the biotransformation experiments 15 compounds listed in the legend of fig 1 except chlorpyrifos showed a decrease in concentration of more than 10 over the experimental time period i e 19 28 days in at least one of the experiments fig s6 the experimental conditions tried to mirror the lake conditions as much as feasible see supplementary information sections s5 s6 for more details to distinguish between the effect of biotic and abiotic processes in the biotransformation experiments abiotic degradation and sorption controls were run in parallel with the lake water experiments chlorpyrifos showed dissipation in the abiotic and sorption controls to the same extent as in the biotic beakers figs s8 s11 and its dissipation in all beakers was thus ascribed to abiotic hydrolysis and or evaporation it has been shown previously that chlorpyrifos is susceptible to hydrolysis and its half life depends on ph but also salinity and metal concentration e g copper in surface water liu et al 2001 for gabapentin slow dissipation was observed in the different controls at a similar rate average of 0 005 d 1 this abiotic dissipation rate constant was lower than the lake water biotic dissipation rates and therefore subtracted from the lake water biotransformation rate constants to yield estimated biotransformation rate constants verapamil was strongly sorbing during the first day after spiking however the sorbed fraction was very similar for all experiments 15 variation between day 1 concentration values verapamil then showed a first order decrease until day 14 after which its concentrations fell below the limit of quantification since this dissipation could still be compared between the different experiments biotransformation rate constants were calculated between day 1 and day 14 for this compound the remaining 12 compounds did not show any significant dissipation in the controls as shown in figs s8 s11 and their first order rate constants were used without further modification for the following analyses in two experiments july and august non spiked controls were used to determine the biotransformation of mps already present in lake greifen the rate constants obtained were generally not significantly different between spiked and non spiked microcosms fig s12 the biotransformation rate constant values and the tss normalized rate constants for the 14 compounds showing biotransformation are presented in fig 1 and tables s4 s5 the rate constant values obtained were often very low in the 0 005 0 2 d 1 range suggesting generally slow biotransformation in lake water this might be related to the low biomass concentration in the water column tss values of 0 5 8 mg l obtained in lake greifen compared to 1 12 4 g l typically used in activated sludge experiments achermann et al 2018 helbling et al 2012 men et al 2017 however once normalized to the tss content rate constant values for the compounds with observable degradation in the lake water are on the same order of magnitude as those observed in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants achermann et al 2018 falås et al 2016 for a comparison of values see table s5 in the si the half lives for the biotransformed compounds are presented in table 1 the transformation rates and calculated half lives varied by one order of magnitude for the same compound under different conditions i e month sampled or depth for instance the half life of valsartan varies between non detectable in may and june and only 5 6 days in the september experiment metolachor biotransformation was only quantifiable in the august experiment at 3 m but non detectable in all the other experiments gabapentin s half lives measured were 121 days at 3 m but only 19 4 days at 6 m in the august experiment many compounds showed higher biotransformation rates during the august or september period fig 1 when the phytoplankton was growing or around its peak density in lake greifen fig 2 these results qualitatively support the notion that biomass concentration is an important factor in the transformation of these compounds however biomass concentration is not explaining the higher transformation rate constants of some compounds such as mianserin and asulam in may or july or the depth related differences in half lives other parameters such as microbial composition thus need to be considered for the 20 compounds that did not show detectable biotransformation in our study some of them are usually considered persistent in surface waters such as carbamazepine and venlafaxine boix et al 2016 li and mclachlan 2019 löffler et al 2005 tixier et al 2003 others have been found to be transformed in some studies but not in others such as trimethoprim jasper et al 2014 jewell et al 2016 trimethoprim s biotransformation was shown to be taking place at low dissolved oxygen concentrations and is thought to be related to certain heterotrophic microorganisms thriving under sub or anoxic conditions khunjar et al 2011 since our microcosms were not tightly closed and continuously shaken they were operating under aerobic conditions thus perhaps preventing conditions that would favour its biotransformation finally many compounds are known to be biodegradable but no transformation rate could be observed or calculated in our study caffeine for example has been shown to be transformed in lake greifen under similar conditions buerge et al 2003 however the transformation rate they measured was very close to our limit of detection for biotransformation their calculated value being 0 004 0 006 d 1 while our limit of detection was 0 005 d 1 for other compounds a lag phase has previously been observed when 50 µg l were spiked into experimental systems with surface waters in one study for caffeine it took more than 20 days to start seeing a decrease after which the transformation was very fast li and mclachlan 2019 it is possible that the duration of the experiments in our study was not long enough to see the adaptation of microorganisms to the spiked mp concentrations and subsequent onset of biotransformation in the case of gabapentin for instance a lag phase of 10 days was observed in the august experiment followed by a rapid transformation at a rate of 0 112 d 1 from day 10 to day 19 concomitantly with an increase in the experimental replicates variation this phenomenon has also been observed in biotransformation experiments with suspended sediment seller et al 2020 and demonstrates that a differential evolution of the communities in the microcosms could lead to a changing biotransformation potential over time concentrating the biomass or running the experiments for a longer time could have helped detecting slower biotransformation but would also have steered the experimental conditions away from the original lake conditions even more making the microcosms less representative of a real lake ecosystem 3 2 environmental and microbial parameters during sampling times lake greifen was closely monitored during the sampling period in terms of environmental parameters microorganism density and diversity the summer of 2018 was exceptionally dry and warm in switzerland with average temperatures 1 5 c above the average from 1981 2010 and only 59 of the normal precipitation in the northern part of the country météosuisse 2019 during the sampling period there was one major phytoplankton bloom noted starting in august and ending in november fig 2 data on temperature dissolved oxygen ph total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorous nitrite nitrate and ammonium for each sampling time are provided in table s2 the may samples were mainly characterised by high ammonium and nitrate concentrations and comparably low biomass of microorganisms the august september and october samples had high chlorophyll a total organic carbon and total suspended solids tss content as expected given the observed phytoplankton bloom results from a principal component analysis of environmental variables pca fig 3 shows that samples from each sampling time point e g may july cluster well together while each month is clearly separated from the other months this demonstrates that every sampling time had distinct environmental characteristics the pca also shows which environmental conditions most strongly explain the observed variability in the samples fig 3 the two depths 3 m and 6 m typically clustered well together for most experiments demonstrating a good mixing of the water column above the thermocline see temperature and chlorophyll a profiles in fig s1 however in august and september a peak of chlorophyll a was observed at 3 m which is also reflected by higher values of dissolved oxygen tss and toc hence leading to a larger separation between the two studied depths the density of bacteria and phytoplankton cells quantified using flow cytometry are presented in fig s13 the phytoplankton cell density increases over the year with its maximal density in september 13 times higher than in may this result is consistent with the increase in chlorophyll a measured in the lake fig 2 in contrast the bacteria cell density shows only minor fluctuations over the entire period with only a 2 7 fold difference between the lowest density in may and the highest density in october at 3 m depth while not showing a peak during the phytoplankton bloom of september fig s13 there could be a delayed response in bacteria density to the bloom since the highest densities are observed during the decay of microalgae cells in october it is not uncommon to find relatively stable densities of bacteria in lakes during summer arndt and nixdorf 1991 the cell densities for both bacteria and phytoplankton were not significantly different between the 3 m and 6 m samples except for july and september samples in which bacteria were 1 3 times more abundant at 3 m than 6 m fig 4 shows the different shannon α diversity indices for bacteria and eukaryotes at every sampling time even though the bacteria density abundance of cells was not strongly influenced by the phytoplankton bloom the diversity of bacteria number of taxa identified found in the water samples was peaking in august when the phytoplankton cells were on the increase the α diversity of bacteria has been shown to be highest during a diatom bloom previously zhang et al 2018 in contrast while the density of eukaryotes was strongly increasing during that time the observed diversity of eukaryotes stayed relatively constant demonstrating that a few species dominated the bloom because of these contrasting dynamics the diversities indices derived from 16s and 18s rrna amplicon sequences did not correlate with each other during the bloom of phytoplankton and its subsequent decay august to october planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia are particularly relevant in terms of their relative proportions fig s14 these two bacterial phyla are involved in the degradation of polysaccharides and thus often abundant during phytoplankton blooms fuerst 2017 martinez garcia et al 2012 their large suite of enzymes martinez garcia et al 2012 could potentially lead to micropollutant biotransformation as a co metabolic outcome although further research is required to confirm this hypothesis 3 3 statistical association of biotransformation rate constants with lake environmental parameters microorganism density and diversity in order to understand the influence of environmental parameters on the dissipation of mps in lake greifen a random forest model was applied to the biotransformation rates obtained using all the environmental variables including the microorganism densities and diversity indices presented above as descriptors random forest models work by fitting thousands of decision trees to a training data set a subset of the whole data set and averaging the prediction the model then measures the predictive ability of the final decision tree in correctly classifying the outcome here the biotransformation rate constants when using the random forest model to predict the overall mp biotransformation potential the mpmf the model obtained explained 72 of the variance the variable importance i e the best predictors of biotransformation rates is presented here as the mean decrease accuracy which is a measure of how much accuracy the model losses by excluding each variable hence the most relevant variables are the lake temperature conductivity 16s shannon diversity index followed by nitrate concentration and indicators of phytoplankton density such as number of phytoplankton cells per ml and chlorophyll a concentration the most important variables are presented in fig 5 full ordered list in fig s17 the partial dependence plots help understand the causal relationship between specific variables e g temperature conductivity and the mpmf prediction lake temperature was thus identified as the descriptor that best explained the variance in mp biotransformation followed by ions and nutrients indicators such as conductivity and nitrate biomass indicators such as phytoplankton cell density and tss and bacteria diversity as the metabolic potential for biotransformation resides mostly in enzymes krah et al 2016 it seems logical that temperature would affect transformation rates either by increasing microorganism growth rate and or enzymatic activity there was a large increase in the overall mp transformation rate mpmf when the water temperature got over 18 c fig 5 and this might be a tipping point where the activity or abundance of microorganism is high enough to catalyse more transformation reactions meynet et al 2020 it should also be noted that the temperature in the environmental chamber used in this study was kept constant at the temperature measured at the time of sampling hence biotransformation rates in lake greifen could differ from our study due to daily and weekly changes in temperature conductivity and nitrate have inverse relationships with the mpmf fig 5 in many instances high conductivity is related to large input of nutrients and ions into a watercourse often due to the discharge of wastewater or run off from agriculture fields gali et al 2012 in our study however the high nutrient concentrations are most likely related to the enhanced nutrient remineralization following the heavy phytoplankton grazing of the spring and low microorganism density of the may samples weithoff and gaedke 2016 fig 3 although less abundant than bacteria in terms of cell number phytoplankton are larger and heavier and represent the bulk of the lake s microorganism total biomass for micropollutants with non specific transformation pathways i e transformed by enzymes widely present in microorganisms crude biomass could be the best predictor of biotransformation this seems to be the case for sulfonamide compounds whose transformation is either correlating strongly with microorganism density or had similar values when normalised for biomass achermann et al 2018 meynet et al 2020 analogously to temperature when the bacteria diversity reaches a certain threshold here a shannon diversity index of 3 5 fig 5 the overall micropollutant biotransformation increases substantially micropollutant biotransformation rate constants in activated sludge sourced from different wastewater treatment plants have been shown to positively correlate with the communities microbial and functional diversity achermann et al 2018 johnson et al 2015 similarly it was shown that the diversity of phytoplankton species also had a positive influence on the transformation of several mps stravs et al 2019 blunt et al 2018 studied the biotransformation of 27 pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting substances along a wastewater effluent flume gradient in lake mead and found that biotransformation rate constants were higher close to the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant which is also where the bacterial metabolic capacity measured by different carbon sources utilization rates with a biolog ecoplates and species diversity were highest 16s rrna sequencing using spearman rank s correlation we can also confirm that the mpmf is significantly correlating with the 16s shannon diversity index but not with the 18s shannon diversity index fig s16 this finding suggests that procaryote diversity has a stronger impact on biotransformation of micropollutants than eukaryote diversity the random forest approach was also applied to those individual mps that had a complete set of biotransformation rate constants table s4 when investigating relationships between lake parameters and rate constants for individual micropollutants some compounds are closely following the mpmf for propachlor for instance temperature and biomass are again the best predictors explaining the observed variance in rate constants fig s18 however other compounds show some differences in the factors influencing their specific transformation rate constants for atenolol total phosphorous total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon are better predictors of their biotransformation than temperature fig s19 since total phosphorous is measured in unfiltered water it includes the amount found in biomass especially the phytoplankton indeed the highest concentration of total phosphorous is concomitant with the peak of phytoplankton bloom fig 3 table s2 it has been shown by stravs et al 2017 that some microalgae and cyanobacteria could transform atenolol to atenolol acid through enzymatic hydrolysis which potentially explains its larger transformation rate at the peak of phytoplankton density finally the biotransformation rate constants of mianserin are poorly explained by the parameters included in the model only 32 of explained variance fig s20 and this might be due to specific microorganisms needed for its degradation mianserin and asulam have previously been shown to be transformed by ammonia and or nitrite oxidizing microorganisms men et al 2016 yu et al 2018 both compounds have high biotransformation rate constants in may when lake greifen went through a phase called clear water phase during which zooplankton grazing heavily on the spring bloom of phytoplankton release large quantities of ammonia in the water weithoff and gaedke 2016 this is consistent with the higher measured ammonia concentrations in may relative to all other time points table s2 thus increased activity of ammonia oxidizers might explain the increased transformation potential for mianserin and asulam in may 4 conclusions this study measured the biotransformation of 35 compounds at five different sampling dates and two lake water depths and presents a unique dataset of 78 biotransformation rate constants above our detection limit of 0 005 day 1 this project thus provides valuable data for modelling the fate of mps in a lake ecosystem and to support improved risk assessment of contaminants in surface waters the rate constants obtained were in a similar range as those of other dissipation processes such as sedimentation and phototransformation in lakes e g tixier et al 2003 demonstrating that microbial biotransformation is a non negligible process for mp fate in large surface water bodies the rates at which mps were transformed were largely influenced by the lake temperature and the phytoplankton bloom and concurrent increase in bacteria diversity that started in august with eutrophication rise in atmospheric co2 concentration and climate warming blooms of microalgae and cyanobacteria are expected to be more frequent gobler 2020 warmer lakes might lead to higher microorganism biomass and hence to higher overall mp biotransformation this suggests that one of the few silver linings of climate change could be a faster degradation of anthropogenic contaminants in lakes if the majority of the compounds transformed faster under higher temperature and phytoplankton biomass divergence from this general pattern was observed for some compounds e g mianserin asulam their biotransformation rate constants seemed to depend more exclusively on specialized sometimes rare types of microorganisms prior knowledge on involved strains and enzymatic pathways and a high throughput combination of field

16789,microplastics provide a unique habitat for microorganisms forming the plastisphere yet the ecology of the plastisphere including the microbial composition functions assembly processes and interaction networks needs to be understood here we collected microplastics and their surrounding water samples in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the bacterial and fungal communities of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were studied based on 16s and internal transcribed spacer its high throughput sequencing we found that the plastisphere had a distinct microbial community and recruited a noteworthy proportion of unique species compared to the aquatic environment community potentially altering ecosystem microbial community and causing microbial invasion using a random forest machine learning model we identified a group of biomarkers that could best distinguish the plastisphere from the aquatic environment significant differences exist in microbial functions between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions of pathogenicity compound degradation as well as functions related to the cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur and these functional differences were expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the oxidation reduction potential salinity the concentrations of nitrogen related ions no3 no2 and nh4 and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the surrounding environment drive the variation of the plastisphere but environmental physicochemical properties explain less of the microbial community variation in the plastisphere than that in the aquatic environment niche based processes govern the assembly of the plastisphere community while neutral based processes dominate the community assembly of the aquatic environment furthermore compared to the aquatic environment the plastisphere has a network of less complexity more modules higher modularity and more competitive links in freshwater ecosystems but the pattern is reversed in seawater ecosystems altogether the microbial ecology of the new anthropogenic ecosystem plastisphere is unique and exerts different effects in freshwater and seawater ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic environment assembly process interaction network microbial community microplastic plastisphere 1 introduction total global plastic production to date may be approaching 10 billion metric tons with the annual production almost reaching 370 million metric tons in 2019 geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2020 only about 9 of plastic waste can be recycled and 79 accumulates in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 wright et al 2021 the plastic accumulated in the environment becomes fragmented and weathered by physical chemical and biological processes and eventually forms microplastics 5 mm julienne et al 2019 ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition some microplastics such as abrasive particles in personal care products enter the environment direct from manufacturing cheung and fok 2017 sun et al 2020a inadvertent ingestion of microplastics by animals may have toxic effects on their health ding et al 2020 jacob et al 2020 plants growing in microplastic contaminated soil also lose their normal physiological traits machado et al 2019 rillig and lehmann 2020 sun et al 2020b surprisingly microplastics with a sufficiently small particle size can directly penetrate the epidermis and enter the organism li et al 2020 sun et al 2020b moreover microplastics are widely distributed and exist in almost any corner of the world miller 2020 li et al 2021 even in the air evangeliou et al 2020 wang et al 2020d zhang et al 2020b antarctic munari et al 2017 reed et al 2018 and arctic bergmann et al 2017 kanhai et al 2018 peeken et al 2018 notably the recent discovery of microplastics in the human placenta suggests that humans may no longer be able to live in a plastic free environment ragusa et al 2021 the buoyancy and the hydrophobic organic polymer surface of microplastics in the environment provides a unique niche for microorganisms zettler et al 2013 this new human made ecosystem is called the plastisphere zettler et al 2013 amaral zettler et al 2020 microorganisms selectively colonize the plastisphere thus forming a specific microbial community wang et al 2020b bhagwat et al 2021 mughini gras et al 2021 the biomass of the plastisphere was previously estimated to be about 0 01 0 2 of the total microbial biomass in ocean surface water amaral zettler et al 2020 however as it has been confirmed that we can measure only 1 of the plastic waste in the marine ecosystem the biomass of the plastisphere will be much higher than this value van sebille et al 2015 amaral zettler et al 2020 therefore based on the significant microbial biomass of the plastisphere and the vital role of microorganisms in biogeochemical systems sunagawa et al 2015 we must pay attention to the ecology of the plastisphere which is crowned as the eighth continent banerjee et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2020 dąbrowska 2021 in this study to better understand the impact of microplastic pollution and to explore plastisphere ecology we investigated the plastisphere and the corresponding aquatic environments in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the objectives of this study were to address the following questions 1 what is the difference between the composition and functions of the microbial community in the plastisphere and in the corresponding aquatic environment 2 what factors shape the plastisphere microbial community and which is more important in the plastisphere microbial community assembly niche based deterministic processes or neutral based stochastic processes 3 what are the patterns and mechanisms of interaction networks between microorganisms in the plastisphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection based on the prevalence of microplastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems and the toxic effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms aquatic ecosystems were selected as the area for study microplastic and water samples were collected from three freshwater ecosystems the dagu river the moshui river and the wulong river and three seawater ecosystems northeast of jiaozhou bay southwest of jiaozhou bay and dingzi bay in qingdao city and yantai city shandong province china in september 2020 fig s1 table s1 a manta trawl was hung behind a boat to collect microplastics approximately every two nautical miles a microplastic sample was obtained from the trawl with sterile forceps and then placed into a sterile tube simultaneously two samples of surface water were taken each one being approximately 2 l in volume and collected into a sterile bottle one was collected to obtain the microbiota in the aquatic environment and the other one was used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the water microplastic samples were immediately transferred to 80 c for storage until analysis each water sample used for microbial analysis was first filtered with a qualitative filter paper 80 120 μm to remove interfering substances and then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the membranes were then stored at 80 c until analysis in total we obtained 36 samples to analyze for environmental physicochemical properties and 72 samples microplastic samples and water samples for simultaneous detection of bacteria and fungi 2 2 analysis of physicochemical properties of the surrounding

of no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 were determined by a continuous flow auto analyzer scalars san skylar analytical b v breda the netherlands the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer elementar acquray toc cube frankfurt germany 2 3 extraction amplification and sequencing of dna analysis of the microbiota samples was carried out by profiling 16s rrna and its genes using illumina high throughput sequencing in novogene co ltd beijing china the dna for each sample was extracted using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab method raimundo et al 2018 trojánek et al 2018 and detailed procedures are provided in the supplementary materials the primers 515f and 806r were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and the primers its5 1737f and its2 2043r were used to amplify the its1 region of the its gene for fungi the amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2 agarose gel for detection only samples with the bright main strip between 400 450 bp were chosen for further experiments all the amplified products were purified with a genejet gel extraction kit thermo fisher scientific amplicon libraries were generated using a truseq dna pcr free sample preparation kit and then quantified and detected using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific and an agilent2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies palo alto ca finally the libraries were sequenced on the illumina novaseq 6000 platform 2 4 sequencing data processing and analysis the 16s and its gene sequences were processed with qiime v 2 caporaso et al 2010 usearch v 10 0 240 edgar 2010 and vsearch v2 15 1 rognes et al 2016 the metadata of the study can be found in table s1 paired raw sequences were joined and quality filtered primer sequences and barcodes were removed clustering of reads into otus was based on 97 sequence identity the taxonomy of the otus was classified based on the rdp classifier for 16s wang et al 2007 and unite database for its koljalg et al 2013 respectively functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax was carried out to annotate bacteria functions louca et al 2016 and funguild was used to annotate fungal functions nguyen et al 2016 2 5 habitat niche breadth neutral model and null model levins niche breadth values of species were calculated using the spaa package in r v 4 0 2 https www r project org and the average niche breadth of all species in one community was used to estimate the habitat niche breadth zhou et al 2021 the neutral model developed by sloan et al 2006 was used to assess the contribution of neutral processes in community assembly the model describes the relationship between the abundance and frequency of species with a neutral based assembly process predicted within the model and a niche based assembly process implied outside the model the m in the model represents the species migration rate and a higher m value indicates a lower dispersal limit finally a null model was performed using the nst r package to estimate the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in the community assembly process a null distribution of the expected beta diversity based on bray curtis distance was obtained by randomly shuffling the original communities and then the normalized stochasticity ratio nst was calculated an nst value of less than 0 5 indicates that deterministic processes dominate and conversely stochastic processes dominate where the nst value is over 0 5 2 6 network analysis and keystone species to explore the patterns of microbial interactions network analysis was carried out based on spearman rank correlations we focused on species whose relative abundance exceeded 0 001 and appeared in at least 80 of the samples interactions with correlation coefficients no greater than 0 6 or p values no less than 0 05 were excluded the interactive platform gephi v 0 9 2 was used to generate network diagrams and analyze topological parameters nodes in the network represent otus and links connected between nodes represent close relationships the group of nodes that are highly connected within this group but less connected to outside this group is called a module nodes are classified into four categories based on within module connectivity zi as well as among module connectivity pi peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs connectors and network hubs are also recognized as keystone species in the community as their absence would collapse the network 2 7 other statistical analysis unconstrained principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance was carried out to visualize the differences in compositions or functions between the plastisphere microbiota and the aquatic environment microbiota permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the statistical significance of the differences and the variation explained by different habitats the plastisphere and the aquatic environment a random forest machine learning model was used to find the biomarkers that could best distinguish between the plastisphere and aquatic environments using data from freshwater ecosystems as the training set to identify biomarkers and testing the accuracy of the biomarker in seawater ecosystems the geographic distance environmental difference euclidean distance based on all the detected environmental physicochemical factors and the corresponding community similarity 1 minus bray curtis distance between every two sites were calculated the relationships between microbial similarity and geographic distance and microbial similarity and environmental difference were explored using linear regression models mantel analysis was used to explore the effects of environmental physicochemical factors on microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment redundancy analysis rda was performed to explore the constraints placed on microbial communities by environment physicochemical factors all the above analyses and plotting were performed in r 2 8 data availability all sequencing data from this study have been deposited in the ncbi under the accession number prjna717904 3 results 3 1 the diversity and composition of the plastisphere microbial community we explored the differences in composition and diversity of microbial communities between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems rarefaction curves showed that populations of this study contained most of the microbiome members from each habitat fig s2 cluster analysis based on bray curtis distance between samples showed that microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment formed two obvious clusters fig s3 for bacterial communities fig s4 for fungal communities pcoa revealed that the composition of the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment differed significantly in the first dimension for both bacterial fig 1 a b and fungal fig 1c d communities in freshwater fig 1a c or seawater fig 1b d ecosystems permanova further verified the statistical significance of the differences in microbial community composition between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment p 0 001 we found that significant differences in the richness of the microbiota existed between the plastisphere and aquatic environment fig 1e in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems the richness of bacterial communities was significantly higher in the plastisphere than in the aquatic environment while the fungal communities in the plastisphere had relatively lower richness fig 1e this result indicates that the plastisphere recruited more bacterial species and fewer fungal species than the aquatic environment by calculating the bray curtis dissimilarity of microbial communities within each habitat the beta diversity of microbial communities in the plastisphere was found to be significantly higher than that in aquatic environments fig 1f indicating the greater heterogeneity of the plastisphere as a microbial habitat the main bacterial phyla detected included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria firmicutes verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and acidobacteria fig 1g significant differences existed in proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment both in freshwater and seawater ecosystems p 0 05 fig s5a b table s2 the main fungal phyla detected included ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota rozellomycota mortierellomycota and cercozoa fig 1h significant differences existed in chytridiomycota between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems p 0 05 fig s5c d table s3 3 2 the unique species enriched species and biomarkers of the plastisphere we explored the specific differences in community composition between the plastisphere and aquatic environment at the otu level first the bipartite association network showed that in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems the number of unique species in the plastisphere or the aquatic environment accounted for a considerable proportion although most of the microbial species in the two habitats were shared fig 2 a b for bacteria fig 2a the plastisphere recruited more unique species than the aquatic environment but for fungi fig 2b the number of unique species in each of the two habitats was comparable second through the difference test of species relative abundance we obtained the number of species enriched and depleted in the plastisphere compared with the aquatic environment fig 2c we found that significant differences existed in most species between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment with plastisphere enriched species outnumbering the aquatic environment enriched species and this pattern existed in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and for both bacterial and fungal communities fig 2c in addition we established a random forest machine learning model using the order level data in freshwater ecosystems to find the most important features that can distinguish microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment the top twenty most important features were selected as a group of biomarkers to differentiate the two habitats and the accuracy was 100 fig 2d table s4 among this group of biomarkers fifteen features had significantly higher relative abundance in the aquatic environment while the other five features were enriched in the plastisphere fig 2e table s4 surprisingly when we used the biomarkers to predict the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in seawater ecosystems the accuracy was also 100 fig 2f showing that the differences between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment with respect to these microorganisms is common to both freshwater and seawater ecosystems 3 3 the microbial functions of the plastisphere we analyzed the functions of bacterial and fungal communities by faprotax supplementary table 1 and funguild supplementary table 2 respectively pcoa revealed that significant differences existed in microbial functional composition between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in the first dimension with the first dimension explaining 45 for bacteria and 71 for fungi of the functional composition fig 3 a b permanova further verified the significant differences between the functional composition of microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment p 0 001 fig 3a b by comparing the relative abundance of microbial functions in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment we found that most of the high abundance functions differed significantly between the two habitats fig 3c f table s5 these functions include those related to pathogenicity including human pathogens in the case of bacteria and pathotrophs in the case of fungi compound degradation including hydrocarbon degradation aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and aromatic compound degradation and cycling of carbon including methylotrophy and methanol oxidation nitrogen including nitrogen respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification and sulfur including dark thiosulfate oxidation and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fig 3c f table s5 in addition the functions that differed significantly between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were not consistent between freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 3c f table s5 3 4 factors shaping the plastisphere microbial community the distance decay model revealed that microbial communities in the plastisphere as well as in the aquatic environment experienced a significant decline in community similarity with increasing geographic distance fig 4 a supplementary table 3 statistically significant linear regression models showed that environmental differences the euclidean distance of environmental factors between sites also affected the community similarity of both plastisphere and aquatic environmental microbiota fig 4b supplementary table 3 to further explore the environmental drivers for plastisphere microbial variation we performed the mantel analysis between microbial community and environmental factors fig 4c d table s6 results showed that the plastisphere bacterial community was significantly affected by orp salinity nitrogen related ions and the doc of the water environment and the environmental drivers of the plastisphere fungal community additionally included ph fig 4c d notably mantel p and mantel r showed that the microbial community in the plastisphere was less affected by salinity than the microbial community in the aquatic environment fig 4c d rda revealed that the microbial community in the plastisphere was less constrained by environmental factors than the microbial community in the aquatic environment as evidenced by environmental factors explained 47 47 of the variation of the plastisphere bacterial community fig s6a 61 32 of the variation of the aquatic environment bacterial community fig s6b 43 00 of the variation of the plastisphere fungal community fig s6c and 61 78 of the variation of the aquatic environment fungal community fig s6d then we explored the role of niche based deterministic and neutral based stochastic processes in structuring plastisphere microbial communities as revealed by habitat niche breadth the neutral model and the null model first the results revealed that the plastisphere had a lower habitat niche breadth than the aquatic environment whether in freshwater or seawater and whether for bacteria or fungi fig 5 a b table s7 second the lower r2 values and m values migration rates of the neutral models for plastisphere microbial community indicated that stochastic ecological processes played a smaller role in the community structure of the plastisphere microbiota than they did in the community structure of the aquatic environment fig 5c d bacterial and fungal communities showed similar patterns but the variation in community structure explained by the neutral models and migration rates was higher for bacterial communities than for fungal communities fig 5c d furthermore the null models revealed that stochasticity played a dominant role in the assembly processes of the aquatic environmental microbial communities whereas deterministic factors had a greater effect on the structure of plastisphere microbial communities fig 5e f table s8 in addition the metacommunities integrating the microbial communities in plastisphere and aquatic environments fw mfw and sw msw were all dominated by deterministic processes in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and for both bacteria and fungi indicating that there was significant niche selection in the microbial community structure because of significant habitat differences between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment fig 5e f table s8 3 5 interaction patterns and keystone species of plastisphere microbiota we explored the interaction patterns across microbiomes in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment through network analysis overall the microbial networks of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment had a relatively high degree of modularity 0 65 and species in the same module had strong interactions or shared niches fig 6 a d the relationships between microorganisms tended to co occurrence rather than co exclusion with more than half of them being positively correlated fig 6e table s9 by comparing the average degree and average weighted degree of networks we found that the interactions between microorganisms in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment of freshwater ecosystems were more complex than those of seawater ecosystems fig 6e table s9 in freshwater ecosystems the microbial network of the plastisphere had less complexity more modules higher modularity and a lower proportion of positive links compared to the network of the aquatic environment fig 6e table s9 in contrast the opposite pattern was observed in seawater ecosystems with the microbial network in the plastisphere having more complexity fewer modules lower modularity and more positive links than the aquatic environment fig 6e table s9 finally we screened the keystone species of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig s7 supplementary table 4 notably there was little intersection between the keystone species of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 6f we used linear regression models to examine the effect of keystone species on community functions and the highly significant linear regression models indicated that the difference between keystone species was the important factor causing differences in community functions fig 6g 4 discussion 4 1 the plastisphere has a distinct microbial community consistent with previously reported findings zettler et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2020 the plastisphere and the aquatic environment had distinct microbiota in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems in our study fig 1 which could affect the structure and evolution of the whole microbial community in these ecosystems wang et al 2020a based on this we screened a group of biomarkers using a random forest machine learning model that accurately distinguished between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 2d f the main reason for the significantly distinct composition of microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment may be that microplastics act as a filter for microorganisms in the environment as a hydrophobic organic vehicle with a large specific surface area microplastics readily adsorb organic matter from the environment including organic carbon sources and pollutants such as pesticides wang et al 2020c polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs sharma et al 2020 in addition most of the chemicals added to plastics during manufacturing are also toxic to organisms hahladakis et al 2018 including intolerant microorganisms but can act as nutrient sources for certain other microorganisms kooi et al 2017 li et al 2020 so microplastics may in effect act as a filter for such microorganisms a second reason may be that microplastics bring with them microorganisms from their original environment plastics are produced by human activities and enter aquatic ecosystems from land air and other ways wang et al 2019 birch et al 2020 ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2021 and they will undoubtedly carry microorganisms from their original environment amaral zettler et al 2020 we found that plastisphere microbiota were less affected by environmental factors than were the microbiota of water figs 4c d s6 which would allow microplastics to act as an umbrella for microbiota rafting microorganisms from their pollution sources into ecosystems we speculate therefore that the origin of the microplastics and the chemical environment that they provide can explain the uniqueness of their microbial community we found that the plastisphere and the aquatic environment each had a noteworthy portion of unique microorganisms fig 2a b the microorganisms unique to the aquatic environment might be the microorganisms that cannot tolerate the plastisphere environment and the microorganisms unique to the plastisphere might be those that were carried by microplastics from their pollution sources one aspect that deserves further attention however is the potential for these unique species rafted by microplastics from other environments to pose a microbial invasion risk to the ecosystem amaral zettler et al 2020 bowley et al 2021 4 2 potential impacts of the plastisphere microbial community on ecosystem function and health the distinct microbial community composition of the plastisphere resulted in a significant functional differentiation between the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in our study indicating that microplastic pollution has the potential to affect ecosystem functions fig 3 the microbial functions were analyzed based on faprotax and funguild in this study and further research with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic technologies is needed to gain a clearer understanding of plastisphere functions firstly we found that the functions associated with the biogeochemical cycling of elements differed significantly between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions related to the cycling of carbon methylotrophy and methanol oxidation nitrogen nitrogen respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification and sulfur dark thiosulfate oxidation and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds therefore microplastics might affect the elemental cycling function of ecosystems by forming unique microbial communities in the plastisphere it has been reported in previous studies that microplastics could also affect the elemental biogeochemical cycling function of ecosystems by altering the microbial communities in the environmental media in which the pollution occurs li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 secondly the plastisphere is rich in chemicals that are released by the microplastics themselves and adsorbed from the surrounding environment wright et al 2020 as the concentration of hydrophobic chemicals on the surface of plastics is up to 106 times that of the surrounding water mato et al 2001 it is not surprising that we found the platisphere to be enriched with microorganisms that have compound degradation functions fig 3c e thirdly the plastisphere was enriched with potential pathogenic microorganisms in the present study fig 3c f microplastics as a long distance transport carrier of these pathogenic microorganisms pose a great threat to the biosecurity of ecosystems and even the water security of humans zettler et al 2013 amaral zettler et al 2020 xue et al 2020 bowley et al 2021 finally we found that functional differences between the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 3e f suggesting that the plastisphere in different ecosystems have different ecological impacts a possibility that has not been explored in previous studies 4 3 mechanisms controlling the assembly of the plastisphere microbial community understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling the community diversity composition functions is a central topic of ecology zhou and ning 2017 to explore the mechanism by which the plastisphere microbial community is formed we studied the environmental factors that might drive variation in the plastisphere microbial community and the role of niche neutrality in the assembly of plastisphere microbial communities first we found that as with the microbial community of the aquatic environment the microbial community similarity in the plastisphere had an obvious distance decay relationship fig 4a on the one hand increased geographic distance increased dispersal limitation indicating the role of stochastic factors in the community assembly process luan et al 2020 clark et al 2021 on the other hand deterministic factors due to ecological niche differentiation could also explain the distance decay patterns of plastisphere microbial communities environmental differences due to geographic factors could significantly affect the structure of the plastisphere microbiota zhang et al 2020 with this study showing that factors such as orp salinity and nutrient elements can drive variation in the plastisphere microbiota fig 4c d in addition several studies have reported that different microplastic types recruit distinct microbiota bhagwat et al 2021 hou et al 2021 and we have previously shown that the similarity of microplastic type composition decreases significantly with increasing geographic distance li et al 2021 which is also a potential factor contributing to the geographical distance effect of plastisphere microbial community next we explored the relative importance of niche deterministic and neutral stochastic processes in structuring the plastisphere microbial community first the narrower habitat niche breadth of the plastisphere compared to the aquatic environment fig 5a indicated that the microbial communities therein were more influenced by environmental filtering wu et al 2018 jiao et al 2020 second the neutral model explained only a small proportion of the microbial community variation and demonstrated that plastisphere microorganisms had stronger dispersal limitations fig 5c d in addition the null model revealed that deterministic processes dominated the assembly of the plastisphere microbial community fig 5e f we speculate that the main reasons for the above findings lie firstly in the high heterogeneity of the plastisphere as a habitat fig 1f with the diversity of microplastic types increasing the impact of environmental filtering on microorganisms and secondly in the fragmented and disconnected nature of the plastisphere as a habitat resulting in a stronger dispersal limitation for the plastisphere microorganisms our results supported the contention that niche selection plays a more important role in more heterogeneous habitats and more fragmented habitats lead to stronger dispersal limitations thus weakening the role of neutrality in the community assembly another interesting finding of our study is that the dispersal limitation for fungi was significantly stronger than that for bacteria in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and in both the plastisphere and aquatic environments fig 5c d supporting the theory that ecological determinism increases with organism body size farjalla et al 2012 gad et al 2020 li et al 2020 luan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 4 4 differential roles of the plastisphere on microbial networks in freshwater and seawater ecosystems when we compared the interaction networks and keystone species of microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environments in different ecosystems we found that compared with the aquatic environment the plastisphere had a network of less complexity more modules higher modularity and more competitive links in freshwater ecosystems but that the reverse was true in seawater ecosystems fig 6a e modules might be caused by niche differentiation habitat heterogeneity and or divergent selection olesen et al 2007 wan et al 2020 the heterogeneity disconnection and fragmentation of the plastisphere as a habitat could increase dispersal limitation reduce microbial interactions and promote niche differentiation thus reducing network complexity and increasing the number of modules and the modularity the filtering effect of the plastisphere could increase the niche overlap of microorganisms on each piece of plastic debris thereby increasing competition between species on each piece however in seawater ecosystems the biomass and activity of microorganisms in the aquatic environment are generally low due to the high salinity and low nutrient concentrations chen et al 2014 chen et al 2019 thus reducing network complexity according to the resource ratio hypothesis at these low resource levels species are more able to experience the inherent spatial variability of their environment thereby facilitating resource partitioning and niche differentiation tilman 1985 kim and ohr 2020 and thus increasing the number of modules and the modularity moreover the harsh environment in seawater might screen microorganisms for salt and barrenness tolerance fuhrman et al 2015 increasing the proportion of species with similar niches and thus intensifying the competitive relationships between species intriguingly the protection afforded to microorganisms by the plastisphere was reflected in this harsh environment of seawater ecosystems it provides shelter so that the microorganisms are subject to less stress by environmental factors such as salinity and it absorbs organic substances to provide nutrients for microorganisms mincer et al 2016 bowley et al 2021 we speculate that this causes the more complex and higher modular network with more modules and more positive links in the plastisphere compared with the aquatic environment in seawater ecosystems the above findings indicate that the heterogeneity fragmentation environmental harshness and resource deficiencies of habitats can reduce interactions between species decrease network complexity increase competition links and promote niche differentiation moreover the plastisphere plays a different role in freshwater and seawater ecosystems leading to different microbial functions the distinct impacts of the plastisphere in different ecosystems should be explored further in the future 5 conclusion this study reveals that the new niche generated in the anthropocene the plastisphere could disturb the microbial communities of ecosystems threaten ecosystem health and function and exert different effects in freshwater and seawater ecosystems this is evidenced by the following findings the community composition and structure of the plastisphere is distinct and a noteworthy proportion of unique species is recruited by the plastisphere significant differences exist in the microbial functions between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions of pathogenicity compound degradation as well as functions related to the cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur functional differences are expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems furthermore the new human made ecosystem has distinct ecological processes and plays a different role in microbial interaction network in different ecosystems the specific manifestation is that niche based processes dominate plastisphere community assembly while neutral based processes dominate assembly of the microbial community in the

16789,microplastics provide a unique habitat for microorganisms forming the plastisphere yet the ecology of the plastisphere including the microbial composition functions assembly processes and interaction networks needs to be understood here we collected microplastics and their surrounding water samples in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the bacterial and fungal communities of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were studied based on 16s and internal transcribed spacer its high throughput sequencing we found that the plastisphere had a distinct microbial community and recruited a noteworthy proportion of unique species compared to the aquatic environment community potentially altering ecosystem microbial community and causing microbial invasion using a random forest machine learning model we identified a group of biomarkers that could best distinguish the plastisphere from the aquatic environment significant differences exist in microbial functions between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions of pathogenicity compound degradation as well as functions related to the cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur and these functional differences were expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the oxidation reduction potential salinity the concentrations of nitrogen related ions no3 no2 and nh4 and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the surrounding environment drive the variation of the plastisphere but environmental physicochemical properties explain less of the microbial community variation in the plastisphere than that in the aquatic environment niche based processes govern the assembly of the plastisphere community while neutral based processes dominate the community assembly of the aquatic environment furthermore compared to the aquatic environment the plastisphere has a network of less complexity more modules higher modularity and more competitive links in freshwater ecosystems but the pattern is reversed in seawater ecosystems altogether the microbial ecology of the new anthropogenic ecosystem plastisphere is unique and exerts different effects in freshwater and seawater ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic environment assembly process interaction network microbial community microplastic plastisphere 1 introduction total global plastic production to date may be approaching 10 billion metric tons with the annual production almost reaching 370 million metric tons in 2019 geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2020 only about 9 of plastic waste can be recycled and 79 accumulates in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 wright et al 2021 the plastic accumulated in the environment becomes fragmented and weathered by physical chemical and biological processes and eventually forms microplastics 5 mm julienne et al 2019 ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition some microplastics such as abrasive particles in personal care products enter the environment direct from manufacturing cheung and fok 2017 sun et al 2020a inadvertent ingestion of microplastics by animals may have toxic effects on their health ding et al 2020 jacob et al 2020 plants growing in microplastic contaminated soil also lose their normal physiological traits machado et al 2019 rillig and lehmann 2020 sun et al 2020b surprisingly microplastics with a sufficiently small particle size can directly penetrate the epidermis and enter the organism li et al 2020 sun et al 2020b moreover microplastics are widely distributed and exist in almost any corner of the world miller 2020 li et al 2021 even in the air evangeliou et al 2020 wang et al 2020d zhang et al 2020b antarctic munari et al 2017 reed et al 2018 and arctic bergmann et al 2017 kanhai et al 2018 peeken et al 2018 notably the recent discovery of microplastics in the human placenta suggests that humans may no longer be able to live in a plastic free environment ragusa et al 2021 the buoyancy and the hydrophobic organic polymer surface of microplastics in the environment provides a unique niche for microorganisms zettler et al 2013 this new human made ecosystem is called the plastisphere zettler et al 2013 amaral zettler et al 2020 microorganisms selectively colonize the plastisphere thus forming a specific microbial community wang et al 2020b bhagwat et al 2021 mughini gras et al 2021 the biomass of the plastisphere was previously estimated to be about 0 01 0 2 of the total microbial biomass in ocean surface water amaral zettler et al 2020 however as it has been confirmed that we can measure only 1 of the plastic waste in the marine ecosystem the biomass of the plastisphere will be much higher than this value van sebille et al 2015 amaral zettler et al 2020 therefore based on the significant microbial biomass of the plastisphere and the vital role of microorganisms in biogeochemical systems sunagawa et al 2015 we must pay attention to the ecology of the plastisphere which is crowned as the eighth continent banerjee et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2020 dąbrowska 2021 in this study to better understand the impact of microplastic pollution and to explore plastisphere ecology we investigated the plastisphere and the corresponding aquatic environments in freshwater and seawater ecosystems the objectives of this study were to address the following questions 1 what is the difference between the composition and functions of the microbial community in the plastisphere and in the corresponding aquatic environment 2 what factors shape the plastisphere microbial community and which is more important in the plastisphere microbial community assembly niche based deterministic processes or neutral based stochastic processes 3 what are the patterns and mechanisms of interaction networks between microorganisms in the plastisphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection based on the prevalence of microplastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems and the toxic effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms aquatic ecosystems were selected as the area for study microplastic and water samples were collected from three freshwater ecosystems the dagu river the moshui river and the wulong river and three seawater ecosystems northeast of jiaozhou bay southwest of jiaozhou bay and dingzi bay in qingdao city and yantai city shandong province china in september 2020 fig s1 table s1 a manta trawl was hung behind a boat to collect microplastics approximately every two nautical miles a microplastic sample was obtained from the trawl with sterile forceps and then placed into a sterile tube simultaneously two samples of surface water were taken each one being approximately 2 l in volume and collected into a sterile bottle one was collected to obtain the microbiota in the aquatic environment and the other one was used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the water microplastic samples were immediately transferred to 80 c for storage until analysis each water sample used for microbial analysis was first filtered with a qualitative filter paper 80 120 μm to remove interfering substances and then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the membranes were then stored at 80 c until analysis in total we obtained 36 samples to analyze for environmental physicochemical properties and 72 samples microplastic samples and water samples for simultaneous detection of bacteria and fungi 2 2 analysis of physicochemical properties of the surrounding environment dissolved oxygen do ph salinity and oxidation reduction potential orp mv were detected in situ using a dissolved oxygen meter jpb 607a shanghai inesa shanghai china a glass electrode ph

of no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 were determined by a continuous flow auto analyzer scalars san skylar analytical b v breda the netherlands the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer elementar acquray toc cube frankfurt germany 2 3 extraction amplification and sequencing of dna analysis of the microbiota samples was carried out by profiling 16s rrna and its genes using illumina high throughput sequencing in novogene co ltd beijing china the dna for each sample was extracted using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab method raimundo et al 2018 trojánek et al 2018 and detailed procedures are provided in the supplementary materials the primers 515f and 806r were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and the primers its5 1737f and its2 2043r were used to amplify the its1 region of the its gene for fungi the amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2 agarose gel for detection only samples with the bright main strip between 400 450 bp were chosen for further experiments all the amplified products were purified with a genejet gel extraction kit thermo fisher scientific amplicon libraries were generated using a truseq dna pcr free sample preparation kit and then quantified and detected using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific and an agilent2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies palo alto ca finally the libraries were sequenced on the illumina novaseq 6000 platform 2 4 sequencing data processing and analysis the 16s and its gene sequences were processed with qiime v 2 caporaso et al 2010 usearch v 10 0 240 edgar 2010 and vsearch v2 15 1 rognes et al 2016 the metadata of the study can be found in table s1 paired raw sequences were joined and quality filtered primer sequences and barcodes were removed clustering of reads into otus was based on 97 sequence identity the taxonomy of the otus was classified based on the rdp classifier for 16s wang et al 2007 and unite database for its koljalg et al 2013 respectively functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax was carried out to annotate bacteria functions louca et al 2016 and funguild was used to annotate fungal functions nguyen et al 2016 2 5 habitat niche breadth neutral model and null model levins niche breadth values of species were calculated using the spaa package in r v 4 0 2 https www r project org and the average niche breadth of all species in one community was used to estimate the habitat niche breadth zhou et al 2021 the neutral model developed by sloan et al 2006 was used to assess the contribution of neutral processes in community assembly the model describes the relationship between the abundance and frequency of species with a neutral based assembly process predicted within the model and a niche based assembly process implied outside the model the m in the model represents the species migration rate and a higher m value indicates a lower dispersal limit finally a null model was performed using the nst r package to estimate the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in the community assembly process a null distribution of the expected beta diversity based on bray curtis distance was obtained by randomly shuffling the original communities and then the normalized stochasticity ratio nst was calculated an nst value of less than 0 5 indicates that deterministic processes dominate and conversely stochastic processes dominate where the nst value is over 0 5 2 6 network analysis and keystone species to explore the patterns of microbial interactions network analysis was carried out based on spearman rank correlations we focused on species whose relative abundance exceeded 0 001 and appeared in at least 80 of the samples interactions with correlation coefficients no greater than 0 6 or p values no less than 0 05 were excluded the interactive platform gephi v 0 9 2 was used to generate network diagrams and analyze topological parameters nodes in the network represent otus and links connected between nodes represent close relationships the group of nodes that are highly connected within this group but less connected to outside this group is called a module nodes are classified into four categories based on within module connectivity zi as well as among module connectivity pi peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs connectors and network hubs are also recognized as keystone species in the community as their absence would collapse the network 2 7 other statistical analysis unconstrained principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance was carried out to visualize the differences in compositions or functions between the plastisphere microbiota and the aquatic environment microbiota permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the statistical significance of the differences and the variation explained by different habitats the plastisphere and the aquatic environment a random forest machine learning model was used to find the biomarkers that could best distinguish between the plastisphere and aquatic environments using data from freshwater ecosystems as the training set to identify biomarkers and testing the accuracy of the biomarker in seawater ecosystems the geographic distance environmental difference euclidean distance based on all the detected environmental physicochemical factors and the corresponding community similarity 1 minus bray curtis distance between every two sites were calculated the relationships between microbial similarity and geographic distance and microbial similarity and environmental difference were explored using linear regression models mantel analysis was used to explore the effects of environmental physicochemical factors on microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment redundancy analysis rda was performed to explore the constraints placed on microbial communities by environment physicochemical factors all the above analyses and plotting were performed in r 2 8 data availability all sequencing data from this study have been deposited in the ncbi under the accession number prjna717904 3 results 3 1 the diversity and composition of the plastisphere microbial community we explored the differences in composition and diversity of microbial communities between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems rarefaction curves showed that populations of this study contained most of the microbiome members from each habitat fig s2 cluster analysis based on bray curtis distance between samples showed that microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment formed two obvious clusters fig s3 for bacterial communities fig s4 for fungal communities pcoa revealed that the composition of the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment differed significantly in the first dimension for both bacterial fig 1 a b and fungal fig 1c d communities in freshwater fig 1a c or seawater fig 1b d ecosystems permanova further verified the statistical significance of the differences in microbial community composition between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment p 0 001 we found that significant differences in the richness of the microbiota existed between the plastisphere and aquatic environment fig 1e in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems the richness of bacterial communities was significantly higher in the plastisphere than in the aquatic environment while the fungal communities in the plastisphere had relatively lower richness fig 1e this result indicates that the plastisphere recruited more bacterial species and fewer fungal species than the aquatic environment by calculating the bray curtis dissimilarity of microbial communities within each habitat the beta diversity of microbial communities in the plastisphere was found to be significantly higher than that in aquatic environments fig 1f indicating the greater heterogeneity of the plastisphere as a microbial habitat the main bacterial phyla detected included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria firmicutes verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and acidobacteria fig 1g significant differences existed in proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment both in freshwater and seawater ecosystems p 0 05 fig s5a b table s2 the main fungal phyla detected included ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota rozellomycota mortierellomycota and cercozoa fig 1h significant differences existed in chytridiomycota between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems p 0 05 fig s5c d table s3 3 2 the unique species enriched species and biomarkers of the plastisphere we explored the specific differences in community composition between the plastisphere and aquatic environment at the otu level first the bipartite association network showed that in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems the number of unique species in the plastisphere or the aquatic environment accounted for a considerable proportion although most of the microbial species in the two habitats were shared fig 2 a b for bacteria fig 2a the plastisphere recruited more unique species than the aquatic environment but for fungi fig 2b the number of unique species in each of the two habitats was comparable second through the difference test of species relative abundance we obtained the number of species enriched and depleted in the plastisphere compared with the aquatic environment fig 2c we found that significant differences existed in most species between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment with plastisphere enriched species outnumbering the aquatic environment enriched species and this pattern existed in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and for both bacterial and fungal communities fig 2c in addition we established a random forest machine learning model using the order level data in freshwater ecosystems to find the most important features that can distinguish microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment the top twenty most important features were selected as a group of biomarkers to differentiate the two habitats and the accuracy was 100 fig 2d table s4 among this group of biomarkers fifteen features had significantly higher relative abundance in the aquatic environment while the other five features were enriched in the plastisphere fig 2e table s4 surprisingly when we used the biomarkers to predict the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in seawater ecosystems the accuracy was also 100 fig 2f showing that the differences between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment with respect to these microorganisms is common to both freshwater and seawater ecosystems 3 3 the microbial functions of the plastisphere we analyzed the functions of bacterial and fungal communities by faprotax supplementary table 1 and funguild supplementary table 2 respectively pcoa revealed that significant differences existed in microbial functional composition between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in the first dimension with the first dimension explaining 45 for bacteria and 71 for fungi of the functional composition fig 3 a b permanova further verified the significant differences between the functional composition of microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment p 0 001 fig 3a b by comparing the relative abundance of microbial functions in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment we found that most of the high abundance functions differed significantly between the two habitats fig 3c f table s5 these functions include those related to pathogenicity including human pathogens in the case of bacteria and pathotrophs in the case of fungi compound degradation including hydrocarbon degradation aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and aromatic compound degradation and cycling of carbon including methylotrophy and methanol oxidation nitrogen including nitrogen respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification and sulfur including dark thiosulfate oxidation and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fig 3c f table s5 in addition the functions that differed significantly between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were not consistent between freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 3c f table s5 3 4 factors shaping the plastisphere microbial community the distance decay model revealed that microbial communities in the plastisphere as well as in the aquatic environment experienced a significant decline in community similarity with increasing geographic distance fig 4 a supplementary table 3 statistically significant linear regression models showed that environmental differences the euclidean distance of environmental factors between sites also affected the community similarity of both plastisphere and aquatic environmental microbiota fig 4b supplementary table 3 to further explore the environmental drivers for plastisphere microbial variation we performed the mantel analysis between microbial community and environmental factors fig 4c d table s6 results showed that the plastisphere bacterial community was significantly affected by orp salinity nitrogen related ions and the doc of the water environment and the environmental drivers of the plastisphere fungal community additionally included ph fig 4c d notably mantel p and mantel r showed that the microbial community in the plastisphere was less affected by salinity than the microbial community in the aquatic environment fig 4c d rda revealed that the microbial community in the plastisphere was less constrained by environmental factors than the microbial community in the aquatic environment as evidenced by environmental factors explained 47 47 of the variation of the plastisphere bacterial community fig s6a 61 32 of the variation of the aquatic environment bacterial community fig s6b 43 00 of the variation of the plastisphere fungal community fig s6c and 61 78 of the variation of the aquatic environment fungal community fig s6d then we explored the role of niche based deterministic and neutral based stochastic processes in structuring plastisphere microbial communities as revealed by habitat niche breadth the neutral model and the null model first the results revealed that the plastisphere had a lower habitat niche breadth than the aquatic environment whether in freshwater or seawater and whether for bacteria or fungi fig 5 a b table s7 second the lower r2 values and m values migration rates of the neutral models for plastisphere microbial community indicated that stochastic ecological processes played a smaller role in the community structure of the plastisphere microbiota than they did in the community structure of the aquatic environment fig 5c d bacterial and fungal communities showed similar patterns but the variation in community structure explained by the neutral models and migration rates was higher for bacterial communities than for fungal communities fig 5c d furthermore the null models revealed that stochasticity played a dominant role in the assembly processes of the aquatic environmental microbial communities whereas deterministic factors had a greater effect on the structure of plastisphere microbial communities fig 5e f table s8 in addition the metacommunities integrating the microbial communities in plastisphere and aquatic environments fw mfw and sw msw were all dominated by deterministic processes in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and for both bacteria and fungi indicating that there was significant niche selection in the microbial community structure because of significant habitat differences between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment fig 5e f table s8 3 5 interaction patterns and keystone species of plastisphere microbiota we explored the interaction patterns across microbiomes in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment through network analysis overall the microbial networks of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment had a relatively high degree of modularity 0 65 and species in the same module had strong interactions or shared niches fig 6 a d the relationships between microorganisms tended to co occurrence rather than co exclusion with more than half of them being positively correlated fig 6e table s9 by comparing the average degree and average weighted degree of networks we found that the interactions between microorganisms in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment of freshwater ecosystems were more complex than those of seawater ecosystems fig 6e table s9 in freshwater ecosystems the microbial network of the plastisphere had less complexity more modules higher modularity and a lower proportion of positive links compared to the network of the aquatic environment fig 6e table s9 in contrast the opposite pattern was observed in seawater ecosystems with the microbial network in the plastisphere having more complexity fewer modules lower modularity and more positive links than the aquatic environment fig 6e table s9 finally we screened the keystone species of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig s7 supplementary table 4 notably there was little intersection between the keystone species of the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 6f we used linear regression models to examine the effect of keystone species on community functions and the highly significant linear regression models indicated that the difference between keystone species was the important factor causing differences in community functions fig 6g 4 discussion 4 1 the plastisphere has a distinct microbial community consistent with previously reported findings zettler et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2020 the plastisphere and the aquatic environment had distinct microbiota in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems in our study fig 1 which could affect the structure and evolution of the whole microbial community in these ecosystems wang et al 2020a based on this we screened a group of biomarkers using a random forest machine learning model that accurately distinguished between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 2d f the main reason for the significantly distinct composition of microbial communities in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment may be that microplastics act as a filter for microorganisms in the environment as a hydrophobic organic vehicle with a large specific surface area microplastics readily adsorb organic matter from the environment including organic carbon sources and pollutants such as pesticides wang et al 2020c polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs sharma et al 2020 in addition most of the chemicals added to plastics during manufacturing are also toxic to organisms hahladakis et al 2018 including intolerant microorganisms but can act as nutrient sources for certain other microorganisms kooi et al 2017 li et al 2020 so microplastics may in effect act as a filter for such microorganisms a second reason may be that microplastics bring with them microorganisms from their original environment plastics are produced by human activities and enter aquatic ecosystems from land air and other ways wang et al 2019 birch et al 2020 ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2021 and they will undoubtedly carry microorganisms from their original environment amaral zettler et al 2020 we found that plastisphere microbiota were less affected by environmental factors than were the microbiota of water figs 4c d s6 which would allow microplastics to act as an umbrella for microbiota rafting microorganisms from their pollution sources into ecosystems we speculate therefore that the origin of the microplastics and the chemical environment that they provide can explain the uniqueness of their microbial community we found that the plastisphere and the aquatic environment each had a noteworthy portion of unique microorganisms fig 2a b the microorganisms unique to the aquatic environment might be the microorganisms that cannot tolerate the plastisphere environment and the microorganisms unique to the plastisphere might be those that were carried by microplastics from their pollution sources one aspect that deserves further attention however is the potential for these unique species rafted by microplastics from other environments to pose a microbial invasion risk to the ecosystem amaral zettler et al 2020 bowley et al 2021 4 2 potential impacts of the plastisphere microbial community on ecosystem function and health the distinct microbial community composition of the plastisphere resulted in a significant functional differentiation between the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment in our study indicating that microplastic pollution has the potential to affect ecosystem functions fig 3 the microbial functions were analyzed based on faprotax and funguild in this study and further research with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic technologies is needed to gain a clearer understanding of plastisphere functions firstly we found that the functions associated with the biogeochemical cycling of elements differed significantly between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions related to the cycling of carbon methylotrophy and methanol oxidation nitrogen nitrogen respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification and sulfur dark thiosulfate oxidation and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds therefore microplastics might affect the elemental cycling function of ecosystems by forming unique microbial communities in the plastisphere it has been reported in previous studies that microplastics could also affect the elemental biogeochemical cycling function of ecosystems by altering the microbial communities in the environmental media in which the pollution occurs li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 secondly the plastisphere is rich in chemicals that are released by the microplastics themselves and adsorbed from the surrounding environment wright et al 2020 as the concentration of hydrophobic chemicals on the surface of plastics is up to 106 times that of the surrounding water mato et al 2001 it is not surprising that we found the platisphere to be enriched with microorganisms that have compound degradation functions fig 3c e thirdly the plastisphere was enriched with potential pathogenic microorganisms in the present study fig 3c f microplastics as a long distance transport carrier of these pathogenic microorganisms pose a great threat to the biosecurity of ecosystems and even the water security of humans zettler et al 2013 amaral zettler et al 2020 xue et al 2020 bowley et al 2021 finally we found that functional differences between the microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environment were expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig 3e f suggesting that the plastisphere in different ecosystems have different ecological impacts a possibility that has not been explored in previous studies 4 3 mechanisms controlling the assembly of the plastisphere microbial community understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling the community diversity composition functions is a central topic of ecology zhou and ning 2017 to explore the mechanism by which the plastisphere microbial community is formed we studied the environmental factors that might drive variation in the plastisphere microbial community and the role of niche neutrality in the assembly of plastisphere microbial communities first we found that as with the microbial community of the aquatic environment the microbial community similarity in the plastisphere had an obvious distance decay relationship fig 4a on the one hand increased geographic distance increased dispersal limitation indicating the role of stochastic factors in the community assembly process luan et al 2020 clark et al 2021 on the other hand deterministic factors due to ecological niche differentiation could also explain the distance decay patterns of plastisphere microbial communities environmental differences due to geographic factors could significantly affect the structure of the plastisphere microbiota zhang et al 2020 with this study showing that factors such as orp salinity and nutrient elements can drive variation in the plastisphere microbiota fig 4c d in addition several studies have reported that different microplastic types recruit distinct microbiota bhagwat et al 2021 hou et al 2021 and we have previously shown that the similarity of microplastic type composition decreases significantly with increasing geographic distance li et al 2021 which is also a potential factor contributing to the geographical distance effect of plastisphere microbial community next we explored the relative importance of niche deterministic and neutral stochastic processes in structuring the plastisphere microbial community first the narrower habitat niche breadth of the plastisphere compared to the aquatic environment fig 5a indicated that the microbial communities therein were more influenced by environmental filtering wu et al 2018 jiao et al 2020 second the neutral model explained only a small proportion of the microbial community variation and demonstrated that plastisphere microorganisms had stronger dispersal limitations fig 5c d in addition the null model revealed that deterministic processes dominated the assembly of the plastisphere microbial community fig 5e f we speculate that the main reasons for the above findings lie firstly in the high heterogeneity of the plastisphere as a habitat fig 1f with the diversity of microplastic types increasing the impact of environmental filtering on microorganisms and secondly in the fragmented and disconnected nature of the plastisphere as a habitat resulting in a stronger dispersal limitation for the plastisphere microorganisms our results supported the contention that niche selection plays a more important role in more heterogeneous habitats and more fragmented habitats lead to stronger dispersal limitations thus weakening the role of neutrality in the community assembly another interesting finding of our study is that the dispersal limitation for fungi was significantly stronger than that for bacteria in both freshwater and seawater ecosystems and in both the plastisphere and aquatic environments fig 5c d supporting the theory that ecological determinism increases with organism body size farjalla et al 2012 gad et al 2020 li et al 2020 luan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 4 4 differential roles of the plastisphere on microbial networks in freshwater and seawater ecosystems when we compared the interaction networks and keystone species of microbiota in the plastisphere and the aquatic environments in different ecosystems we found that compared with the aquatic environment the plastisphere had a network of less complexity more modules higher modularity and more competitive links in freshwater ecosystems but that the reverse was true in seawater ecosystems fig 6a e modules might be caused by niche differentiation habitat heterogeneity and or divergent selection olesen et al 2007 wan et al 2020 the heterogeneity disconnection and fragmentation of the plastisphere as a habitat could increase dispersal limitation reduce microbial interactions and promote niche differentiation thus reducing network complexity and increasing the number of modules and the modularity the filtering effect of the plastisphere could increase the niche overlap of microorganisms on each piece of plastic debris thereby increasing competition between species on each piece however in seawater ecosystems the biomass and activity of microorganisms in the aquatic environment are generally low due to the high salinity and low nutrient concentrations chen et al 2014 chen et al 2019 thus reducing network complexity according to the resource ratio hypothesis at these low resource levels species are more able to experience the inherent spatial variability of their environment thereby facilitating resource partitioning and niche differentiation tilman 1985 kim and ohr 2020 and thus increasing the number of modules and the modularity moreover the harsh environment in seawater might screen microorganisms for salt and barrenness tolerance fuhrman et al 2015 increasing the proportion of species with similar niches and thus intensifying the competitive relationships between species intriguingly the protection afforded to microorganisms by the plastisphere was reflected in this harsh environment of seawater ecosystems it provides shelter so that the microorganisms are subject to less stress by environmental factors such as salinity and it absorbs organic substances to provide nutrients for microorganisms mincer et al 2016 bowley et al 2021 we speculate that this causes the more complex and higher modular network with more modules and more positive links in the plastisphere compared with the aquatic environment in seawater ecosystems the above findings indicate that the heterogeneity fragmentation environmental harshness and resource deficiencies of habitats can reduce interactions between species decrease network complexity increase competition links and promote niche differentiation moreover the plastisphere plays a different role in freshwater and seawater ecosystems leading to different microbial functions the distinct impacts of the plastisphere in different ecosystems should be explored further in the future 5 conclusion this study reveals that the new niche generated in the anthropocene the plastisphere could disturb the microbial communities of ecosystems threaten ecosystem health and function and exert different effects in freshwater and seawater ecosystems this is evidenced by the following findings the community composition and structure of the plastisphere is distinct and a noteworthy proportion of unique species is recruited by the plastisphere significant differences exist in the microbial functions between the plastisphere and the aquatic environment including functions of pathogenicity compound degradation as well as functions related to the cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur functional differences are expressed differently in freshwater and seawater ecosystems furthermore the new human made ecosystem has distinct ecological processes and plays a different role in microbial interaction network in different ecosystems the specific manifestation is that niche based processes dominate plastisphere community assembly while neutral based processes dominate assembly of the microbial community in the aquatic environment the interaction network of the plastisphere has less complexity more modules higher modularity and more competitive relationships than that of the aquatic environment in freshwater ecosystems but an opposite pattern exists in seawater ecosystems in the future more effort is needed to gain a comprehensive picture of the plastisphere including its metagenome and virome on a large spatiotemporal scale declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing interests exist acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation
