9000,drought often causes tremendous agricultural impacts and economic losses but drought impacts are difficult to assess and quantify improving drought monitoring and early warning systems by linking indicators to impacts can reduce social vulnerability however it is still challenging to establish quantitative links between drought indicators and impacts during drought stress in this study using experimental observation records during drought in different climatic zones in china we established the quantitative links between the drought indicator based on soil moisture and the affected biological parameters of wheat triticum aestivum l determined the thresholds of the onset and severity of the impact of drought on wheat and found that the onset thresholds had a convergence across climate zones and the severity thresholds were different in different climate zones this study may provide a new understanding for evaluating drought stress or severity and provide an important reference to better understand the hazard itself and carry out impact based drought monitoring and early warning keywords drought impacts thresholds wheat onset of drought severity of drought data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is a global frequent natural disaster that causes huge economic losses in the contiguous united states drought events occur almost every year on average causing losses of more than 1 billion and the cost of specific events is usually reaches 4 7 billion sometimes as high as 30 billion peters lidard et al 2021 in many regions of the world it is projected to experience an increase in the severity and frequency of drought events in the future wang et al 2022 huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 markonis et al 2021 cook et al 2015 therefore drought has attracted widespread concerned by all sectors of society people often respond to drought by planning and maintaining water resources formulating and adjusting production plans elliott et al 2017 fu et al 2013 drought monitoring and early warning based on drought indicators provides national departments local governments and economic entities with relevant information on the occurrence development and impact of drought in order to minimize the losses caused by drought pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 collins et al 2016 peters lidard et al 2021 shadman et al 2016 many countries such as china the united states the united kingdom australia and so on have developed drought monitoring and early warning systems which can calculate various drought indicators and produce drought monitoring and early warning reports pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 collins et al 2016 however the drought monitoring and early warning information provided by the current system is not enough to meet the needs of drought response collins et al 2016 dilling et al 2015 fu et al 2013 recent stakeholder inquiries on drought impacts monitoring and early warning systems in the united states united kingdom and australia have shown that drought impacts are difficult to assess and quantify improving drought monitoring and early warning systems dews through linking indicators to impacts can lessen societal vulnerability bachmair et al 2016 in order to strengthen the link between indicators and impacts an online database for collecting user based reports on drought impacts was launched in the united states some years ago in order to concisely describe expected impacts at different levels of drought by linking impacts chronicled in the drought impact reporter dir to severity levels in the u s drought monitor bachmair et al 2015 collins et al 2016 noel et al 2020 similar explorations were carried out in europe bachmair et al 2015 the link between the effects of drought and drought severity was identified at the state level in the united states and developed the state and regionally specific drought impact classification tables which enriched the product information of the u s drought monitor noel et al 2020 nevertheless the impact data from dir are qualitative and post event and the links established between these data and drought indicators only reflect the qualitative links between drought events and their consequences which is still little helpful for determining the beginning and severity of drought impacts and understanding the real time and quantitative relationship between drought severity and impact during drought collins et al 2016 dilling et al 2015 fu et al 2013 it is believed that the inability to fully understand the drought hazard itself and its root causes may hinder drought early warning and timely response fu et al 2013 steinemann et al 2015 which may require an in depth understanding of the process and mechanism of drought impact in terms of the impact of drought on agriculture drought reduces soil moisture and negatively affects biological processes of crops such as photosynthesis ultimately resulting in yield loss madana et al 2014 gupta et al 2020 tezara et al 1999 basu et al 2016 ji et al 2010 ma and zhou 2017 zarei et al 2021a 2020 2021b therefore by conducting drought stress experiments of wheat in six sites across climate zones in china from 2001 to 2021 this study starts with the simultaneous observation of drought indicator based on soil moisture and damaged biological parameters of wheat and sought to 1 investigate a quantitative link between drought severity and its biological impact on wheat during drought stress 2 explore the onset and severity thresholds of drought impact on photosynthetic parameters and leaf water content responses to reduction of soil moisture and then 3 evaluate the change characteristics of drought threshold across different climate regions in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 drought and impact indicators relative soil moisture rsm was selected as the drought indicator and obtained as follows formula hunt et al 2009 1 rsw sm θ fc 100 where sm is soil moisture and θfc is field water capacity which were obtained according to data from the local agri meteorological station of china meteorological administration six biological parameters were selected to characterize the quantitative biological impacts of drought on wheat including net photosynthetic rate pn and its drought induced loss rate pnl transpiration rate tr and its drought induced loss rate trl and leaf water content lwc and its drought induced loss rate lwcl 2 p nl p n p no p no 100 where pno is the net photosynthetic rate at the onset of drought impact 3 t rl t r t ro t ro 100 where tro is the transpiration rate at the onset of drought impact 4 lwc l lwc lwc o lwc o 100 where lwco is the leaf water content at the onset of drought impact 2 2 experiment sites and design 2 2 1 experiment sites the drought stress experiments of wheat were conducted at 6 sites in arid semi arid semi humid and humid climate zones including wuwei dingxi wushaoling gucheng zhengzhou and nanjing in china fig 1 the mean annual precipitation ranged from 171 to 1090 mm and the mean annual temperature ranged from 0 4 to 16 0 c at these locations table 1 2 2 2 experiment design three types of experiments were conducted a simulated drought field test wheat was planted in the field plots under an open rain shelter to block rain only when it rained ensuring that the drought persisted b simulated drought pot test wheat was grown in the pots under an open rain shelter to block rain only when it rained to ensure that the drought continued c natural drought field test wheat was grown in the open field where natural drought occurred the experiments included 28 simulated drought field tests 19 simulated drought pot tests and 21 natural drought field tests table 2 in both types of experiments a and b there were 2 water treatments 1 treatment without drought control ck control treatments were fully watered the soil would be immediately irrigated to near the field water capacity once a water deficit occurred during the growing season 2 drought stress treatment simulated drought was designed to randomly occur with water stress at different growth stages of wheat and persist until the plants wilt even die so that the process of the impact of drought on wheat could be observed at different growth stages there were three replications for each treatment if there was no significant difference in rsm between them the drought process was considered to be the same otherwise different in each experiment the treatment for drought was conducted in several growth stages tillering jointing booting or flowering of wheat rsm was at the same level before treatments then the soil moisture for drought treatment was naturally decreased and the water stress appeared and continued until plants wilt or death the samples and observation were taken every day in the simulated drought pot test and at every 5 7 days in the simulated and natural drought field test during the drought processes all observation items are carried out simultaneously at every observation at each experiment site as for spring wheat in wuwei dingxi and wushaoling sites farmyard manure 5 6 104 kg ha 1 combined with car amide 138 kg ha 1 and diammonium hydrogen phosphate 228 kg ha 1 were applied before sowing the plot was seeded at a population density of 645 104 plants ha 1 and with the row spacing s 15 cm and the pot was sowed 20 seeds each plot was 3 7 m length and 2 6 m width in the simulated drought field test and each test plot was 20 m length and 15 m width in the natural drought field test the pot size was 30 cm inside diameter and 27 cm depth in the simulated drought pot test as for winter wheat in gucheng zhengzhou and nanjing sites chicken manure 40 m3 ha 1 pure nitrogen 215 kg ha 1 phosphorus pent oxide 108 kg ha 1 were applied before sowing the plot was seeded at a population density of 300 104 plants ha 1 and with the row spacing s 22 cm and the pot was sowed 20 seeds and retained 10 plants in each pot when thinning out in the three leave stage each plot was 4 0 m length and 2 0 m width in the simulated drought field test and each test plot was 25 m length and 15 m width in the natural drought field test the pot size was 30 cm inside diameter and 35 cm depth in simulated drought pot test the spring wheat and winter wheat crops were planted following local sowing schedules in experiment year at all sites 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data included precipitation and daily air temperature used in this study was collected from 2383 china meteorological administration monitoring stations from 1981 to 2010 the meteorological data sets were provided by the national meteorological information centre nmic of the china meteorological administration http cac nmic cn the meteorological data were quality controlled using the nmic conventional procedures including the internal consistency check the temporal and spatial consistency checks li et al 2009 the gucheng site where precipitation and temperature data came from reference ma and zhou 2017 due to the fact that it was not in the chinese meteorological data sharing service system 2 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture sm was measured at 10 cm intervals from soil surface down to 50 cm depth in all plots using a hand held stainless steel soil auger at every sampling time during the growing season the fresh soil was put into an aluminum specimen box and weighed using electronic balance ja5003 shanghai puchun measure instrument co ltd then dried in an electric blast drying oven 101 2 a beijing kewei yongxing instrument co ltd for 15 h at 105 c for dry soil sm was determined by the following equation 5 sm g 2 g 3 g 3 g 1 100 where g2 is the weight of fresh soil and aluminum specimen box g g3 is the weight of dried soil and aluminum specimen box g g1 is the weight of aluminum specimen box g 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate pn μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate tr mmol h2o m 2 s 1 were measured using a portable open path gas exchange system li 6400 or li 6400xt li cor inc lincoln ne usa pn and tr of leaf were measured between 09 30 and 14 00 h on a sunny day three plants were randomly selected in each pot or plot and then the flag leaf of plant was selected for the measure of photosynthetic parameters 2 3 4 leaf water content leaf water content lwc of wheat was determined by the weighing method three plants were randomly sampled from each pot or plot on 09 00 am the leaves of each plant were cut off the fresh leaf was put into a kraft paper sacks and weighed immediately using electronic balance ja5003 shanghai puchun measure instrument co ltd then fixated for 1 h at 105 c and dried for 15 h at 85 c for dry mass in an electric blast drying oven 101 2 a beijing keweiyongxing instrument co ltd lwc was determined by the following formula 6 lwc w f w d w f 100 where wf is the weight of fresh leaf g wd is the weight of dried leaf g 2 4 data analysis all analyses and figures were performed in origin 8 0 originlab guagnzhou ltd the branch company of originlab usa the relationships between wheat biological parameters and rsm were fitted by the polynomial equation in the soft origin 8 0 anova was carried in origin 8 0 the difference between mean values from various climatic regions were compared using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 in box plots of onset threshold values of drought impact on wheat rsmdo across climatic zones the fitting relationships in fig 6 were translated horizontally on the condition that the onset threshold values of drought impact converge to 50 3 results 3 1 temporal variation characteristics of drought severity and its impact time trend of wheat biological parameters and relative soil moisture in various drought processes showed that in the absence of drought stress pn tr lwc and rsm displayed very small fluctuations over time and their values remained at a relatively high level fig 2 however under drought stress these indicators began to decline over time and their values were lower than those without drought stress fig 2 indicating that the severity of drought and its negative impact on wheat increased as the drought continued the process of field drought meanwhile lasted for a long time and may be regarded as a slow process fig 2a and the potted drought process lasted for a short time and as a fast process fig 2b under drought stress pn tr lwc and rsm of potted wheat decreased faster than that of field indicating that fast process drought develops faster than slow process drought and could cause a greater negative impact on wheat in a short period of time 3 2 link between drought severity and its impact responses of biological parameters of wheat to relative soil moisture showed that pn tr and lwc all presented small fluctuations with the change of rsm under sufficient water supply fig 3a but decreased rapidly with the decline of rsm under drought stress fig 3a p 0 001 indicating that these biological parameters of wheat were affected by drought from adequate soil moisture to drought stress these biological parameters displayed a trend of small fluctuations and then a rapid decline with the decrease of rsm and there was an obvious change in phases and an identifiable turning point fig 3a p 0 001 when the rsm was greater than the value corresponding to the turning point the value of each biological parameter showed a small fluctuation with the decrease of rsm for rsm less than the value corresponding to the turning point the parameter values exhibited a continuous decrease with reducing rsm and which was irreversible this relationship between rsm and wheat biological parameters exists in 68 observed drought processes and can be perfectly fitted by polynomial functions implying that there is a quantitative link between the drought severity and the impact of drought on wheat that is the impact on wheat starts from zero and intensifies rapidly with the increase of drought severity along the process of absence occurrence and persistence of drought showing the trend of onset and continued increase of drought impact based on the quantitative relationships between rsm and affected biological parameters of wheat the rsm pn tr and lwc corresponding to the turning point are defined as the onset threshold rsmdo the onset net photosynthetic rate pno the onset transpiration rate tro and the onset leaf water content lwco of drought impact on wheat respectively while the rsm less than rsmdo is defined as the severity threshold for drought impacts on wheat rsmds fig 3a analysis of experimental data shows that rsmdo is generally around 50 3 3 link between the severity of drought and drought induced losses in order to more directly reflect the quantitative link between the severity of drought and drought induced losses and facilitate the drought classification the functional relationships between relative soil moisture and biological parameter loss are shown in fig 3b it can be seen that when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl fluctuated slightly above and below the zero line with the change of rsm indicating that wheat growth was not affected by drought and when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl decreased with the decrease of rsmds fig 3b p 0 001 indicating that drought caused biological loss or negative impact on wheat and the loss increased with the increase of drought severity based on the observed data analysis of all drought processes the relationships between pnl trl lwcl and rsmds can also be fitted by a simple linear function if only the period affected by drought was considered fig 4 p 0 005 before the onset of drought impact i e when rsm rsmdo there was no statistically significant relationship between pnl trl lwcl and rsw indicating that water is not a limiting factor for wheat growth after the onset of drought impact when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl declined linearly with the decrease of rsm namely rswds indicating that the impact of drought on wheat increased linearly with the increase of drought severity 3 4 regional variation characteristics of drought impact threshold 3 4 1 convergence of onset threshold of drought impact to examine differences in rsmdo across climate zones based on the quantitative relationships between rsm and wheat biological parameters fitted by polynomials we calculated the values of rsmdo for all 68 observed drought processes and analyzed the discrete features of the 130 rsmdo values obtained interestingly we found that in any single climatic region 80 and above of all rsmdo values operated in the range of 47 5 52 5 while the mean value of rsmdo for each climatic region fell within the interval of 50 1 5 fig 5 indicating that there was a convergence to 50 across the climate zones in the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat p 0 05 3 4 2 difference of severity threshold of drought impact to compare the differences in rsmds causing the same biological loss across climatic zones we displayed the relationships between wheat biological parameter losses and rsm during the drought processes beginning with the jointing stage of field wheat in the six test sites fig 6 p 0 5 the results showed that after the onset of drought impact pnl trl and lwcl continued to decline with the decrease of rsmds but their declining rate varied in different climate region and generally increased from the arid area to the humid area which also caused that the rsmds corresponding to the same pnl trl and lwcl values increased from the arid region to the wet region and the difference in the rsmds gradually increased with the decrease of pnl trl and lwcl indicating that the severity threshold of drought impact on wheat that led to the same biological loss was different across climatic zones and the difference gradually increased as drought persisted and the loss increased 4 discussion uncertainty and accuracy in modeling monitoring and forecasting drought onset duration and end is a common concern of scholars collins et al 2016 meanwhile managers call current drought indicators and triggers useless and basically ignored in drought preparedness and planning because they have questions such as how do we know when we are in drought how severe is it and when do we take action collins et al 2016 there is general agreement that a more comprehensive understanding of the link between drought severity or indicators and impact is crucial to improve drought monitoring and early warning bachmair et al 2015 collins et al 2016 elliott et al 2017 stagge et al 2015 steinemann 2014 the meteorological drought index spei spi mci etc has been widely used in drought monitoring noel et al 2020 peters lidard et al 2021 bachmair et al 2015 however these drought indicators are physical variables that independently reflect water shortage and the severity of drought is graded according to the mathematical probability distribution of indicators pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 collins et al 2016 peters lidard et al 2021 noel et al 2020 in order to meet the needs of monitoring and assessment of drought impact people usually associate the post event impact of drought with the severity described by drought indicators however these drought indicators reflect the physical process of drought occurrence and development while the impact of drought reflects the consequences of drought disasters in fact we often ignore the long term persistence of the impact of drought and the process of drought impacts needs to be fully understood all these may bring great difficulties to accurately determine the beginning duration and end time of drought impact and to achieve quantitative and real time monitoring and assessment of drought effect our study demonstrates a quantitative link between drought severity and its impact on wheat which can be used to determine the onset and severity of drought impacts it can be seen from this study that the impact or damage of drought on wheat generally begins when rsm 50 and then increases with the decrease of rsm according to our observations it takes more than 20 days from the onset to the more severe for example pnl 40 for the impact of drought on wheat in the field which makes it possible to carry out early warnings with the onset of drought impact in the operational practice of drought monitoring early warning and assessment the drought severity is divided into different grades through drought indicators and the possible effects of different grades of drought are given for example in the u s drought monitor the severity of drought is divided into 5 grades which are d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought d4 exceptional drought noel et al 2020 here according to the quantitative relationship between rsm and net photosynthetic rate loss in fig 4 we give the drought classification and soil moisture threshold based on the impact process table 3 this helps to understand the impacts of drought on wheat at different stages or grades during drought by monitoring soil moisture of course drought severity classification can also be carried out according to the relationship between different biological parameters and soil moisture in different climatic regions and more related experimental studies are also needed to improve the accuracy of this drought classification people usually pay more attention to crop yield reduction caused by drought lesk et al 2016 jägermeyr and frieler 2018 zarei et al 2021a 2021b in fact even small increases in the rate of net photosynthesis can translate into large increases in biomass and hence yield since carbon assimilation is integrated over the entire growing season martin et al 2011 this study observed the impacts of drought on wheat biological parameters during droughts and confirmed that drought damage to wheat occurred during droughts rather than after drought events and the yield loss from drought were the result of this damage integration during drought indicating that focusing on drought impact processes is key to determining and verifying in real time the onset and persistence of drought impacts the study found that the onset thresholds of drought impacts on wheat had convergence across climatic regions while the severity thresholds showed a regional difference and an increasing trend from the arid to the wet climate region in reality the regional adaptability of drought indicators and their thresholds is a major scientific issue in drought research yang et al 2017 steinemann et al 2015 akuraju et al 2017 and our findings may provide reference for conducting drought monitoring and early warning across climate regions if rsm is used as a drought indicator the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat is the same in different climatic regions however the severity threshold is larger in humid than in arid areas for droughts with the same impact 5 conclusion the fast process drought develops faster than slow process and could cause a greater negative impact on wheat in a short period of time from adequate soil moisture to drought stress the biological parameters of wheat displayed a trend of small fluctuations and then a rapid decline with the decrease of rsm and there was an obvious change in phases and an identifiable turning point rsm corresponding to the turning point is defined as the onset threshold rsmdo of drought impact on wheat while the rsm less than rsmdo is defined as the severity threshold rsmds for drought impacts on wheat the water is not a limiting factor for wheat growth before the onset of drought impact the impact of drought on wheat increased linearly with the increase of drought severity after the onset of drought impact the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat converges to 50 in different climatic zones the severity threshold of drought impact on wheat is different in different climatic regions and generally increased from the arid area to the humid area after the onset of drought impact credit authorship contribution statement runyuan wang conceptualization investigation data curation

depth in all plots using a hand held stainless steel soil auger at every sampling time during the growing season the fresh soil was put into an aluminum specimen box and weighed using electronic balance ja5003 shanghai puchun measure instrument co ltd then dried in an electric blast drying oven 101 2 a beijing kewei yongxing instrument co ltd for 15 h at 105 c for dry soil sm was determined by the following equation 5 sm g 2 g 3 g 3 g 1 100 where g2 is the weight of fresh soil and aluminum specimen box g g3 is the weight of dried soil and aluminum specimen box g g1 is the weight of aluminum specimen box g 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate pn μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate tr mmol h2o m 2 s 1 were measured using a portable open path gas exchange system li 6400 or li 6400xt li cor inc lincoln ne usa pn and tr of leaf were measured between 09 30 and 14 00 h on a sunny day three plants were randomly selected in each pot or plot and then the flag leaf of plant was selected for the measure of photosynthetic parameters 2 3 4 leaf water content leaf water content lwc of wheat was determined by the weighing method three plants were randomly sampled from each pot or plot on 09 00 am the leaves of each plant were cut off the fresh leaf was put into a kraft paper sacks and weighed immediately using

were performed in origin 8 0 originlab guagnzhou ltd the branch company of originlab usa the relationships between wheat biological parameters and rsm were fitted by the polynomial equation in the soft origin 8 0 anova was carried in origin 8 0 the difference between mean values from various climatic regions were compared using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 in box plots of onset threshold values of drought impact on wheat rsmdo across climatic zones the fitting relationships in fig 6 were translated horizontally on the condition that the onset threshold values of drought impact converge to 50 3 results 3 1 temporal variation characteristics of drought severity and its impact time trend of wheat biological parameters and relative soil moisture in various drought processes showed that in the absence of drought stress pn tr lwc and rsm displayed very small fluctuations over time and their values remained at a relatively high level fig 2 however under drought stress these indicators began to decline over time and their values were lower than those without drought stress fig 2 indicating that the severity of drought and its negative impact on wheat increased as the drought continued the process of field drought meanwhile lasted for a long time and may be regarded as a slow process fig 2a and the potted drought process lasted for a short time and as a fast process fig 2b under drought stress pn tr lwc and rsm of potted wheat decreased faster than that of field indicating that fast process drought develops faster than slow process drought and could cause a greater negative impact on wheat in a short period of time 3 2 link between drought severity and its impact responses of biological parameters of wheat to relative soil moisture showed that pn tr and lwc all presented small fluctuations with the change of rsm under sufficient water supply fig 3a but decreased rapidly with the decline of rsm under drought stress fig 3a p 0 001 indicating that these biological parameters of wheat were affected by drought from adequate soil moisture to drought stress these biological parameters displayed a trend of small fluctuations and then a rapid decline with the decrease of rsm and there was an obvious change in phases and an identifiable turning point fig 3a p 0 001 when the rsm was greater than the value corresponding to the turning point the value of each biological parameter showed a small fluctuation with the decrease of rsm for rsm less than the value corresponding to the turning point the parameter values exhibited a continuous decrease with reducing rsm and which was irreversible this relationship between rsm and wheat biological parameters exists in 68 observed drought processes and can be perfectly fitted by polynomial functions implying that there is a quantitative link between the drought severity and the impact of drought on wheat that is the impact on wheat starts from zero and intensifies rapidly with the increase of drought severity along the process of absence occurrence and persistence of drought showing the trend of onset and continued increase of drought impact based on the quantitative relationships between rsm and affected biological parameters of wheat the rsm pn tr and lwc corresponding to the turning point are defined as the onset threshold rsmdo the onset net photosynthetic rate pno the onset transpiration rate tro and the onset leaf water content lwco of drought impact on wheat respectively while the rsm less than rsmdo is defined as the severity threshold for drought impacts on wheat rsmds fig 3a analysis of experimental data shows that rsmdo is generally around 50 3 3 link between the severity of drought and drought induced losses in order to more directly reflect the quantitative link between the severity of drought and drought induced losses and facilitate the drought classification the functional relationships between relative soil moisture and biological parameter loss are shown in fig 3b it can be seen that when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl fluctuated slightly above and below the zero line with the change of rsm indicating that wheat growth was not affected by drought and when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl decreased with the decrease of rsmds fig 3b p 0 001 indicating that drought caused biological loss or negative impact on wheat and the loss increased with the increase of drought severity based on the observed data analysis of all drought processes the relationships between pnl trl lwcl and rsmds can also be fitted by a simple linear function if only the period affected by drought was considered fig 4 p 0 005 before the onset of drought impact i e when rsm rsmdo there was no statistically significant relationship between pnl trl lwcl and rsw indicating that water is not a limiting factor for wheat growth after the onset of drought impact when rsm rsmdo pnl trl and lwcl declined linearly with the decrease of rsm namely rswds indicating that the impact of drought on wheat increased linearly with the increase of drought severity 3 4 regional variation characteristics of drought impact threshold 3 4 1 convergence of onset threshold of drought impact to examine differences in rsmdo across climate zones based on the quantitative relationships between rsm and wheat biological parameters fitted by polynomials we calculated the values of rsmdo for all 68 observed drought processes and analyzed the discrete features of the 130 rsmdo values obtained interestingly we found that in any single climatic region 80 and above of all rsmdo values operated in the range of 47 5 52 5 while the mean value of rsmdo for each climatic region fell within the interval of 50 1 5 fig 5 indicating that there was a convergence to 50 across the climate zones in the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat p 0 05 3 4 2 difference of severity threshold of drought impact to compare the differences in rsmds causing the same biological loss across climatic zones we displayed the relationships between wheat biological parameter losses and rsm during the drought processes beginning with the jointing stage of field wheat in the six test sites fig 6 p 0 5 the results showed that after the onset of drought impact pnl trl and lwcl continued to decline with the decrease of rsmds but their declining rate varied in different climate region and generally increased from the arid area to the humid area which also caused that the rsmds corresponding to the same pnl trl and lwcl values increased from the arid region to the wet region and the difference in the rsmds gradually increased with the decrease of pnl trl and lwcl indicating that the severity threshold of drought impact on wheat that led to the same biological loss was different across climatic zones and the difference gradually increased as drought persisted and the loss increased 4 discussion uncertainty and accuracy in modeling monitoring and forecasting drought onset duration and end is a common concern of scholars collins et al 2016 meanwhile managers call current drought indicators and triggers useless and basically ignored in drought preparedness and planning because they have questions such as how do we know when we are in drought how severe is it and when do we take action collins et al 2016 there is general agreement that a more comprehensive understanding of the link between drought severity or indicators and impact is crucial to improve drought monitoring and early warning bachmair et al 2015 collins et al 2016 elliott et al 2017 stagge et al 2015 steinemann 2014 the meteorological drought index spei spi mci etc has been widely used in drought monitoring noel et al 2020 peters lidard et al 2021 bachmair et al 2015 however these drought indicators are physical variables that independently reflect water shortage and the severity of drought is graded according to the mathematical probability distribution of indicators pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 collins et al 2016 peters lidard et al 2021 noel et al 2020 in order to meet the needs of monitoring and assessment of drought impact people usually associate the post event impact of drought with the severity described by drought indicators however these drought indicators reflect the physical process of drought occurrence and development while the impact of drought reflects the consequences of drought disasters in fact we often ignore the long term persistence of the impact of drought and the process of drought impacts needs to be fully understood all these may bring great difficulties to accurately determine the beginning duration and end time of drought impact and to achieve quantitative and real time monitoring and assessment of drought effect our study demonstrates a quantitative link between drought severity and its impact on wheat which can be used to determine the onset and severity of drought impacts it can be seen from this study that the impact or damage of drought on wheat generally begins when rsm 50 and then increases with the decrease of rsm according to our observations it takes more than 20 days from the onset to the more severe for example pnl 40 for the impact of drought on wheat in the field which makes it possible to carry out early warnings with the onset of drought impact in the operational practice of drought monitoring early warning and assessment the drought severity is divided into different grades through drought indicators and the possible effects of different grades of drought are given for example in the u s drought monitor the severity of drought is divided into 5 grades which are d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought d4 exceptional drought noel et al 2020 here according to the quantitative relationship between rsm and net photosynthetic rate loss in fig 4 we give the drought classification and soil moisture threshold based on the impact process table 3 this helps to understand the impacts of drought on wheat at different stages or grades during drought by monitoring soil moisture of course drought severity classification can also be carried out according to the relationship between different biological parameters and soil moisture in different climatic regions and more related experimental studies are also needed to improve the accuracy of this drought classification people usually pay more attention to crop yield reduction caused by drought lesk et al 2016 jägermeyr and frieler 2018 zarei et al 2021a 2021b in fact even small increases in the rate of net photosynthesis can translate into large increases in biomass and hence yield since carbon assimilation is integrated over the entire growing season martin et al 2011 this study observed the impacts of drought on wheat biological parameters during droughts and confirmed that drought damage to wheat occurred during droughts rather than after drought events and the yield loss from drought were the result of this damage integration during drought indicating that focusing on drought impact processes is key to determining and verifying in real time the onset and persistence of drought impacts the study found that the onset thresholds of drought impacts on wheat had convergence across climatic regions while the severity thresholds showed a regional difference and an increasing trend from the arid to the wet climate region in reality the regional adaptability of drought indicators and their thresholds is a major scientific issue in drought research yang et al 2017 steinemann et al 2015 akuraju et al 2017 and our findings may provide reference for conducting drought monitoring and early warning across climate regions if rsm is used as a drought indicator the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat is the same in different climatic regions however the severity threshold is larger in humid than in arid areas for droughts with the same impact 5 conclusion the fast process drought develops faster than slow process and could cause a greater negative impact on wheat in a short period of time from adequate soil moisture to drought stress the biological parameters of wheat displayed a trend of small fluctuations and then a rapid decline with the decrease of rsm and there was an obvious change in phases and an identifiable turning point rsm corresponding to the turning point is defined as the onset threshold rsmdo of drought impact on wheat while the rsm less than rsmdo is defined as the severity threshold rsmds for drought impacts on wheat the water is not a limiting factor for wheat growth before the onset of drought impact the impact of drought on wheat increased linearly with the increase of drought severity after the onset of drought impact the onset threshold of drought impact on wheat converges to 50 in different climatic zones the severity threshold of drought impact on wheat is different in different climatic regions and generally increased from the arid area to the humid area after the onset of drought impact credit authorship contribution statement runyuan wang conceptualization investigation data curation

9001,water productivity wp a performance indicator defines if the agricultural production system uses the resources competently spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to knowing where a gap in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps where a crop production system performs well and where developments are still possible to enhance the water productive performance this study proposes to assess spatial wheat wp in drought prone northwestern bangladesh both primary and secondary data such as sentinel 2 msi landsat 8 oli satellite images actual evapotranspiration eta from lysimeter and wheat farmers field data over the study area were collected to accomplish this study the wheat cultivated fields were delineated first using sentinel 2 msi data during the 2018 wheat growing season wp parameters namely crop yield and eta were estimated using landsat 8 satellite data based on yield data from the farmer s field and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values generated from the same fields a linear regression model was developed this model was applied to obtain crop yield maps from the ndvi maps of the study area a remote sensing based well tested robust algorithm surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal was used to estimate eta using landsat 8 images and local ground information cloud free single date images corresponding to wheat growth stages such as initial development mid season and late season were used to estimate seasonal eta sebal estimated single date eta was validated by newly developed under this study lysimeter measured eta wheat maps were then masked to get crop specific yield and eta maps finally the wp maps of wheat were produced by the mathematical operation of the yield and eta raster maps the ndvi crop yield y models were calibrated and validated which shows an acceptable degree of dispersion between observed and estimated values thakurgaon and panchagorh districts second administrative tier are higher wheat yielding districts in the study area the average wheat yield of the study area was 3 51 t ha 1 which is close to the department of agricultural extension officially reported data in the case of the denominator eta of wp estimation results show that sebal estimated wheat eta on the image dates is close to eta estimated by the lysimeter the average seasonal eta for wheat is found as 253 mm the estimated highest and lowest eta demands are found in thakurgaon and panchagorh districts respectively the estimated wp of wheat ranged between 1 33 and 1 46 kg m 3 with an average of 1 39 kg m 3 among the eight study districts panchagorh and thakurgaon districts are the highest water productive whereas gaibandha and nilphamari show the minimum level of the wp among the y eta wp eta and wp y relationships wp y shows the highest correlation r2 0 73 as the higher wp observed mainly due to high yielding capacity besides suitable soil characteristics and weather conditions favor wheat wp in those areas this study identifies high performing bright and low performing hot spots of wp across the northwest of bangladesh finally stakeholders and decision makers can use the information to define priority areas set goals for improvement and justify the type of investment or measures for improving water productive agriculture in bangladesh keywords evapotranspiration lysimeter landsat 8 water productivity wheat yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world is facing twin challenges namely water stress and food security which are already pressing and are likely to grow in the future foley et al 2011 neither of these challenges can be addressed in isolation because crop production is the prime freshwater consumer and this water is a crucial resource in producing crops rosegrant et al 2009 producing more crops using a drop of water commonly known as water productivity could be a crucial strategy to address both challenges molden et al 2003 the concept of water productivity wp of the crop is based on producing more crops from the same water resources or producing the same amount of food from fewer water resources giordano et al 2021 water productivity a performance indicator defines if the agricultural production system uses the resources competently spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to knowing where a gap in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps where a crop production system performs well and where developments are still possible to enhance the water productive performance this information supports policymakers and investors guidelines to take action to improve the wp zwart et al 2010 the usage of crop wp as an agricultural performance indicator has increased over the decades this indicator is specified in the sustainable development goals sdgs which demand that agricultural productivity should be doubled by 2030 sgd2 3 and water use efficiency must be increased sdg6 4 substantially bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 given that water could be a limiting factor for crop production consequently measuring water productivity parameters mainly crop productivity and evapotranspiration eta assume critical importance water productivity is typically estimated by means of crop yield and evapotranspiration of the crops crop yield and crop specific evapotranspiration are essential to estimate at the field to global scales for optimizing crop water management and the potential needs of crops for best yields li et al 2013 nagore et al 2014 both these parameters of wp are usually estimated through conventional means e g field experiments or surveys currently satellite remote sensing techniques have been used to measure them even at the field level the use of spatial data to estimate these parameters is increasing due to effectiveness and extent if compared with in situ methods for example field water balances or ground measurements sadras et al 2015 relating ndvi generated from spatial data with harvestable yield is the utmost extensively used statistical model kogan et al 2013 skakun et al 2019 remote sensing technique can model and simulate the eta process abtew and melesse 2013 using developed algorithms such as sebs su 2002 sseb senay et al 2011 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 metric allen et al 2007 and tsb norman and becker 1995 bangladesh specifically the northwest region is facing water security primarily due to rapid population growth declining agricultural land and water and changing climate mainuddin and kirby 2015 less agricultural land and irrigation water will be available for future crop production besides this production must be increased in those limited resources under changing climate to feed the ever increasing growing population consequently providing food and water security to its population has been an important socio economic and administrative priority for the government of bangladesh mainuddin and kirby 2015 despite attaining self sufficiency in rice production the current practices of boro rice production use about 75 of irrigation water and cause declining in the groundwater which affects the environment significantly mainuddin et al 2020 recently the government of bangladesh gob has been discouraging to expand of the high water consuming boro rice dry winter season rice particularly in the climatic vulnerable northwestern region planning commission 2015 ahmad et al 2014 fahad et al 2018 accordingly other cereals like wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l could be then a better alternative to support the water productive food production particularly for the northwest region where about 60 wheat and 65 maize of the whole country are grown bbs 2018 these crops are essential emerging crops in bangladesh because of their high yield potential fewer water uses and economic profitability compared to rice ahmad et al 2014 consequently increasing the wp of these promising crops could be the crucial strategy to address both the aforesaid food and water security challenges brauman et al 2013 despite limited actions for upgrading agricultural water productivity the spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to know the answer to the questions i the status of the crop water productivity i e where are we ii the gaps in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps i e what are the goals and iii the way forward i e how to achieve them however before starting to initiate increasing the wp of the crops it is essential to know the status of the spatial variability of productivity water use and wp of crops some recent studies have evaluated the crop wp to scale it at global and local scales the first benchmarking study at a global level was conducted by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 based on the compiled wp values for individual crops zwart et al 2010 assessed global wp for rainfed and

district scale estimation for rice mainly some studies show district level eta information only excluding water productivity information therefore information on the spatial status of wp specifically for wheat production is the lack in this region benchmark information of the spatial wp is a prerequisite for initiating a program for improving existing wp consequently there are knowledge gaps in the information on field scale wheat wp which is essential to assess for improving the wp in satellite remote sensing the accumulated scientific knowledge among agricultural researchers and radiation physicists has progressed in the development of numerical systems to transform remotely sensed data into handy information such as crop types yields and evapotranspiration fluxes this study proposes ideas to generate spatial field level water productivity of wheat crops find out the drives to enhance the water productive performance and the way forward to achieve them as a case study in the northwest region of bangladesh to the best of our knowledge this is the first study aiming to estimate the benchmarking field level 30 m scale spatial wp of wheat in bangladesh our study attempts to provide insights into the actual status realistic goals and potentials of crop water productivity in bangladesh by utilizing satellite imagery landsat 8 and sentinel 2 in the context of evapotranspiration data availability a newly non weighing above ground lysimeters design and development is another innovation that would be helpful to validate the output of the sebal at the field scale moreover our developed wheat wp map provides the higher wp boundaries as target wp values and similarly lower boundaries where improvements are required to help decision makers understand the extent of improvements as well as the locations of poor and good practices among the studied districts finally the notions of this study including other major crops to define priority areas set goals for improvement and justify the type of investment or measures for improving water productive agriculture to ensure food security globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area for this research the rangpur division the northwestern region of bangladesh has been selected as the study area fig 1 this division bangladesh s 7th division was established on january 25 2010 and consists of eight districts second administrative tier panchagorh thakurgaon dinajpur lalmonirhat kurigram nilphamari rangpur and gaibandha the area of this division is about 16 320 km2 and is located between 25 20 and 26 37 n and 88 50 and 89 53 e this division is bordered on the north by the indian state of west bengal on the south by the joypurhat and bogura districts on the east by assam state and on the west by the indian state of west bengal among the 24 sub regions of the physiography the study area covers four major sub regions namely old himalayan piedmont plain tista floodplain old brahmaputra floodplain and barind tract thakurgaon district including parts of dinajpur and panchagarh is comprised of the old himalayan piedmont plain this land area is usually moderately sloping at the hill base including silty sediments deposited by watercourses this land consists of piedmont sands and gravels deposited as alluvial fans by the mahananda and karatoya rivers the drainage pattern of this area is broad smooth braided including irregular shaped edges cut across by many channels which branch out and reconnect frequently the geography is subjected to flood plains of the ganges and brahmaputra rivers thirty aezs identified in bangladesh are classified based on characteristics of soil physiography seasonal flooding depth and extent seasonal weather parameters crop season and growing period among the 30 aezs the rangpur division study area consists of eight aezs fig 1 the aezs of this region is identified based on four elements such as physiography soils land levels of flooding and agro climatology the croplands are fragmented and heterogeneous and soil fertility and organic matter vary significantly in this region the study area has the major cropping areas which is essential to the current food security achievement mainly for its dry winter season crop production this region alone produces about 35 60 and 65 of the boro rice wheat and maize respectively bbs 2018 this region uses 96 5 groundwater in irrigating boro rice shahid 2011 this overuse causes a reduction in groundwater levels which in turn leads to the shortage of irrigation and drinking water in particular regions the government of bangladesh has also given high priority to sustaining the uses of groundwater in irrigating boro rice in the study area hence other cereal crops such as wheat and maize become popular to cultivate in the winter season in this region 2 2 data both primary and secondary data such as the satellite imageries actual evapotranspiration eta from newly developed lysimeter and farmers field production data along with gps location over the study area were collected to accomplish this study 2 2 1 satellite data cloud free satellite imageries namely sentinel 2 msi and landsat 8 oli available during the wheat growing season 2018 were collected and used for this study sentinel 2 sensor data have been preferred to classify wheat in this study mainly due to high spatial 10 m and temporal resolution 5 days which are crucial in phenology based wheat area delineation this satellite 2 mission is an alliance of twin satellites namely sentinel 2a initiated 23 june 2015 and sentinel 2b initiated 7 march 2017 which makes it a higher revisiting time of 5 days with the same viewing angles the sentinel 2 sensors have 13 bands including visible band 2 3 and 4 red edge band 5 6 and 7 and near infrared band 8 and 8a part of the spectrum among them near infrared band 8 has 10 m near infrared nir band 8a has 20 m resolution whereas visible and red edge bands have 10 m and 20 m resolution respectively for this study cloud free time series sentinel 2 satellite images tile number t45rxj t45ryj t45rxk and t45ryk data dated 01 december 2017 26 december 2017 25 january 2018 09 february 2018 19 february 2018 and 07 march 2018 were downloaded free from usgs archives www earthexplorer usgs gov landsat 8 oli data was used to calculate yield and actual evapotranspiration eta for the study area because this data has the thermal infrared tir bands which along with others are essential for evapotranspiration estimation landsat 8 is an earth observation satellite eos launched on february 11 2013 it is the 8th satellite in the landsat program the 7th to reach orbit successfully originally it was called the landsat data continuity mission and is a collaboration between the united states geological survey usgs and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa landsat 8 satellite is a sun synchronous near polar orbit including 438 miles altitude inclined at 98 2 degrees and circles the earth every 99 min landsat 8 oli has a 16 day temporal resolution including equatorial overpass time 10 00 a m 15 min for this study landsat 8 oli data path 138 139 and row 42 dated 01 december 2017 25 december 2017 03 february 2018 and 06 march 2018 were downloaded from usgs archives www earthexplorer usgs gov to estimate wheat yield and seasonal evapotranspiration 2 2 2 lysimeter data to estimate the evapotranspiration data of wheat a simple non weighing drainage lysimeter was constructed and deployed in the research field of bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur four stages of the wheat growing period namely initial developing mid and late stages were considered to measure the respective evapotranspiration data from lysimeters which were used to evaluate the sebal based evapotranspiration of wheat 2 2 3 field survey data three field surveys were conducted for ground truth data collected on 21 december 2017 19 february 2018 and 21 march 2018 during the winter wheat growing season 2018 over the study area a hand held gps was used to collect wheat fields location as ground truth data sixty eight wheat fields were surveyed including the location and yield information of wheat over the study area 2 3 methodology zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 used crop water productivity which is defined as the crop yield over actual evapotranspiration eta in a crop season 1 wp kg m 3 crop yield kg ha 1 10 i sos eos et a mm the crop yield is defined as the harvestable yield and the eta is taken as the accumulated crop evapotranspiration from the start of the season sos to the end of the season eos the conversion factor 10 1 converts eta from mm to m3 ha 1 this applied methodology of wheat wp using remote sensing follows three steps such as delineating wheat fields and wheat wp through productivity and seasonal evapotranspiration the overall methodology is shown in the following fig 2 2 3 1 wheat area delineation a rule based crop classifying technique was applied to delineate wheat cultivated fields based on the ndvi based threshold values for this study available cloud free time series sentinel 2 satellite images data during the wheat growing season dated 01 december 2017 26 december 2017 25 january 2018 09 february 2018 19 february 2018 and 06 march 2018 coinciding with the six wheat phenological stages namely emergence shooting booting flowering grain development and maturity respectively were used twelve wheat fields were selected from which spectral signatures on those images date were collected for determining ndvi based threshold values wheat crop fields were delineated using sentinel 2 image data from time series threshold values of ndvi of wheat in this knowledge based classification rules include wheat and non wheat and the condition includes the threshold of the vegetation indices vis first a single date wheat crop was delineated using the knowledge based classifier all the six single date images were classified by the rule based binary numbering classification system if the vis values are between the threshold values the classifier counts binary 1 i e wheat pixels otherwise count binary 0 i e non wheat pixels finally all six single date wheat crop maps were combined using mathematical image operation for the phenology based final wheat map 2 3 2 estimation of spatial crop yield spatial crop productivity estimation through statistical regression models with remotely sensed data needs at best one variable which results from satellite sensors compared to vegetation indices which are a product of combining reflectance of different bands or individual bands are more relevant to crop biomass and can be directly used to compute vegetation conditions bannari et al 1995 several studies used a linear regression model to define the correlation between wheat yield and satellite derived ndvi in different areas of the world ren et al 2008 regressing mid season ndvi with harvestable productivity is one of the extensively used remotely sensed data based statistical models skakun et al 2019 wheat yield was produced in this study from landsat 8 oli products ndvi and harvestable yield collected from farmers fields productivity information on the wheat of the local farmers was collected through the 2017 2018 wheat growing rabi season through the two field surveys at each sample site the information on sowing and crop cutting time along with phenological stages were collected from the respective wheat farmers after screening collected samples 57 wheat yield field information were selected for development calibration of the yield map and its validation purposes these samples were used to calibrate an empirical regression model of yield with spectral information of landsat 8 oli product to cover the period of optimum ndvi of the crop two clear image attainment dates 12 february and 28 february were selected for this study therefore the relationships between ndvi and wheat yield were observed on those image attainment dates two landsat 8 scenes path 138 139 and row 42 were mosaicked to cover the entire study area the ndvis were derived using red and near infrared bands of the mosaic image ndvi information of wheat samples was extracted all images were processed with qgis 2 18 1 once the ndvis information was extracted and combined with yield data approximately 80 46 nos of samples were used to develop calibrate the empirical model and 20 11 nos samples were used to validate it the linear regression relationships were developed between wheat productivity dependent variable and ndvi independent variable applying a cropland mask improves the precision of crop productivity estimation becker reshef et al 2010 a mask with the wheat fields was applied to the calibrated yield map to get the final yield map of wheat the calibrated empirical model was applied to estimate average wheat yield which was further compared with the ofﬁcial yield data of the department of agricultural extension dae during the 2018 wheat growing season 2 3 3 estimation and evaluation of actual evapotranspiration eta surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is an optical image data processing model comprised of a set of computational steps to estimate eta based on energy interactions among land and atmosphere bastiaanssen et al 1998 this model deduces the surface heat fluxes evaporation and radiation using satellite data in the visible nir and tirs these remotely sensed parameters are taken from any suitable satellite sensor working in these wavelengths sebal algorithm has been applied so far for many case studies specifically in europe and asia including bangladesh and this algorithm is considered the most precise and logical method to estimate the eta at present in estimating spatial eta values several solar radiation parameters are needed to calculate cloud free landsat 8 oli tirs data with path 138 139 and row 42 were acquired on 01 december 2017 25 december 2017 03 february 2018 07 march 2018 and 23 march 2018 to calculate eta on those image acquisition dates one arc second resolution aster digital elevation model dem along with some reference weather parameters such as sunshine hours relative humidity maximum and minimum temperature and geographic location were used the following mathematical eqs 2 12 for building the sebal algorithm were used to calculate eta eta estimation from satellite data by sebal is subject to the thermodynamic balance among the subsurface laminar and atmospheric turbulent transport process this process is termed as land surface energy balance which is used to calculate the eta process at the vegetation surface eq 2 2 rn g h λet where rn denotes net radiation watt m 2 g denotes soil heat flux watt m 2 h denotes sensible heat flux watt m 2 and λet denotes latent heat flux rn was calculated by deducting total outgoing fluxes from total incoming fluxes using eq 3 allen et al 2011 3 rn 1 α rs rl rl 1 ε rl where rs denotes incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 α denotes broadband surface albedo dimensionless rl denotes incoming long wave radiation w m 2 rl denotes outgoing long wave radiation w m 2 and ε denotes surface emissivity dimensionless the rs was calculated using atmospheric transmissivity solar constant solar incidence angle and earth sun distance with atmospheric transmissivity and land surface reference temperature the rl was estimated using the stefan boltzmann equation modified the stefan boltzmann equation surface temperature and emissivity were used to compute rl sebal computes heat flux from soil g estimation based on the empirical eq 4 representing values near midday developed by waters et al 2002 4 g rn ts α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α2 1 0 98 ndvi4 g rn was computed and tested if ndvi 0 g rn then was assigned equal to 0 5 the consequential image was altered to soil heat flux g by multiplying g rn by rn waters et al 2002 land surface temperatures ts were calculated using the modified plank equation and selected cold and hot pixels from satellite image data on thermal radiance eq 5 5 t s k 2 ln ε k 1 r c 1 where rc signifies thermal radiation adjusted from the ground surface which was computed using the spectral radiance of band 6 according to coll et al 2009 ɛ denotes broad band surface emissivity which is the percentage of the thermal energy radiated by the surface to the thermal energy radiated by a blackbody at the same temperature k1 and k2 are constants for landsat images the sebal process utilizes the hot dry bare agricultural field and cold wet well irrigated fully covered crop surface pixels to fix boundary conditions for energy balance bastiaanssen et al 1998 sensible heat flux h is the rate of heat loss to the air by convection and conduction due to temperature gradients and was calculated from the following empirical eq 6 given by bastiaanssen et al 1998 6 h ρ cp dt rah where h denotes sensible heat flux cp denotes air specific heat 1 kj kg k ρ denotes air density kg m 3 dt is near surface temperature differences in k and rah denotes aerodynamic resistance to transport heat m s latent heat flux λet in w m2 is the rate of latent heat loss from the surface due to evapotranspiration the instantaneous et etinst was then computed in mm hr 1 using eq 7 and 8 7 λ et r n g h 8 et inst 3600 λ et λ where λ denoted latent heat of vaporization j kg and was calculated as eq 9 9 λ 2 501 t a 273 0 002361 where ta is the mean air temperature k based on the etinst and local weather data the reference evapotranspiration fraction etrf was calculated as follows eq 10 10 etrf etinst etr where etr is the reference et at the time of the image mm hr etrf is similar to the well known crop coefficient kc and is used to extrapolate et from the image time to 24 hour or longer periods finally sebal calculates daily 24 hour evapotranspiration et24 by supposing the instantaneous etrf computed above is the same as the 24 hour average and that evapotranspiration changes during the day while etrf remains relatively constant finally the et24 mm day was calculated using the eq 11 11 et24 etrf etr 24 where etr 24 denoted the total 24 hour et0 for the image day and was calculated using eq 12 12 et r 24 h 24 et r 24 the requirements of the sebal method to calculate the pixel wise evapotranspiration 16 spatial analyst models were buildup and applied with erdas imagine software for this study eta was estimated with the sebal model at different growing stages of wheat for the available cloud free image data the seasonal eta was then calculated based on the growth stages values of the crop table 1 the estimated eta from landsat 8 oli with sebal model was then validated with the eta estimated by the lysimeter in this case four growth stages namely the initial development mid and late stages of wheat were considered based on image availability first the daily eta of the image date coinciding with four growth stages was estimated using the sebal algorithm then each eta map was multiplied by the respective growing days number to get the seasonal eta of wheat newly designed and developed non weighing above ground lysimeters were set up in the experimental fields of bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur the height of the lysimeter is 38 cm and the radius is 18 cm a tinny layer of sand and small gravels are placed at the lowermost of the bucket and fill the bucket with soil the same soil collected from the experimental fields was used in the lysimeter so that the instrument could represent the soil character of the same study field drainage discharge and capture systems were designed to facilitate drainage from the lysimeter the tillage depth sowing date and seed rate usually used in fields condition were applied proportionally to the lysimeter the soil of the studied area is classified as a sandy clay loam usda classification with 55 sand 27 silt and 18 clay according to the actual field practice three rows of wheat seeds have been sown separately in a lysimeter a small plastic bucket was placed at the bottom of the lysimeter bucket during the irrigation and rainfall events to collect the percolated water fig 3 these experiments were replicated thrice traditional flooding irrigation was applied and monitored by measuring the quantity of water in a calibrated container before application the lysimeter was drained by gravity and percolated water was collected in the collection container placed just under the lysimeter and measured in the measuring cylinder regarding irrigation scheduling the farmers usually apply 3 4 irrigation at the different water sensitive stages of wheat during its growing season in bangladesh mustafa et al 2017 suggest four irrigation applications at the booting flowering crown root initiation and at flowering stage in the water scarcity region of bangladesh irrigation was then applied from 15 december 2017 16 march 2018 including four applications of the suggested stages of wheat growth finally eta was calculated from the water balance eq 13 to evaluate the eta estimated from sebal 13 p r et δs where p denotes precipitation r denotes stream flow and δs denotes storage changes in soil or the bedrock groundwater 2 3 4 estimation and mapping of water productivity originally eta maps and yields maps were available at 30 m resolutions whereas crop maps were at 10 m spatial resolution before further processing of these maps for wheat wp the crop map was rescaled to 30 m resolution the water productivity of wheat was estimated by the mathematical operation of raster maps of seasonal evapotranspiration and yield of wheat 3 results 3 1 delineate wheat cultivated fields the rule based classification algorithm delineated the wheat fields of the study area fig 4 the wheat maps show variations in the distribution of wheat cultivated fields over the study area the major wheat cultivated districts were thakurgaon and panchagorh districts whereas gaibandha and lalmonirhat were the less wheat cultivated districts the generated wheat map was validated through an accuracy assessment and comparison agreement the overall accuracy was 82 30 based on the ground truth data indicating satisfactory p 0 05 classification results table 2 the estimated rs based district wise area was further compared to the district wise area reported by the department of agricultural extension dae and showed a good comparison agreement fig 5 wheat cultivation in this region is especially favored by the long winter season that is usually unavailable in other parts of the country during the harvesting period of wheat the crop is privileged by clear sunshine and low humidity wheat requires diverse temperatures at the different phenological phases of the crops in general the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures are required at 3 5 5 5 c 20 25 c and 30 c respectively for the wheat growing period at temperatures below or above optimum the germination of the seed decreases slowly if the temperature exceeds 30 c at the maturity time and it leads to force maturity and yield loss wheat is accordingly cultivated mainly in dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagorh districts over the study area because all these factors favor thakurgaon and dinajpur to be dominated by wheat based cropping systems huq and shoaib 2013 3 2 estimation of the numerator of wp crop productivity wheat yields were estimated from landsat 8 oli image data and farmers field yield data over the study area the linear relationship on february 12 74 das and february 28 90 das shows the best fit among wheat productivity and ndvi p value 0 05 among the available clear images moreover this regression model on the image dates indicated an identical explanation of the wheat yield variation though both models estimate the yield similarly the anticipation of 16 days led to a select date of february 12 74 das including a relatively better correlation as well to the estimation of the yield of wheat fig 6 a in consequence using the landsat 8 image dated february 12 enable the assessment of wheat productivity 30 35 days in advance of harvest the yield model shows good agreement among the wheat productivity and ndvi was 75 eq 14 the coefficient of the linear regression model for the vegetation index r2 of 0 75 states that 75 of changes in the vegetation index are justified and the rest is influenced by other variables 14 wheat yield t ha 1 3 0321 ndvi 1 6573 ndvi related thoroughly to vegetation vigor can estimate crop productivity and monitor crop development from the early 1980 s tucker et al 1980 boken and shaykewich 2002 many researchers estimated crop productivity before harvesting and found similar results to this study mirasi et al 2019 evaluated sum ndvi values to estimate wheat grain yields using multi temporal landsat oli data and the best estimation of grain yields was obtained using the spectral landsat oli data for about 43 days before optimal harvesting operation time lopresti et al 2015 estimated wheat productivity four weeks before harvest relations among ndvi wheat productivity before harvest becker reshef et al 2010 reported wheat grain yields in an early estimation manner using ndvi values exactly 30 days before harvesting in buenos aires ren et al 2008 found a reasonable wheat productivity estimation from ndvi using modis data during the booting and heading stages the best correlation between ndvi wheat productivity coincided during the highest lai period which is achieved 10 15 days before anthesis fig 6 b shows the calibrated yield model i e the relationship between observed and estimated productivity from landsat ndvi dated 12 february and farmers yields while the calibrated yield model was validated the rmse value 247 kg ha 1 represents 7 32 of the observed average yields which shows an acceptable degree of dispersion between observed and estimated yield values becker reshef et al 2010 found similar results rmse 440 kg ha 1 while estimating wheat yield in ukraine kouadio et al 2012 estimated regional wheat yield from modis data with an rmse of 570 kg ha 1 representing about 7 of the mean of observed yields lopresti et al 2015 using remotely sensed data estimated the regional wheat yield with an rmse value of 582 kg ha 1 and an r2 of 0 53 in argentia the dispersion between observed and estimated yields could be attributed to some reasons using landsat 8 images the wheat yield has been estimated even six weeks before the harvest weather conditions and biotic adversities during march grain filling influence yield and thus the inference of ndvi from february could be changed becker reshef et al 2010 found that high values of ndvi at the peak of wheat growth were related to low yields due to a meteorological event before harvest finally a spatial wheat yield map is generated by applying this developed yield model eq 14 on landsat 8 images dated 12 february 2018 fig 7 the average estimated wheat yield was 3 51 ton ha 1 for the rangpur division mustafa et al 2017 found a 3 25 t ha 1 wheat yield in moderate soil fertility levels in dhaka bangladesh which are similar to this study s results the wheat yield map shows the variation in its range over the study area the highest wheat yields were estimated in thakurgaon 3 7 t ha 1 and dinajpur 3 65 t ha 1 districts whereas the lowest yields were estimated in kurigram 3 42 t ha 1 and gaibandha 3 3 t ha 1 districts if compared the district wise rs based estimated yields were well matched with the department of agricultural extension dae reported estimation though rs based estimation is relatively higher except for the panchagorh district fig 8 3 3 estimation of the denominator of wp actual evapotranspiration the denominator of wp i e actual evapotranspiration was estimated for wheat using a remotely sensed sebal algorithm a low cost above ground lysimeter was designed and developed under this study to estimate the wheat field eta which was used to validate sebal estimated spatial eta of wheat 3 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration using lysimeter table 3 depicts the values of field water balance to estimate the evapotranspiration of wheat under irrigation practices measured by the newly developed lysimeter during the 2017 2018 wheat growing season after completing seed germination the first irrigation was applied at 15 days the lysimeter received its final irrigation 100 days after seeding and wheat was harvested 12 days after the final irrigation total cumulative eta was measured as 276 4 mm three events of rainfall of 2 26 and 29 mm were recorded during 61 110 days after sowing which were not enough to meet up the eta so further watering was applied as supplemental irrigation the negative sign of the soil water storage values indicates that the water was depleted from the initial soil moisture which was utilized by the crop the positive sign defines that the soil retained more water compared to the initial condition table 3 3 3 2 estimation of actual evapotranspiration using sebal actual evapotranspiration from landsat 8 oli was quantified for irrigated wheat fields over the entire study area using the sebal procedure the eta was estimated daily at the four image acquisition dates from december 2017 to april 2018 on the available cloud free image acquisition dates sebal estimated average eta values in an experimental field were compared with lysimeter estimated eta it is observed that sebal was somewhat under estimated in eta than that of lysimeter estimated eta of wheat though it showed plausible trends regarding the accuracy of eta derived from the sebal fig 9 the result shows that during the initial developing mid and late stages total eta estimated both from sebal and lysimeter were 24 56 107 and 66 mm and 27 5 64 6 114 8 and 69 5 mm respectively the estimated seasonal eta of sebal and lysimeter were 253 mm and 276 4 mm respectively the differences in eta between the two methods might be due to the different data sources experimental fields etc however researchers also found they underestimated eta using sebal when compared with the ground based data shopan et al 2013 estimated eta by the sebal methods using modis data and found an underestimation of sebal estimated eta while compared with eta obtained from ground based measurements by the penman monteith method fig 10 shows the a changes in the actual daily and b seasonal evapotranspiration of wheat during the 2018 winter crop season wheat shows a low eta demand during the initial growth stage 01 december due to fragile canopy cover which could lower the eta in the developing stage 25 december eta demand increased due to the development of canopy covers and sizes during the mid stage 03 february the wheat reached its highest eta demand as this time is the highest canopy cover and heading filling stage which increases the eta demand during the late stages 07 march when the average wheat crop leaped to senescence the eta demand became decreasing over the study area all four daily eta maps during the growth stages of wheat were multiplied by their respective number of growing days respective stages to get the seasonal eta fig 10 shows the seasonal changes of the wheat eta over the study area the energy balance modeling results show that the district wise seasonal eta of wheat from 25 november through 16 march 110 days varied from 208 to 329 mm with an overall spatial average of 253 mm among the district wise distribution of seasonal eta during the 2018 crop season the average highest and lowest eta demand were estimated in thakurgaon and lalmonirhat 256 mm each and panchagorh 246 mm districts respectively whereas moderate eta was estimated in other districts a similar pattern of sebal based eta demand for wheat 240 mm was observed by zhang et al 2019 during the wheat growing season in the guanzhong plain china mustafa et al 2017 found 280 mm eta for fully irrigated wheat in bangladesh which is close to the observation of this study 3 4 estimation of crop water productivity based on the yield wp numerator and seasonal eta wp denominator the wp of wheat was calculated spatially fig 11 shows the map of wheat wp and their variations over the rangpur division the average wp ranges between 1 33 and 1 46 kg m 3 among the 8 study districts the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts are the highest water productive at as1 46 and 1 43 kg m 3 respectively for wheat whereas gaibandha and nilphamari show the minimum wheat wp as 1 33 and 1 35 kg m 3 respectively rest four districts dinajpur rangpur lalmonirhat and kurogram show medium water productivity 1 40 1 38 1 37 and 1 37 kg m 3 respectively the average wp for the entire rangpur division was 1 39 kg m 3 mustafa et al 2017 found 1 25 kg m 3 for fully irrigated wheat in bangladesh which was close to this study s results moreover these estimates fall between ranges of global estimation of wheat wp which varies from 0 6 to 1 7 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 among the relationships of yield y eta and wp this study shows that the y eta relationship is not as straightforward as often assumed r squared values are low as r2 0 34 fig 7 similar results have been found while global wheat y eta relationships have been assessed and the average was found to be as low as 0 35 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 however the y wp relation is found more correlated as often assumed the r squared value is high as r2 is 0 71 for wheat in this study the wp can be improved by increasing per unit area crop yield or decreasing actual crop evapotranspiration field experiments from previous such studies conﬁrm that using high yield cultivars improved crop water productivity and reduced water consumption zhenci et al 2019 xu and zhao 2001 zhang et al 2010 2005 on the other hand early in the wheat growth cycle the weather should be warm and moist later the weather should be sunny and dry all these are the factors that favor these areas as wheat based cropping systems nevertheless utmost of the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts and north eastern parts of dinajpur districts of the old himalayan piedmont plain having 58 high and 34 medium high land are suitable for wheat cultivation brammer et al 1988 huq and shoaib 2013 therefore the water productivity of wheat is more in these districts than those in others among the study districts a range of wp values for wheat exists which could be caused by the many factors that influence the soil plant water relationship the variation of the wp of locating the bright spots and hot spots is seen in fig 10 where the wp is above and below the average values respectively the poor wp values or hot spots apply to the fields where poor water management or farming practices may be detected easily for further improvement these maps prove that on farm practices could have a significant range of impacts on improving wp bright spots represent superior management practices applied by farmers to maximize the wp such maps can help decision makers and local farmers to determine the best agronomic practices including improved variety fertilizer irrigation scheduling and crop rotation to apply in low yielding fields to increase crop and water productivity ghorbanpour et al 2022 4 discussions we estimated the water productivity of wheat including its parameter namely productivity and evapotranspiration prior to the relationship of wheat yield to the evapotranspiration and wp 4 1 productivity of wheat accurate forecasts of wheat production are of vital importance to farmers production plans trade and import export plans however approximations of the productivity of wheat crops can be obtained even before harvesting using linear regression models based on vegetation indices and observations of the yield the yield estimated in this study may vary from the actual harvested yield due to weather variations insect pest infestation etc remote sensing sensors observe the yield indirectly based on the condition of instantaneous vegetative condition of cereals whose yield consists of storage organs which are very sensitive at critical growth stages to weather conditions consequently grain yield could be low even if above ground biomass is large yue et al 2021 reeves et al 2005 however forecasting wheat productivity using landsat 8 ndvi there are still about four six weeks to be harvested which imposes uncertainty on the actual productivity due to disease insect infestation lack of proper management etc lopresti et al 2015 the wheat yield map based on the regression models in this study shows the variation in its range over the study area due to various reasons wheat cultivation with its better yield in this region is especially favored by the long winter season that is usually unavailable in other parts of the country during the harvesting period of wheat the crop is privileged by clear sunshine and low humidity all these factors favor thakurgaon and dinajpur to be dominated by wheat based cropping systems huq and shoaib 2013 wheat is a crop from a cold environment it requires however diverse temperatures at the different phenological phases of the crops temperature requirements may somewhat differ from variety to variety during the germination period in general the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures are required at 3 5 5 5 c 20 25 c and 30 c respectively for the wheat growing period at temperatures below or above optimum the germination of the seed decreases slowly if the temperature exceeds 30 c at the maturity time and it leads to force maturity and yield loss district wise spatial variations in wheat yield were observed over the study area mainly due to land types soil fertility soil texture organic matter weather and management practices etc dinajpur was observed as a relatively better yield producing district whereas nilphamari and kurigram were observed as relatively low yield producing districts dinajpur district including thakurgaon and panchagorh is under the old himalayan piedmont plain and tista meander floodplain which has mainly high to medium high land and a medium fertility level huq and shoaib 2013 and exists relatively cold weather which is suitable for wheat cultivation in these districts moreover the dinajpur district covers mostly by silty loam and clay loam which have a higher moisture holding capacity this moisture holding capacity might assist crops in producing relatively better yields however nilphamari and kurigram districts are under active brahmaputra jamuna and tista floodplain which has medium high land and low land low fertility levels and all these characteristics are moderately suitable for wheat cultivation huq and shoaib brammer et al 2013 1988 however acceptable management practices including the production facilities of aez make lalmonirhat district the higher yield producing district for wheat as well 4 2 actual evapotranspiration of wheat the most precise and logical sebal algorithm was applied to estimate the eta lack of data to evaluate the result of sebal output a newly aboveground lysimeter has been designed and developed under this study sebal estimated average eta was somewhat under estimated in eta than that of lysimeter estimated eta of wheat though it showed plausible trends to validate the outcomes from the sebal algorithm an experimental lysimeter was employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics the results showed that the sebal generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the lysimeter method registering the highest correlation r2 0 99 and the rmse of the crop growing period was 0 16 mm d 1 i e etsebal having good accuracy with respect to observed etlysimeter a similar result was also observed by some other researchers asadi and kamran 2022 bala et al 2016 the sebal has been therefore useful for remote agricultural land where ground based data lysimeter data are not available for daily et estimation among the characteristics of aez of the rangpur division the dinajpur district covers mostly by silty loam and clay loam this type of soil has a higher moisture holding capacity which might let the crops have more eta on the other hand the panchagorh district covers mostly by loamy sand this type of soil has a lower moisture holding capacity which might let the crops have less eta rest of the districts covers by a silty loom which has a moderate holding capacity might let the crops moderate eta brammer et al 1988 similar results have been observed by grosso et al 2018 who showed that soil texture had been generally one of the main factors controlling the eta sebal estimated spatial distribution with higher values found in serviceable soil areas luxmoore and sharma 1984 showed the effect of the textural class of soil on eta depends on one of its properties i e pore space which is determined mainly primarily by its structure and grain size distribution ward et al 1995 observed that clay soils fine textured tend to exhibit higher porosity soil water storage and eta however they exhibit minor subsurface runoff and hydraulic conductivity compared to sandy soils coarse textured however the spatial eta patterns are the results of complex interactions between crops water table level soil texture salinity and climate inter annual variability air temperature radiation wind speed and humidity are the principal weather parameters that affect evapotranspiration factors such as low land fertility soil salinity limited fertilizer application presence of impenetrable or hard soil horizons and improper soil management can limit the development of crops and reduce eta other factors such as soil water content plant density and ground cover etc can affect assessing eta actual evapotranspiration is conditioned mainly by soil types and water deficit extent however too much waterlogging might limit water uptake by hindering respiration several studies have established this phenomenon which shows the correlation between actual evaporation and crop types it was found that climate factors contribute significant variation in the estimated evapotranspiration sanford and selnick 2013 however the high repetition rate of sebal measurements and their excellent agreement with point measurements are strong indications that a sebal approach is an effective tool for mapping a real time eta 4 3 water productivity of wheat we estimated the water productivity of wheat including its parameter namely yield and evapotranspiration we assessed the relationship between wheat yield to evapotranspiration and wp the y et relationship found in this study does not as straightforward r2 0 34 as often assumed similar results average r2 0 35 have been found while global wheat y et relationships were assessed by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the lesson learned here is that y eta function may only locally be valid and may not be used in macro scale planning of agricultural water management however the water productivity of wheat is found to be more correlated to yield 0 73 rather than evapotranspiration 0 34 of the wheat the y wp relationship found in this study is as straightforward as often assumed many researchers find similar relationships in their studies abdullaev and molden 2004 show water productivity is a function of crop yields and water management practices as such there are many means of increasing water productivity as outlined by molden et al 2003 ranging from field to basin level practices field practices such as tillage soil fertility and varieties influence water productivity hussain et al 2003 less water through changes in water management practices influence water productivity additionally there are important interactions between water management and farm practices more reliable supplies can lead to less risk for farmers and more investments in yield enhancing agronomic practices water management practices can be important in keeping yield levels high zwart bastiaanssen 2007 also found the water productivity of wheat is more correlated to yield in china india pakistan egypt the netherlands and california in these studies sebal was used to estimate et yield and wpet large differences exist in wp levels the highest values occur in the nile delta egypt 1 52 kg m 3 kings county usa 1 44 kg m 3 and oldambt the netherlands 1 39 kg m 3 the lowest average value was found in sindh province pakistan 0 54 kg m 3 water productions in pakistan are almost three times lower than in egypt they attributed this disparity of wp due to low yields and high et levels the correlation reveals that in all systems except sindh the differences in wp can be better explained by yield levels than by et the implication of this finding is that agronomical practices are more important for increasing crop water productivity than water management practices zhang et al 2005 found similar results that the cwp for winter wheat in fengqiu county in the hai basin increased three times with grain yield increasing to almost six times the yield during fifty years while water consumption increased by only 28 3 crop yield improved by 50 while annual et only increased slightly 12 from 1980 to 2002 resulting in significant cwp improvements in the past 20 years in the region zhenci xu et al 2019 demonstrated the irrigated agriculture s annual water footprint in the north china plain ncp increased from 53 billion m3 in 1986 78 billion m3 in 2010 all counties faced water scarcity during 1986 2010 even as the average crop water productivity increased from 0 90 kg m 3 to 1 94 kg m 3 there are 173 ncp counties suffering severe water scarcity but still producing signiﬁcant crop yields with a high water footprint the lesson learned based on the above mentioned discussion is that crop wp is a function of grain yields and water management practices and wp y functions are locally valid and could be used in macro scale planning of agricultural water management as well compared to the rest of the study area gaibandha and kurigram districts have lower land and water productivity wp could be improved with such under performed areas up to at least the highest water productivity level obtained in this research besides better agronomic practices technological improvements and adoption provide opportunities to reduce the gap between actual and attainable yield as well as water productivity where attainable yield is achieved in experimental fields this study identifies high performance hotspots in the northwestern part of bangladesh this could help local farmers water managers and policymakers to devise strategies to reduce productivity gaps and ensure future water productive food security by applying spatial wp information policymakers and investors can find out the gap in wp that exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps and where developments are still possible to improve water productive performance not only within districts but also within fields as well the former is essential due to obtaining a higher utilization of water resources under local environmental conditions spatial data itself although it cannot provide the underlying reasons for variations farm plots with excellent and poor management practices can be identified by it this information is essential for extension services dissemination and farmers help farmers teach programs since water productivity is more tightly coupled to yield than to eta increasing low yields seems the most straightforward solution to increase water productivity 5 conclusions this study estimates the present state of spatial water productivity of wheat in northwest bangladesh the wheat yield the numerator of wp map shows the variation in its range over the study area dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagorh districts have a higher yield of wheat suitable weather irrigation facilities and soil conditions might favor expected wheat yield the sebal algorithm estimated wheat eta denominator of wp shows the underestimation but is reasonable when compared with the newly designed and installed lysimeter estimated eta however plausible trends and seasonal eta values derived through sebal show satisfactory results among the study area the highest and lowest eta have been observed in dinajpur and panchagorh respectively might be mainly due to the variation in the moisture holding capacity of the soil there is variation in wp among the districts and scope for improvement panchagorh thakurgaon and dinajpur districts have the highest water productivity for wheat whereas gaibandha shows the minimum wp most of the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts and north eastern parts of dinajpur districts of the old himalayan piedmont plain and favorable weather conditions are suitable for wheat cultivation accordingly wheat wps are more in these districts than those of others in the entire study area mainly due to high yielding capacity greater dinajpur region is the highest water productive district whereas other districts specifically the gaibandha have the potential for increasing the wheat wp finally stakeholders policy and decision makers can use the notions of this study including other major crops globally to define priority areas set goals for improvement and justify the type of investment or

9001,water productivity wp a performance indicator defines if the agricultural production system uses the resources competently spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to knowing where a gap in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps where a crop production system performs well and where developments are still possible to enhance the water productive performance this study proposes to assess spatial wheat wp in drought prone northwestern bangladesh both primary and secondary data such as sentinel 2 msi landsat 8 oli satellite images actual evapotranspiration eta from lysimeter and wheat farmers field data over the study area were collected to accomplish this study the wheat cultivated fields were delineated first using sentinel 2 msi data during the 2018 wheat growing season wp parameters namely crop yield and eta were estimated using landsat 8 satellite data based on yield data from the farmer s field and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values generated from the same fields a linear regression model was developed this model was applied to obtain crop yield maps from the ndvi maps of the study area a remote sensing based well tested robust algorithm surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal was used to estimate eta using landsat 8 images and local ground information cloud free single date images corresponding to wheat growth stages such as initial development mid season and late season were used to estimate seasonal eta sebal estimated single date eta was validated by newly developed under this study lysimeter measured eta wheat maps were then masked to get crop specific yield and eta maps finally the wp maps of wheat were produced by the mathematical operation of the yield and eta raster maps the ndvi crop yield y models were calibrated and validated which shows an acceptable degree of dispersion between observed and estimated values thakurgaon and panchagorh districts second administrative tier are higher wheat yielding districts in the study area the average wheat yield of the study area was 3 51 t ha 1 which is close to the department of agricultural extension officially reported data in the case of the denominator eta of wp estimation results show that sebal estimated wheat eta on the image dates is close to eta estimated by the lysimeter the average seasonal eta for wheat is found as 253 mm the estimated highest and lowest eta demands are found in thakurgaon and panchagorh districts respectively the estimated wp of wheat ranged between 1 33 and 1 46 kg m 3 with an average of 1 39 kg m 3 among the eight study districts panchagorh and thakurgaon districts are the highest water productive whereas gaibandha and nilphamari show the minimum level of the wp among the y eta wp eta and wp y relationships wp y shows the highest correlation r2 0 73 as the higher wp observed mainly due to high yielding capacity besides suitable soil characteristics and weather conditions favor wheat wp in those areas this study identifies high performing bright and low performing hot spots of wp across the northwest of bangladesh finally stakeholders and decision makers can use the information to define priority areas set goals for improvement and justify the type of investment or measures for improving water productive agriculture in bangladesh keywords evapotranspiration lysimeter landsat 8 water productivity wheat yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world is facing twin challenges namely water stress and food security which are already pressing and are likely to grow in the future foley et al 2011 neither of these challenges can be addressed in isolation because crop production is the prime freshwater consumer and this water is a crucial resource in producing crops rosegrant et al 2009 producing more crops using a drop of water commonly known as water productivity could be a crucial strategy to address both challenges molden et al 2003 the concept of water productivity wp of the crop is based on producing more crops from the same water resources or producing the same amount of food from fewer water resources giordano et al 2021 water productivity a performance indicator defines if the agricultural production system uses the resources competently spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to knowing where a gap in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps where a crop production system performs well and where developments are still possible to enhance the water productive performance this information supports policymakers and investors guidelines to take action to improve the wp zwart et al 2010 the usage of crop wp as an agricultural performance indicator has increased over the decades this indicator is specified in the sustainable development goals sdgs which demand that agricultural productivity should be doubled by 2030 sgd2 3 and water use efficiency must be increased sdg6 4 substantially bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 given that water could be a limiting factor for crop production consequently measuring water productivity parameters mainly crop productivity and evapotranspiration eta assume critical importance water productivity is typically estimated by means of crop yield and evapotranspiration of the crops crop yield and crop specific evapotranspiration are essential to estimate at the field to global scales for optimizing crop water management and the potential needs of crops for best yields li et al 2013 nagore et al 2014 both these parameters of wp are usually estimated through conventional means e g field experiments or surveys currently satellite remote sensing techniques have been used to measure them even at the field level the use of spatial data to estimate these parameters is increasing due to effectiveness and extent if compared with in situ methods for example field water balances or ground measurements sadras et al 2015 relating ndvi generated from spatial data with harvestable yield is the utmost extensively used statistical model kogan et al 2013 skakun et al 2019 remote sensing technique can model and simulate the eta process abtew and melesse 2013 using developed algorithms such as sebs su 2002 sseb senay et al 2011 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 metric allen et al 2007 and tsb norman and becker 1995 bangladesh specifically the northwest region is facing water security primarily due to rapid population growth declining agricultural land and water and changing climate mainuddin and kirby 2015 less agricultural land and irrigation water will be available for future crop production besides this production must be increased in those limited resources under changing climate to feed the ever increasing growing population consequently providing food and water security to its population has been an important socio economic and administrative priority for the government of bangladesh mainuddin and kirby 2015 despite attaining self sufficiency in rice production the current practices of boro rice production use about 75 of irrigation water and cause declining in the groundwater which affects the environment significantly mainuddin et al 2020 recently the government of bangladesh gob has been discouraging to expand of the high water consuming boro rice dry winter season rice particularly in the climatic vulnerable northwestern region planning commission 2015 ahmad et al 2014 fahad et al 2018 accordingly other cereals like wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l could be then a better alternative to support the water productive food production particularly for the northwest region where about 60 wheat and 65 maize of the whole country are grown bbs 2018 these crops are essential emerging crops in bangladesh because of their high yield potential fewer water uses and economic profitability compared to rice ahmad et al 2014 consequently increasing the wp of these promising crops could be the crucial strategy to address both the aforesaid food and water security challenges brauman et al 2013 despite limited actions for upgrading agricultural water productivity the spatial information on crop wp is fundamental to know the answer to the questions i the status of the crop water productivity i e where are we ii the gaps in wp exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps i e what are the goals and iii the way forward i e how to achieve them however before starting to initiate increasing the wp of the crops it is essential to know the status of the spatial variability of productivity water use and wp of crops some recent studies have evaluated the crop wp to scale it at global and local scales the first benchmarking study at a global level was conducted by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 based on the compiled wp values for individual crops zwart et al 2010 assessed global wp for rainfed and irrigated wheat and maize as benchmarks for productivity analysis and performance based comparison in the context of the local scale some studies on the crop types peña arancibia et al 2021 siddiquee

district scale estimation for rice mainly some studies show district level eta information only excluding water productivity information therefore information on the spatial status of wp specifically for wheat production is the lack in this region benchmark information of the spatial wp is a prerequisite for initiating a program for improving existing wp consequently there are knowledge gaps in the information on field scale wheat wp which is essential to assess for improving the wp in satellite remote sensing the accumulated scientific knowledge among agricultural researchers and radiation physicists has progressed in the development of numerical systems to transform remotely sensed data into handy information such as crop types yields and evapotranspiration fluxes this study proposes ideas to generate spatial field level water productivity of wheat crops find out the drives to enhance the water productive performance and the way forward to achieve them as a case study in the northwest region of bangladesh to the best of our knowledge this is the first study aiming to estimate the benchmarking field level 30 m scale spatial wp of wheat in bangladesh our study attempts to provide insights into the actual status realistic goals and potentials of crop water productivity in bangladesh by utilizing satellite imagery landsat 8 and sentinel 2 in the context of evapotranspiration data availability a newly non weighing above ground lysimeters design and development is another innovation that would be helpful to validate the output of the sebal at the field scale moreover our developed wheat wp map provides the higher wp boundaries as target wp values and similarly lower boundaries where improvements are required to help decision makers understand the extent of improvements as well as the locations of poor and good practices among the studied districts finally the notions of this study including other major crops to define priority areas set goals for improvement and justify the type of investment or measures for improving water productive agriculture to ensure food security globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area for this research the rangpur division the northwestern region of bangladesh has been selected as the study area fig 1 this division bangladesh s 7th division was established on january 25 2010 and consists of eight districts second administrative tier panchagorh thakurgaon dinajpur lalmonirhat kurigram nilphamari rangpur and gaibandha the area of this division is about 16 320 km2 and is located between 25 20 and 26 37 n and 88 50 and 89 53 e this division is bordered on the north by the indian state of west bengal on the south by the joypurhat and bogura districts on the east by assam state and on the west by the indian state of west bengal among the 24 sub regions of the physiography the study area covers four major sub regions namely old himalayan piedmont plain tista floodplain old brahmaputra floodplain and barind tract thakurgaon district including parts of dinajpur and panchagarh is comprised of the old himalayan piedmont plain this land area is usually moderately sloping at the hill base including silty sediments deposited by watercourses this land consists of piedmont sands and gravels deposited as alluvial fans by the mahananda and karatoya rivers the drainage pattern of this area is broad smooth braided including irregular shaped edges cut across by many channels which branch out and reconnect frequently the geography is subjected to flood plains of the ganges and brahmaputra rivers thirty aezs identified in bangladesh are classified based on characteristics of soil physiography seasonal flooding depth and extent seasonal weather parameters crop season and growing period among the 30 aezs the rangpur division study area consists of eight aezs fig 1 the aezs of this region is identified based on four elements such as physiography soils land levels of flooding and agro climatology the croplands are fragmented and heterogeneous and soil fertility and organic matter vary significantly in this region the study area has the major cropping areas which is essential to the current food security achievement mainly for its dry winter season crop production this region alone produces about 35 60 and 65 of the boro rice wheat and maize respectively bbs 2018 this region uses 96 5 groundwater in irrigating boro rice shahid 2011 this overuse causes a reduction in groundwater levels which in turn leads to the shortage of irrigation and drinking water in particular regions the government of bangladesh has also given high priority to sustaining the uses of groundwater in irrigating boro rice in the study area hence other cereal crops such as wheat and maize become popular to cultivate in the winter season in this region 2 2 data both primary and secondary data such as the satellite imageries actual evapotranspiration eta from newly developed lysimeter and farmers field production data along with gps location over the study area were collected to accomplish this study 2 2 1 satellite data cloud free satellite imageries namely sentinel 2 msi and landsat 8 oli available during the wheat growing season 2018 were collected and used for this study sentinel 2 sensor data have been preferred to classify wheat in this study mainly due to high spatial 10 m and temporal resolution 5 days which are crucial in phenology based wheat area delineation this satellite 2 mission is an alliance of twin satellites namely sentinel 2a initiated 23 june 2015 and sentinel 2b initiated 7 march 2017 which makes it a higher revisiting time of 5 days with the same viewing angles the sentinel 2 sensors have 13 bands including visible band 2 3 and 4 red edge band 5 6 and 7 and near infrared band 8 and 8a part of the spectrum among them near infrared band 8 has 10 m near infrared nir band 8a has 20 m resolution whereas visible and red edge bands have 10 m and 20 m resolution respectively for this study cloud free time series sentinel 2 satellite images tile number t45rxj t45ryj t45rxk and t45ryk data dated 01 december 2017 26 december 2017 25 january 2018 09 february 2018 19 february 2018 and 07 march 2018 were downloaded free from usgs archives www earthexplorer usgs gov landsat 8 oli data was used to calculate yield and actual evapotranspiration eta for the study area because this data has the thermal infrared tir bands which along with others are essential for evapotranspiration estimation landsat 8 is an earth observation satellite eos launched on february 11 2013 it is the 8th satellite in the landsat program the 7th to reach orbit successfully originally it was called the landsat data continuity mission and is a collaboration between the united states geological survey usgs and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa landsat 8 satellite is a sun synchronous near polar orbit including 438 miles altitude inclined at 98 2 degrees and circles the earth every 99 min landsat 8 oli has a 16 day temporal resolution including equatorial overpass time 10 00 a m 15 min for this study landsat 8 oli data path 138 139 and row 42 dated 01 december 2017 25 december 2017 03 february 2018 and 06 march 2018 were downloaded from usgs archives www earthexplorer usgs gov to estimate wheat yield and seasonal evapotranspiration 2 2 2 lysimeter data to estimate the evapotranspiration data of wheat a simple non weighing drainage lysimeter was constructed and deployed in the research field of bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur four stages of the wheat growing period namely initial developing mid and late stages were considered to measure the respective evapotranspiration data from lysimeters which were used to evaluate the sebal based evapotranspiration of wheat 2 2 3 field survey data three field surveys were conducted for ground truth data collected on 21 december 2017 19 february 2018 and 21 march 2018 during the winter wheat growing season 2018 over the study area a hand held gps was used to collect wheat fields location as ground truth data sixty eight wheat fields were surveyed including the location and yield information of wheat over the study area 2 3 methodology zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 used crop water productivity which is defined as the crop yield over actual evapotranspiration eta in a crop season 1 wp kg m 3 crop yield kg ha 1 10 i sos eos et a mm the crop yield is defined as the harvestable yield and the eta is taken as the accumulated crop evapotranspiration from the start of the season sos to the end of the season eos the conversion factor 10 1 converts eta from mm to m3 ha 1 this applied methodology of wheat wp using remote sensing follows three steps such as delineating wheat fields and wheat wp through productivity and seasonal evapotranspiration the overall methodology is shown in the following fig 2 2 3 1 wheat area delineation a rule based crop classifying technique was applied to delineate wheat cultivated fields based on the ndvi based threshold values for this study available cloud free time series sentinel 2 satellite images data during the wheat growing season dated 01 december 2017 26 december 2017 25 january 2018 09 february 2018 19 february 2018 and 06 march 2018 coinciding with the six wheat phenological stages namely emergence shooting booting flowering grain development and maturity respectively were used twelve wheat fields were selected from which spectral signatures on those images date were collected for determining ndvi based threshold values wheat crop fields were delineated using sentinel 2 image data from time series threshold values of ndvi of wheat in this knowledge based classification rules include wheat and non wheat and the condition includes the threshold of the vegetation indices vis first a single date wheat crop was delineated using the knowledge based classifier all the six single date images were classified by the rule based binary numbering classification system if the vis values are between the threshold values the classifier counts binary 1 i e wheat pixels otherwise count binary 0 i e non wheat pixels finally all six single date wheat crop maps were combined using mathematical image operation for the phenology based final wheat map 2 3 2 estimation of spatial crop yield spatial crop productivity estimation through statistical regression models with remotely sensed data needs at best one variable which results from satellite sensors compared to vegetation indices which are a product of combining reflectance of different bands or individual bands are more relevant to crop biomass and can be directly used to compute vegetation conditions bannari et al 1995 several studies used a linear regression model to define the correlation between wheat yield and satellite derived ndvi in different areas of the world ren et al 2008 regressing mid season ndvi with harvestable productivity is one of the extensively used remotely sensed data based statistical models skakun et al 2019 wheat yield was produced in this study from landsat 8 oli products ndvi and harvestable yield collected from farmers fields productivity information on the wheat of the local farmers was collected through the 2017 2018 wheat growing rabi season through the two field surveys at each sample site the information on sowing and crop cutting time along with phenological stages were collected from the respective wheat farmers after screening collected samples 57 wheat yield field information were selected for development calibration of the yield map and its validation purposes these samples were used to calibrate an empirical regression model of yield with spectral information of landsat 8 oli product to cover the period of optimum ndvi of the crop two clear image attainment dates 12 february and 28 february were selected for this study therefore the relationships between ndvi and wheat yield were observed on those image attainment dates two landsat 8 scenes path 138 139 and row 42 were mosaicked to cover the entire study area the ndvis were derived using red and near infrared bands of the mosaic image ndvi information of wheat samples was extracted all images were processed with qgis 2 18 1 once the ndvis information was extracted and combined with yield data approximately 80 46 nos of samples were used to develop calibrate the empirical model and 20 11 nos samples were used to validate it the linear regression relationships were developed between wheat productivity dependent variable and ndvi independent variable applying a cropland mask improves the precision of crop productivity estimation becker reshef et al 2010 a mask with the wheat fields was applied to the calibrated yield map to get the final yield map of wheat the calibrated empirical model was applied to estimate average wheat yield which was further compared with the ofﬁcial yield data of the department of agricultural extension dae during the 2018 wheat growing season 2 3 3 estimation and evaluation of actual evapotranspiration eta surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is an optical image data processing model comprised of a set of computational steps to estimate eta based on energy interactions among land and atmosphere bastiaanssen et al 1998 this model deduces the surface heat fluxes evaporation and radiation using satellite data in the visible nir and tirs these remotely sensed parameters are taken from any suitable satellite sensor working in these wavelengths sebal algorithm has been applied so far for many case studies specifically in europe and asia including bangladesh and this algorithm is considered the most precise and logical method to estimate the eta at present in estimating spatial eta values several solar radiation parameters are needed to calculate cloud free landsat 8 oli tirs data with path 138 139 and row 42 were acquired on 01 december 2017 25 december 2017 03 february 2018 07 march 2018 and 23 march 2018 to calculate eta on those image acquisition dates one arc second resolution aster digital elevation model dem along with some reference weather parameters such as sunshine hours relative humidity maximum and minimum temperature and geographic location were used the following mathematical eqs 2 12 for building the sebal algorithm were used to calculate eta eta estimation from satellite data by sebal is subject to the thermodynamic balance among the subsurface laminar and atmospheric turbulent transport process this process is termed as land surface energy balance which is used to calculate the eta process at the vegetation surface eq 2 2 rn g h λet where rn denotes net radiation watt m 2 g denotes soil heat flux watt m 2 h denotes sensible heat flux watt m 2 and λet denotes latent heat flux rn was calculated by deducting total outgoing fluxes from total incoming fluxes using eq 3 allen et al 2011 3 rn 1 α rs rl rl 1 ε rl where rs denotes incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 α denotes broadband surface albedo dimensionless rl denotes incoming long wave radiation w m 2 rl denotes outgoing long wave radiation w m 2 and ε denotes surface emissivity dimensionless the rs was calculated using atmospheric transmissivity solar constant solar incidence angle and earth sun distance with atmospheric transmissivity and land surface reference temperature the rl was estimated using the stefan boltzmann equation modified the stefan boltzmann equation surface temperature and emissivity were used to compute rl sebal computes heat flux from soil g estimation based on the empirical eq 4 representing values near midday developed by waters et al 2002 4 g rn ts α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α2 1 0 98 ndvi4 g rn was computed and tested if ndvi 0 g rn then was assigned equal to 0 5 the consequential image was altered to soil heat flux g by multiplying g rn by rn waters et al 2002 land surface temperatures ts were calculated using the modified plank equation and selected cold and hot pixels from satellite image data on thermal radiance eq 5 5 t s k 2 ln ε k 1 r c 1 where rc signifies thermal radiation adjusted from the ground surface which was computed using the spectral radiance of band 6 according to coll et al 2009 ɛ denotes broad band surface emissivity which is the percentage of the thermal energy radiated by the surface to the thermal energy radiated by a blackbody at the same temperature k1 and k2 are constants for landsat images the sebal process utilizes the hot dry bare agricultural field and cold wet well irrigated fully covered crop surface pixels to fix boundary conditions for energy balance bastiaanssen et al 1998 sensible heat flux h is the rate of heat loss to the air by convection and conduction due to temperature gradients and was calculated from the following empirical eq 6 given by bastiaanssen et al 1998 6 h ρ cp dt rah where h denotes sensible heat flux cp denotes air specific heat 1 kj kg k ρ denotes air density kg m 3 dt is near surface temperature differences in k and rah denotes aerodynamic resistance to transport heat m s latent heat flux λet in w m2 is the rate of latent heat loss from the surface due to evapotranspiration the instantaneous et etinst was then computed in mm hr 1 using eq 7 and 8 7 λ et r n g h 8 et inst 3600 λ et λ where λ denoted latent heat of vaporization j kg and was calculated as eq 9 9 λ 2 501 t a 273 0 002361 where ta is the mean air temperature k based on the etinst and local weather data the reference evapotranspiration fraction etrf was calculated as follows eq 10 10 etrf etinst etr where etr is the reference et at the time of the image mm hr etrf is similar to the well known crop coefficient kc and is used to extrapolate et from the image time to 24 hour or longer periods finally sebal calculates daily 24 hour evapotranspiration et24 by supposing the instantaneous etrf computed above is the same as the 24 hour average and that evapotranspiration changes during the day while etrf remains relatively constant finally the et24 mm day was calculated using the eq 11 11 et24 etrf etr 24 where etr 24 denoted the total 24 hour et0 for the image day and was calculated using eq 12 12 et r 24 h 24 et r 24 the requirements of the sebal method to calculate the pixel wise evapotranspiration 16 spatial analyst models were buildup and applied with erdas imagine software for this study eta was estimated with the sebal model at different growing stages of wheat for the available cloud free image data the seasonal eta was then calculated based on the growth stages values of the crop table 1 the estimated eta from landsat 8 oli with sebal model was then validated with the eta estimated by the lysimeter in this case four growth stages namely the initial development mid and late stages of wheat were considered based on image availability first the daily eta of the image date coinciding with four growth stages was estimated using the sebal algorithm then each eta map was multiplied by the respective growing days number to get the seasonal eta of wheat newly designed and developed non weighing above ground lysimeters were set up in the experimental fields of bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur the height of the lysimeter is 38 cm and the radius is 18 cm a tinny layer of sand and small gravels are placed at the lowermost of the bucket and fill the bucket with soil the same soil collected from the experimental fields was used in the lysimeter so that the instrument could represent the soil character of the same study field drainage discharge and capture systems were designed to facilitate drainage from the lysimeter the tillage depth sowing date and seed rate usually used in fields condition were applied proportionally to the lysimeter the soil of the studied area is classified as a sandy clay loam usda classification with 55 sand 27 silt and 18 clay according to the actual field practice three rows of wheat seeds have been sown separately in a lysimeter a small plastic bucket was placed at the bottom of the lysimeter bucket during the irrigation and rainfall events to collect the percolated water fig 3 these experiments were replicated thrice traditional flooding irrigation was applied and monitored by measuring the quantity of water in a calibrated container before application the lysimeter was drained by gravity and percolated water was collected in the collection container placed just under the lysimeter and measured in the measuring cylinder regarding irrigation scheduling the farmers usually apply 3 4 irrigation at the different water sensitive stages of wheat during its growing season in bangladesh mustafa et al 2017 suggest four irrigation applications at the booting flowering crown root initiation and at flowering stage in the water scarcity region of bangladesh irrigation was then applied from 15 december 2017 16 march 2018 including four applications of the suggested stages of wheat growth finally eta was calculated from the water balance eq 13 to evaluate the eta estimated from sebal 13 p r et δs where p denotes precipitation r denotes stream flow and δs denotes storage changes in soil or the bedrock groundwater 2 3 4 estimation and mapping of water productivity originally eta maps and yields maps were available at 30 m resolutions whereas crop maps were at 10 m spatial resolution before further processing of these maps for wheat wp the crop map was rescaled to 30 m resolution the water productivity of wheat was estimated by the mathematical operation of raster maps of seasonal evapotranspiration and yield of wheat 3 results 3 1 delineate wheat cultivated fields the rule based classification algorithm delineated the wheat fields of the study area fig 4 the wheat maps show variations in the distribution of wheat cultivated fields over the study area the major wheat cultivated districts were thakurgaon and panchagorh districts whereas gaibandha and lalmonirhat were the less wheat cultivated districts the generated wheat map was validated through an accuracy assessment and comparison agreement the overall accuracy was 82 30 based on the ground truth data indicating satisfactory p 0 05 classification results table 2 the estimated rs based district wise area was further compared to the district wise area reported by the department of agricultural extension dae and showed a good comparison agreement fig 5 wheat cultivation in this region is especially favored by the long winter season that is usually unavailable in other parts of the country during the harvesting period of wheat the crop is privileged by clear sunshine and low humidity wheat requires diverse temperatures at the different phenological phases of the crops in general the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures are required at 3 5 5 5 c 20 25 c and 30 c respectively for the wheat growing period at temperatures below or above optimum the germination of the seed decreases slowly if the temperature exceeds 30 c at the maturity time and it leads to force maturity and yield loss wheat is accordingly cultivated mainly in dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagorh districts over the study area because all these factors favor thakurgaon and dinajpur to be dominated by wheat based cropping systems huq and shoaib 2013 3 2 estimation of the numerator of wp crop productivity wheat yields were estimated from landsat 8 oli image data and farmers field yield data over the study area the linear relationship on february 12 74 das and february 28 90 das shows the best fit among wheat productivity and ndvi p value 0 05 among the available clear images moreover this regression model on the image dates indicated an identical explanation of the wheat yield variation though both models estimate the yield similarly the anticipation of 16 days led to a select date of february 12 74 das including a relatively better correlation as well to the estimation of the yield of wheat fig 6 a in consequence using the landsat 8 image dated february 12 enable the assessment of wheat productivity 30 35 days in advance of harvest the yield model shows good agreement among the wheat productivity and ndvi was 75 eq 14 the coefficient of the linear regression model for the vegetation index r2 of 0 75 states that 75 of changes in the vegetation index are justified and the rest is influenced by other variables 14 wheat yield t ha 1 3 0321 ndvi 1 6573 ndvi related thoroughly to vegetation vigor can estimate crop productivity and monitor crop development from the early 1980 s tucker et al 1980 boken and shaykewich 2002 many researchers estimated crop productivity before harvesting and found similar results to this study mirasi et al 2019 evaluated sum ndvi values to estimate wheat grain yields using multi temporal landsat oli data and the best estimation of grain yields was obtained using the spectral landsat oli data for about 43 days before optimal harvesting operation time lopresti et al 2015 estimated wheat productivity four weeks before harvest relations among ndvi wheat productivity before harvest becker reshef et al 2010 reported wheat grain yields in an early estimation manner using ndvi values exactly 30 days before harvesting in buenos aires ren et al 2008 found a reasonable wheat productivity estimation from ndvi using modis data during the booting and heading stages the best correlation between ndvi wheat productivity coincided during the highest lai period which is achieved 10 15 days before anthesis fig 6 b shows the calibrated yield model i e the relationship between observed and estimated productivity from landsat ndvi dated 12 february and farmers yields while the calibrated yield model was validated the rmse value 247 kg ha 1 represents 7 32 of the observed average yields which shows an acceptable degree of dispersion between observed and estimated yield values becker reshef et al 2010 found similar results rmse 440 kg ha 1 while estimating wheat yield in ukraine kouadio et al 2012 estimated regional wheat yield from modis data with an rmse of 570 kg ha 1 representing about 7 of the mean of observed yields lopresti et al 2015 using remotely sensed data estimated the regional wheat yield with an rmse value of 582 kg ha 1 and an r2 of 0 53 in argentia the dispersion between observed and estimated yields could be attributed to some reasons using landsat 8 images the wheat yield has been estimated even six weeks before the harvest weather conditions and biotic adversities during march grain filling influence yield and thus the inference of ndvi from february could be changed becker reshef et al 2010 found that high values of ndvi at the peak of wheat growth were related to low yields due to a meteorological event before harvest finally a spatial wheat yield map is generated by applying this developed yield model eq 14 on landsat 8 images dated 12 february 2018 fig 7 the average estimated wheat yield was 3 51 ton ha 1 for the rangpur division mustafa et al 2017 found a 3 25 t ha 1 wheat yield in moderate soil fertility levels in dhaka bangladesh which are similar to this study s results the wheat yield map shows the variation in its range over the study area the highest wheat yields were estimated in thakurgaon 3 7 t ha 1 and dinajpur 3 65 t ha 1 districts whereas the lowest yields were estimated in kurigram 3 42 t ha 1 and gaibandha 3 3 t ha 1 districts if compared the district wise rs based estimated yields were well matched with the department of agricultural extension dae reported estimation though rs based estimation is relatively higher except for the panchagorh district fig 8 3 3 estimation of the denominator of wp actual evapotranspiration the denominator of wp i e actual evapotranspiration was estimated for wheat using a remotely sensed sebal algorithm a low cost above ground lysimeter was designed and developed under this study to estimate the wheat field eta which was used to validate sebal estimated spatial eta of wheat 3 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration using lysimeter table 3 depicts the values of field water balance to estimate the evapotranspiration of wheat under irrigation practices measured by the newly developed lysimeter during the 2017 2018 wheat growing season after completing seed germination the first irrigation was applied at 15 days the lysimeter received its final irrigation 100 days after seeding and wheat was harvested 12 days after the final irrigation total cumulative eta was measured as 276 4 mm three events of rainfall of 2 26 and 29 mm were recorded during 61 110 days after sowing which were not enough to meet up the eta so further watering was applied as supplemental irrigation the negative sign of the soil water storage values indicates that the water was depleted from the initial soil moisture which was utilized by the crop the positive sign defines that the soil retained more water compared to the initial condition table 3 3 3 2 estimation of actual evapotranspiration using sebal actual evapotranspiration from landsat 8 oli was quantified for irrigated wheat fields over the entire study area using the sebal procedure the eta was estimated daily at the four image acquisition dates from december 2017 to april 2018 on the available cloud free image acquisition dates sebal estimated average eta values in an experimental field were compared with lysimeter estimated eta it is observed that sebal was somewhat under estimated in eta than that of lysimeter estimated eta of wheat though it showed plausible trends regarding the accuracy of eta derived from the sebal fig 9 the result shows that during the initial developing mid and late stages total eta estimated both from sebal and lysimeter were 24 56 107 and 66 mm and 27 5 64 6 114 8 and 69 5 mm respectively the estimated seasonal eta of sebal and lysimeter were 253 mm and 276 4 mm respectively the differences in eta between the two methods might be due to the different data sources experimental fields etc however researchers also found they underestimated eta using sebal when compared with the ground based data shopan et al 2013 estimated eta by the sebal methods using modis data and found an underestimation of sebal estimated eta while compared with eta obtained from ground based measurements by the penman monteith method fig 10 shows the a changes in the actual daily and b seasonal evapotranspiration of wheat during the 2018 winter crop season wheat shows a low eta demand during the initial growth stage 01 december due to fragile canopy cover which could lower the eta in the developing stage 25 december eta demand increased due to the development of canopy covers and sizes during the mid stage 03 february the wheat reached its highest eta demand as this time is the highest canopy cover and heading filling stage which increases the eta demand during the late stages 07 march when the average wheat crop leaped to senescence the eta demand became decreasing over the study area all four daily eta maps during the growth stages of wheat were multiplied by their respective number of growing days respective stages to get the seasonal eta fig 10 shows the seasonal changes of the wheat eta over the study area the energy balance modeling results show that the district wise seasonal eta of wheat from 25 november through 16 march 110 days varied from 208 to 329 mm with an overall spatial average of 253 mm among the district wise distribution of seasonal eta during the 2018 crop season the average highest and lowest eta demand were estimated in thakurgaon and lalmonirhat 256 mm each and panchagorh 246 mm districts respectively whereas moderate eta was estimated in other districts a similar pattern of sebal based eta demand for wheat 240 mm was observed by zhang et al 2019 during the wheat growing season in the guanzhong plain china mustafa et al 2017 found 280 mm eta for fully irrigated wheat in bangladesh which is close to the observation of this study 3 4 estimation of crop water productivity based on the yield wp numerator and seasonal eta wp denominator the wp of wheat was calculated spatially fig 11 shows the map of wheat wp and their variations over the rangpur division the average wp ranges between 1 33 and 1 46 kg m 3 among the 8 study districts the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts are the highest water productive at as1 46 and 1 43 kg m 3 respectively for wheat whereas gaibandha and nilphamari show the minimum wheat wp as 1 33 and 1 35 kg m 3 respectively rest four districts dinajpur rangpur lalmonirhat and kurogram show medium water productivity 1 40 1 38 1 37 and 1 37 kg m 3 respectively the average wp for the entire rangpur division was 1 39 kg m 3 mustafa et al 2017 found 1 25 kg m 3 for fully irrigated wheat in bangladesh which was close to this study s results moreover these estimates fall between ranges of global estimation of wheat wp which varies from 0 6 to 1 7 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 among the relationships of yield y eta and wp this study shows that the y eta relationship is not as straightforward as often assumed r squared values are low as r2 0 34 fig 7 similar results have been found while global wheat y eta relationships have been assessed and the average was found to be as low as 0 35 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 however the y wp relation is found more correlated as often assumed the r squared value is high as r2 is 0 71 for wheat in this study the wp can be improved by increasing per unit area crop yield or decreasing actual crop evapotranspiration field experiments from previous such studies conﬁrm that using high yield cultivars improved crop water productivity and reduced water consumption zhenci et al 2019 xu and zhao 2001 zhang et al 2010 2005 on the other hand early in the wheat growth cycle the weather should be warm and moist later the weather should be sunny and dry all these are the factors that favor these areas as wheat based cropping systems nevertheless utmost of the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts and north eastern parts of dinajpur districts of the old himalayan piedmont plain having 58 high and 34 medium high land are suitable for wheat cultivation brammer et al 1988 huq and shoaib 2013 therefore the water productivity of wheat is more in these districts than those in others among the study districts a range of wp values for wheat exists which could be caused by the many factors that influence the soil plant water relationship the variation of the wp of locating the bright spots and hot spots is seen in fig 10 where the wp is above and below the average values respectively the poor wp values or hot spots apply to the fields where poor water management or farming practices may be detected easily for further improvement these maps prove that on farm practices could have a significant range of impacts on improving wp bright spots represent superior management practices applied by farmers to maximize the wp such maps can help decision makers and local farmers to determine the best agronomic practices including improved variety fertilizer irrigation scheduling and crop rotation to apply in low yielding fields to increase crop and water productivity ghorbanpour et al 2022 4 discussions we estimated the water productivity of wheat including its parameter namely productivity and evapotranspiration prior to the relationship of wheat yield to the evapotranspiration and wp 4 1 productivity of wheat accurate forecasts of wheat production are of vital importance to farmers production plans trade and import export plans however approximations of the productivity of wheat crops can be obtained even before harvesting using linear regression models based on vegetation indices and observations of the yield the yield estimated in this study may vary from the actual harvested yield due to weather variations insect pest infestation etc remote sensing sensors observe the yield indirectly based on the condition of instantaneous vegetative condition of cereals whose yield consists of storage organs which are very sensitive at critical growth stages to weather conditions consequently grain yield could be low even if above ground biomass is large yue et al 2021 reeves et al 2005 however forecasting wheat productivity using landsat 8 ndvi there are still about four six weeks to be harvested which imposes uncertainty on the actual productivity due to disease insect infestation lack of proper management etc lopresti et al 2015 the wheat yield map based on the regression models in this study shows the variation in its range over the study area due to various reasons wheat cultivation with its better yield in this region is especially favored by the long winter season that is usually unavailable in other parts of the country during the harvesting period of wheat the crop is privileged by clear sunshine and low humidity all these factors favor thakurgaon and dinajpur to be dominated by wheat based cropping systems huq and shoaib 2013 wheat is a crop from a cold environment it requires however diverse temperatures at the different phenological phases of the crops temperature requirements may somewhat differ from variety to variety during the germination period in general the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures are required at 3 5 5 5 c 20 25 c and 30 c respectively for the wheat growing period at temperatures below or above optimum the germination of the seed decreases slowly if the temperature exceeds 30 c at the maturity time and it leads to force maturity and yield loss district wise spatial variations in wheat yield were observed over the study area mainly due to land types soil fertility soil texture organic matter weather and management practices etc dinajpur was observed as a relatively better yield producing district whereas nilphamari and kurigram were observed as relatively low yield producing districts dinajpur district including thakurgaon and panchagorh is under the old himalayan piedmont plain and tista meander floodplain which has mainly high to medium high land and a medium fertility level huq and shoaib 2013 and exists relatively cold weather which is suitable for wheat cultivation in these districts moreover the dinajpur district covers mostly by silty loam and clay loam which have a higher moisture holding capacity this moisture holding capacity might assist crops in producing relatively better yields however nilphamari and kurigram districts are under active brahmaputra jamuna and tista floodplain which has medium high land and low land low fertility levels and all these characteristics are moderately suitable for wheat cultivation huq and shoaib brammer et al 2013 1988 however acceptable management practices including the production facilities of aez make lalmonirhat district the higher yield producing district for wheat as well 4 2 actual evapotranspiration of wheat the most precise and logical sebal algorithm was applied to estimate the eta lack of data to evaluate the result of sebal output a newly aboveground lysimeter has been designed and developed under this study sebal estimated average eta was somewhat under estimated in eta than that of lysimeter estimated eta of wheat though it showed plausible trends to validate the outcomes from the sebal algorithm an experimental lysimeter was employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics the results showed that the sebal generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the lysimeter method registering the highest correlation r2 0 99 and the rmse of the crop growing period was 0 16 mm d 1 i e etsebal having good accuracy with respect to observed etlysimeter a similar result was also observed by some other researchers asadi and kamran 2022 bala et al 2016 the sebal has been therefore useful for remote agricultural land where ground based data lysimeter data are not available for daily et estimation among the characteristics of aez of the rangpur division the dinajpur district covers mostly by silty loam and clay loam this type of soil has a higher moisture holding capacity which might let the crops have more eta on the other hand the panchagorh district covers mostly by loamy sand this type of soil has a lower moisture holding capacity which might let the crops have less eta rest of the districts covers by a silty loom which has a moderate holding capacity might let the crops moderate eta brammer et al 1988 similar results have been observed by grosso et al 2018 who showed that soil texture had been generally one of the main factors controlling the eta sebal estimated spatial distribution with higher values found in serviceable soil areas luxmoore and sharma 1984 showed the effect of the textural class of soil on eta depends on one of its properties i e pore space which is determined mainly primarily by its structure and grain size distribution ward et al 1995 observed that clay soils fine textured tend to exhibit higher porosity soil water storage and eta however they exhibit minor subsurface runoff and hydraulic conductivity compared to sandy soils coarse textured however the spatial eta patterns are the results of complex interactions between crops water table level soil texture salinity and climate inter annual variability air temperature radiation wind speed and humidity are the principal weather parameters that affect evapotranspiration factors such as low land fertility soil salinity limited fertilizer application presence of impenetrable or hard soil horizons and improper soil management can limit the development of crops and reduce eta other factors such as soil water content plant density and ground cover etc can affect assessing eta actual evapotranspiration is conditioned mainly by soil types and water deficit extent however too much waterlogging might limit water uptake by hindering respiration several studies have established this phenomenon which shows the correlation between actual evaporation and crop types it was found that climate factors contribute significant variation in the estimated evapotranspiration sanford and selnick 2013 however the high repetition rate of sebal measurements and their excellent agreement with point measurements are strong indications that a sebal approach is an effective tool for mapping a real time eta 4 3 water productivity of wheat we estimated the water productivity of wheat including its parameter namely yield and evapotranspiration we assessed the relationship between wheat yield to evapotranspiration and wp the y et relationship found in this study does not as straightforward r2 0 34 as often assumed similar results average r2 0 35 have been found while global wheat y et relationships were assessed by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the lesson learned here is that y eta function may only locally be valid and may not be used in macro scale planning of agricultural water management however the water productivity of wheat is found to be more correlated to yield 0 73 rather than evapotranspiration 0 34 of the wheat the y wp relationship found in this study is as straightforward as often assumed many researchers find similar relationships in their studies abdullaev and molden 2004 show water productivity is a function of crop yields and water management practices as such there are many means of increasing water productivity as outlined by molden et al 2003 ranging from field to basin level practices field practices such as tillage soil fertility and varieties influence water productivity hussain et al 2003 less water through changes in water management practices influence water productivity additionally there are important interactions between water management and farm practices more reliable supplies can lead to less risk for farmers and more investments in yield enhancing agronomic practices water management practices can be important in keeping yield levels high zwart bastiaanssen 2007 also found the water productivity of wheat is more correlated to yield in china india pakistan egypt the netherlands and california in these studies sebal was used to estimate et yield and wpet large differences exist in wp levels the highest values occur in the nile delta egypt 1 52 kg m 3 kings county usa 1 44 kg m 3 and oldambt the netherlands 1 39 kg m 3 the lowest average value was found in sindh province pakistan 0 54 kg m 3 water productions in pakistan are almost three times lower than in egypt they attributed this disparity of wp due to low yields and high et levels the correlation reveals that in all systems except sindh the differences in wp can be better explained by yield levels than by et the implication of this finding is that agronomical practices are more important for increasing crop water productivity than water management practices zhang et al 2005 found similar results that the cwp for winter wheat in fengqiu county in the hai basin increased three times with grain yield increasing to almost six times the yield during fifty years while water consumption increased by only 28 3 crop yield improved by 50 while annual et only increased slightly 12 from 1980 to 2002 resulting in significant cwp improvements in the past 20 years in the region zhenci xu et al 2019 demonstrated the irrigated agriculture s annual water footprint in the north china plain ncp increased from 53 billion m3 in 1986 78 billion m3 in 2010 all counties faced water scarcity during 1986 2010 even as the average crop water productivity increased from 0 90 kg m 3 to 1 94 kg m 3 there are 173 ncp counties suffering severe water scarcity but still producing signiﬁcant crop yields with a high water footprint the lesson learned based on the above mentioned discussion is that crop wp is a function of grain yields and water management practices and wp y functions are locally valid and could be used in macro scale planning of agricultural water management as well compared to the rest of the study area gaibandha and kurigram districts have lower land and water productivity wp could be improved with such under performed areas up to at least the highest water productivity level obtained in this research besides better agronomic practices technological improvements and adoption provide opportunities to reduce the gap between actual and attainable yield as well as water productivity where attainable yield is achieved in experimental fields this study identifies high performance hotspots in the northwestern part of bangladesh this could help local farmers water managers and policymakers to devise strategies to reduce productivity gaps and ensure future water productive food security by applying spatial wp information policymakers and investors can find out the gap in wp that exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps and where developments are still possible to improve water productive performance not only within districts but also within fields as well the former is essential due to obtaining a higher utilization of water resources under local environmental conditions spatial data itself although it cannot provide the underlying reasons for variations farm plots with excellent and poor management practices can be identified by it this information is essential for extension services dissemination and farmers help farmers teach programs since water productivity is more tightly coupled to yield than to eta increasing low yields seems the most straightforward solution to increase water productivity 5 conclusions this study estimates the present state of spatial water productivity of wheat in northwest bangladesh the wheat yield the numerator of wp map shows the variation in its range over the study area dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagorh districts have a higher yield of wheat suitable weather irrigation facilities and soil conditions might favor expected wheat yield the sebal algorithm estimated wheat eta denominator of wp shows the underestimation but is reasonable when compared with the newly designed and installed lysimeter estimated eta however plausible trends and seasonal eta values derived through sebal show satisfactory results among the study area the highest and lowest eta have been observed in dinajpur and panchagorh respectively might be mainly due to the variation in the moisture holding capacity of the soil there is variation in wp among the districts and scope for improvement panchagorh thakurgaon and dinajpur districts have the highest water productivity for wheat whereas gaibandha shows the minimum wp most of the panchagorh and thakurgaon districts and north eastern parts of dinajpur districts of the old himalayan piedmont plain and favorable weather conditions are suitable for wheat cultivation accordingly wheat wps are more in these districts than those of others in the entire study area mainly due to high yielding capacity greater dinajpur region is the highest water productive district whereas other districts specifically the gaibandha have the potential for increasing the wheat wp finally

9002,subsurface drainage systems are a dominant flow and nitrate transport pathway from fields to surface waters existing methods to estimate tile flow are either expensive complex or need diverse data types in this study a parsimonious statistical model was derived and validated for use to obtain estimates of annual tile flow at field scale 1 10 ha and catchment scale 200 1400 ha in tile drained minerogenic soils the model was developed from tile flow and precipitation data from 38 drainage stations distributed all over denmark firstly a significant linear relationship between tile flow and precipitation was derived r2 0 57 p 0 0001 the threshold value in the linear regression model 543 mm can be viewed as a value from where tile flow is initiated and the slope value 0 48 indicates that when the threshold value is reached precipitation is partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 secondly the developed model was evaluated at catchment scale in 14 smaller danish catchments and in more detail in a 15th catchment lillebæk the evaluation showed that the model was more accurate and precise at catchment scale than at field scale this difference might appear because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation among fields within a catchment is averaged when evaluating the mean of multiple fields at catchment scale thirdly the capability of the model to estimate transport of nitrate n from tile drains was evaluated in lillebæk at catchment scale and here the model performed satisfactorily against the measured transport of nitrate n nse 0 72 and pbias 20 we suggest that the model can be used to aid agricultural water management keywords subsurface drainage tile flow tile nitrate n transport linear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction diffuse losses of nitrate n n are the dominant pressure causing eutrophication and less than good ecological conditions in most european coastal waters kristensen et al 2018 riemann et al 2016 and in most coastal waters around the world diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2009 therefore many countries are struggling to reduce the diffuse n losses to water bodies as in e g europe where the eu member states are busy drafting river basin management plans rbmps under the eu water framework directive wfd to obtain good chemical and ecological quality in water bodies by 2027 union 2000 one of the main significant pressures on surface waters is nutrient losses from diffuse sources mostly agriculture kristensen et al 2018 currently many measures are used in the rbmps to meet the requirements for reductions of agricultural n losses including farm level nutrient planning manure and fertilizer standards and norms catch crops buffer strips etc kristensen et al 2018 however there is a growing need for use of a more targeted agricultural n regulation that requires a delineation of vulnerable or robust areas based on information about the dominant flow and n transport pathways in the landscape petersen et al 2021 in clayey till landscapes the dominant flow and transport pathway is subsurface drainage tile drains that bypasses the natural denitrification in groundwater rozemeijer et al 2010 thus it is essential to be able to assess the contribution of tile flow to the streamflow and n transport to total stream export at catchment scale to improve our targeted agricultural n regulation and reduce the n loading to marine waters carstensen et al 2020 petersen et al 2021 tile flow generation is a spatiotemporal variable controlled by a range of complex processes governed by the landscape climate and tile installation in denmark the need for tile drains for economical crop production is attributable to two factors kronvang et al 2013 1 the elevation of the field compared to the receiving surface water level elevation dependent tile drains and 2 the structure and properties of the soil soil dependent tile drains the elevation dependent tile drains are primarily fed by regionally infiltrated water and the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially schilling and zhang 2004 soil dependent tile drains on the other hand are fed by locally infiltrated water and the tile flow is either seasonal with low or no flow during summer and relatively high flow during winter king et al 2014 or ephemeral flow kleinman et al 2015 soil dependent tile drains are either systematically installed pipes in flat areas where tile depth and spacing depend on the permeability of the soil or strategically installed in local depressions where the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially in total around one third of the land area in denmark is tile drained olesen 2009 a range of field and modelling approaches have been used to assess tile flow generation at agricultural field scale 1 10 ha to catchment scale 200 1400 ha field approaches have included chemical and isotopic tracers monitoring of water flow with flow meters or weirs and water samples taken with automatic samplers cain et al 2022 carstensen et al 2019 grant et al 1996 schilling et al 2019 however measurements are costly to perform and cannot be implemented for larger areas such as entire catchments denmark has been the object of several process based modelling studies that represent stages in the development and refinement of state of the art simulation of tile flow using both coupled and uncoupled surface groundwater models these studies have been catchment studies aimed at matching observed tile flow and in some cases improving process understanding de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 however process based models need to be parameterised and calibrated to individual fields or catchments and require specific data rendering them time consuming and difficult to apply to ungauged and data poor catchments statistical models on the other hand require fewer parameters lower computational effort and less data previous work has demonstrated that hydrological time series and local management practices are useful in predicting the daily tile flow using statistical models kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 in denmark a variety of national topographic and soil data are available and these may potentially be useful for studying the applicability and scalability of the statistical models to larger areas and to different catchments a study training four statistical models on multiple years of data from 53 drainage stations distributed all over denmark found that precipitation was the dominant predictor variable among 25 topographic and soil related predictor variables motarjemi et al 2021 although methods capable of providing information about tile flow do exist they are most often either expensive complex or need diverse data types and a method capable of easily providing information about the tile flow contribution to the basin yield in catchments is therefore needed to aid agricultural water management in this study a parsimonious statistical model that can be used to obtain estimates of annual tile flow and n transport at field scale 1 10 ha to catchment scale 200 1400 ha in tile drained minerogenic soils in denmark from precipitation data was derived and validated to demonstrate the model s effectiveness it was applied to 14 smaller catchments 195 1397 ha from all over denmark furthermore we applied the model to a small catchment lillebæk 438 ha and its five monitored fields 1 10 ha in order to test its applicability at field to catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the statistical model was developed for 38 drainage stations in tile drained minerogenic soils distributed all over denmark fig 1 daily precipitation p was measured either at gauging stations or the nearest available meteorological station daily p values were corrected to the ground surface using the correction factors from allerup and madsen 1979 and then summed up to cover the full agrohydrological year from 1st april to 31st march tile flow q was monitored using either v notch weirs or magnetic flowmeters when utilising weirs the water level was monitored nearly continuously with pressure transducers allowing tile flow to be calculated for each v notch weir using the appropriate weir equation the calculated daily tile flow was summed to achieve an annual flow for the full agrohydrological year annual precipitation mm and tile flow mm were measured for a varying number of years during the period 1971 72 2016 17 some stations had only measured data for one year others up to 23 years for one station data on the annual tile flow were not available for two years due to absence of measurements in total the full dataset included 360 observations of annual tile flow and precipitation 2 2 statistical model the purpose of the statistical analysis was to elucidate the relationship between tile flow and precipitation to estimate an equation that can be used for predicting the annual tile flow from annual precipitation for ungauged soils standard least squares linear regression methods snedecor and cochran 1989 were used for estimating the parameters in the prediction model applying sas software the linear regression model was fitted using ordinary least squares methods and the data sets as described in steps 1 and 2 below before the parameters in the models were estimated all data where precipitation was less than 543 mm were omitted in the fit of the model 15 observations in total resulting in 345 observations the reason for this is that below 543 mm the recorded tile flows were close to zero or equal to zero and we assumed that the tile drains began to run above 543 mm precipitation model estimation and validation were carried out in two steps 1 the full data set was used to estimate the prediction equation 2 the full data set was split into two halves and a model was estimated for each half the 38 stations were enumerated from 1 to 38 and split into even and uneven numbered stations step 2 was used to evaluate the robustness of the model in step 1 moreover a mixed model snedecor and cochran 1989 with station number defined as a random factor was used to evaluate the variation in data among stations and in data among years within each station this method was applied using the model residuals to estimate the size of the two variance components and to evaluate whether they were of the same numerical order the model used for calculating the residuals was the model fitted in step 1 applying all the available data the mixed model was estimated using sas software 2 3 model application and evaluation 2 3 1 tile flow in 14 smaller danish catchments the utility of the model to estimate tile flow was evaluated in 14 smaller danish catchments with a size ranging between 195 and 1397 ha blue dots in fig 1 more than 90 of the agricultural land within the catchments is tile drained according to the danish national drain probability map møller et al 2018 and there are at least four years of daily streamflow data on the outlet stations daily streamflow data come from the national environmental monitoring programme novana run by the danish ministry of environment and food dce the annual precipitation within the catchments is based on dmi s danish meteorological institute 10 km x 10 km grid precipitation for agrohydrological years from 1st april to 31st march the annual tile flow is calculated as the difference between total streamflow and baseflow estimated using a baseflow separation programme wahl and wahl 1988 based on a modified version of the british institute of hydrology ih s method gustard et al 1992 parameters for the programme included a five day minimum flow period and a recession constant of 0 90 2 3 2 tile flow in lillebæk the lillebæk catchment 438 ha blue square fig 1 was evaluated in more detail lillebæk has been part of the danish agricultural catchment monitoring programme loop since 1989 this programme aims at monitoring the effects of the agricultural regulations on the aquatic environment with focus on nutrients such as nitrate n n and phosphorous p and harmful substances such as pesticides deelstra et al 2014 kronvang et al 2003 the monitoring programme provides long term time series of the water chemistry of soil pore water drainage water and shallow groundwater 6 m and stream water at different frequencies weekly to monthly as well as climate and hydrology stream discharge at daily frequency therefore this intensively monitored danish catchment is the best example catchment in denmark for evaluating our new statistical model for tile flow and n losses a model was estimated using the full data set excepting the five drainage stations in lillebæk this model was used to estimate tile flow for the stations in lillebæk and the model was used to evaluate the robustness of the model based on the full data set in step 1 above the annual precipitation for agrohydrological years in the period 1990 2018 was obtained by summing daily values of corrected precipitation from two long term rain gauges station 28460 during the period 1990 2010 and station 5461 from 2011 and onwards the mean annual precipitation was 795 mm cv 17 and the annual precipitation was lowest in 1995 96 431 mm and highest in 1994 95 1047 mm thus precipitation data are within the range of data used to derive the model and cover both dry and wet years 2 3 3 transport of nitrate n from tile drains in lillebæk 2 3 3 1 modelled transport the model developed without the five drainage stations in lillebæk was further used to estimate the contribution of tile nitrate n transport to stream total nitrate n export nitrate n concentrations in tile drainage water have been monitored at weekly intervals at the five drainage stations since 1989 nitrate n concentrations in soil pore water have also been monitored at weekly intervals since 1989 normally in 10 suctions cups installed at 1 m depth covering leaching from an area of approximately 300 m2 within the fields of the five drainage stations nitrate n concentrations in drainage water and soil pore water at 1 m depth have been proven not to differ significantly blicher mathiesen et al 2021 assuming that soil pore water concentrations are representative of drainage water concentrations at every tile drained field in lillebæk the total annual tile nitrate n transport was estimated as the sum of tile nitrate n transport from the individual fields nsim tile kg n ha 1 1 nsim tile n soil i qsim tile i where n soil and qsim tile are the model estimated annual soil pore water nitrate n concentrations mg l 1 and the estimated tile flow for field i using the developed tile drain model the annual soil water pore concentrations were estimated by dividing the annual nitrate n leaching kg n ha 1 by the annual soil water percolation at 1 m depth mm the annual nitrate n leaching and water percolation were estimated using the nles5 model børgesen et al 2022 and the daisy model hansen et al 2012 respectively 2 3 3 2 calculated transport nitrate n concentrations in stream water have been monitored 1 3 times monthly since 1989 at catchment outlets using grab sampling the daily transport of nitrate n is calculated based on the daily observed flow multiplied by linearly interpolated daily nitrate n concentrations between sampling dates kronvang and bruhn 1996 the annual transport of nitrate n from tile drains nobs tile kg n

annual stream total nitrate n export was estimated by dividing the sum of the daily nitrate n fluxes for an agrohydrological year n stream i q i kg n by the catchment area a ha 1 3 n total n stream i

was used to estimate the annual tile flow q i from annual precipitation p i and the prediction error of q i can be calculated as follows snedecor and cochran 1989 5 se q i rmse 1 1 345 p i mp p j mp 2 where rmse is the root mean squared error obtained from fitting the model 82 5 mm 345 is the total number of observations used to fit the model p i is the new precipitation value used in the prediction p j is the observed annual precipitation for observation j j 1 2 345 and mp is the mean value of measured precipitation in the full data set used to fit the model 864 mm summation is over 1 2 345 the principle of propagation of error can be used to calculate the prediction error of the mean value of a number of predictions in the following it is assumed that the fields i have a similar catchment area let q be the mean of n predicted estimates q i 6 q 1 n i 1 n q i all q i variables can be viewed as stochastic variables the variance of q can be calculated as 7 var q var 1 n i 1 n q i 1 n 2 i 1 n var q i 1 n 2 i 1 n se q i 2 here se q i is the prediction error of q i eq 5 this implies that the prediction error of q is 8 se q var q 1 n i 1 n se q i 2 to estimate ci95 for q se q is multiplied with the t distribution with 345 degrees of freedom and the 97 5 percentile in addition to the precision of the model estimated values relative to the corresponding measured values the accuracy of the model estimates was determined on the basis of graphical comparisons and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias statistics moriasi et al 2007 criteria for assessing the success of model results have been suggested including the following nse and pbias thresholds for satisfactory replication of measured values nse 0 5 and pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical model 3 1 1 model development and validation precipitation and tile flow showed a significant linear fit with an r2 value in the interval 0 57 0 62 and a relatively low standard error for the slope 0 0224 0 0358 mm table 1 the validation in steps 2 3 shows that the estimated models on subsets of the full data set yield within two times the standard errors of the intercept and slope estimates than the equation fitted on the full data set table 1 this shows that the estimates of the model based on the full dataset only change slightly using different subsets of data and that the tile flow can be estimated from the full data model with robustness the model fit for the model estimated from the full dataset is shown in fig 2 at 544 mm precipitation the tile flow is estimated to 19 mm using the model fitted from the full dataset thus there is a small discontinuity at 543 in that the tile flow is defined to be zero at 543 mm and below the 19 mm is slightly below the standard error of the estimate of the intercept of the model overall the mean annual precipitation ranged from 575 mm in sahl coefficient of variation cv 23 to 1229 mm in estrup cv 15 the mean annual tile flow was lowest in slæggerup 30 mm cv 108 and highest in estrup 436 mm cv 28 see table a 1 in appendix a for further details in a mixed model applied to the model residuals and where station number is considered a random factor the variance among stations is only slightly larger 4937 than the variation among residuals calculated for a given station 3609 the two variance components are approximately of the same size the variance among stations may be due to differences related to the landscape and the tile installation while the variance within stations among years may be due to the climate in addition to the variance among and within stations respectively some variance may be due to data errors in precipitation measurements tile flow measurements tile catchment delineation and exchange of groundwater across the catchment delineation estimated models from individual stations with more than seven observations are listed in table b 1 in appendix b 3 1 2 linking estimated model parameters to hydrological processes the threshold value of 543 mm in the model represents evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage needed to initiate tile flow initiation of tile flow in minerogenic soils may relate to 1 preferential flow through macropores once the root zone storage capacity is reached or 2 matrix flow once the groundwater potentiometric surface is above the tile depth the actual annual evapotranspiration in denmark is around 400 550 mm ringgaard et al 2012 of which the majority is evaporated between april october 350 500 mm therefore a net precipitation of around 50 200 mm is available for soil moisture storage during the period april october values of root zone storage capacity are around 60 160 mm for typical danish soils gregersen and knudsen 1981 where the root zone storage capacity depends on the type of soil and the rooting depth the threshold value for tile flow 543 mm in this study is significantly higher than the 449 mm reported by motarjemi et al 2021 however motarjemi et al 2021 used tile flow data from drainage stations in both minerogenic soils 38 stations and elevation dependent soils 15 stations in elevation dependent soils the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially and regionally infiltrated water is discharged thus a lower threshold value is expected moreover the slope value indicates that precipitation is partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 after the threshold value is exceeded the relation is linear indicating that the system is stable after soil moisture storage is full and evapotranspiration has been met the estimated slope in this study 0 48 is in the same range as the 0 46 reported by motarjemi et al 2021 but is considered superior because the statistical analysis in this study is solely based on drainage stations in minerogenic soils furthermore the estimated slope is in the same range as the 0 51 reported by king et al 2015 for poorly drained silt loam and very poorly drained clay loam in central ohio us but slightly lower than the 0 60 reported by schilling and jones 2019 for silty and loamy soils in north central iowa us 3 2 model application and evaluation 3 2 1 tile flow in 14 smaller danish catchments the developed model was applied to and evaluated for 14 smaller catchments compared with the recommended evaluation criteria by moriasi et al 2007 the nse values suggested satisfactory performance of the model for 8 out of the 14 smaller catchments while the pbias values suggested satisfactory performance of the model for 9 catchments table 2 the quick flow component is assumed to be tile flow only other fast flowing components such as surface runoff are ignored because it is expected that tile drainage will eliminate the possibility of surface runoff other than in periods with melting snow miller and lyon 2021 on the other hand tile flow may significantly increase the baseflow fraction blann et al 2009 frederiksen et al 2018 halford and mayer 2000 schilling and libra 2003 to precisely estimate other fast flowing components in quick flow and the tile flow component in baseflow respectively further research may be required such as process based modelling or water chemistry studies using water isotope or conservative tracers 3 2 2 tile flow in lillebæk the tile drain model was evaluated in more detail for the lillebæk catchment blue square in fig 1 the model matched the measured tile flow data well at catchment scale fig 3 except for the years 2010 11 and 2012 13 for which the estimated tile flow was significantly lower than the measured tile flow 46 and 56 mm the prediction error for the period given as a 95 confidence interval is around 16 mm moreover the model showed very good statistical performance at catchment scale nse 0 8 and pbias 4 3 see table 3 the model matched the measured tile flow at field scale except at l4st2 for the period from 2009 10 2018 19 for which the estimated tile flow was significantly lower than the corresponding measured value fig 3 the prediction error for the period given as a 95 confidence interval is around 162 mm compared with the performance of a coupled groundwater surface water model based on the mike she code for the lillebæk catchment hansen et al 2013 the developed tile drain model showed similar performance statistics values the model showed good statistical performance at tile drain station l4st4 nse 0 64 and pbias 6 1 while the performance was unsatisfactory at the other tile drain stations table 3 the model was more accurate and precise at catchment scale 200 1400 ha than at field scale 1 10 ha fig 3 this difference appears because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation expected at field scale is averaged when evaluating multiple fields at catchment scale to this end it is noticed in eq 8 that the prediction error decreases if the number of fields n increases for example if the annual precipitation is 875 mm the annual tile flow is predicted to be 179 mm and the prediction error given as a 95 confidence interval ci95 is calculated to be around 162 mm for one field 62 for five fields and 16 mm for 100 fields fig 4 3 2 3 transport of nitrate n from tile drains in lillebæk with a high degree of accuracy for the entire period fig 5 the model succeeded in estimating the calculated transport of nitrate n from tile drains in the lillebæk catchment when subtracting the baseflow nitrate n transport from the observed nitrate n export from the catchment however for a total of ten years the model estimated nitrate n transport from tile drains was higher than the calculated nitrate n transport ranges from 4 to 9 kg n ha 1 3 3 implication for modelling and managing agricultural nitrate n to achieve the goal of good ecological state of coastal waters as stated in the eu water framework directive denmark still needs to reduce the annual nitrate n load to coastal waters with 13 000 ton miljøministeriet 2021 as nitrate n loading from tile drains is transported directly to surface and coastal waters it is relevant to develop tools that can quantify the level of the direct nitrate n transport from tile drains as an important step to obtain cost effective mitigation measures in lillebæk 68 of the total stream nitrate n export was from tile transport during the period 1991 92 2016 17 nitrate n retention in surface waters is in general at a lower level than nitrate n retention during transport in anoxic aquifers blicher mathiesen et al 2014 mitigation measures such as controlled drainage intelligent buffer strips restoration of wetlands and constructed wetlands targeted to tile drain transport are for many catchments and farmers more relevant than reducing agricultural production by set aside or afforestation or lowering the nitrogen input or changing crop cover from winter cereals to spring cereals when catch crops are demanded however given the complexity of the rural landscape implementation of targeted mitigation measures is a difficult task because diffuse pollution varies considerably within and among catchments due to the complex interactions between soil climate topography hydrology land use and management heathwaite et al 2005 in this context the developed statistical model is a strong tool that may help to quantify the importance of tile drains for the water and nitrate n transport in catchments however the applicability of the model is limited by lack of access to suitable data precipitation data are available for most areas information on the location of drained areas on the other hand is uncertain and different sources might suggest different things in this study the drain probability map of møller et al 2018 was used as in most danish studies to locate drained areas other general applicable methods are ground penetrating radar allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 aerial photos northcott et al 2000 verma et al 1996 and statistical approaches hirt et al 2005 moreover the model in this study requires estimates of tile drainage water nitrate n concentrations to estimate the tile nitrate n transport assuming that soil pore water concentrations are representative of drainage water concentrations we used nles5 and daisy models to estimate soil pore water concentrations a national scale hectare resolution data set exists for denmark 4 conclusions the main objective of this study was to develop a parsimonious statistical model for predicting the annual contribution of tile drains to catchment discharge and nitrate n export from precipitation data a linear regression equation was applied to a dataset containing measured tile flow and precipitation the model was trained on multiple years of data from 38 drainage stations in tile drained minerogenic soils distributed all over denmark a mixed model was used to analyse the variation in data among stations and in data among years within each station we derived a significant linear relationship between annual tile flow and annual precipitation r2 0 57 p 0 0001 the precipitation explained 57 of the variance in tile flow while the remaining variance was due to the natural spatiotemporal variability in tile flow generation and the potential error in data the x intercept of the linear equation 543 mm was interpreted as a threshold value for evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage needed to initiate tile flow and the slope value 0 48 indicated that precipitation was partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 after the threshold value was exceeded the model provided more accurate and precise estimates of tile flow at catchment scale 200 1400 ha than at field scale 1 10 ha this was because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation expected at field scale was averaged out when looking at the mean of multiple fields at catchment scale the model succeeded in estimating the calculated transport of nitrate n from tile drains at catchment scale in the lillebæk catchment instead of expensive field methods complex process based models and statistical models requiring various data types a parsimonious statistical model with an easily understood intuitive appeal based on precipitation data could function as a strong predictive tool to quantify tile flow and nitrate n export and to understand the hydrological processes in this study we aimed at incorporating the most important predictor variable precipitation for tile flow generation however we believe that a future study should use more predictor variables such as landscape characteristics to better explain the spatial variation in tile flow generation thereby providing higher modelling accuracy and precision declaration of

9002,subsurface drainage systems are a dominant flow and nitrate transport pathway from fields to surface waters existing methods to estimate tile flow are either expensive complex or need diverse data types in this study a parsimonious statistical model was derived and validated for use to obtain estimates of annual tile flow at field scale 1 10 ha and catchment scale 200 1400 ha in tile drained minerogenic soils the model was developed from tile flow and precipitation data from 38 drainage stations distributed all over denmark firstly a significant linear relationship between tile flow and precipitation was derived r2 0 57 p 0 0001 the threshold value in the linear regression model 543 mm can be viewed as a value from where tile flow is initiated and the slope value 0 48 indicates that when the threshold value is reached precipitation is partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 secondly the developed model was evaluated at catchment scale in 14 smaller danish catchments and in more detail in a 15th catchment lillebæk the evaluation showed that the model was more accurate and precise at catchment scale than at field scale this difference might appear because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation among fields within a catchment is averaged when evaluating the mean of multiple fields at catchment scale thirdly the capability of the model to estimate transport of nitrate n from tile drains was evaluated in lillebæk at catchment scale and here the model performed satisfactorily against the measured transport of nitrate n nse 0 72 and pbias 20 we suggest that the model can be used to aid agricultural water management keywords subsurface drainage tile flow tile nitrate n transport linear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction diffuse losses of nitrate n n are the dominant pressure causing eutrophication and less than good ecological conditions in most european coastal waters kristensen et al 2018 riemann et al 2016 and in most coastal waters around the world diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2009 therefore many countries are struggling to reduce the diffuse n losses to water bodies as in e g europe where the eu member states are busy drafting river basin management plans rbmps under the eu water framework directive wfd to obtain good chemical and ecological quality in water bodies by 2027 union 2000 one of the main significant pressures on surface waters is nutrient losses from diffuse sources mostly agriculture kristensen et al 2018 currently many measures are used in the rbmps to meet the requirements for reductions of agricultural n losses including farm level nutrient planning manure and fertilizer standards and norms catch crops buffer strips etc kristensen et al 2018 however there is a growing need for use of a more targeted agricultural n regulation that requires a delineation of vulnerable or robust areas based on information about the dominant flow and n transport pathways in the landscape petersen et al 2021 in clayey till landscapes the dominant flow and transport pathway is subsurface drainage tile drains that bypasses the natural denitrification in groundwater rozemeijer et al 2010 thus it is essential to be able to assess the contribution of tile flow to the streamflow and n transport to total stream export at catchment scale to improve our targeted agricultural n regulation and reduce the n loading to marine waters carstensen et al 2020 petersen et al 2021 tile flow generation is a spatiotemporal variable controlled by a range of complex processes governed by the landscape climate and tile installation in denmark the need for tile drains for economical crop production is attributable to two factors kronvang et al 2013 1 the elevation of the field compared to the receiving surface water level elevation dependent tile drains and 2 the structure and properties of the soil soil dependent tile drains the elevation dependent tile drains are primarily fed by regionally infiltrated water and the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially schilling and zhang 2004 soil dependent tile drains on the other hand are fed by locally infiltrated water and the tile flow is either seasonal with low or no flow during summer and relatively high flow during winter king et al 2014 or ephemeral flow kleinman et al 2015 soil dependent tile drains are either systematically installed pipes in flat areas where tile depth and spacing depend on the permeability of the soil or strategically installed in local depressions where the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially in total around one third of the land area in denmark is tile drained olesen 2009 a range of field and modelling approaches have been used to assess tile flow generation at agricultural field scale 1 10 ha to catchment scale 200 1400 ha field approaches have included chemical and isotopic tracers monitoring of water flow with flow meters or weirs and water samples taken with automatic samplers cain et al 2022 carstensen et al 2019 grant et al 1996 schilling et al 2019 however measurements are costly to perform and cannot be implemented for larger areas such as entire catchments denmark has been the object of several process based modelling studies that represent stages in the development and refinement of state of the art simulation of tile flow using both coupled and uncoupled surface groundwater models these studies have been catchment studies aimed at matching observed tile flow and in some cases improving process understanding de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 however process based models need to be parameterised and calibrated to individual fields or catchments and require specific data rendering them time consuming and difficult to apply to ungauged and data poor catchments statistical models on the other hand require fewer parameters lower computational effort and less data previous work has demonstrated that hydrological time series and local management practices are useful in predicting the daily tile flow using statistical models kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 in denmark a variety of national topographic and soil data are available and these may potentially be useful for studying the applicability and scalability of the statistical models to larger areas and to different catchments a study training four statistical models on multiple years of data from 53 drainage stations distributed all over denmark found that precipitation was the dominant predictor variable among 25 topographic and soil related predictor variables motarjemi et al 2021 although methods capable of providing information about tile flow do exist they are most often either expensive complex or need diverse data types and a method capable of easily providing information about the tile flow contribution to the basin yield in catchments is therefore needed to aid agricultural water management in this study a parsimonious statistical model that can be used to obtain estimates of annual tile flow and n transport at field scale 1 10 ha to catchment scale 200 1400 ha in tile drained minerogenic soils in denmark from precipitation data was derived and validated to demonstrate the model s effectiveness it was applied to 14 smaller catchments 195 1397 ha from all over denmark furthermore we applied the model to a small catchment lillebæk 438 ha and its five monitored fields 1 10 ha in order to test its applicability at field to catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the statistical model was developed for 38 drainage stations in tile drained minerogenic soils distributed all over denmark fig 1 daily precipitation p was measured either at gauging stations or the nearest available meteorological station daily p values were corrected to the ground surface using the correction factors from allerup and madsen 1979 and then summed up to cover the full agrohydrological year from 1st april to 31st march tile flow q was monitored using either v notch weirs or magnetic flowmeters when utilising weirs the water level was monitored nearly continuously with pressure transducers allowing tile flow to be calculated for each v notch weir using the appropriate weir equation the calculated daily tile flow was summed to achieve an annual flow for the full agrohydrological year annual precipitation mm and tile flow mm were measured for a varying number of years during the period 1971 72 2016 17 some stations had only measured data for one year others up to 23 years for one station data on the annual tile flow were not available for two years due to absence of measurements in total the full dataset included 360 observations of annual tile flow and precipitation 2 2 statistical model the purpose of the statistical analysis was to elucidate the relationship between tile flow and precipitation to estimate an equation that can be used for predicting the annual tile flow from annual precipitation for ungauged soils standard least squares linear regression methods snedecor and cochran 1989 were used for estimating the parameters in the prediction model applying sas software the linear regression model was fitted using ordinary least squares methods and the data sets as described in steps 1 and 2 below before the parameters in the models were estimated all data where precipitation was less than 543 mm were omitted in the fit of the model 15 observations in total resulting in 345 observations the reason for this is that below 543 mm the recorded tile flows were close to zero or equal to zero and we assumed that the tile drains began to run above 543 mm precipitation model estimation and validation were carried out in two steps 1 the full data set was used to estimate the prediction equation 2 the full data set was split into two halves and a model was estimated for each half the 38 stations were enumerated from 1 to 38 and split into even and uneven numbered stations step 2 was used to evaluate the robustness of the model in step 1 moreover a mixed model snedecor and cochran 1989 with station number defined as a random factor was used to evaluate the variation in data among stations and in data among years within each station this method was applied using the model residuals to estimate the size of the two variance components and to evaluate whether they were of the same numerical order the model used for calculating the residuals was the model fitted in step 1 applying all the available data the mixed model was estimated using sas software 2 3 model application and evaluation 2 3 1 tile flow in 14 smaller danish catchments the utility of the model to estimate tile flow was evaluated in 14 smaller danish catchments with a size ranging between 195 and 1397 ha blue dots in fig 1 more than 90 of the agricultural land within the catchments is tile drained according to the danish national drain probability map møller et al 2018 and there are at least four years of daily streamflow data on the outlet stations daily streamflow data come from the national environmental monitoring programme novana run by the danish ministry of environment and food dce the annual precipitation within the catchments is based on dmi s danish meteorological institute 10 km x 10 km grid precipitation for agrohydrological years from 1st april to 31st march the annual tile flow is calculated as the difference between total streamflow and baseflow estimated using a baseflow separation programme wahl and wahl 1988 based on a modified version of the british institute of hydrology ih s method gustard et al 1992 parameters for the programme included a five day minimum flow period and a recession constant of 0 90 2 3 2 tile flow in lillebæk the lillebæk catchment 438 ha blue square fig 1 was evaluated in more detail lillebæk has been part of the danish agricultural catchment monitoring programme loop since 1989 this programme aims at monitoring the effects of the agricultural regulations on the aquatic environment with focus on nutrients such as nitrate n n and phosphorous p and harmful substances such as pesticides deelstra et al 2014 kronvang et al 2003 the monitoring programme provides long term time series of the water chemistry of soil pore water drainage water and shallow groundwater 6 m and stream water at different frequencies weekly to monthly as well as climate and hydrology stream discharge at daily frequency therefore this intensively monitored danish catchment is the best example catchment in denmark for evaluating our new statistical model for tile flow and n losses a model was estimated using the full data set excepting the five drainage stations in lillebæk this model was used to estimate tile flow for the stations in lillebæk and the model was used to evaluate the robustness of the model based on the full data set in step 1 above the annual precipitation for agrohydrological years in the period 1990 2018 was obtained by summing daily values of corrected precipitation from two long term rain gauges station 28460 during the period 1990 2010 and station 5461 from 2011 and onwards the mean annual precipitation was 795 mm cv 17 and the annual precipitation was lowest in 1995 96 431 mm and highest in 1994 95 1047 mm thus precipitation data are within the range of data used to derive the model and cover both dry and wet years 2 3 3 transport of nitrate n from tile drains in lillebæk 2 3 3 1 modelled transport the model developed without the five drainage stations in lillebæk was further used to estimate the contribution of tile nitrate n transport to stream total nitrate n export nitrate n concentrations in tile drainage water have been monitored at weekly intervals at the five drainage stations since 1989 nitrate n concentrations in soil pore water have also been monitored at weekly intervals since 1989 normally in 10 suctions cups installed at 1 m depth covering leaching from an area of approximately 300 m2 within the fields of the five drainage stations nitrate n concentrations in drainage water and soil pore water at 1 m depth have been proven not to differ significantly blicher mathiesen et al 2021 assuming that soil pore water concentrations are representative of drainage water concentrations at every tile drained field in lillebæk the total annual tile nitrate n transport was estimated as the sum of tile nitrate n transport from the individual fields nsim tile kg n ha 1 1 nsim tile n soil i qsim tile i where n soil and qsim tile are the model estimated annual soil pore water nitrate n concentrations mg l 1 and the estimated tile flow for field i using the developed tile drain model the annual soil water pore concentrations were estimated by dividing the annual nitrate n leaching kg n ha 1 by the annual soil water percolation at 1 m depth mm the annual nitrate n leaching and water percolation were estimated using the nles5 model børgesen et al 2022 and the daisy model hansen et al 2012 respectively 2 3 3 2 calculated transport nitrate n concentrations in stream water have been monitored 1 3 times monthly since 1989 at catchment outlets using grab sampling the daily transport of nitrate n is calculated based on the daily observed flow multiplied by linearly interpolated daily nitrate n concentrations between sampling dates kronvang and bruhn 1996 the annual transport of nitrate n from tile drains nobs tile kg n ha 1 was calculated as the difference between the annual stream total nitrate n export n total kg n ha 1 and the annual nitrate n transport via baseflow n bf kg n ha 1 2 nobs tile n total n bf the annual stream total nitrate n export was estimated by dividing the sum of the daily nitrate n fluxes for an agrohydrological year n stream i q i kg n by the catchment area a ha 1 3 n total n stream i q i a where n stream i and q i are the nitrate n concentration in the stream mg l 1 and the total volume of discharge l of the ith day of a year unmeasured n stream i was estimated by using linear interpolation the annual nitrate n transport via baseflow was estimated by dividing the annual nitrate n fluxes via baseflow for an agrohydrological year bf j n bf j kg n by the catchment area a ha 1 4 n bf bf j n bf j a where bf j and n bf j are the annual baseflow discharge l and the baseflow nitrate n concentrations mg l 1 for the agrohydrological year j baseflow nitrate n concentrations were the flow weighted averages of the nitrate n concentrations of the five lowest discharge points in a single year normally the late summer period 2 4 prediction error the model based on the full dataset was used to estimate the annual tile flow q i from annual precipitation p i and the prediction error of q i can be calculated as follows snedecor and cochran 1989 5 se q i rmse 1 1 345 p i mp p j mp 2 where rmse is the root mean squared error obtained from fitting the model 82 5 mm 345 is the total number of observations used to fit the model p i is the new precipitation value used in the prediction p j is the observed annual precipitation for observation j j 1 2 345 and mp is the mean value of measured precipitation in the full data set used to fit the model 864 mm summation is over 1 2 345 the principle of propagation of error can be used to calculate the prediction error of the mean value of a number of predictions in the following it is assumed that the fields i have a similar catchment area let q be the mean of n predicted estimates q i 6 q 1 n i 1 n q i all q i variables can be viewed as stochastic variables the variance of q can be calculated as 7 var q var 1 n i 1 n q i 1 n 2 i 1 n var q i 1 n 2 i 1 n se q i 2 here se q i is the prediction error of q i eq 5 this implies that the prediction error of q is 8 se q var q 1 n i 1 n se q i 2 to estimate ci95 for q se q is multiplied with the t distribution with 345 degrees of freedom and the 97 5 percentile in addition to the precision of the model estimated values relative to the corresponding measured values the accuracy of the model estimates was determined on the basis of graphical comparisons and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias statistics moriasi et al 2007 criteria for assessing the success of model results have been suggested including the following nse and pbias thresholds for satisfactory replication of measured values nse 0 5 and pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical model 3 1 1 model development and validation precipitation and tile flow showed a significant linear fit with an r2 value in the interval 0 57 0 62 and a relatively low standard error for the slope 0 0224 0 0358 mm table 1 the validation in steps 2 3 shows that the estimated models on subsets of the full data set yield within two times the standard errors of the intercept and slope estimates than the equation fitted on the full data set table 1 this shows that the estimates of the model based on the full dataset only change slightly using different subsets of data and that the tile flow can be estimated from the full data model with robustness the model fit for the model estimated from the full dataset is shown in fig 2 at 544 mm precipitation the tile flow is estimated to 19 mm using the model fitted from the full dataset thus there is a small discontinuity at 543 in that the tile flow is defined to be zero at 543 mm and below the 19 mm is slightly below the standard error of the estimate of the intercept of the model overall the mean annual precipitation ranged from 575 mm in sahl coefficient of variation cv 23 to 1229 mm in estrup cv 15 the mean annual tile flow was lowest in slæggerup 30 mm cv 108 and highest in estrup 436 mm cv 28 see table a 1 in appendix a for further details in a mixed model applied to the model residuals and where station number is considered a random factor the variance among stations is only slightly larger 4937 than the variation among residuals calculated for a given station 3609 the two variance components are approximately of the same size the variance among stations may be due to differences related to the landscape and the tile installation while the variance within stations among years may be due to the climate in addition to the variance among and within stations respectively some variance may be due to data errors in precipitation measurements tile flow measurements tile catchment delineation and exchange of groundwater across the catchment delineation estimated models from individual stations with more than seven observations are listed in table b 1 in appendix b 3 1 2 linking estimated model parameters to hydrological processes the threshold value of 543 mm in the model represents evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage needed to initiate tile flow initiation of tile flow in minerogenic soils may relate to 1 preferential flow through macropores once the root zone storage capacity is reached or 2 matrix flow once the groundwater potentiometric surface is above the tile depth the actual annual evapotranspiration in denmark is around 400 550 mm ringgaard et al 2012 of which the majority is evaporated between april october 350 500 mm therefore a net precipitation of around 50 200 mm is available for soil moisture storage during the period april october values of root zone storage capacity are around 60 160 mm for typical danish soils gregersen and knudsen 1981 where the root zone storage capacity depends on the type of soil and the rooting depth the threshold value for tile flow 543 mm in this study is significantly higher than the 449 mm reported by motarjemi et al 2021 however motarjemi et al 2021 used tile flow data from drainage stations in both minerogenic soils 38 stations and elevation dependent soils 15 stations in elevation dependent soils the groundwater potentiometric surface intersects the tile drains perennially and regionally infiltrated water is discharged thus a lower threshold value is expected moreover the slope value indicates that precipitation is partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 after the threshold value is exceeded the relation is linear indicating that the system is stable after soil moisture storage is full and evapotranspiration has been met the estimated slope in this study 0 48 is in the same range as the 0 46 reported by motarjemi et al 2021 but is considered superior because the statistical analysis in this study is solely based on drainage stations in minerogenic soils furthermore the estimated slope is in the same range as the 0 51 reported by king et al 2015 for poorly drained silt loam and very poorly drained clay loam in central ohio us but slightly lower than the 0 60 reported by schilling and jones 2019 for silty and loamy soils in north central iowa us 3 2 model application and evaluation 3 2 1 tile flow in 14 smaller danish catchments the developed model was applied to and evaluated for 14 smaller catchments compared with the recommended evaluation criteria by moriasi et al 2007 the nse values suggested satisfactory performance of the model for 8 out of the 14 smaller catchments while the pbias values suggested satisfactory performance of the model for 9 catchments table 2 the quick flow component is assumed to be tile flow only other fast flowing components such as surface runoff are ignored because it is expected that tile drainage will eliminate the possibility of surface runoff other than in periods with melting snow miller and lyon 2021 on the other hand tile flow may significantly increase the baseflow fraction blann et al 2009 frederiksen et al 2018 halford and mayer 2000 schilling and libra 2003 to precisely estimate other fast flowing components in quick flow and the tile flow component in baseflow respectively further research may be required such as process based modelling or water chemistry studies using water isotope or conservative tracers 3 2 2 tile flow in lillebæk the tile drain model was evaluated in more detail for the lillebæk catchment blue square in fig 1 the model matched the measured tile flow data well at catchment scale fig 3 except for the years 2010 11 and 2012 13 for which the estimated tile flow was significantly lower than the measured tile flow 46 and 56 mm the prediction error for the period given as a 95 confidence interval is around 16 mm moreover the model showed very good statistical performance at catchment scale nse 0 8 and pbias 4 3 see table 3 the model matched the measured tile flow at field scale except at l4st2 for the period from 2009 10 2018 19 for which the estimated tile flow was significantly lower than the corresponding measured value fig 3 the prediction error for the period given as a 95 confidence interval is around 162 mm compared with the performance of a coupled groundwater surface water model based on the mike she code for the lillebæk catchment hansen et al 2013 the developed tile drain model showed similar performance statistics values the model showed good statistical performance at tile drain station l4st4 nse 0 64 and pbias 6 1 while the performance was unsatisfactory at the other tile drain stations table 3 the model was more accurate and precise at catchment scale 200 1400 ha than at field scale 1 10 ha fig 3 this difference appears because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation expected at field scale is averaged when evaluating multiple fields at catchment scale to this end it is noticed in eq 8 that the prediction error decreases if the number of fields n increases for example if the annual precipitation is 875 mm the annual tile flow is predicted to be 179 mm and the prediction error given as a 95 confidence interval ci95 is calculated to be around 162 mm for one field 62 for five fields and 16 mm for 100 fields fig 4 3 2 3 transport of nitrate n from tile drains in lillebæk with a high degree of accuracy for the entire period fig 5 the model succeeded in estimating the calculated transport of nitrate n from tile drains in the lillebæk catchment when subtracting the baseflow nitrate n transport from the observed nitrate n export from the catchment however for a total of ten years the model estimated nitrate n transport from tile drains was higher than the calculated nitrate n transport ranges from 4 to 9 kg n ha 1 3 3 implication for modelling and managing agricultural nitrate n to achieve the goal of good ecological state of coastal waters as stated in the eu water framework directive denmark still needs to reduce the annual nitrate n load to coastal waters with 13 000 ton miljøministeriet 2021 as nitrate n loading from tile drains is transported directly to surface and coastal waters it is relevant to develop tools that can quantify the level of the direct nitrate n transport from tile drains as an important step to obtain cost effective mitigation measures in lillebæk 68 of the total stream nitrate n export was from tile transport during the period 1991 92 2016 17 nitrate n retention in surface waters is in general at a lower level than nitrate n retention during transport in anoxic aquifers blicher mathiesen et al 2014 mitigation measures such as controlled drainage intelligent buffer strips restoration of wetlands and constructed wetlands targeted to tile drain transport are for many catchments and farmers more relevant than reducing agricultural production by set aside or afforestation or lowering the nitrogen input or changing crop cover from winter cereals to spring cereals when catch crops are demanded however given the complexity of the rural landscape implementation of targeted mitigation measures is a difficult task because diffuse pollution varies considerably within and among catchments due to the complex interactions between soil climate topography hydrology land use and management heathwaite et al 2005 in this context the developed statistical model is a strong tool that may help to quantify the importance of tile drains for the water and nitrate n transport in catchments however the applicability of the model is limited by lack of access to suitable data precipitation data are available for most areas information on the location of drained areas on the other hand is uncertain and different sources might suggest different things in this study the drain probability map of møller et al 2018 was used as in most danish studies to locate drained areas other general applicable methods are ground penetrating radar allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 aerial photos northcott et al 2000 verma et al 1996 and statistical approaches hirt et al 2005 moreover the model in this study requires estimates of tile drainage water nitrate n concentrations to estimate the tile nitrate n transport assuming that soil pore water concentrations are representative of drainage water concentrations we used nles5 and daisy models to estimate soil pore water concentrations a national scale hectare resolution data set exists for denmark 4 conclusions the main objective of this study was to develop a parsimonious statistical model for predicting the annual contribution of tile drains to catchment discharge and nitrate n export from precipitation data a linear regression equation was applied to a dataset containing measured tile flow and precipitation the model was trained on multiple years of data from 38 drainage stations in tile drained minerogenic soils distributed all over denmark a mixed model was used to analyse the variation in data among stations and in data among years within each station we derived a significant linear relationship between annual tile flow and annual precipitation r2 0 57 p 0 0001 the precipitation explained 57 of the variance in tile flow while the remaining variance was due to the natural spatiotemporal variability in tile flow generation and the potential error in data the x intercept of the linear equation 543 mm was interpreted as a threshold value for evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage needed to initiate tile flow and the slope value 0 48 indicated that precipitation was partitioned into recharge 52 and tile flow 48 after the threshold value was exceeded the model provided more accurate and precise estimates of tile flow at catchment scale 200 1400 ha than at field scale 1 10 ha this was because the natural spatial variability in tile flow generation expected at field scale was averaged out when looking at the mean of multiple fields at catchment scale the model succeeded in estimating the calculated transport of nitrate n from tile drains at catchment scale in the lillebæk catchment instead of expensive field methods complex process based models and statistical models requiring various data types a parsimonious statistical model with an easily understood intuitive appeal based on precipitation data could function as a strong predictive tool to quantify tile flow and nitrate n export and to understand the hydrological processes in this study we aimed at incorporating the most important predictor variable precipitation for tile flow generation however we believe that a future study should use more predictor variables such as landscape characteristics to better explain the spatial variation in tile flow generation thereby providing higher modelling accuracy and precision declaration of

following two strategies 1 a control treatment ctl irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration and 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi ψtrunk ψstem and mds were directly influenced by soil water content and atmospheric demand mds was able to detect water stress in di trees the earliest however variability was high and it was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between irrigation treatments at the end of the season mds had a maximum value of 300 µm ψstem 1 4 mpa on the other hand variation for midday ψstem and ψtrunk was low and both indicators were able to distinguish between irrigation strategies midday ψstem and ψtrunk had a strong linear relationship similar to the identity line r2 0 88 however when ψstem and ψtrunk were compared in the afternoon ψtrunk reported by microtensiometers was 0 7 mpa lower than ψstem measured by a pressure chamber the daily relationship between trunk diameter variations and ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers followed five different stages changes in trunk diameter were delayed relative to changes in ψtrunk the seasonal relationship between the mds and ψtrunk was strongly related at the start of deficit irrigation r2 0 63 but when the complete season was considered this relationship was weaker r2 0 44 moreover the low coefficient of variation and high sensitivity of the midday ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers supports the suitability of using them in automated irrigation systems to monitor tree water status in spite of their high dependence on environmental conditions this is one of the first studies that validates the use of microtensiometers to continuously monitor tree water status in fruit trees across two consecutive seasons under differing irrigation treatments keywords

introduction plant biosensors integrate soil water availability and atmospheric water demand across phenological stages jones 2008 fernández 2017 fernandes silva et al 2019 noun et al 2022 plant based sensors are preferred over soil moisture or atmosphere based measures or models stem water potential has been extensively identified as a sensitive measure to assess tree water status mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2000 suter et al 2019 over other indicators however despite being a standard measure it has always been a time consuming non automated method which has limited its use bellvert et al 2016 boini et al 2019 conesa et al 2019 stem water potential directly assesses water tension within the trunk by quantifying the pressure required to push sap through the petiole of a leaf that has stopped its transpiration by enclosing it in a plastic bag that is surrounded by aluminum foil and is in equilibrium with the trunk stem water potential has been traditionally measured with a pressure chamber and is a temporally discrete and destructive measurement scholander et al 1965 for these reasons there is interest in developing continuous plant based indicators that are as effective at measuring tree water status can be automated subjected to remote control and be part of an autonomous irrigation system steppe et al 2008 these approaches and sensors include those that monitor trunk diameter variations sap flow pereira et al 2007 conejero et al 2007 green et al 2009 leaf turgor pressure rüger et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2013 padilla díaz et al 2018 canopy temperature costa et al 2019 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 and stem water content mcdonald et al 2002 he et al 2021 these approaches are either a function of downstream effects from changes in stem water potential or suffer from high variability for measurements trunk diameter variations and indices derived from diurnal patterns have also been widely studied and reported to reflect tree water status ortuño et al 2010 these measurements are based on changes in the water content of extensible tissues of the trunk which cause variations in trunk diameter vieira et al 2022 trunk diameter measurements are recommended over fruit diameter for irrigation decisions maximum daily shrinkage mds is among the most frequently derived indices and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum diameter on the same day this is a sensitive indicator for detecting early water stress in mature fruit trees mirás avalos et al 2017 however in some cases when the stem water potential decreases below a specific threshold value mds values do not continue to increase and even a reduction in the mds values have been reported under severe water stress conditions girón et al 2016 blanco et al 2018 a common approach for validation is to compare sensor data with stem water potential measured with the pressure chamber microtensiometers directly measure trunk water potential in situ using microelectromechanical pressure sensors that are embedded into the trunk of the tree pagay et al 2014 this produces continuous water potential measurements which might help improve irrigation strategies based on tree water status garcía tejera et al 2021 the daily pattern of trunk water potential recorded by microtensiometers has been positively associated with stem water potential measured with a pressure chamber blanco and kalcsits 2021 in vines pagay 2022 also reported the diurnal patterns of trunk water potential from microtensiometers however both of these studies made comparisons across a short period of time while recently there is an increasing interest in assessing the microtensiometers as a tool for irrigation management lakso et al 2022 gonzalez et al 2022 there are few studies that examine trunk water potential measured by microtensiometers across whole seasons and compare its measurements with data acquired from established methods like a pressure chamber or trunk dendrometers to our knowledge this is the first study in which the trunk water potential is compared with the trunk diameter variations the aim of this study was to make long term comparisons of stem water potential values measured with either microtensiometers or with a pressure chamber and to compare stem water potential with mds for detecting early water stress in pear trees under controlled water limitations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2021 and 2022 at the washington state university experimental orchard located in rock island washington state usa 47 19 n 120 04 w the experimental plot 0 81 ha was d anjou pear pyrus communis l orchard grafted on ohxf 87 rootstock and trained on a central leader system at a tree density of 833 trees per hectare 2 67 4 5 m planted in 2007 the soil was a shallow sandy loam and trees were drip irrigated by a system consisting of a single drip line per tree row and five emitters per tree of 2 l h 1 discharge rate horticultural practices e g fertilization pruning and weed control were the same for all trees in the block and followed commercial regular practices full bloom was in april and harvest was in late august early september for both years 2 2 irrigation treatments two irrigation treatments were imposed 1 a control treatment ctl irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc to ensure non limiting soil water conditions during the complete season 2 a regulated deficit irrigation treatment di irrigated at 100 of etc from full bloom to early stage of

replicate two trees per replicate were selected for their uniformity average ground cover of 41 and mean trunk diameter of 10 5 0 23 cm for measurements 2 3 weather and soil monitoring hourly meteorological data were recorded by an agweathernet station located at the experimental orchard http www weather wsu edu sunrise station the variables measured were air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and solar radiation daily et0 was calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and air vapor pressure deficit vpd from air temperature and relative humidity moreover in order to consider the microclimate conditions within the pear orchard two temperature and relative humidity sensors atmos 14 meter group inc pullman wa usa were also installed in the orchard soil volumetric water content was measured at 0 25 and 0 50 m depth with two capacitance frequency domain sensors teros 11 meter group pullman wa usa per replicate the soil sensors were installed under the canopy and placed 0 25 m from the drip emitter 2 4 trunk stem and leaf water potential ψtrunk was recorded every 20 min in six trees per treatment two per replicate using microtensiometers connected to a solar powered data logger florapulse davis ca usa the microtensiometers were embedded into the trunk of the selected trees each year of study on the north side of the trunk away from direct sunlight the microtensiometers were not reinstalled nor left working in the same tree for two seasons each season new sensors were used in the same trees the daily range of the ψtrunk was calculated as the daily difference in ψtrunk between the maximum and minimum value recorded by the microtensiometers ψstem was manually measured with the scholander pressure chamber model 615d pms instrument company albany or usa at solar midday every 4 7 days in six healthy mature and shaded leaves located close to the trunk per treatment leaves were wrapped with black polyethylene plastic and covered with aluminum foil for at least 2 h prior to the measurements mccutchan and shackel 1992 moreover ψstem was measured in 2022 every 14 days with the pressure chamber in the afternoon 15 30 16 30 h solar time for the same trees where microtensiometers were installed to validate the relationship between the ψstem and ψtrunk midday leaf water potential ψleaf was measured every 14 days in six fully expanded mature leaves from branches in the lower half of the canopy per treatment in the same trees where microtensiometers were installed with the same scholander

ca usa 3 results 3 1 weather and soil water status the daily maximum air temperature ranged from 20 c in early june and mid september and 45 c in early july in 2021 and late july in 2022 fig 1 67 and 64 days out of the 105 days had maximum air temperature that exceeded 30 c in 2021 and 2022 respectively the minimum air temperature varied between 10 and 25 c the daily et0 and the vpd was highly variable during the season reaching maximum daily average values slightly higher in 2021 11 5 mm and 5 0 kpa doy 180 than in 2022 11 mm and 4 5 kpa doy 209 daily maximum photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was similar for both years peaking in late june at approximately 1900 µmol m 2 s 1 and decreasing below 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 by september volumetric soil water content in the ctl treatment from 0 25 to 0 50 m depth ranged between 0 27 and 0 37 m3 m 3 during both years of study in the di treatment soil water content strongly decreased once deficit irrigation started it was similar to the ctl in june 0 30 m3 m 3 and then decreased to values similar to 0 15 m3 m 3 at the end of the experiment for both years fig 1 the rate of decrease was faster in 2021 than 2022 where volumetric soil water content fell below 0 15 m3 m 3 by the end of july in 2021 and by the middle of august in 2022 3 2 trunk and stem water potential microtensiometers and pressure chamber ψtrunk continuously measured using microtensiometers clearly showed differences between irrigation treatments in both years of the study fig 2 daily minimum ψtrunk was often reached during the afternoon when atmospheric demand was the highest once deficit irrigation started daily minimum ψtrunk of di trees were lower than those of the ctl trees however the daily maximum values observed at sunrise were similar for both treatments when the evaporative demand increased 30 days after the start of deficit irrigation both the maximum and the minimum ψtrunk of the di trees were significantly lower than those from the ctl trees in 2022 both ctl and di trees had higher variability and range of daily measurements than in 2021 with minimum values in midsummer of 2021 for di trees of 2 0 mpa and in 2022 of 2 5 mpa daily mean ψtrunk was lower for di trees in 2021 than in 2022 following this pattern ψtrunk was below 1 0 mpa for 25 days in 2021 and 14 days in 2022 for di trees however there were more extreme negative ψtrunk observed in 2022 daily minimum ψtrunk values were below 2 0 mpa for 5 days in 2021 and for 31 days in 2022 fig 2 ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers at midday closely followed ψstem and ψleaf values measured with a pressure chamber at midday fig 3 midday ψstem for ctl trees under no soil water limitations were between 0 5 and 0 8 mpa with the lowest value of 1 0 mpa recorded in 2022 doy 209 by the pressure chamber and 1 2 mpa by the microtensiometers for di trees the lowest value of midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber and ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers was 1 5 mpa and was recorded from late july to mid august for both years however afterward midday ψstem and ψtrunk slowly increased to 1 0 mpa in 2021 while in 2022 similar values were observed several times until the end of the experiment ψstem and ψtrunk were sensitive water stress indicators and consistently differentiated between the two irrigation strategies imposed throughout the experiment ψstem measured by a pressure chamber was able to significantly distinguish differences between irrigation treatments two and one day earlier than the ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers in 2021 and 2022 respectively on the other hand ψleaf was not as sensitive as ψstem and ψtrunk although they all followed a similar trend ψleaf showed more variability and was not able to detect early water stress in di trees once the deficit was applied in 2022 ψstem from the pressure chamber was compared with ψtrunk from the microtensiometers during the afternoon differences between both indicators were greater in mid afternoon particularly for di trees ψtrunk values were approximately 34 lower than ψstem values these differences between both indicators were not observed at midday fig 4 there was a strong relationship between both at midday in both years of study r2 0 88 and were similar to the identity line 1 1 x y for the range of midday ψstem between 0 3 and 1 7 mpa on the other hand the relationship between both indicators in the afternoon was also strong but were different from the identity line with more negative values for the ψtrunk values recorded by the microtensiometers fig 4 when midday ψstem and ψtrunk were compared there were differences for 7 and 5 days out of 24 for ctl trees in 2021 and 2022 respectively despite having significant differences the variation between the mean values for each indicator was not higher than 0 5 mpa with more negative values of ψtrunk recorded by microtensiometers fig 3 3 3 trunk diameter as expected trunk diameter growth and daily fluctuations were different between treatments trunk diameter increased for ctl trees by 94 and 78 compared to di trees in 2021 and 2022 respectively however all the trees regardless of their irrigation treatment had greater growth in 2022 than in 2021 fig 5 moreover the mds in the late summer of 2021 doy 234 onwards was low for both treatments compared to the mds observed during the same period in 2022 significant differences in maximum daily shrinkage mds rapidly emerged between treatments when deficit irrigation was imposed in both years maximum mds values 311 µm were recorded in late june in 2021 for both ctl and di trees when both treatments were irrigated to fulfill their water requirements during the week with the maximum et0 and vpd of the season on the other hand maximum mds values in 2022 were recorded in late july by di trees approximately one month later than the water restrictions on those trees were imposed fig 6 in 2021 maximum mds for ctl trees occurred at the start of the experiment and then decreased during the season until daily mds reached approximately 100 µm mds for di trees followed a similar pattern but with almost double mds than ctl trees from mid july to mid august doy 194 222 in 2022 mds was more variable for both treatments and significant differences occurred until the end of the experiment mds was three times greater for di trees compared to ctl trees for several days in late august doy 235 242 mds was then compared with the daily range of ψtrunk recorded by the microtensiometers in order to assess which method was better able to detect early water stress the daily range for ψtrunk varied between years and was not able to detect early water stress compared to mds in 2021 ψtrunk daily ranged from 0 3 to 1 0 mpa for ctl trees and 0 3 1 3 mpa for di trees and in 2022 ranged from 0 4 to 1 4 mpa for ctl trees and 0 4 2 2 mpa for di trees 3 4 relationship between trunk water potential and trunk diameter fluctuations mds ψstem and ψtrunk were strongly related to vpd and air temperature for ctl trees vpdmd and tmax were particularly closely related with coefficients of determination that varied between 0 58 and 0 88 table s1 fig 7 in general mds responded more to environmental variables that aggregated values for a whole day or reflected maximum daily values in contrast midday stem and trunk water potential were more related with midday environmental variables particularly ψtrunk these different relationships can be observed when both indicators are compared with the et0 ψstem vs et0 had the lowest coefficients of variation in 2022 r2 0 34 and 0 37 for ψtrunk and ψstem respectively while the mds had coefficients of determination similar to those calculated with tmean or vpdmax r2 0 53 fig 7 shows the regression analysis between the mds and the midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber fig 7a and with the ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers fig 7b using pooled data when both relationships were compared a polynomial regression fit the data with the ψstem while a linear regression was the best fit for the ψtrunk however when only the midday ψtrunk during the month prior and after the start of deficit irrigation was considered a second order regression best fit the data r2 0 63 fig 7c the relationship between vpdmd and mds or midday ψtrunk in the ctl trees was considered fig 7d a strong correlation was observed for both variables measuring water relations signal intensity was similar for all variables and higher for the entire deficit period than for the 14 days immediately following the start of the deficit irrigation table 1 coefficient of variation was the highest for mds and was greater in 2022 for the first 14 days of deficit irrigation however when the entire deficit period was considered cv was higher in 2021 since the coefficient of variation was the highest for mds the sensitivity was subsequently the lowest for all measured variables the daily range ψtrunk was the most sensitive index for the early water stress detection daily maximum and minimum ψtrunk were reached 2 2 5 h earlier than the maximum and minimum trunk diameters were recorded respectively however there was a four hour delay between the time when ψtrunk completely recovered and when trunk diameter stopped increasing fig 8 when both patterns were compared five stages were identified stage i was the final recovery of trunk diameter at night after ψtrunk has been already recovered the tree was rehydrated and transpiration was negligible stage ii describes the period when maximum ψtrunk occurred at sunrise and when the trunk reached its maximum diameter stage iii corresponded to the beginning of the trunk shrinkage until the minimum value of the ψtrunk occurs stage iv is the period between the occurrence of minimum daily ψtrunk and trunk diameter when ψtrunk slowly recovered but trunk diameter continued to decrease stage v corresponded to the final stage when both indicators rapidly recovered and ended once ψtrunk again reached its daily maximum value although the behaviour of both indicators was strongly related during stages iii and v of decrease and recovery respectively they were not as strongly related during stages i ii and iv because of slower changes in trunk diameter compared to ψtrunk 4 discussion the strong relationship between ψtrunk reported from microtensiometers and ψstem measured using a pressure chamber shows how microtensiometers can be used to continuously monitor tree water status however the relationship between the two indicators was less similar when measurements were taken in the afternoon these results follow those previously reported blanco and kalcsits 2021 and the relationship between both methods was similar for both years fig 4 moreover both indicators midday ψstem and ψtrunk significantly identify the two irrigation strategies assayed fig 3 significant differences between treatments appeared earlier for ψstem and ψtrunk than ψleaf which supports previous studies reporting the efficacy of ψstem to assess water relations in woody species naor 2000 santesteban et al 2019 ctl trees almost always had midday ψstem values higher than 1 mpa and were similar to those reported for fully irrigated pear trees in other studies venturi et al 2021 marsal et al 2002a 2002b ψtrunk observed from microtensiometers steadily decreased after midday for both treatments but particularly for di trees fig 1 in our experiment ψstem measured with the pressure chamber in the afternoon was slightly more negative than that measured at midday however for ψtrunk between midday and 16 00 h it decreased more than 0 7 mpa in di trees these differences between both indicators raise the question whether ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers although reliably reflects tree water status at midday underestimates the water stress during the afternoon we hypothesize that this behaviour is related with the strong relationship found between ψtrunk and vpd reference equations are included in the supplementary material so decreases in vpd during the afternoon cause ψtrunk drops consequently the calculation of water stress indicators such as the water stress integral myers 1988 might result affected if ψtrunk is used instead of ψstem pagay 2022 reported that under environmental conditions with high evaporative demand the relationship between both indicators weakened in our study daily maximum vpd reached as high as 5 5 kpa was usually observed at the same time when minimum ψtrunk was observed for microtensiometers while midday vpd was never greater than 4 5 kpa these differences could also be related to the fact that ψtrunk is measured in the main trunk of the tree so considers the whole tree canopy so it should be more dependent on the average ppfd conditions while ψstem is measured in a leave that is in equilibrium with one specific branch and that branch is composed by many leaves exposed to different levels of radiation during the day other factors such as artifacts generated for either method and environmental conditions may lead to differences between treatments changes in the xylem and phloem flow throughout the season and the effect of the crop load have been reported to affect ψstem in temperate woody plants morandi et al 2010 ray and savage 2021 and these factors might also affect the sensitivity of ψtrunk as well as the location within the trunk where the microtensiometers are installed the high for the pressure chamber stanley et al 1983 reported that leaf age can influence ψstem therefore leaves at the beginning or end of the season might equilibrate differently with the stem compared to mature leaves more research is needed to understand the underlying reasons contributing to differences between both indicators like other plant based sensors that need to be embedded in the trunk of the tree such as electromagnetic sensors stott et al 2020 the precision of microtensiometers highly depends on the installation process and the proper contact between the sensor and the xylem regarding ψstem even for established methods levin 2019 indicated that one of the main sources of variability when using a pressure chamber can be the operator however several authors have reported low coefficients of variability for ψstem measured with a pressure chamber in fruit trees and vines goldhamer and fereres 2001 ortuño et al 2006 de la rosa et al 2016 blanco et al 2018 berríos et al 2022 in this study even on days when significant differences between ψstem and ψtrunk were observed both indicators were able to distinguish between irrigation treatments in addition to comparing ψtrunk with ψstem these parallel measurements were compared with diurnal trunk diameter fluctuations like ψtrunk measured with a microtensiometer dendrometers continuously measure plant responses and produce indices that can be used for irrigation decisions however dendrometers can have limitations noun et al 2022 indices derived from the trunk diameter fluctuations including mds have been successfully used in fruit trees and vines to detect and quantify water deficit ortuño et al 2009 liu et al 2011 abdelfatah et al 2013 mds is considered a key water status indicator and has been used alone for irrigation scheduling in peach trees conejero et al 2007 however marsal et al 2002a 2002b and intrigliolo and castel 2006 reported the ability of mds to assess tree water status was affected by trunk seasonal changes during the season here mds had a high signal intensity and differences between irrigation treatments emerged earlier than for midday ψtrunk by 9 and 2 days in 2021 and 2022 respectively however mds was unable to resolve differences between treatments at the end of the 2021 season fig 6 because of decreasing mds as the season progressed for both years and treatments similarly conesa et al 2018 reported that mds was unsuitable for predicting water stress in vines after veraison although the mds detected water stress earlier mds did not increase in the same proportion when ψstem was lower than 1 4 mpa and or ψtrunk was lower than 1 2 mpa fig 7 similar observations for the relationship of both water status indicators have been described in almond cherry grapes nectarine and olive trees puerto et al 2013 blanco et al 2018 montoro et al 2012 de la rosa et al 2016 girón et al 2016 when only the di trees in the 30 days before and after the start of water limitations were considered the relationship between mds and ψtrunk was stronger although mds has been traditionally compared with ψstem we also calculated the daily range ψtrunk to best compare both indicators the daily range of ψtrunk did not detect significant differences between the irrigation treatments earlier than the mds the midday ψstem or the midday ψtrunk here both trunk diameter variation and ψtrunk had a similar pattern compared to those described for norway spruce by herzog et al 1995 for sap flow and trunk diameter with five characteristic stages our results also align with malheiro et al 2020 who reported that trunk diameter changes were delayed compared to sap flow which was responsive to changes in transpiration in touriga nacional grapevines consequently our results demonstrated that the dendrometry could be more related to the potential energy of the water available in the trunk of the tree which is responsive to changes occurring in the xylem herzog et al 1995 therefore trunk diameter continued to decrease stage iv when ψtrunk reached its minimum value in the afternoon on the other hand during stage i when the xylem potential was the highest of the day trunk diameter continued to increase furthermore we observed that water stress affected trunk diameter swelling during the evening and night stage v and trunk diameter shrinkage stage iii under the same environmental conditions di trees had lower ψtrunk but similar trunk diameter growth than ctl trees fig 8f these patterns may imply that di trees to fully recover their trunk diameter needed higher water potential gradients than ctl trees so for the same gradient of water potential during the night recovery stages di trees will have less trunk swelling which implies less water available for transpiration as trunk internal water storage contributes with up to 28 of the total water used by a deciduous tree in a day oliva carrasco et al 2015 coincidentally our results were similar to those that reported a strong relationship between environmental conditions particularly vpd table 1 and both mds and ψstem goldhamer et al 1999 de swaef et al 2009 ortuño et al 2009 egea et al 2009 galindo et al 2013 corell et al 2016 shackel et al 2021 direct measurements of plant stress have the potential for application of precision irrigation strategies in addition to ψstem and mds there are other water status indicators that as ψtrunk have the potential for being used for irrigation automation such as canopy temperature sap flow leaf turgor pressure and trunk water content mira garcía et al 2022 reported threshold values for irrigation scheduling of lime trees under different cropping systems based on thermal indices however these thermal indices were not able to anticipate water stress detection better than soil sensors fan et al 2022 stated that sap flow was useful to assess the water status of asian pear trees but it had high variability and was not as sensitive to the changes in soil and the atmosphere water status in the early season as plant water potential scalisi et al 2019 observed a strong relationship between the leaf turgor and ψleaf of nectarine trees however values needed to be transformed into a second derivative to calculate leaf pressure change rate to compare it with midday ψstem furthermore these sensors can damage the organ where they were installed and may need frequent adjustment or reinstallation stott et al 2020 monitored the changes in the trunk dielectric permittivity of peach trees by embedding different soil sensors into the trunk of the trees with promising results despite the high variability among them and araújo et al 2021 recommended individual calibration of the sensors alizadeh et al 2021 introduced relative trunk water content sensor able to monitor changes in the tree water status these sensors had a robust relationship with trunk diameter but unlike microtensiometers were delayed by three hours compared to diurnal variations in trunk diameter ψtrunk recorded by microtensiometers responded quicker than variations in trunk diameter and do not require individual calibration like some sap flow and trunk water content sensors microtensiometers directly measure ψtrunk which resulted strongly related to midday ψstem and do not need to be transformed into a different index like thermal indices or leaf turgor however ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers was highly dependent on environmental conditions vpd consistently showed more negative minimum values during the afternoon than ψstem and did not detect water stress earlier than ψstem 5 conclusion the strong relationship with midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber the environmental variables affecting water supply to and demand by the plant high sensitivity low variability and the ability to continuously monitor tree water status increases the potential for ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers to be used for automated irrigation under deficit or fully irrigated conditions long term validation and consistent delineation of water stress treatments for pear show the low variability and sensitivity needed for industry adoption although this study does not resolve the underlying causes for differences in diurnal patterns between ψtrunk and ψstem we identify the relationship between the changes in trunk water status and trunk diameter continuous measurement of trunk water potential may contribute to the development of meaningful diurnal patterns and processes that might occur at different phases of short or long term water stress credit

9003,microtensiometers are plant based sensors than can continuously measure trunk water potential ψtrunk this new water status indicator ψtrunk was compared with the midday stem water potential ψstem measured with a pressure chamber the current standard for assessing water status in trees leaf water potential and maximum daily shrinkage mds in adult d anjou pear trees pyrus communis l irrigated following two strategies 1 a control treatment ctl irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration and 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi ψtrunk ψstem and mds were directly influenced by soil water content and atmospheric demand mds was able to detect water stress in di trees the earliest however variability was high and it was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between irrigation treatments at the end of the season mds had a maximum value of 300 µm ψstem 1 4 mpa on the other hand variation for midday ψstem and ψtrunk was low and both indicators were able to distinguish between irrigation strategies midday ψstem and ψtrunk had a strong linear relationship similar to the identity line r2 0 88 however when ψstem and ψtrunk were compared in the afternoon ψtrunk reported by microtensiometers was 0 7 mpa lower than ψstem measured by a pressure chamber the daily relationship between trunk diameter variations and ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers followed five different stages changes in trunk diameter were delayed relative to changes in ψtrunk the seasonal relationship between the mds and ψtrunk was strongly related at the start of deficit irrigation r2 0 63 but when the complete season was considered this relationship was weaker r2 0 44 moreover the low coefficient of variation and high sensitivity of the midday ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers supports the suitability of using them in automated irrigation systems to monitor tree water status in spite of their high dependence on environmental conditions this is one of the first studies that validates the use of microtensiometers to continuously monitor tree water status in fruit trees across two consecutive seasons under differing irrigation treatments keywords

introduction plant biosensors integrate soil water availability and atmospheric water demand across phenological stages jones 2008 fernández 2017 fernandes silva et al 2019 noun et al 2022 plant based sensors are preferred over soil moisture or atmosphere based measures or models stem water potential has been extensively identified as a sensitive measure to assess tree water status mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2000 suter et al 2019 over other indicators however despite being a standard measure it has always been a time consuming non automated method which has limited its use bellvert et al 2016 boini et al 2019 conesa et al 2019 stem water potential directly assesses water tension within the trunk by quantifying the pressure required to push sap through the petiole of a leaf that has stopped its transpiration by enclosing it in a plastic bag that is surrounded by aluminum foil and is in equilibrium with the trunk stem water potential has been traditionally measured with a pressure chamber and is a temporally discrete and destructive measurement scholander et al 1965 for these reasons there is interest in developing continuous plant based indicators that are as effective at measuring tree water status can be automated subjected to remote control and be part of an autonomous irrigation system steppe et al 2008 these approaches and sensors include those that monitor trunk diameter variations sap flow pereira et al 2007 conejero et al 2007 green et al 2009 leaf turgor pressure rüger et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2013 padilla díaz et al 2018 canopy temperature costa et al 2019 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 and stem water content mcdonald et al 2002 he et al 2021 these approaches are either a function of downstream effects from changes in stem water potential or suffer from high variability for measurements trunk diameter variations and indices derived from diurnal patterns have also been widely studied and reported to reflect tree water status ortuño et al 2010 these measurements are based on changes in the water content of extensible tissues of the trunk which cause variations in trunk diameter vieira et al 2022 trunk diameter measurements are recommended over fruit diameter for irrigation decisions maximum daily shrinkage mds is among the most frequently derived indices and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum diameter on the same day this is a sensitive indicator for detecting early water stress in mature fruit trees mirás avalos et al 2017 however in some cases when the stem water potential decreases below a specific threshold value mds values do not continue to increase and even a reduction in the mds values have been reported under severe water stress conditions girón et al 2016 blanco et al 2018 a common approach for validation is to compare sensor data with stem water potential measured with the pressure chamber microtensiometers directly measure trunk water potential in situ using microelectromechanical pressure sensors that are embedded into the trunk of the tree pagay et al 2014 this produces continuous water potential measurements which might help improve irrigation strategies based on tree water status garcía tejera et al 2021 the daily pattern of trunk water potential recorded by microtensiometers has been positively associated with stem water potential measured with a pressure chamber blanco and kalcsits 2021 in vines pagay 2022 also reported the diurnal patterns of trunk water potential from microtensiometers however both of these studies made comparisons across a short period of time while recently there is an increasing interest in assessing the microtensiometers as a tool for irrigation management lakso et al 2022 gonzalez et al 2022 there are few studies that examine trunk water potential measured by microtensiometers across whole seasons and compare its measurements with data acquired from established methods like a pressure chamber or trunk dendrometers to our knowledge this is the first study in which the trunk water potential is compared with the trunk diameter variations the aim of this study was to make long term comparisons of stem water potential values measured with either microtensiometers or with a pressure chamber and to compare stem water potential with mds for detecting early water stress in pear trees under controlled water limitations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2021 and 2022 at the washington state university experimental orchard located in rock island washington state usa 47 19 n 120 04 w the experimental plot 0 81 ha was d anjou pear pyrus communis l orchard grafted on ohxf 87 rootstock and trained on a central leader system at a tree density of 833 trees per hectare 2 67 4 5 m planted in 2007 the soil was a shallow sandy loam and trees were drip irrigated by a system consisting of a single drip line per tree row and five emitters per tree of 2 l h 1 discharge rate horticultural practices e g fertilization pruning and weed control were the same for all trees in the block and followed commercial regular practices full bloom was in april and harvest was in late august early september for both years 2 2 irrigation treatments two irrigation treatments were imposed 1 a control treatment ctl irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc to ensure non limiting soil water conditions during the complete season 2 a regulated deficit irrigation treatment di irrigated at 100 of etc from full bloom to early stage of

et al 2012 and the evaporation reduction coefficient fereres et al 1982 treatments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates per treatment with six trees in each replicate two trees per replicate were selected for their uniformity average ground cover of 41 and mean trunk diameter of 10 5 0 23 cm for measurements 2 3 weather and soil monitoring hourly meteorological data were recorded by an agweathernet station located at the experimental orchard http www weather wsu edu sunrise station the variables measured were air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and solar radiation daily et0 was calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and air vapor pressure deficit vpd from air temperature and relative humidity moreover in order to consider the microclimate conditions within the pear orchard two temperature and relative humidity sensors atmos 14 meter group inc pullman wa usa were also installed in the orchard soil volumetric water content was measured at 0 25 and 0 50 m depth with two capacitance frequency domain sensors teros 11 meter group pullman wa usa per replicate the soil sensors were installed under the canopy and placed 0 25 m from the drip emitter 2 4 trunk stem and leaf water potential ψtrunk was recorded every 20 min in six trees per treatment two per replicate using microtensiometers connected to a solar powered data logger florapulse davis ca usa the microtensiometers were embedded into the trunk of the selected trees each year of study on the north side of the trunk away from direct sunlight the microtensiometers were not reinstalled nor left working in the same tree for two seasons each season new sensors were used in the same trees the daily range of the ψtrunk was calculated as the daily difference in ψtrunk between the maximum and minimum value recorded by the microtensiometers ψstem was manually measured with the scholander pressure chamber model 615d pms instrument company albany or usa at solar midday every 4 7 days in six healthy mature and shaded leaves located close to the trunk per treatment leaves were wrapped with black polyethylene plastic and covered with aluminum foil for at least 2 h prior to the measurements mccutchan and shackel 1992 moreover ψstem was measured in 2022 every 14 days with the pressure chamber in the afternoon 15 30 16 30 h solar time for the same trees where microtensiometers were installed to validate the relationship between the ψstem and ψtrunk midday leaf water potential ψleaf was measured every 14 days in six fully expanded mature leaves from branches in the lower half of the canopy per treatment in the same trees where microtensiometers were installed with the same scholander pressure chamber 2 5 trunk diameter fluctuations trunk diameter was monitored in 8 trees 4 trees per treatment every 10 min using linear voltage differential pressure transducer dendrometers lvdt model de 1 t implexx sense melbourne australia installed on the northern side of the trunks 30 cm above the point where the microtensiometers were installed sensors had a 0 001 mm resolution maximum daily shrinkage mds was calculated as the daily difference in diameter between the maximum and the minimum goldhamer and fereres 2001 2 6 statistical analysis relationships between plant water status indicators and meteorological variables were explored through linear and non linear regression analyses performed with sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa the sensitivity s of water stress indicators were calculated according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 for ψstem measured with the pressure chamber and ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers at midday the daily mean and range of ψtrunk and the mds s was calculated by dividing signal intensity si calculated as the ratio between ctl and di by the coefficient of variation cv data were analyzed by using analysis of variance

ca usa 3 results 3 1 weather and soil water status the daily maximum air temperature ranged from 20 c in early june and mid september and 45 c in early july in 2021 and late july in 2022 fig 1 67 and 64 days out of the 105 days had maximum air temperature that exceeded 30 c in 2021 and 2022 respectively the minimum air temperature varied between 10 and 25 c the daily et0 and the vpd was highly variable during the season reaching maximum daily average values slightly higher in 2021 11 5 mm and 5 0 kpa doy 180 than in 2022 11 mm and 4 5 kpa doy 209 daily maximum photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was similar for both years peaking in late june at approximately 1900 µmol m 2 s 1 and decreasing below 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 by september volumetric soil water content in the ctl treatment from 0 25 to 0 50 m depth ranged between 0 27 and 0 37 m3 m 3 during both years of study in the di treatment soil water content strongly decreased once deficit irrigation started it was similar to the ctl in june 0 30 m3 m 3 and then decreased to values similar to 0 15 m3 m 3 at the end of the experiment for both years fig 1 the rate of decrease was faster in 2021 than 2022 where volumetric soil water content fell below 0 15 m3 m 3 by the end of july in 2021 and by the middle of august in 2022 3 2 trunk and stem water potential microtensiometers and pressure chamber ψtrunk continuously measured using microtensiometers clearly showed differences between irrigation treatments in both years of the study fig 2 daily minimum ψtrunk was often reached during the afternoon when atmospheric demand was the highest once deficit irrigation started daily minimum ψtrunk of di trees were lower than those of the ctl trees however the daily maximum values observed at sunrise were similar for both treatments when the evaporative demand increased 30 days after the start of deficit irrigation both the maximum and the minimum ψtrunk of the di trees were significantly lower than those from the ctl trees in 2022 both ctl and di trees had higher variability and range of daily measurements than in 2021 with minimum values in midsummer of 2021 for di trees of 2 0 mpa and in 2022 of 2 5 mpa daily mean ψtrunk was lower for di trees in 2021 than in 2022 following this pattern ψtrunk was below 1 0 mpa for 25 days in 2021 and 14 days in 2022 for di trees however there were more extreme negative ψtrunk observed in 2022 daily minimum ψtrunk values were below 2 0 mpa for 5 days in 2021 and for 31 days in 2022 fig 2 ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers at midday closely followed ψstem and ψleaf values measured with a pressure chamber at midday fig 3 midday ψstem for ctl trees under no soil water limitations were between 0 5 and 0 8 mpa with the lowest value of 1 0 mpa recorded in 2022 doy 209 by the pressure chamber and 1 2 mpa by the microtensiometers for di trees the lowest value of midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber and ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers was 1 5 mpa and was recorded from late july to mid august for both years however afterward midday ψstem and ψtrunk slowly increased to 1 0 mpa in 2021 while in 2022 similar values were observed several times until the end of the experiment ψstem and ψtrunk were sensitive water stress indicators and consistently differentiated between the two irrigation strategies imposed throughout the experiment ψstem measured by a pressure chamber was able to significantly distinguish differences between irrigation treatments two and one day earlier than the ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers in 2021 and 2022 respectively on the other hand ψleaf was not as sensitive as ψstem and ψtrunk although they all followed a similar trend ψleaf showed more variability and was not able to detect early water stress in di trees once the deficit was applied in 2022 ψstem from the pressure chamber was compared with ψtrunk from the microtensiometers during the afternoon differences between both indicators were greater in mid afternoon particularly for di trees ψtrunk values were approximately 34 lower than ψstem values these differences between both indicators were not observed at midday fig 4 there was a strong relationship between both at midday in both years of study r2 0 88 and were similar to the identity line 1 1 x y for the range of midday ψstem between 0 3 and 1 7 mpa on the other hand the relationship between both indicators in the afternoon was also strong but were different from the identity line with more negative values for the ψtrunk values recorded by the microtensiometers fig 4 when midday ψstem and ψtrunk were compared there were differences for 7 and 5 days out of 24 for ctl trees in 2021 and 2022 respectively despite having significant differences the variation between the mean values for each indicator was not higher than 0 5 mpa with more negative values of ψtrunk recorded by microtensiometers fig 3 3 3 trunk diameter as expected trunk diameter growth and daily fluctuations were different between treatments trunk diameter increased for ctl trees by 94 and 78 compared to di trees in 2021 and 2022 respectively however all the trees regardless of their irrigation treatment had greater growth in 2022 than in 2021 fig 5 moreover the mds in the late summer of 2021 doy 234 onwards was low for both treatments compared to the mds observed during the same period in 2022 significant differences in maximum daily shrinkage mds rapidly emerged between treatments when deficit irrigation was imposed in both years maximum mds values 311 µm were recorded in late june in 2021 for both ctl and di trees when both treatments were irrigated to fulfill their water requirements during the week with the maximum et0 and vpd of the season on the other hand maximum mds values in 2022 were recorded in late july by di trees approximately one month later than the water restrictions on those trees were imposed fig 6 in 2021 maximum mds for ctl trees occurred at the start of the experiment and then decreased during the season until daily mds reached approximately 100 µm mds for di trees followed a similar pattern but with almost double mds than ctl trees from mid july to mid august doy 194 222 in 2022 mds was more variable for both treatments and significant differences occurred until the end of the experiment mds was three times greater for di trees compared to ctl trees for several days in late august doy 235 242 mds was then compared with the daily range of ψtrunk recorded by the microtensiometers in order to assess which method was better able to detect early water stress the daily range for ψtrunk varied between years and was not able to detect early water stress compared to mds in 2021 ψtrunk daily ranged from 0 3 to 1 0 mpa for ctl trees and 0 3 1 3 mpa for di trees and in 2022 ranged from 0 4 to 1 4 mpa for ctl trees and 0 4 2 2 mpa for di trees 3 4 relationship between trunk water potential and trunk diameter fluctuations mds ψstem and ψtrunk were strongly related to vpd and air temperature for ctl trees vpdmd and tmax were particularly closely related with coefficients of determination that varied between 0 58 and 0 88 table s1 fig 7 in general mds responded more to environmental variables that aggregated values for a whole day or reflected maximum daily values in contrast midday stem and trunk water potential were more related with midday environmental variables particularly ψtrunk these different relationships can be observed when both indicators are compared with the et0 ψstem vs et0 had the lowest coefficients of variation in 2022 r2 0 34 and 0 37 for ψtrunk and ψstem respectively while the mds had coefficients of determination similar to those calculated with tmean or vpdmax r2 0 53 fig 7 shows the regression analysis between the mds and the midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber fig 7a and with the ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers fig 7b using pooled data when both relationships were compared a polynomial regression fit the data with the ψstem while a linear regression was the best fit for the ψtrunk however when only the midday ψtrunk during the month prior and after the start of deficit irrigation was considered a second order regression best fit the data r2 0 63 fig 7c the relationship between vpdmd and mds or midday ψtrunk in the ctl trees was considered fig 7d a strong correlation was observed for both variables measuring water relations signal intensity was similar for all variables and higher for the entire deficit period than for the 14 days immediately following the start of the deficit irrigation table 1 coefficient of variation was the highest for mds and was greater in 2022 for the first 14 days of deficit irrigation however when the entire deficit period was considered cv was higher in 2021 since the coefficient of variation was the highest for mds the sensitivity was subsequently the lowest for all measured variables the daily range ψtrunk was the most sensitive index for the early water stress detection daily maximum and minimum ψtrunk were reached 2 2 5 h earlier than the maximum and minimum trunk diameters were recorded respectively however there was a four hour delay between the time when ψtrunk completely recovered and when trunk diameter stopped increasing fig 8 when both patterns were compared five stages were identified stage i was the final recovery of trunk diameter at night after ψtrunk has been already recovered the tree was rehydrated and transpiration was negligible stage ii describes the period when maximum ψtrunk occurred at sunrise and when the trunk reached its maximum diameter stage iii corresponded to the beginning of the trunk shrinkage until the minimum value of the ψtrunk occurs stage iv is the period between the occurrence of minimum daily ψtrunk and trunk diameter when ψtrunk slowly recovered but trunk diameter continued to decrease stage v corresponded to the final stage when both indicators rapidly recovered and ended once ψtrunk again reached its daily maximum value although the behaviour of both indicators was strongly related during stages iii and v of decrease and recovery respectively they were not as strongly related during stages i ii and iv because of slower changes in trunk diameter compared to ψtrunk 4 discussion the strong relationship between ψtrunk reported from microtensiometers and ψstem measured using a pressure chamber shows how microtensiometers can be used to continuously monitor tree water status however the relationship between the two indicators was less similar when measurements were taken in the afternoon these results follow those previously reported blanco and kalcsits 2021 and the relationship between both methods was similar for both years fig 4 moreover both indicators midday ψstem and ψtrunk significantly identify the two irrigation strategies assayed fig 3 significant differences between treatments appeared earlier for ψstem and ψtrunk than ψleaf which supports previous studies reporting the efficacy of ψstem to assess water relations in woody species naor 2000 santesteban et al 2019 ctl trees almost always had midday ψstem values higher than 1 mpa and were similar to those reported for fully irrigated pear trees in other studies venturi et al 2021 marsal et al 2002a 2002b ψtrunk observed from microtensiometers steadily decreased after midday for both treatments but particularly for di trees fig 1 in our experiment ψstem measured with the pressure chamber in the afternoon was slightly more negative than that measured at midday however for ψtrunk between midday and 16 00 h it decreased more than 0 7 mpa in di trees these differences between both indicators raise the question whether ψtrunk measured with the microtensiometers although reliably reflects tree water status at midday underestimates the water stress during the afternoon we hypothesize that this behaviour is related with the strong relationship found between ψtrunk and vpd reference equations are included in the supplementary material so decreases in vpd during the afternoon cause ψtrunk drops consequently the calculation of water stress indicators such as the water stress integral myers 1988 might result affected if ψtrunk is used instead of ψstem pagay 2022 reported that under environmental conditions with high evaporative demand the relationship between both indicators weakened in our study daily maximum vpd reached as high as 5 5 kpa was usually observed at the same time when minimum ψtrunk was observed for microtensiometers while midday vpd was never greater than 4 5 kpa these differences could also be related to the fact that ψtrunk is measured in the main trunk of the tree so considers the whole tree canopy so it should be more dependent on the average ppfd conditions while ψstem is measured in a leave that is in equilibrium with one specific branch and that branch is composed by many leaves exposed to different levels of radiation during the day other factors such as artifacts generated for either method and environmental conditions may lead to differences between treatments changes in the xylem and phloem flow throughout the season and the effect of the crop load have been reported to affect ψstem in temperate woody plants morandi et al 2010 ray and savage 2021 and these factors might also affect the sensitivity of ψtrunk as well as the location within the trunk where the microtensiometers are installed the high for the pressure chamber stanley et al 1983 reported that leaf age can influence ψstem therefore leaves at the beginning or end of the season might equilibrate differently with the stem compared to mature leaves more research is needed to understand the underlying reasons contributing to differences between both indicators like other plant based sensors that need to be embedded in the trunk of the tree such as electromagnetic sensors stott et al 2020 the precision of microtensiometers highly depends on the installation process and the proper contact between the sensor and the xylem regarding ψstem even for established methods levin 2019 indicated that one of the main sources of variability when using a pressure chamber can be the operator however several authors have reported low coefficients of variability for ψstem measured with a pressure chamber in fruit trees and vines goldhamer and fereres 2001 ortuño et al 2006 de la rosa et al 2016 blanco et al 2018 berríos et al 2022 in this study even on days when significant differences between ψstem and ψtrunk were observed both indicators were able to distinguish between irrigation treatments in addition to comparing ψtrunk with ψstem these parallel measurements were compared with diurnal trunk diameter fluctuations like ψtrunk measured with a microtensiometer dendrometers continuously measure plant responses and produce indices that can be used for irrigation decisions however dendrometers can have limitations noun et al 2022 indices derived from the trunk diameter fluctuations including mds have been successfully used in fruit trees and vines to detect and quantify water deficit ortuño et al 2009 liu et al 2011 abdelfatah et al 2013 mds is considered a key water status indicator and has been used alone for irrigation scheduling in peach trees conejero et al 2007 however marsal et al 2002a 2002b and intrigliolo and castel 2006 reported the ability of mds to assess tree water status was affected by trunk seasonal changes during the season here mds had a high signal intensity and differences between irrigation treatments emerged earlier than for midday ψtrunk by 9 and 2 days in 2021 and 2022 respectively however mds was unable to resolve differences between treatments at the end of the 2021 season fig 6 because of decreasing mds as the season progressed for both years and treatments similarly conesa et al 2018 reported that mds was unsuitable for predicting water stress in vines after veraison although the mds detected water stress earlier mds did not increase in the same proportion when ψstem was lower than 1 4 mpa and or ψtrunk was lower than 1 2 mpa fig 7 similar observations for the relationship of both water status indicators have been described in almond cherry grapes nectarine and olive trees puerto et al 2013 blanco et al 2018 montoro et al 2012 de la rosa et al 2016 girón et al 2016 when only the di trees in the 30 days before and after the start of water limitations were considered the relationship between mds and ψtrunk was stronger although mds has been traditionally compared with ψstem we also calculated the daily range ψtrunk to best compare both indicators the daily range of ψtrunk did not detect significant differences between the irrigation treatments earlier than the mds the midday ψstem or the midday ψtrunk here both trunk diameter variation and ψtrunk had a similar pattern compared to those described for norway spruce by herzog et al 1995 for sap flow and trunk diameter with five characteristic stages our results also align with malheiro et al 2020 who reported that trunk diameter changes were delayed compared to sap flow which was responsive to changes in transpiration in touriga nacional grapevines consequently our results demonstrated that the dendrometry could be more related to the potential energy of the water available in the trunk of the tree which is responsive to changes occurring in the xylem herzog et al 1995 therefore trunk diameter continued to decrease stage iv when ψtrunk reached its minimum value in the afternoon on the other hand during stage i when the xylem potential was the highest of the day trunk diameter continued to increase furthermore we observed that water stress affected trunk diameter swelling during the evening and night stage v and trunk diameter shrinkage stage iii under the same environmental conditions di trees had lower ψtrunk but similar trunk diameter growth than ctl trees fig 8f these patterns may imply that di trees to fully recover their trunk diameter needed higher water potential gradients than ctl trees so for the same gradient of water potential during the night recovery stages di trees will have less trunk swelling which implies less water available for transpiration as trunk internal water storage contributes with up to 28 of the total water used by a deciduous tree in a day oliva carrasco et al 2015 coincidentally our results were similar to those that reported a strong relationship between environmental conditions particularly vpd table 1 and both mds and ψstem goldhamer et al 1999 de swaef et al 2009 ortuño et al 2009 egea et al 2009 galindo et al 2013 corell et al 2016 shackel et al 2021 direct measurements of plant stress have the potential for application of precision irrigation strategies in addition to ψstem and mds there are other water status indicators that as ψtrunk have the potential for being used for irrigation automation such as canopy temperature sap flow leaf turgor pressure and trunk water content mira garcía et al 2022 reported threshold values for irrigation scheduling of lime trees under different cropping systems based on thermal indices however these thermal indices were not able to anticipate water stress detection better than soil sensors fan et al 2022 stated that sap flow was useful to assess the water status of asian pear trees but it had high variability and was not as sensitive to the changes in soil and the atmosphere water status in the early season as plant water potential scalisi et al 2019 observed a strong relationship between the leaf turgor and ψleaf of nectarine trees however values needed to be transformed into a second derivative to calculate leaf pressure change rate to compare it with midday ψstem furthermore these sensors can damage the organ where they were installed and may need frequent adjustment or reinstallation stott et al 2020 monitored the changes in the trunk dielectric permittivity of peach trees by embedding different soil sensors into the trunk of the trees with promising results despite the high variability among them and araújo et al 2021 recommended individual calibration of the sensors alizadeh et al 2021 introduced relative trunk water content sensor able to monitor changes in the tree water status these sensors had a robust relationship with trunk diameter but unlike microtensiometers were delayed by three hours compared to diurnal variations in trunk diameter ψtrunk recorded by microtensiometers responded quicker than variations in trunk diameter and do not require individual calibration like some sap flow and trunk water content sensors microtensiometers directly measure ψtrunk which resulted strongly related to midday ψstem and do not need to be transformed into a different index like thermal indices or leaf turgor however ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers was highly dependent on environmental conditions vpd consistently showed more negative minimum values during the afternoon than ψstem and did not detect water stress earlier than ψstem 5 conclusion the strong relationship with midday ψstem measured with the pressure chamber the environmental variables affecting water supply to and demand by the plant high sensitivity low variability and the ability to continuously monitor tree water status increases the potential for ψtrunk measured by the microtensiometers to be used for automated irrigation under deficit or fully irrigated conditions long term validation and consistent delineation of water stress treatments for pear show the low variability and sensitivity needed for industry adoption although this study does not resolve the underlying causes for differences in diurnal patterns between ψtrunk and ψstem we identify the relationship between the changes in trunk water status and trunk diameter continuous measurement of trunk water potential may contribute to the development of meaningful diurnal patterns and processes that might occur at different phases of short or long term water stress credit

9004,because of climate change and the scarce availability of natural resources there is a need to develop sustainable intensification strategies intended for optimizing water use in vineyards in this study water regime fertilization and soil management practices were assessed in terms of vineyard water use by evaluating the inter row and crop line evapotranspiration et components using the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model in combination with unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral and thermal images taken on five dates throughout the growing season the application of the metric uav using high resolution imagery was proven as a useful tool for evaluating the effects of sustainable intensification strategies on water use of crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil identifying the most efficient site specific strategies for water conservation purposes moreover metric uav allowed evaluating separately their effects on the inter row and the crop line among the assessed sustainable intensification strategies the application of mulching provided the highest water savings 28 when compared to traditional soil tillage management reducing inter row soil evaporation by 63 while increasing crop line et by 14 in spite of this the mulching application did not affect yield but significantly enhanced water use efficiency wue in terms of grape yield compared to tillage the adoption of deficit irrigation di strategies did not result in vine water stress that was severe enough to significantly affect crop line et when compared with fully irrigated fi vines both di and fi strategies increased vine water use by 18 and 27 respectively as compared to the rainfed regime with no differences found in the inter row water consumption di and fi in turn significantly increased yield as compared to rainfed crops leading to significant improvements in wue in the short term the application of supplemental inorganic fertilizers did not modify either the vineyard water use or vine performance keywords evapotranspiration multispectral remote sensing thermal vitis vinifera water requirements data availability data

increasingly threatened by the effects of climate change that include an overall warmer scenario and the shifting in precipitation patterns diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 ipcc 2021 despite the high uncertainties related to climate models olesen et al 2007 and to the effects of increasing carbon dioxide on water requirements chamizo et al 2017 crops will likely increase their potential water requirements under future climatic conditions döll 2002 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 the mediterranean basin will be especially impacted highlighting the severe changes in air temperature and rainfall in the iberian peninsula webber et al 2018 moreover grapevines are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to the impact of shifts in phenology and water stress on grape composition and wine quality van leeuwen and darriet 2016 gambetta 2016 bonada et al 2018 viticultural practices should play a key role in reducing water use alleviating grapevine water stress and improving water use efficiency wue i e yield produced per unit of water consumed by crops medrano et al 2015 bambach et al 2022 in this regard possible strategies for sustainable intensification of water resources in vineyards include changes in plant material scions and rootstocks and in viticultural techniques ollat et al 2016 these latter are based on alleviating the undesired effects of both water stress and higher temperatures on vine performance as example they include the adoption of different irrigation regimes for increasing soil water content mccarthy et al 2002 intrigliolo and castel 2010 the use of cover crops monteiro and lopes 2007 and the application of mulch for reducing soil evaporation lópez urrea et al 2020 furthermore fertilization management can be used to regulate vine vigour through its effects on vine water relations and nutritional status schreiner et al 2013 however all the above studies do not quantify water use at the vineyard level the effectiveness of sustainable intensification strategies is commonly assessed by using classical methods based on ground measurements such as those intended for measuring structural and geometric parameters e g crop height canopy volume shoot length and yield tardaguila et al 2012 buesa et al 2020 maclaren et al 2022 and for evaluating crop water and nutritional status e g pressure chamber sap flow and leaf and soil analysis roccuzzo et al 2012 villalobos et al 2013 consoli et al 2017 however most of them are high cost time consuming and destructive methods that due to their time specific nature may not reflect the high crop heterogeneity especially in woody crops bramley and hamilton 2004 aquino et al 2018 technological advances in the last decades have provided alternatives to the above mentioned classical ground based methods such as imaging based methods particularly remarkable when on board remote proximal sensing acquisition platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles uav these allow covering large spatial areas capturing the spatial variability within the vineyard in a non destructive time and cost effective way acevedo opazo et al 2008 dorigo et al 2007 research efforts are oriented to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the et products using multi source remote sensing data or data fusion techniques knipper et al 2019 xue et al 2022 additionally sensors on board uav provide high resolution data which allows segmenting bare soil from pure vegetation rango et al 2009 matese et al 2015 ballesteros et al 2015 several authors have used multispectral and thermal data obtained from uavs for precision agriculture purposes specifically in vineyards imaging based applications include crop evapotranspiration etc determination e g chandel et al 2021 ortega farias et al 2021 kustas et

response to water stress than those based on the visible and the near infrared regions ramírez cuesta et al 2022 it is because the thermal infrared region reflects the fast crop temperature increases due to the stomatal closure caused by a site specific stress khanal et al 2017 and changes in photosynthetic activity wong et al 2022 the sensitivity of thermal based remote sensing is the base of most surface energy balance seb models such as one source e g sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 metric allen al 2007a two source e g tseb kustas and norman 1999 disalexi anderson et al 2007 and three

to spectral based crop coefficients approach under different crop conditions consoli and vanella 2014 pôças et al 2020 in this study the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b model is applied among the numerous available seb models because it requires a minimum auxiliary ground based dataset especially when compared to seb models that demand many more parameters additionally the metric model performs an automatic internal calibration thus eliminating the need for an exact atmospheric correction and reducing the impacts of any biases on the estimation of aerodynamic stability correction or surface roughness this internal calibration can be performed within each remotely sensed image analyzed allen et al 2007a li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 the main goal of this study was to address vineyard water requirements and wue in a semi arid climate under several sustainable intensification practices such as water regime wr fertilization management fm and soil management sm using the metric model allen et al 2007a ramírez cuesta et al 2020 with high resolution images as inputs hereafter metric uav in particular this study assessed the effects of i non irrigation and two irrigation strategies ii supplementary mineral fertilization to a deep organic manure and iii mulching application and bare soil on the vineyard 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in 2017 at a commercial wine grape bobal vineyard vitis vinifera l of 1 7 ha located in requena valencia spain 39º30 20 71 n 1º13 51 31 w fig 1 within the designation of origin utiel requena the vineyard was planted in 2002 onto 110 richter rootstock in a bilateral cordon conduction system on a vertical trellis following a north south orientation 10º nw with a spacing of 2 5 1 4 m the soil at the site has a clay loam to light clay texture with a deep profile 2 m along the entire plot and with an available water capacity of around 180 mm m 1 buesa et al 2021 the area has a semi arid continental mediterranean climate with an average annual air temperature total annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration et0 for 2017 of 15 0 c 322 and 1251 mm respectively specifically during the period of grapevine development from april 1st to september 20th cumulative et0 and rainfall values were 891 and 119 mm respectively fig 2 the daily et0 values averaged over 5 mm and the weeks with rainfall greater than 10 mm occurred three times during the growing season 2 2 experimental design the influence of 3 sustainable intensification strategies including the modification of wr fm and sm was assessed on the seb components fig 3 the experimental design was distributed in 4 randomized complete blocks containing 7 experimental treatments combining the 3 management factors table 1 each sub plot consisted of 5 rows where the internal 18 vines were experimental whereas the perimeter vines acted as borders the wr factor hypothesizes that under rainfed rf conditions excessive water stress may severely impair vineyard yield and on the other hand that full irrigation fi would not result in a higher wue this factor considered 3 levels rf fi and deficit irrigation di conditions rf treatments were not watered for the previous 5 growing seasons whereas the di and fi treatments were watered at 50 etc until veraison after which water was withheld and at 100 etc respectively the wr factor was evaluated by comparing the rf o b fi o b and di o b treatments in these treatments the soil in the inter row was kept bare by soil tillage b and organic amendment was applied o table 1 the fm factor hypothesizes that there are strong interactions between wue and nitrogen use efficiency and thus management practices should focus on enhancing both simultaneously quemada and gabriel 2016 taking into account that the response to the fm strategy may differ between the different wr a 2 factorial combination of two fertilization strategies the application of an organic amendment o and a supplemental inorganic fertilizer application o i and two wr rf and fi was established following the recommendations provided by garcía escudero 2010 all four treatments were organically fertilized with buried manure in 2016 at a rate of 116 93 139 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively in 2017 only the inorganic fertilization treatments were supplemented at a rate of 53 35 105 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively in the rf treatments the supplementary fertilizer application was done manually in spring with subsequent subsoiling and in the fi treatments it was applied during the same period by fertigation a volume of water without fertilizer equal that of the fertigation treatments was applied to the fi o b treatment specifically the rf o b rf oi b fi o b and fi oi b treatments were utilized for evaluating fm the sm factor hypothesizes that mulching can reduce soil evaporation thereby enhancing vine water status and especially under rf conditions increasing yield and wue medrano et al 2015 thus a 2 factorial combination of two sm practices consisting of soil tillage bare where the soil was tilled twice per season and mulching with no tillage mulch and two wr rf and fi was assessed the mulching consisted of a 3 5 cm layer of crushed pruning waste distributed on the entire soil surface without tilling the soil throughout the season the evaluation of sm was performed by comparing the rf oi b and rf oi m fi oi b and fi oi m treatments weather conditions were recorded using an automated meteorological station located in the plot the et0 was calculated with the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 and the irrigation scheduling was based on the canopy cover crop coefficient kco relationships reported by lópez urrea et al 2012 thus kco values were 0 25 0 35 from bud break to flowering 0 40 0 50 from flowering to veraison and 0 50 0 60 from veraison to harvest consequently etc for fi was computed by multiplying the et0 by the kco values 2 3 airborne campaigns five uav campaigns were carried out during the 2017 growing season covering all vineyard stages table 2 multispectral and thermal sensors installed on board a quadcopter md4 1000 microdrones inc kreuztal germany was used flights were performed under sunny conditions between 10 00 and 10 30 gmt at 80 m above ground level the multispectral sensor was a sequoia camera parrot paris france which acquired four bands covering the green red red edge and near infra red nir spectral regions of the light spectrum with center wavelengths at 550 640 735 and 790 nm respectively the focal length was 3 98 mm yielding a pixel size of 7 cm the sensor was a 4 8 3 6 mm charge coupled device ccd with a pixel size of 3 75 3 75 µm resulting in an image size of 1280 960 columns and rows image acquisition was established according to a flight plan computed using microdrones photogrammetric flight planning software hernandez lopez et al 2013 multispectral images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected the radiometric calibration was performed using an aircalib calibration panel airinov paris france whereas for the geometric correction eight coordinates known targets were distributed covering the entire field 3 of them located within the experimental area green points in fig 1 the accurate locations of the targets were obtained using a leica gps 1200 leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland linked to a global navigation satellite system gnss permanent reference station providing an estimated accuracy of 0 02 and 0 03 m in planimetry and altimetry respectively the orthoimages were generated using structure from motion techniques with pix4d software pix4d s a lausanne switzerland the thermal sensor used to obtain the thermal images was the flir tau2 flir systems inc wilsonville oregon united states with a focal of 9 mm fov 69 56 an uncooled microbolometer of 640 h x 520 v a pixel size of 17 µm a spectral band ranging between 7 5 and 13 5 µm and a weight of approximately 72 g without a lens a camera calibration procedure was performed by following the methodology proposed by ribeiro gomes et al 2016 which considers the temperature changes in the sensor case and the highly non linear relationships with the digital response of the camera allowing us to obtain a measurement error of 1 37 ºc since uav data is less influenced by atmospheric effects than images acquired from satellite due to the proximity of the targets aragon et al 2020 a full atmospheric correction was not necessary thus in order to validate the uav data on the ground thermal data was measured with an apogee mi 210 infrared thermometer apogee instruments inc united states on the cold pixel surface and on a black surface placed on the plot at the flight time 5 measurements per surface type and flight data not shown all the geomatic data were obtained for the crs epsg 25830 in planimetry and epsg 5782 in altimetry 2 4 field measurements for all flight dates table 2 vine stem water potential ψstem was measured on three west side oriented leaves per sub plot using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument company albany or usa measurements were performed at midday 11 30 12 30 h gmt on non transpiring leaves that were bagged for at least 1 h prior to measurement in hermetic plastic bags covered with aluminum foil at harvest grapevine yield was determined on each experimental vine 2 5 crop evapotranspiration calculation using the metric model the metric gis tool ramírez cuesta et al 2020 was used to estimate spatially distributed etc this tool is an arcgis toolbox that implements the metric model allen et al 2007a for determining the latent heat flux le in w m 2 and therefore the etc as a residual of the seb equation eq 1 1 le r n g h where rn is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 in addition kco values were calculated as the ratio between etc and et0 at the image acquisition time the detailed formulation of each component and the procedure used to upscale from instantaneous to daily kco and etc values can be found in allen et al 2007a metric gis was initially developed for using satellite images as input i e landsat satellite images so different adjustments were made to adapt it to high resolution uav images herein metric uav and to improve the agro system characterization 2 5 1 anchor pixels selection in general the metric model requires the identification of two anchor pixels where the h value is reliably assumed named as hot and cold pixels for etc calculation allen et al 2007a ramírez cuesta et al 2020 however the relatively small area covered by the uavs makes difficult finding pixels that meet the requirement expected for the hot and cold conditions especially those referring to the latter under semi arid conditions allen et al 2013 bhattarai et al 2017 saboori et al 2021 therefore to ensure the presence of cold conditions potential etc in the acquired images a 10 10 m of cynodon dactylon l pers var celebration was planted at the beginning of the season 20 m away from the study area fig 1 it was fully irrigated prior the uav campaign in order to ensure non water stress conditions during image acquisition regarding the hot pixel no specific actions were required due to presence of multiple candidates in the surrounding area the et0 fraction referred to the standardized 0 5 m tall alfalfa reference assigned to the cold and the hot pixels were 1 00 and 0 05 respectively 2 5 2 land use classification from a preliminary analysis of the land use categories located in the study area which allowed a better parameterization and estimation of the surface roughness parameter three different classes were differentiated herbaceous grapevine and bare soil class values 81 82 and 31 respectively according to united states geological survey national land cover database definitions the herbaceous class was manually delineated as it was concentrated on the cold region see 2 5 1 anchor pixel selection whereas a more complex procedure was required for the differentiation between grapevine and bare soil named vegetation segmentation thus for the delineation of the grapevine category a multi criteria approach based on the combination of the multispectral and thermal images was adopted in the present study this approach benefits from the noticeable difference of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lst between the vegetation and the bare soil therefore ndvi and lst isolines with a spacing of 0 01 and 0 5 k respectively were created from these isolines ndvi and lst thresholds values were visually selected in the region of contact between the soil and the plant i e where the isolines were closer to each other thus a pixel was respectively classified as grapevine when characterized by ndvi and lst values higher and lower than the thresholds selected for ndvi and lst alternatively if the ndvi and lst of a pixel was lower and higher than the selected thresholds the pixel was classified as bare soil when only one condition was met i e or ndvi or lst which occurred in a negligible proportion of the total study area the pixel was not considered in the study since these pixels indicate a displacement between multispectral and thermal images this displacement has been noted as a common issue when dealing with two different sensors on board a uav ramírez cuesta et al 2019 additionally the combination of ndvi and lst thresholds allowed shadow exclusion where shaded pixels are identified by lower ndvi and lst values than the established thresholds 2 5 3 albedo adjustment the original version of metric computes broad band surface albedo α by integrating the at surface reflectance from visible nir and short wave infrared bands using a weighting function allen et al 2007a tasumi et al 2008 eq 2 2 α b 1 n ρ s b w b where ρs b is the at surface reflectance for band b wb is a weighting coefficient table 3 representing the fraction of at surface solar radiation occurring within the spectral range represented by a specific band and n is the number of satellite bands integrated as reported in section 2 3 the sensor on board the uav used in this study while maintaining similar wavelength ranges for the green red and nir bands to those used in ramírez cuesta et al 2019 did not cover the blue and short wave infrared spectrum regions in this respect ramírez cuesta et al 2019 found a similar problem when using hyperspectral data that did not cover the spectral range required by tasumi et al 2008 proposing a new methodology for estimating broad band α by adjusting the original wb tasumi et al 2008 for hyperspectral data table 3 following the same methodology α was computed using the wb proposed by ramírez cuesta et al 2019 table 3 hereafter αstd and compared with the α estimated from different strategies in which the value of wb of the blue band not available in the sequoia multispectral sensor was added to green αblue green red αblue red and nir bands αblue nir respectively table 3 the comparison was performed using 5000 points that were randomly distributed throughout a nearby area flown using the same hyperspectral camera as by ramírez cuesta et al 2019 2 5 4 leaf area index estimation a leaf area index lai ndvi relationship based on the information collected from 2 flight dates 6th june and 10th july 2017 was developed assuming that these two dates were representative of the 5 flight dates in these two dates lai was calculated as the vine leaf area la divided by the total ground surface area assigned as a function of the planting framework i e 3 5 m2 for a vine spacing of 2 5 1 4 m eq 3 3 lai la m 2 planting framework m 2 la 1 4 2 5 la was estimated using linear equations that related the parameter measured by means of a leaf area meter li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln ne usa to total shoot length per vine main plus laterals shoots following the procedure described by buesa et al 2019 briefly allometric relationships were obtained based on individual vine shoots using samples of 15 main shoots and 15 secondary shoots on each date of measurement shoots were collected from border vines from each wr on june 6th and july 10th 2017 on these dates total vine shoot length was determined in the field for all shoots of ten vines five rf and five fi once the lai values for these two dates were estimated they were correlated to the ndvi values for pure grapevine derived from the uav images e g excluding the bare soil this relationship using ndvi of each flight date as the input was used to calculate lai at the pixel level for all pixels classified as grapevine whereas lai of the bare soil was estimated according to allen et al 2007a therefore total lai was obtained by merging the lai raster computed for crop rows and bare ground 2 5 5 aerodynamic adjustment the essential role played by crop morphology on the determination of the surface roughness makes its determination a key aspect commonly experimental methods have used fixed relationships between aerodynamic or momentum roughness length zom and zero plane displacement height d0 and vegetation height h or employed roughness length values associated with each land cover type most applications of the seb models have generally used expressions for zom and d0 determination that are only appropriate for annual agricultural crops tasumi et al 2003 allen et al 2007a 2007b however other authors have improved the aerodynamic parameterization for sparse trees using more complex functions such as the perrier roughness function perrier 1982 based on vegetation indices and tree canopy architecture parameters santos et al 2012 eq 4 4 z om 1 exp alai 2 exp alai 2 h where a is an adjustment factor for the lai distribution within the canopy with a 2 f for f 0 5 and a 2 1 f 1 for f 0 5 the f parameter represents the proportion of lai lying in the upper half of the plant for each experimental unit h was derived from the images acquired with the uav that were incorporated into the metric uav model instead of using the classical experimental relationships between vegetation indices and crop height allen et al 2007a crop height maps were computed by subtracting the digital elevation after vegetation point cloud removal to the digital elevation model of each date fig 4 from this map an average h value for each experimental unit was calculated and assigned only to pixels classified as vegetation whereas for those corresponding to bare soil an h value of zero was assumed fig 4 additionally parameters related with tree canopy for sparse trees involved in the perrier roughness function eq 4 were adjusted to account for the architecture of the vineyard twenty lateral images were taken on july 9th and august 4th 2015 from ten vines each day the f parameter required in the perrier function eq 4 fig 4 was derived by classifying the image into two categories vegetation and non vegetation and calculating the percentage of the vegetated area within the upper half of the vineyard fig 4 a background red curtain was used to avoid the vines located in the back rows that could interfere with the classification fig 4 buesa et al 2019 2 6 seasonal crop evapotranspiration computation the wue kg m 3 was determined as the ratio between grape yield and seasonal etc the latter was estimated by interpolating the daily etc values calculated using the metric uav model to the entire season for this purpose the kco values weighted for the crop line and inter row areas in each sub plot were interpolated to the rest of the days by numerical integration between dates of measurement in the crop line the kco corresponded mainly with the crop transpiration component and to a lesser extent to the wet bulb soil evaporation thus at the crop line kco was interpolated by applying a linear regression between the values of two consecutive flying dates on the contrary in the inter row kco was representative mainly of the soil evaporation component which highly depends on precipitation that occurred on the days prior to the measurement for this reason for the inter row kco was interpolated taking into account weekly rainfall the precipitation occurring the week before each flight was correlated with the kco modelled in the inter row for each flight separately for each sub plot of bare soil and mulching treatments obtaining two 2nd order polynomial relationships with a general regression between kco and weekly precipitation p for bare soil of kco 0 001 p2 0 029 p 0 238 such relationships were used later on a weekly basis to interpolate kco in the inter row if no precipitation occurred during a certain week kco in the inter row was assumed equal to that obtained by metric for each treatment sub plot on flights when no precipitation occurred the previous week finally the etc values were calculated either for the crop line or the inter row by multiplying the kco by the daily et0 for the growing period april 1st to september 20th 2017 total etc values were obtained by merging the etc raster computed for crop rows and bare soil 2 7 statistical analysis the effect of each intensification strategy on i ψstem ii the main outputs obtained by the application of metric uav model α ndvi lai lst rn g h etc and kco iii seasonal water use iv yield and v wue was evaluated with an analysis of variance anova using statistix v 9 analytical software tallahassee fl a single anova for each intensification strategy was performed in order to assess each individual contribution fig 3 specifically for analyzing ψstem differences between treatments in each intensification strategy an anova per field measurement day was carried out on the other hand when analyzing the differences on the main metric uav outputs the interactions between the intensification strategies and the dates of data acquisition hereafter date factor were also assessed to evaluate if the observed responses were dependent on the vineyard phenology additionally for sm and fm since both of them were tested under two irrigation conditions their interaction with wr was also assessed also including the triple interaction with the date factor when the intensification strategy date interaction was significant the mean comparison was performed considering date as a factor whereas if the interaction was not significant a unique mean comparison considering all dates together was performed contrarily the anovas for evaluating differences between treatments on water use yield and wue were performed on the entire season basis for each intensification strategy mean comparisons were performed using fisher s least significant difference test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 adaptation of metric gis to the use of high resolution images the most accurate α estimates using the multispectral camera were obtained with αblue green i e when the blue band coefficient was incorporated to the green band coefficient table 3 that relationship had an r2 of 1 00 practically coinciding with the 1 1 line fig a 1 thus for the application of the metric model using the high resolution images obtained with the multispectral camera α was computed as eq 5 5 α 0 969 0 403 ρ green 0 250 ρ red 0 347 ρ nir 0 004 where ρgreen ρred and ρnir refer to the at surface reflectance in the green red and nir spectral bands respectively grapevine lai values derived from field measurements ranged from 1 05 to 1 62 ndvi values for pure grapevine pixels e g excluding the bare soil computed from the multispectral images oscillated from 0 65 to 0 73 the relationship found between the lai obtained from field measurements and ndvi values had an r2 0 57 with a p value 0 01 and was equal to eq 6 6 lai 4 70 ndvi 1 90 the relationship obtained was incorporated into metric uav as the equation for calculating lai of vineyard classified pixels while maintaining the lai equation proposed by allen et al 2007a for bare soil and herbaceous categories the digital processing of the lateral images retrieved similar f factor values for both days analyzed 0 80 and 0 74 for july 9th and august 4th respectively resulting in an overall general mean value for the f factor of 0 77 0 07 3 2 surface energy balance component from metric uav once the metric gis model was adapted to the high resolution imagery i e metric uav the comparison of the instantaneous available energy rn g and the sum of le and h fluxes for each experimental unit and date showed an r2 equal to 0 99 and a relationship coinciding with the 1 1 line fig a 2 additionally from this graph it can be observed that rn g decreased from the beginning 439 w m 2 to the end of the growing season 273 w m 2 fig a 2 the distribution of the flights within the vineyard growing season allowed for an evaluation of the temporal pattern of lst the main biophysical parameters α ndvi and lai seb components rn g h etc and kco outputted from metric uav specifically fig 5 shows an example of the outputs obtained for june 6th 2017 areas with ndvi lai and kco close to 0 correspond with bare soil non transpiring surfaces on the contrary areas with negative h values and high ndvi lai and kco refer to vegetated surfaces i e crop line the evolution of the biophysical parameters during the growing season in the entire plot fig 6a showed that α varied from 0 13 to 0 22 and lst from 301 to 314 k both vegetation indexes ndvi and lai experienced a slight increase until july 11th reaching a maximum of 0 40 and 1 88 respectively progressively decreasing as the growing season moved forward regarding the temporal pattern evaluation of seb components fig 6b rn exhibited a decreasing trend from june to september with values ranging from 567 w m 2 to 360 w m 2 a slighter variation was experienced by h and g moving from 104 to 191 w m 2 and from 87 to 157 w m 2 respectively additionally as the combination of the crop development and the et0 reduction le decreased almost gradually from 329 w m 2 june 6th to 124 w m 2 september 20th 3 3 management practices assessment table 4 summarizes the results of the anovas performed for evaluating the effect of each sustainable intensification practice in the inter row crop line and both of them together thus focusing on etc and kco it was observed that the wr and date factors were statistically significant p 0 05 however the interactions wrxdate were not significant indicating that the effect from water management did not vary from one date to another i e observed wr pattern repeats for all the assessed dates regarding the sm strategy it was observed that there was a significant smxdate interaction table 4 denoting that the effect of sm was dependent on the date finally for the fm strategy no statistically differences were observed between the different treatments in any of the evaluated variable i e o and o i table 4 in the next subsections the specific effect of the management practices on lst the biophysical parameters α ndvi lai the seb components rn g h le or etc and kco under study are described in depth focusing only on those that were statistically significant i e wr and sm table 4 3 3 1 water regime in general terms no significant differences were observed among the wrs in terms of ψstem until august 22th with the exception of rf which differed from fi and di on june 15th fig 7 from that moment on until the end of the season the wr treatments started to exhibit significant differences with less stress observed in fi versus di and rf with average values for these three dates of 0 87 1 24 and 1 26 mpa respectively from the assessment of the effect of wr on the different seb components by the comparison of fi o b di o b and rf o b it can be derived that fi o b had statistically higher rn values as compared with di o b 6 w m 2 and rf o b 12 w m 2 respectively however these differences were found in the inter row whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in the crop line table 5 regarding g and h no statistically significant differences were observed among treatments with the average value for the dates considered being 119 and 125 w m 2 respectively considering both inter row and crop line the daily etc and kco values were significantly higher for fi o b 3 41 mm d 1 and 0 63 respectively than for rf o b 3 02 mm d 1 and 0 55 respectively on the contrary di o b with daily etc and kco values of 3 23 mm d 1 and 0 59 respectively was not significantly different to fi o b or rf o b table 5 such differences were influenced by the higher ndvi and lai values of fi o b 0 37 and 1 45 respectively in comparison to rf o b 0 33 and 1 36 respectively the higher kc and etc values of fi o b translated into significantly lower lst values in comparison with rf o b with a difference of about 1 k 305 2 k for fi o b and 306 3 k for rf o b table 5 after separately analyzing the inter row and crop line regions and in general terms no differences for ndvi and lai were observed in the inter row whereas in the crop line significant differences between wr treatments in terms of ndvi and lai were obtained table 5 such discrepancies together with the higher vegetated fraction cover of fi o b 27 in comparison with rf o b 22 led to significant differences in the crop line in terms of etc and kco between the treatments that received some irrigation fi o b and di o b in comparison with rf o b etc of 1 54 1 66 mm d 1 for fi o b and di o b versus 1 31 mm d 1 for rf o b and kco of 0 27 0 30 for fi o b and di o b versus 0 23 for rf o b 3 3 2 soil management the presence of mulching led to a better water status under fi and rf conditions being more evident under fi fig 7 under fi conditions the mulching treatment showed significant less negative ψstem values from august 3rd until the end of the season with an average reduction for this temporal interval of 0 16 mpa under rf conditions ψstem reductions were also observed being significant in half of the dates analyzed june 15th and september 5th and 20th with an average reduction in these three dates of 0 11 mpa fig 7 regarding the biophysical parameters and seb components the presence of mulching in the vineyard caused a decrease of α not only in the inter row but also in the crop line table 6 this in general translated into significantly higher rn values in the inter row in the mulching treatment in comparison to the treatment without mulching with average values of 471 and 447 w m 2 respectively but in lower rn values in the crop line with the presence of mulching 524 versus 531 w m 2 as well the effect of mulching on g was not so evident with sporadic days showing significant lower g values in the mulching treatment in the inter row and crop line these differences disappeared in the last two dates september 5th and 20th table 6 for the specific case of h a clear and significant increase was observed both in the inter row average increase of 138 w m 2 and in the crop line increase of 39 w m 2 caused by the presence of mulching this agrees with the higher lst values 4 4 k observed in the mulching treatment in comparison to the bare soil treatment 310 3 k versus 305 9 k as a consequence the application of mulching resulted in a reduction in etc and kco in the inter row etc from 1 73 to 0 61 mm d 1 kco from 0 32 to 0 11 whereas in the crop line an increase of both variables was observed etc from 1 41 to 1 60 mm d 1 kco from 0 25 to 0 29 however the greater proportion of the inter row in comparison to the crop line led to a general decrease in etc and kco 3 4 sustainable intensification strategies to improve water use efficiency the intensification strategies implemented here aimed at adapting the vineyard to the increasing water scarcity in a sustainable way the year 2017 was drier than usual with 322 mm of rainfall 118 mm from april 1st to september 20th the fi treatments received 128 mm while the di treatments received 62 mm tables 7 and 8 summarize the results of grapevine yield as well as seasonal water use the latter split into inter row and crop line and the wue the results were split by experimental factor that is wr sm and fm for the latter two factors the data presented are the average of both levels of wr tested as there was no significant interaction between factors tables 7 and 8 for the fm the results were not analyzed in depth as this factor had no effect on seasonal water use and vine yields regarding the sm factor seasonal water use in the inter row was significantly reduced by 63 in the mulched treatments rf oi m and fi oi m as compared to the ones with bare soil rf oi b and fi oi b tables 7 and 8 it should be noted that in the case of bare soil seasonal water use in the inter row accounted for 54 of all vineyard water use while using mulch reduced it to 28 the wr significantly affected seasonal water use in the crop line but not in the inter row tables 7 and 8 overall rf o b significantly decreased water use by 12 compared to that of fi o b treatment while di o b did not differ from either treatment 4 discussion to date only two source seb models allowed us to directly separate inter row and crop line components in crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil using medium spatial resolution images semmens et al 2016 xia et al 2016 kustas et al 2019 sánchez et al 2019 knipper et al 2020 these approaches allow differentiating soil evaporation and plant transpiration even in pixels containing both types of surfaces as those of landsat and aqua terra satellites despite the robust etc estimates provided by two source models their applicability is mainly limited by the great number of ground measurements involved and by the need for soil and vegetation temperatures li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 in this sense the improved spatial resolution provided by the images acquired from uavs considerably reduce the proportion of mixed pixels being more flexible and useful for detecting frequent changes occurring at the plot scale especially in partially vegetated conditions ramírez cuesta et al 2019 niu et al 2020 however the use of uavs has some limitations related to the sensor viewing angle effects which can cause variation in lst of several degrees for some scenes colaizzi et al 2012 liou and kar 2014 another constrain related to the use of uavs is the uncertainty in the determination of the anchor pixels specially the cold pixel within a specific scene for their application in seb approaches which could not necessarily exist due to its smaller area li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 to solve these limitations in this study a large number of scenes were used for mosaicking the images which allowed us to discard the external parts of the scene where the distortion was higher keeping only the near nadir regions affordable estimates of vine transpiration represent valuable information particularly during the vine growing season for determining vine water use and stress both of which influence grape yield and quality kustas et al 2019 applying metric uav with high resolution images allowed the separation between the inter row and the crop line this is relevant for evaluating the effect of sustainable intensification strategies in orchards with discontinuous canopies specifically when affecting a single component i e soil e g mulching or plant level e g fm lópez urrea et al 2020 alfieri et al 2022 as result of this study the effects of wrs on vine water status were partially in agreement with the seb components in general fi plants showed better water status and transpiration rates than rf ones i e higher etc and lower ψstem fig 7 and table 5 however on the last three dates the better water status observed in fi vines as compared to di plants in terms of ψstem was not found in the crop line when using the metric uav model such inconsistency may be explained because metric focuses on vine et whereas ψstem focuses on just one of the many plant signals used to regulate vine transpiration martorell et al 2015 martínez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 in fact the relationship between ψstem and transpiration is not constant throughout the growing season herrera et al 2022 nonetheless the differences detected on etc between fi and rf treatments highlight the inherent effect of etc on reducing canopy lst which could avoid possible grape composition alterations and photosynthetic damage in response to heat stress events mori et al 2007 greer and weston 2010 the presence of mulching led to a better water status under fi and rf conditions being more evident under fi the observed ψstem pattern agrees with the higher daily etc rates derived from the metric uav model for the mulching treatments when compared with bare soil additionally the separation between the inter row and the crop line allowed us to ascertain that mulching considerably reduced the soil evaporative component in the inter row considered a source of water loss or inefficiency furthermore the use of mulching increased to a lesser extent vine transpiration i e for enhancing plant productivity and or cooling the vine microclimate kool et al 2014 zarrouk et al 2016 however it is worth mentioning that the crop line lst increased with the mulching even if its etc was higher than in the bare soil treatment this could be due to the transfer of the heat from the inter row 5 8 k hotter than without mulching to the plant surface another important advantage of metric when compared with other seb models such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 is that metric uses the alfalfa et0 fraction to extrapolate from instantaneous to daily etc values it allows capturing the effects of potential local advection due to the use of et0 both at the time of image acquisition and for the entire day allen et al 2011 mkhwanazi et al 2015 nevertheless the application of the metric model requires the use of hourly weather data which limits its use in places where weather data at the hourly scale is not available mkhwanazi et al 2015 indeed sm could cause microclimatic changes which affect the vineyard water and seb fluxes and hence the grapevine s response to wr fandiño et al 2012 on the other hand at the whole vineyard level both the etc and kco decreased in the mulching treatment as compared to the bare soil management due to the greater area of the inter row component resulting in a 28 seasonal water use under both wrs this water saving is a remarkable achievement for semi arid regions medrano et al 2015 moreover supplementary fertilization had no effects on any of the parameters analyzed tables 4 7 and 8 suggesting that vine nutrition requirements were fully satisfied within each wr by soil fertility and the organic amendment applied in 2016 regardless the effects of the strategies on water use only changes in water and soil management significantly affected wue with the differences observed between treatments being even greater in terms of yield consequently the large increase in yield caused by fi as compared to the increase in etc resulted in a significant wue increase tables 7 and 8 this is in part because the irrigated plots within the vineyard had been also irrigated in the previous seasons and therefore the yield values registered were also a consequence of the mid term application of irrigation however the obtained results differed from those reported by other authors where rf treatments obtained higher wue than fully irrigated vines calculating wue as the ratio between yield and the volume of irrigation water plus rainfall medrano et al 2015 mirás avalos intrigliolo 2017 this highlights the importance of determining water use and not assuming that water applied equals water consumed although it should be noted that particularly in woody perennial crops seasonal water use does not necessarily have to be strongly correlated with yield intrigliolo and castel 2008 buesa et al 2017 that is the case for instance for the large reductions found using metric uav on seasonal water use in mulching compared to bare soil under both wrs this management strategy did not lead to yield differences and therefore wue significantly increased by the application of mulching nonetheless the results regarding sm assessment should be interpreted taking into account the possible uncertainties of the metric model for estimating g in the presence of mulching agam et al 2019 in this regard further exploration of the vineyard soil energy balance may be beneficial kool et al 2016 the results obtained in terms of kco in particular those referring to vines under fi conditions are in agreement with the values observed in previous research which derived relationships between vegetation indexes obtained from remote sensing e g lai and vegetated fraction cover and kco measured with lysimeters williams and ayars 2005 netzer et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 when comparing the vineyard kco obtained from these previous empirical relationships kco from 0 33 to 0 56 with those reported here resulting from the application of the metric uav model with high resolution imagery kco from 0 47 to 0 52 similar values were obtained with discrepancies oscillating between 3 and 9 in this regard it is important to highlight the importance of reducing uncertainties in lai values using uavs by obtaining the relationship between field measured la and ndvi kang et al 2022 moreover more studies evaluating the performance of other vis for deriving lai are required nevertheless despite these promising results the drawback of the approach used here is that etc determinations were carried out only at some specific moments during the season and even of the day and therefore potential misinterpretations when attempting to upscale the results to an entire season could be generated kustas et al 2022 the challenge will therefore be to integrate ground and remote sensing information to obtain solutions for sensor networks sensors installed on the ground will provide real time information continuously collecting data about the dynamic water use while remote sensing will allow determining etc at a larger scale but with a low temporal resolution 5 conclusions using the metric uav model with high resolution images proved to be useful in assessing water use in woody crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil this also allowed to evaluate of the effects of different sustainable intensification strategies separately in the inter row and the crop line components irrespective of possible model uncertainties in the estimation of the seb fluxes and those associated with the etc calculation within the time intervals among the five flight dates carried out in this study with the proposed approach we were also able to derive the following more agronomic conclusions that could be useful for increasing viticulture sustainability di and mulching are promising strategies for a sustainable vineyard intensification under semi arid growing conditions as both enhance wue the fertilization strategies evaluated showed no effects on the short term vineyard seb fluxes and wue the application of mulching reduced soil water evaporation in the inter row at the same time that it increased crop line transpiration resulting in water savings of 28 both full and di regimes resulted in increased crop line transpiration compared to the rainfed treatment without altering inter row water consumption which together with yield gains resulted in significant improvements in wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9004,because of climate change and the scarce availability of natural resources there is a need to develop sustainable intensification strategies intended for optimizing water use in vineyards in this study water regime fertilization and soil management practices were assessed in terms of vineyard water use by evaluating the inter row and crop line evapotranspiration et components using the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model in combination with unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral and thermal images taken on five dates throughout the growing season the application of the metric uav using high resolution imagery was proven as a useful tool for evaluating the effects of sustainable intensification strategies on water use of crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil identifying the most efficient site specific strategies for water conservation purposes moreover metric uav allowed evaluating separately their effects on the inter row and the crop line among the assessed sustainable intensification strategies the application of mulching provided the highest water savings 28 when compared to traditional soil tillage management reducing inter row soil evaporation by 63 while increasing crop line et by 14 in spite of this the mulching application did not affect yield but significantly enhanced water use efficiency wue in terms of grape yield compared to tillage the adoption of deficit irrigation di strategies did not result in vine water stress that was severe enough to significantly affect crop line et when compared with fully irrigated fi vines both di and fi strategies increased vine water use by 18 and 27 respectively as compared to the rainfed regime with no differences found in the inter row water consumption di and fi in turn significantly increased yield as compared to rainfed crops leading to significant improvements in wue in the short term the application of supplemental inorganic

increasingly threatened by the effects of climate change that include an overall warmer scenario and the shifting in precipitation patterns diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 ipcc 2021 despite the high uncertainties related to climate models olesen et al 2007 and to the effects of increasing carbon dioxide on water requirements chamizo et al 2017 crops will likely increase their potential water requirements under future climatic conditions döll 2002 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 the mediterranean basin will be especially impacted highlighting the severe changes in air temperature and rainfall in the iberian peninsula webber et al 2018 moreover grapevines are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to the impact of shifts in phenology and water stress on grape composition and wine quality van leeuwen and darriet 2016 gambetta 2016 bonada et al 2018 viticultural practices should play a key role in reducing water use alleviating grapevine water stress and improving water use efficiency wue i e yield produced per unit of water consumed by crops medrano et al 2015 bambach et al 2022 in this regard possible strategies for sustainable intensification of water resources in vineyards include changes in plant material scions and rootstocks and in viticultural techniques ollat et al 2016 these latter are based on alleviating the undesired effects of both water stress and higher temperatures on vine performance as example they include the adoption of different irrigation regimes for increasing soil water content mccarthy et al 2002 intrigliolo and castel 2010 the use of cover crops monteiro and lopes 2007 and the application of mulch for reducing soil evaporation lópez urrea et al 2020 furthermore fertilization management can be used to regulate vine vigour through its effects on vine water relations and nutritional status schreiner et al 2013 however all the above studies do not quantify water use at the vineyard level the effectiveness of sustainable intensification strategies is commonly assessed by using classical methods based on ground measurements such as those intended for measuring structural and geometric parameters e g crop height canopy volume shoot length and yield tardaguila et al 2012 buesa et al 2020 maclaren et al 2022 and for evaluating crop water and nutritional status e g pressure chamber sap flow and leaf and soil analysis roccuzzo et al 2012 villalobos et al 2013 consoli et al 2017 however most of them are high cost time consuming and destructive methods that due to their time specific nature may not reflect the high crop heterogeneity especially in woody crops bramley and hamilton 2004 aquino et al 2018 technological advances in the last decades have provided alternatives to the above mentioned classical ground based methods such as imaging based methods particularly remarkable when on board remote proximal sensing acquisition platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles uav these allow covering large spatial areas capturing the spatial variability within the vineyard in a non destructive time and cost effective way acevedo opazo et al 2008 dorigo et al 2007 research efforts are oriented to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the et products using multi source remote sensing data or data fusion techniques knipper et al 2019 xue et al 2022 additionally sensors on board uav provide high resolution data which allows segmenting bare soil from pure vegetation rango et al 2009 matese et al 2015 ballesteros et al 2015 several authors have used multispectral and thermal data obtained from

response to water stress than those based on the visible and the near infrared regions ramírez cuesta et al 2022 it is because the thermal infrared region reflects the fast crop temperature increases due to the stomatal closure caused by a site specific stress khanal et al 2017 and changes in photosynthetic activity wong et al 2022 the sensitivity of thermal based remote sensing is the base of

internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b model is applied among the numerous available seb models because it requires a minimum auxiliary ground based dataset especially when compared to seb models that demand many more parameters additionally the metric model performs an automatic internal calibration thus eliminating the need for an exact atmospheric correction and reducing the impacts of any biases on the estimation of aerodynamic stability correction or surface roughness this internal calibration can be performed within each remotely sensed image analyzed allen et al 2007a li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 the main goal of this study was to address vineyard water requirements and wue in a semi arid climate under several sustainable intensification practices such as water

fig 2 the daily et0 values averaged over 5 mm and the weeks with rainfall greater than 10 mm occurred three times during the growing season 2 2 experimental design the influence of 3 sustainable intensification strategies including the modification of wr fm and sm was assessed on the seb components fig 3 the experimental design was distributed in 4 randomized complete blocks containing 7 experimental treatments combining the 3 management factors table 1 each sub plot consisted of 5 rows where the internal 18 vines were experimental whereas the perimeter vines acted as borders the wr factor hypothesizes that under rainfed rf conditions excessive water stress may severely impair vineyard yield and on the other hand that full irrigation fi would not result in a higher wue this factor considered 3 levels rf fi and deficit irrigation di conditions rf treatments were not watered for the previous 5 growing seasons whereas the di and fi treatments were watered at 50 etc until veraison after which water was withheld and at 100 etc respectively the wr factor was evaluated by comparing the rf o b fi o b and di o b treatments in these treatments the soil in the inter row was kept bare by soil tillage b and organic amendment was applied o table 1 the fm factor hypothesizes that there are strong interactions between wue and nitrogen use efficiency and thus management practices should focus on enhancing both simultaneously quemada and gabriel 2016 taking into account that the response to the fm strategy may differ between the different wr a 2 factorial combination of two fertilization strategies the application of an organic amendment o and a supplemental inorganic fertilizer application o i and two wr rf and fi was established following the recommendations provided by garcía escudero 2010 all four treatments were organically fertilized with buried manure in 2016 at a rate of 116 93 139 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively in 2017 only the inorganic fertilization treatments were supplemented at a rate of 53 35 105 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively in the rf treatments the supplementary fertilizer application was done manually in spring with subsequent subsoiling and in the fi treatments it was applied during the same period by fertigation a volume of water without fertilizer equal that of the fertigation treatments was applied to the fi o b treatment specifically the rf o b rf oi b fi o b and fi oi b treatments were utilized for evaluating fm the sm factor hypothesizes that mulching can reduce soil evaporation thereby enhancing vine water status and especially under rf conditions increasing yield and wue medrano et al 2015 thus a 2 factorial combination of two sm practices consisting of soil tillage bare where the soil was tilled twice per season and mulching with no tillage mulch and two wr rf and fi was assessed the mulching consisted of a 3 5 cm layer of crushed pruning waste distributed on the entire soil surface without tilling the soil throughout the season the evaluation of sm was performed by comparing the rf oi b and rf oi m fi oi b and fi oi m treatments weather conditions were recorded using an automated meteorological station located in the plot the et0 was calculated with the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 and the irrigation scheduling was based on the canopy cover crop coefficient kco relationships reported by lópez urrea et al 2012 thus kco values were 0 25 0 35 from bud break to flowering 0 40 0 50 from flowering to veraison and 0 50 0 60 from veraison to harvest consequently etc for fi was computed by multiplying the et0 by the kco values 2 3 airborne campaigns five uav campaigns were carried out during the 2017 growing season covering all vineyard stages table 2 multispectral and thermal sensors installed on board a quadcopter md4 1000 microdrones inc kreuztal germany was used flights were performed under sunny conditions between 10 00 and 10 30 gmt at 80 m above ground level the multispectral sensor was a sequoia camera parrot paris france which acquired four bands covering the green red red edge and near infra red nir spectral regions of the light spectrum with center wavelengths at 550 640 735 and 790 nm respectively the focal length was 3 98 mm yielding a pixel size of 7 cm the sensor was a 4 8 3 6 mm charge coupled device ccd with a pixel size of 3 75 3 75 µm resulting in an image size of 1280 960 columns and rows image acquisition was established according to a flight plan computed using microdrones photogrammetric flight planning software hernandez lopez et al 2013 multispectral images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected the radiometric calibration was performed using an aircalib calibration panel airinov paris france whereas for the geometric correction eight coordinates known targets were distributed covering the entire field 3 of them located within the experimental area green points in fig 1 the accurate locations of the targets were obtained using a leica gps 1200 leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland linked to a global navigation satellite system gnss permanent reference station providing an estimated accuracy of 0 02 and 0 03 m in planimetry and altimetry respectively the orthoimages were generated using structure from motion techniques with pix4d software pix4d s a lausanne switzerland the thermal sensor used to obtain the thermal images was the flir tau2 flir systems inc wilsonville oregon united states with a focal of 9 mm fov 69 56 an uncooled microbolometer of 640 h x 520 v a pixel size of 17 µm a spectral band ranging between 7 5 and 13 5 µm and a weight of approximately 72 g without a lens a camera calibration procedure was performed by following the methodology proposed by ribeiro gomes et al 2016 which considers the temperature changes in the sensor case and the highly non linear relationships with the digital response of the camera allowing us to obtain a measurement error of 1 37 ºc since uav data is less influenced by atmospheric effects than images acquired from satellite due to the proximity of the targets aragon et al 2020 a full atmospheric correction was not necessary thus in order to validate the uav data on the ground thermal data was measured with an apogee mi 210 infrared thermometer apogee instruments inc united states on the cold pixel surface and on a black surface placed on the plot at the flight time 5 measurements per surface type and flight data not shown all the geomatic data were obtained for the crs epsg 25830 in planimetry and epsg 5782 in altimetry 2 4 field measurements for all flight dates table 2 vine stem water potential ψstem was measured on three west side oriented leaves per sub plot using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument company albany or usa measurements were performed at midday 11 30 12 30 h gmt on non transpiring leaves that were bagged for at least 1 h prior to measurement in hermetic plastic bags covered with aluminum foil at harvest grapevine yield was determined on each experimental vine 2 5 crop evapotranspiration calculation using the metric model the metric gis tool ramírez cuesta et al 2020 was used to estimate spatially distributed etc this tool is an arcgis toolbox that implements the metric model allen et al 2007a for determining the latent heat flux le in w m 2 and therefore the etc as a residual of the seb equation eq 1 1 le r n g h where rn is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 in addition kco values were calculated as the ratio between etc and et0 at the image acquisition time the detailed formulation of each component and the procedure used to upscale from instantaneous to daily kco and etc values can be found in allen et al 2007a metric gis was initially developed for using satellite images as input i e landsat satellite images so different adjustments were made to adapt it to high resolution uav images herein metric uav and to improve the agro system characterization 2 5 1 anchor pixels selection in general the metric model requires the identification of two anchor pixels where the h value is reliably assumed named as hot and cold pixels for etc calculation allen et al 2007a ramírez cuesta et al 2020 however the relatively small area covered by the uavs makes difficult finding pixels that meet the requirement expected for the hot and cold conditions especially those referring to the latter under semi arid conditions allen et al 2013 bhattarai et al 2017 saboori et al 2021 therefore to ensure the presence of cold conditions potential etc in the acquired images a 10 10 m of cynodon dactylon l pers var celebration was planted at the beginning of the season 20 m away from the study area fig 1 it was fully irrigated prior the uav campaign in order to ensure non water stress conditions during image acquisition regarding the hot pixel no specific actions were required due to presence of multiple candidates in the surrounding area the et0 fraction referred to the standardized 0 5 m tall alfalfa reference assigned to the cold and the hot pixels were 1 00 and 0 05 respectively 2 5 2 land use classification from a preliminary analysis of the land use categories located in the study area which allowed a better parameterization and estimation of the surface roughness parameter three different classes were differentiated herbaceous grapevine and bare soil class values 81 82 and 31 respectively according to united states geological survey national land cover database definitions the herbaceous class was manually delineated as it was concentrated on the cold region see 2 5 1 anchor pixel selection whereas a more complex procedure was required for the differentiation between grapevine and bare soil named vegetation segmentation thus for the delineation of the grapevine category a multi criteria approach based on the combination of the multispectral and thermal images was adopted in the present study this approach benefits from the noticeable difference of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lst between the vegetation and the bare soil therefore ndvi and lst isolines with a spacing of 0 01 and 0 5 k respectively were created from these isolines ndvi and lst thresholds values were visually selected in the region of contact between the soil and the plant i e where the isolines were closer to each other thus a pixel was respectively classified as grapevine when characterized by ndvi and lst values higher and lower than the thresholds selected for ndvi and lst alternatively if the ndvi and lst of a pixel was lower and higher than the selected thresholds the pixel was classified as bare soil when only one condition was met i e or ndvi or lst which occurred in a negligible proportion of the total study area the pixel was not considered in the study since these pixels indicate a displacement between multispectral and thermal images this displacement has been noted as a common issue when dealing with two different sensors on board a uav ramírez cuesta et al 2019 additionally the combination of ndvi and lst thresholds allowed shadow exclusion where shaded pixels are identified by lower ndvi and lst values than the established thresholds 2 5 3 albedo adjustment the original version of metric computes broad band surface albedo α by integrating the at surface reflectance from visible nir and short wave infrared bands using a weighting function allen et al 2007a tasumi et al 2008 eq 2 2 α b 1 n ρ s b w b where ρs b is the at surface reflectance for band b wb is a weighting coefficient table 3 representing the fraction of at surface solar radiation occurring within the spectral range represented by a specific band and n is the number of satellite bands integrated as reported in section 2 3 the sensor on board the uav used in this study while maintaining similar wavelength ranges for the green red and nir bands to those used in ramírez cuesta et al 2019 did not cover the blue and short wave infrared spectrum regions in this respect ramírez cuesta et al 2019 found a similar problem when using hyperspectral data that did not cover the spectral range required by tasumi et al 2008 proposing a new methodology for estimating broad band α by adjusting the original wb tasumi et al 2008 for hyperspectral data table 3 following the same methodology α was computed using the wb proposed by ramírez cuesta et al 2019 table 3 hereafter αstd and compared with the α estimated from different strategies in which the value of wb of the blue band not available in the sequoia multispectral sensor was added to green αblue green red αblue red and nir bands αblue nir respectively table 3 the comparison was performed using 5000 points that were randomly distributed throughout a nearby area flown using the same hyperspectral camera as by ramírez cuesta et al 2019 2 5 4 leaf area index estimation a leaf area index lai ndvi relationship based on the information collected from 2 flight dates 6th june and 10th july 2017 was developed assuming that these two dates were representative of the 5 flight dates in these two dates lai was calculated as the vine leaf area la divided by the total ground surface area assigned as a function of the planting framework i e 3 5 m2 for a vine spacing of 2 5 1 4 m eq 3 3 lai la m 2 planting framework m 2 la 1 4 2 5 la was estimated using linear equations that related the parameter measured by means of a leaf area meter li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln ne usa to total shoot length per vine main plus laterals shoots following the procedure described by buesa et al 2019 briefly allometric relationships were obtained based on individual vine shoots using samples of 15 main shoots and 15 secondary shoots on each date of measurement shoots were collected from border vines from each wr on june 6th and july 10th 2017 on these dates total vine shoot length was determined in the field for all shoots of ten vines five rf and five fi once the lai values for these two dates were estimated they were correlated to the ndvi values for pure grapevine derived from the uav images e g excluding the bare soil this relationship using ndvi of each flight date as the input was used to calculate lai at the pixel level for all pixels classified as grapevine whereas lai of the bare soil was estimated according to allen et al 2007a therefore total lai was obtained by merging the lai raster computed for crop rows and bare ground 2 5 5 aerodynamic adjustment the essential role played by crop morphology on the determination of the surface roughness makes its determination a key aspect commonly experimental methods have used fixed relationships between aerodynamic or momentum roughness length zom and zero plane displacement height d0 and vegetation height h or employed roughness length values associated with each land cover type most applications of the seb models have generally used expressions for zom and d0 determination that are only appropriate for annual agricultural crops tasumi et al 2003 allen et al 2007a 2007b however other authors have improved the aerodynamic parameterization for sparse trees using more complex functions such as the perrier roughness function perrier 1982 based on vegetation indices and tree canopy architecture parameters santos et al 2012 eq 4 4 z om 1 exp alai 2 exp alai 2 h where a is an adjustment factor for the lai distribution within the canopy with a 2 f for f 0 5 and a 2 1 f 1 for f 0 5 the f parameter represents the proportion of lai lying in the upper half of the plant for each experimental unit h was derived from the images acquired with the uav that were incorporated into the metric uav model instead of using the classical experimental relationships between vegetation indices and crop height allen et al 2007a crop height maps were computed by subtracting the digital elevation after vegetation point cloud removal to the digital elevation model of each date fig 4 from this map an average h value for each experimental unit was calculated and assigned only to pixels classified as vegetation whereas for those corresponding to bare soil an h value of zero was assumed fig 4 additionally parameters related with tree canopy for sparse trees involved in the perrier roughness function eq 4 were adjusted to account for the architecture of the vineyard twenty lateral images were taken on july 9th and august 4th 2015 from ten vines each day the f parameter required in the perrier function eq 4 fig 4 was derived by classifying the image into two categories vegetation and non vegetation and calculating the percentage of the vegetated area within the upper half of the vineyard fig 4 a background red curtain was used to avoid the vines located in the back rows that could interfere with the classification fig 4 buesa et al 2019 2 6 seasonal crop evapotranspiration computation the wue kg m 3 was determined as the ratio between grape yield and seasonal etc the latter was estimated by interpolating the daily etc values calculated using the metric uav model to the entire season for this purpose the kco values weighted for the crop line and inter row areas in each sub plot were interpolated to the rest of the days by numerical integration between dates of measurement in the crop line the kco corresponded mainly with the crop transpiration component and to a lesser extent to the wet bulb soil evaporation thus at the crop line kco was interpolated by applying a linear regression between the values of two consecutive flying dates on the contrary in the inter row kco was representative mainly of the soil evaporation component which highly depends on precipitation that occurred on the days prior to the measurement for this reason for the inter row kco was interpolated taking into account weekly rainfall the precipitation occurring the week before each flight was correlated with the kco modelled in the inter row for each flight separately for each sub plot of bare soil and mulching treatments obtaining two 2nd order polynomial relationships with a general regression between kco and weekly precipitation p for bare soil of kco 0 001 p2 0 029 p 0 238 such relationships were used later on a weekly basis to interpolate kco in the inter row if no precipitation occurred during a certain week kco in the inter row was assumed equal to that obtained by metric for each treatment sub plot on flights when no precipitation occurred the previous week finally the etc values were calculated either for the crop line or the inter row by multiplying the kco by the daily et0 for the growing period april 1st to september 20th 2017 total etc values were obtained by merging the etc raster computed for crop rows and bare soil 2 7 statistical analysis the effect of each intensification strategy on i ψstem ii the main outputs obtained by the application of metric uav model α ndvi lai lst rn g h etc and kco iii seasonal water use iv yield and v wue was evaluated with an analysis of variance anova using statistix v 9 analytical software tallahassee fl a single anova for each intensification strategy was performed in order to assess each individual contribution fig 3 specifically for analyzing ψstem differences between treatments in each intensification strategy an anova per field measurement day was carried out on the other hand when analyzing the differences on the main metric uav outputs the interactions between the intensification strategies and the dates of data acquisition hereafter date factor were also assessed to evaluate if the observed responses were dependent on the vineyard phenology additionally for sm and fm since both of them were tested under two irrigation conditions their interaction with wr was also assessed also including the triple interaction with the date factor when the intensification strategy date interaction was significant the mean comparison was performed considering date as a factor whereas if the interaction was not significant a unique mean comparison considering all dates together was performed contrarily the anovas for evaluating differences between treatments on water use yield and wue were performed on the entire season basis for each intensification strategy mean comparisons were performed using fisher s least significant difference test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 adaptation of metric gis to the use of high resolution images the most accurate α estimates using the multispectral camera were obtained with αblue green i e when the blue band coefficient was incorporated to the green band coefficient table 3 that relationship had an r2 of 1 00 practically coinciding with the 1 1 line fig a 1 thus for the application of the metric model using the high resolution images obtained with the multispectral camera α was computed as eq 5 5 α 0 969 0 403 ρ green 0 250 ρ red 0 347 ρ nir 0 004 where ρgreen ρred and ρnir refer to the at surface reflectance in the green red and nir spectral bands respectively grapevine lai values derived from field measurements ranged from 1 05 to 1 62 ndvi values for pure grapevine pixels e g excluding the bare soil computed from the multispectral images oscillated from 0 65 to 0 73 the relationship found between the lai obtained from field measurements and ndvi values had an r2 0 57 with a p value 0 01 and was equal to eq 6 6 lai 4 70 ndvi 1 90 the relationship obtained was incorporated into metric uav as the equation for calculating lai of vineyard classified pixels while maintaining the lai equation proposed by allen et al 2007a for bare soil and herbaceous categories the digital processing of the lateral images retrieved similar f factor values for both days analyzed 0 80 and 0 74 for july 9th and august 4th respectively resulting in an overall general mean value for the f factor of 0 77 0 07 3 2 surface energy balance component from metric uav once the metric gis model was adapted to the high resolution imagery i e metric uav the comparison of the instantaneous available energy rn g and the sum of le and h fluxes for each experimental unit and date showed an r2 equal to 0 99 and a relationship coinciding with the 1 1 line fig a 2 additionally from this graph it can be observed that rn g decreased from the beginning 439 w m 2 to the end of the growing season 273 w m 2 fig a 2 the distribution of the flights within the vineyard growing season allowed for an evaluation of the temporal pattern of lst the main biophysical parameters α ndvi and lai seb components rn g h etc and kco outputted from metric uav specifically fig 5 shows an example of the outputs obtained for june 6th 2017 areas with ndvi lai and kco close to 0 correspond with bare soil non transpiring surfaces on the contrary areas with negative h values and high ndvi lai and kco refer to vegetated surfaces i e crop line the evolution of the biophysical parameters during the growing season in the entire plot fig 6a showed that α varied from 0 13 to 0 22 and lst from 301 to 314 k both vegetation indexes ndvi and lai experienced a slight increase until july 11th reaching a maximum of 0 40 and 1 88 respectively progressively decreasing as the growing season moved forward regarding the temporal pattern evaluation of seb components fig 6b rn exhibited a decreasing trend from june to september with values ranging from 567 w m 2 to 360 w m 2 a slighter variation was experienced by h and g moving from 104 to 191 w m 2 and from 87 to 157 w m 2 respectively additionally as the combination of the crop development and the et0 reduction le decreased almost gradually from 329 w m 2 june 6th to 124 w m 2 september 20th 3 3 management practices assessment table 4 summarizes the results of the anovas performed for evaluating the effect of each sustainable intensification practice in the inter row crop line and both of them together thus focusing on etc and kco it was observed that the wr and date factors were statistically significant p 0 05 however the interactions wrxdate were not significant indicating that the effect from water management did not vary from one date to another i e observed wr pattern repeats for all the assessed dates regarding the sm strategy it was observed that there was a significant smxdate interaction table 4 denoting that the effect of sm was dependent on the date finally for the fm strategy no statistically differences were observed between the different treatments in any of the evaluated variable i e o and o i table 4 in the next subsections the specific effect of the management practices on lst the biophysical parameters α ndvi lai the seb components rn g h le or etc and kco under study are described in depth focusing only on those that were statistically significant i e wr and sm table 4 3 3 1 water regime in general terms no significant differences were observed among the wrs in terms of ψstem until august 22th with the exception of rf which differed from fi and di on june 15th fig 7 from that moment on until the end of the season the wr treatments started to exhibit significant differences with less stress observed in fi versus di and rf with average values for these three dates of 0 87 1 24 and 1 26 mpa respectively from the assessment of the effect of wr on the different seb components by the comparison of fi o b di o b and rf o b it can be derived that fi o b had statistically higher rn values as compared with di o b 6 w m 2 and rf o b 12 w m 2 respectively however these differences were found in the inter row whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in the crop line table 5 regarding g and h no statistically significant differences were observed among treatments with the average value for the dates considered being 119 and 125 w m 2 respectively considering both inter row and crop line the daily etc and kco values were significantly higher for fi o b 3 41 mm d 1 and 0 63 respectively than for rf o b 3 02 mm d 1 and 0 55 respectively on the contrary di o b with daily etc and kco values of 3 23 mm d 1 and 0 59 respectively was not significantly different to fi o b or rf o b table 5 such differences were influenced by the higher ndvi and lai values of fi o b 0 37 and 1 45 respectively in comparison to rf o b 0 33 and 1 36 respectively the higher kc and etc values of fi o b translated into significantly lower lst values in comparison with rf o b with a difference of about 1 k 305 2 k for fi o b and 306 3 k for rf o b table 5 after separately analyzing the inter row and crop line regions and in general terms no differences for ndvi and lai were observed in the inter row whereas in the crop line significant differences between wr treatments in terms of ndvi and lai were obtained table 5 such discrepancies together with the higher vegetated fraction cover of fi o b 27 in comparison with rf o b 22 led to significant differences in the crop line in terms of etc and kco between the treatments that received some irrigation fi o b and di o b in comparison with rf o b etc of 1 54 1 66 mm d 1 for fi o b and di o b versus 1 31 mm d 1 for rf o b and kco of 0 27 0 30 for fi o b and di o b versus 0 23 for rf o b 3 3 2 soil management the presence of mulching led to a better water status under fi and rf conditions being more evident under fi fig 7 under fi conditions the mulching treatment showed significant less negative ψstem values from august 3rd until the end of the season with an average reduction for this temporal interval of 0 16 mpa under rf conditions ψstem reductions were also observed being significant in half of the dates analyzed june 15th and september 5th and 20th with an average reduction in these three dates of 0 11 mpa fig 7 regarding the biophysical parameters and seb components the presence of mulching in the vineyard caused a decrease of α not only in the inter row but also in the crop line table 6 this in general translated into significantly higher rn values in the inter row in the mulching treatment in comparison to the treatment without mulching with average values of 471 and 447 w m 2 respectively but in lower rn values in the crop line with the presence of mulching 524 versus 531 w m 2 as well the effect of mulching on g was not so evident with sporadic days showing significant lower g values in the mulching treatment in the inter row and crop line these differences disappeared in the last two dates september 5th and 20th table 6 for the specific case of h a clear and significant increase was observed both in the inter row average increase of 138 w m 2 and in the crop line increase of 39 w m 2 caused by the presence of mulching this agrees with the higher lst values 4 4 k observed in the mulching treatment in comparison to the bare soil treatment 310 3 k versus 305 9 k as a consequence the application of mulching resulted in a reduction in etc and kco in the inter row etc from 1 73 to 0 61 mm d 1 kco from 0 32 to 0 11 whereas in the crop line an increase of both variables was observed etc from 1 41 to 1 60 mm d 1 kco from 0 25 to 0 29 however the greater proportion of the inter row in comparison to the crop line led to a general decrease in etc and kco 3 4 sustainable intensification strategies to improve water use efficiency the intensification strategies implemented here aimed at adapting the vineyard to the increasing water scarcity in a sustainable way the year 2017 was drier than usual with 322 mm of rainfall 118 mm from april 1st to september 20th the fi treatments received 128 mm while the di treatments received 62 mm tables 7 and 8 summarize the results of grapevine yield as well as seasonal water use the latter split into inter row and crop line and the wue the results were split by experimental factor that is wr sm and fm for the latter two factors the data presented are the average of both levels of wr tested as there was no significant interaction between factors tables 7 and 8 for the fm the results were not analyzed in depth as this factor had no effect on seasonal water use and vine yields regarding the sm factor seasonal water use in the inter row was significantly reduced by 63 in the mulched treatments rf oi m and fi oi m as compared to the ones with bare soil rf oi b and fi oi b tables 7 and 8 it should be noted that in the case of bare soil seasonal water use in the inter row accounted for 54 of all vineyard water use while using mulch reduced it to 28 the wr significantly affected seasonal water use in the crop line but not in the inter row tables 7 and 8 overall rf o b significantly decreased water use by 12 compared to that of fi o b treatment while di o b did not differ from either treatment 4 discussion to date only two source seb models allowed us to directly separate inter row and crop line components in crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil using medium spatial resolution images semmens et al 2016 xia et al 2016 kustas et al 2019 sánchez et al 2019 knipper et al 2020 these approaches allow differentiating soil evaporation and plant transpiration even in pixels containing both types of surfaces as those of landsat and aqua terra satellites despite the robust etc estimates provided by two source models their applicability is mainly limited by the great number of ground measurements involved and by the need for soil and vegetation temperatures li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 in this sense the improved spatial resolution provided by the images acquired from uavs considerably reduce the proportion of mixed pixels being more flexible and useful for detecting frequent changes occurring at the plot scale especially in partially vegetated conditions ramírez cuesta et al 2019 niu et al 2020 however the use of uavs has some limitations related to the sensor viewing angle effects which can cause variation in lst of several degrees for some scenes colaizzi et al 2012 liou and kar 2014 another constrain related to the use of uavs is the uncertainty in the determination of the anchor pixels specially the cold pixel within a specific scene for their application in seb approaches which could not necessarily exist due to its smaller area li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 to solve these limitations in this study a large number of scenes were used for mosaicking the images which allowed us to discard the external parts of the scene where the distortion was higher keeping only the near nadir regions affordable estimates of vine transpiration represent valuable information particularly during the vine growing season for determining vine water use and stress both of which influence grape yield and quality kustas et al 2019 applying metric uav with high resolution images allowed the separation between the inter row and the crop line this is relevant for evaluating the effect of sustainable intensification strategies in orchards with discontinuous canopies specifically when affecting a single component i e soil e g mulching or plant level e g fm lópez urrea et al 2020 alfieri et al 2022 as result of this study the effects of wrs on vine water status were partially in agreement with the seb components in general fi plants showed better water status and transpiration rates than rf ones i e higher etc and lower ψstem fig 7 and table 5 however on the last three dates the better water status observed in fi vines as compared to di plants in terms of ψstem was not found in the crop line when using the metric uav model such inconsistency may be explained because metric focuses on vine et whereas ψstem focuses on just one of the many plant signals used to regulate vine transpiration martorell et al 2015 martínez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 in fact the relationship between ψstem and transpiration is not constant throughout the growing season herrera et al 2022 nonetheless the differences detected on etc between fi and rf treatments highlight the inherent effect of etc on reducing canopy lst which could avoid possible grape composition alterations and photosynthetic damage in response to heat stress events mori et al 2007 greer and weston 2010 the presence of mulching led to a better water status under fi and rf conditions being more evident under fi the observed ψstem pattern agrees with the higher daily etc rates derived from the metric uav model for the mulching treatments when compared with bare soil additionally the separation between the inter row and the crop line allowed us to ascertain that mulching considerably reduced the soil evaporative component in the inter row considered a source of water loss or inefficiency furthermore the use of mulching increased to a lesser extent vine transpiration i e for enhancing plant productivity and or cooling the vine microclimate kool et al 2014 zarrouk et al 2016 however it is worth mentioning that the crop line lst increased with the mulching even if its etc was higher than in the bare soil treatment this could be due to the transfer of the heat from the inter row 5 8 k hotter than without mulching to the plant surface another important advantage of metric when compared with other seb models such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 is that metric uses the alfalfa et0 fraction to extrapolate from instantaneous to daily etc values it allows capturing the effects of potential local advection due to the use of et0 both at the time of image acquisition and for the entire day allen et al 2011 mkhwanazi et al 2015 nevertheless the application of the metric model requires the use of hourly weather data which limits its use in places where weather data at the hourly scale is not available mkhwanazi et al 2015 indeed sm could cause microclimatic changes which affect the vineyard water and seb fluxes and hence the grapevine s response to wr fandiño et al 2012 on the other hand at the whole vineyard level both the etc and kco decreased in the mulching treatment as compared to the bare soil management due to the greater area of the inter row component resulting in a 28 seasonal water use under both wrs this water saving is a remarkable achievement for semi arid regions medrano et al 2015 moreover supplementary fertilization had no effects on any of the parameters analyzed tables 4 7 and 8 suggesting that vine nutrition requirements were fully satisfied within each wr by soil fertility and the organic amendment applied in 2016 regardless the effects of the strategies on water use only changes in water and soil management significantly affected wue with the differences observed between treatments being even greater in terms of yield consequently the large increase in yield caused by fi as compared to the increase in etc resulted in a significant wue increase tables 7 and 8 this is in part because the irrigated plots within the vineyard had been also irrigated in the previous seasons and therefore the yield values registered were also a consequence of the mid term application of irrigation however the obtained results differed from those reported by other authors where rf treatments obtained higher wue than fully irrigated vines calculating wue as the ratio between yield and the volume of irrigation water plus rainfall medrano et al 2015 mirás avalos intrigliolo 2017 this highlights the importance of determining water use and not assuming that water applied equals water consumed although it should be noted that particularly in woody perennial crops seasonal water use does not necessarily have to be strongly correlated with yield intrigliolo and castel 2008 buesa et al 2017 that is the case for instance for the large reductions found using metric uav on seasonal water use in mulching compared to bare soil under both wrs this management strategy did not lead to yield differences and therefore wue significantly increased by the application of mulching nonetheless the results regarding sm assessment should be interpreted taking into account the possible uncertainties of the metric model for estimating g in the presence of mulching agam et al 2019 in this regard further exploration of the vineyard soil energy balance may be beneficial kool et al 2016 the results obtained in terms of kco in particular those referring to vines under fi conditions are in agreement with the values observed in previous research which derived relationships between vegetation indexes obtained from remote sensing e g lai and vegetated fraction cover and kco measured with lysimeters williams and ayars 2005 netzer et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 when comparing the vineyard kco obtained from these previous empirical relationships kco from 0 33 to 0 56 with those reported here resulting from the application of the metric uav model with high resolution imagery kco from 0 47 to 0 52 similar values were obtained with discrepancies oscillating between 3 and 9 in this regard it is important to highlight the importance of reducing uncertainties in lai values using uavs by obtaining the relationship between field measured la and ndvi kang et al 2022 moreover more studies evaluating the performance of other vis for deriving lai are required nevertheless despite these promising results the drawback of the approach used here is that etc determinations were carried out only at some specific moments during the season and even of the day and therefore potential misinterpretations when attempting to upscale the results to an entire season could be generated kustas et al 2022 the challenge will therefore be to integrate ground and remote sensing information to obtain solutions for sensor networks sensors installed on the ground will provide real time information continuously collecting data about the dynamic water use while remote sensing will allow determining etc at a larger scale but with a low temporal resolution 5 conclusions using the metric uav model with high resolution images proved to be useful in assessing water use in woody crops where vegetation does not completely cover the soil this also allowed to evaluate of the effects of different sustainable intensification strategies separately in the inter row and the crop line components irrespective of possible model uncertainties in the estimation of the seb fluxes and those associated with the etc calculation within the time intervals among the five flight dates carried out in this study with the proposed approach we were also able to derive the following more agronomic conclusions that could be useful for increasing viticulture sustainability di and mulching are promising strategies for a sustainable vineyard intensification under semi arid growing conditions as both enhance wue the fertilization strategies evaluated showed no effects on the short term vineyard seb fluxes and wue the application of mulching reduced soil water evaporation in the inter row at the same time that it increased crop line transpiration resulting in water savings of 28 both full and di regimes resulted in increased crop line transpiration compared to the rainfed treatment without altering inter row water consumption which together with yield gains resulted in significant improvements in wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
