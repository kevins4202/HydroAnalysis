17250,conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat micropollutants thus for 20 years several complementary treatment systems such as surface flow wetlands have been used to address this issue previous studies demonstrate that higher residence time and low global velocities promote nutrient removal rates or micropollutant photodegradation nevertheless these studies were restricted to the system limits inlet outlet therefore detailed knowledge of water flow is crucial for identifying areas that promote degradation and optimise surface flow wetlands the present study combines 3d water flow numerical modelling and liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms using this numerical model validated by tracer experimental data several velocity areas were distinguished in the wetland four areas were selected to investigate the waterflow influence and led to the following results on the one hand the number and concentration of micropollutants are independent of the waterflow which could be due to several assumptions such as the chronic exposure associated with a low reynolds number on the other hand the potential degradation products metabolites were also assessed in the sludge to investigate the micropollutant biodegradation processes occurring in the wetland micropollutant metabolites or degradation products were detected in higher proportions both number and concentration in lower flow rate areas the relation to higher levels of plant and microorganism metabolites suggests higher biological activity that promotes degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants mass spectrometry computational fluid dynamics water flow modelling sludge surface flow wetland 1 introduction in the past decades water quality and micropollutant issues have become major concerns in the water treatment field recent progress has confirmed this trend with the establishment of the watch list in european laws decision 2015 495 eu of 20 march 2015 barbosa et al 2016 mailler et al 2017 micropollutants found in the environment have several origins but urban wastewater is one of the most cited kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 petrie et al 2015 phillips et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 indeed a wide variety of our daily activities generate micropollutants which end up in wastewater washing cooking or drug consumption and subsequently in wastewater treatment plants wwtps these wastewater treatment systems have not been designed to treat micropollutants nevertheless in the literature waste water treatment systems and particularly constructed wetlands cw show their efficiency in the treatment of some micropollutants hijosa valsero et al 2010 matamoros and bayona 2006 vymazal et al 2017 in this way part of the micropollutants can be caught by the different compartments of these systems whereas others are released into the environment additionally wwtps face sustainability issues reuse of water derived resources and reduction of their environmental footprint wang et al 2015 therefore constructed wetlands and natural based treatment systems seem to be well suited to these new challenges in europe complementary treatment systems have been installed for 20 years and can improve micropollutant removal and reduce the impact of direct release into the environment wwtps could disturb the environmental balance for example tong et al mention the impact of the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in lakes found near a wwtp outlet tong et al 2020 surface flow treatment wetlands sftw are particularly popular in rural communities mara et al 1992 and offer several benefits such as complementary treatment for micropollutants described in one of our previous studies nuel et al 2018 furthermore the literature mentions hydraulics specifically residence time as one of the major factors that could influence micropollutant removal boonnorat et al 2016 ejhed et al 2018 esperanza et al 2007 gros et al 2010 the increase in residence time can promote different mechanisms that are useful for micropollutant management for example longer residence time improves the biodegradation koch et al 1999 siegrist et al 1995 of conventional pollutants such as nutrients concerning micropollutants photodegradation or sorption in sludge could be promoted by higher residence time in this kind of system rühmland et al 2015 thus reducing their release into the environment nonetheless most studies focus on the boundary conditions of the system inlet outlet to characterise removal efficiency and compare global hydraulic parameters such as residence time distribution however these global parameters could also hide the influence of specific areas inside water treatment systems therefore a deep knowledge of hydraulics is crucial to understand the potential influence of water flow velocity on the distribution and degradation of micropollutants and would be useful to optimise the processes nonetheless few studies consider different regions inside a system to compare those that could influence distribution or promote micropollutant removal gaullier et al 2020 among these studies mali et al 2018 used a 2d hydrodynamics model combined with a passive scalar transport equation to determine metal distribution in a port their simulations show the influence of water flow velocity in the studied system another study conducted by gaullier et al 2020 highlighted the heterogeneous distribution of pesticides in constructed wetlands using tracer experiments in different water flow velocity areas nevertheless this study did not consider the degradation process and therefore the fate of these pesticides was not fully investigated as such the aim of this study was to obtain detailed knowledge of water flow velocities in a surface flow wetland and to determine if these velocities could influence micropollutant distribution and degradation therefore we propose the first 3d surface wetland model based on real study site geometry combined with large scale micropollutant screening this transient water flow model was validated by a tracer experiment comparison between experimental tracer experiment and simulation using a passive scalar transport equation and built to define sludge collection areas as sludge is a static compartment micropollutants are sorbed according to their properties and affinity with solids and can provide a general overview of the chronic micropollutant load in this way micropollutant analysis was linked to water flow process modelling to understand the potential influence of the water flow velocity field on the spatial distribution and degradation of micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is an sftw located in lutter 47 27 47 7 n 7 22 29 9 e grand est france and implemented in 2009 the sftw is a shallow water pond with an impervious layer of clay to counter the high permeability of the natural soil the sftw has a surface of 750 m² maximal width of approximately 13 m maximal length of approximately 40 m and a heterogeneous depth the sftw has not yet been cleaned and mud has been accumulating since 2009 this sftw was constructed at the outlet of a two stage vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw that collects wastewater 1000 population equivalent before releasing it to the sftw and finally into the river all details concerning sftw can be found in laurent et al 2015 2 2 hydrodynamics numerical model 2 2 1 water flow and passive scalar transport governing equations computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were performed on openfoam 4 0 using the unsteady solver pimplefoam which was chosen for its ability to solve the navier stokes equations in unsteady mode and consider incompressible and turbulent conditions for the flow resolution such turbulent conditions were observed in the sftw inlet the corresponding continuity 1 and momentum equations 2 are given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u p υ δ u where u is the velocity p the pressure υ the kinematic viscosity and t the time because of calculation costs constraints only water flow was considered in this study a tracker simulation was performed to validate the model considering the tracker as a passive scalar the equation governing the passive scalar transport 3 is given as 3 c t u c 2 d m c q m where c is the tracker concentration u is the velocity t is the time dm is the tracker diffusion coefficient sulforhodamine dm 3 6 10 6 m² s 1 and qm is the pollutant source term a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with a turbulence closure scheme was used to solve these equations the standard k ɛ model was selected for the turbulence as it is well adapted for large flow fields and has been used in several water flow simulations in ponds alvarado et al 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 the simulations were performed using second order schemes and the results were extracted after convergence all simulation results were obtained with residuals lower than 10 7 2 2 2 computational domains and boundary conditions the cfd model geometry was built using data collected in the field indeed all the surface points defining the limits of the computational domain were obtained using a gps system the domain was then split into 1 square meter subdomains and the depth was measured manually using a bathymetry approach all the data were used to build a 3d geometry of the sftw figure s1 shows an overview of the study site used for the 3d model regarding the boundary conditions the following hypothesis was applied to the simulations first an inlet flow rate was defined for each simulation sftw flow rate monitoring was performed using ultrasonic probes ijinus mellac france and built in exponential section venturis isma forbach france as described by nuel et al nuel et al 2017 then the average flow rate was calculated and used for each simulation this hypothesis can be applied as the difference between the maximum and minimum sftw flow rate measurements was not significant according to the results obtained by nuel et al nuel et al 2017 the outlet pressure was considered at the outlet whereas no slip conditions were considered for the bank and the ground of the sftw finally symmetry conditions were used for the water surface for the tracker experiment an inlet mass flow rate was defined with a mass flow rate of approximately 100 mg s during the first 300 s of the simulation subsequently the geometry was meshed the mesh size was chosen to fulfil a y criterion between 30 and 300 in accordance with criteria for the standard k ɛ model according to the recommendations found in versteeg et al versteeg and malalasekera 2007 this y criterion was calculated using equation 4 4 δ s 2 0 026 1 2 y μ 13 14 ρ u 13 14 l 1 14 where u is the averaged velocity m s ρ is the water density kg m 3 µ is the dynamic viscosity kg m 1 s 1 l is the average water depth m and δs is the mesh size in cm using this criterion the recommended mesh size was between 1 1 and 11 cm to reduce the calculation cost the selected mesh size was 10 cm this choice was checked during the model validation step the model resulting from these choices has 1 5 million grid cells 2 2 3 model validation the numerical model results were compared with the tracker experimental results obtained in the field to ensure model and meshing validity tracer campaigns were performed with sulforhodamine b srb c27h29n2nao7s2 as a fluorescent dye to estimate the sftw residence time as described in detail in laurent et al laurent et al 2015 briefly an instantaneous pulse of tracer was injected at the inlet and the tracer concentrations were monitored by a fluorometer ggun fl30 albilia switzerland connected to a peristaltic pump operating continuously at 1 l s 1 fluorometer readings were calibrated on site by water samples collected at the same location and spiked with known tracer amounts these results were then compared to numerical simulations using the passive scalar simulation described in section 2 2 1 alvarado et al alvarado et al 2013 and coggins et al coggins et al 2017 suggest the use of residence time to validate an sftw water flow model figure s2 underlines the proper fit between the simulated and experimental curves thus the model can reproduce the outlet signal based on the results the model was validated for the rest of the study 2 3 chemicals acetic acid and formic acid were acquired from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the extraction solvents acetonitrile methanol and

aldrich 2 5 micropollutants extraction micropollutants were analysed in the sludge samples water flow modelling defines the sludge sampling strategy described in section 3 1 in each defined area a composite of surface sludge the first ten cm was collected in each season as this layer was in direct contact with the wastewater the samples were stored at 4 c before analysis all analyses were performed using 3 biological replicates micropollutants were extracted as described by villette et al 2019a briefly 10 g of sludge was weighed and double extraction was performed the first overnight extraction was performed using 40 ml of acetonitrile water 90 10 with 1 acetic acid at 4 c under shaking with a magnetic stirrer the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 5500 rpm and the supernatant was collected then a second extraction was performed on the pellet using 20 ml of isopropanol acetonitrile 90 10 for 15 min at 4 c under shaking the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 5500 rpm and the supernatant was recovered and freeze dried finally the samples were solubilised in 1 ml of acetonitrile isopropanol water 50 45 5 parallel blank extraction was performed in each season 2 6 micropollutant analysis the samples were analysed in liquid chromatography lc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms the method used targetscreener method bruker was mentioned in villette

broad band collision induced dissociation bbcid with an ms ms collision energy set at 30 ev an analytical quality check was performed using a mix of pesticides to assess the retention time refs 31972 and 31978 restek the detailed procedure and operational parameters can be found in villette et al 2019a 2 7 data processing the annotations for the lc hrms ms data were performed using tasq 1 4 bruker daltonics which contains a database of 2204 drugs and injected pesticides and has been used to annotate ions in a targeted way based on the retention time m z value isotopic pattern of the parent ion msigma and qualifier ions daughter ion using this database which contains micropollutant commercial injection standards all identification reached level 1 according to the schymanski classification the selection criteria were a signal to noise ratio higher than 3 a retention time variation lower than 0 3 min an exact mass variation lower than 3 ppm and matching fragment ions when available to obtain the most representative view of the contamination only micropollutants found in all seasons and in 3 biological replicates with available commercial standards were quantified the mean concentration was determined using all the replicates and the standard deviation represents the variation found in the different seasons for each replicate additionally predicted catabolites and conjugates metabolites of the micropollutants were annotated using in silico predictions performed in metabolite predict 2 0 bruker germany pelander et al 2009 this annotation process has already been described in villette et al 2019b briefly 79 biotransformation rules were applied to the structure of the parent drugs to generate metabolites over two generations the software then generated a list of raw formulae containing potential metabolites but also retrieved the enzymes generating the metabolites finally raw formula lists were imported into metaboscape 4 0 for annotation to perform suspect screening of the metabolites the data are compared with raw formulae generated using smartformula as mentioned in villette et al 2019b the metabolites mentioned in this study were only those found in all seasons and in 3 biological replicates finally the data were analysed using a non targeted method following the processing mentioned in villette et al 2019a the annotations were performed using a criterion of mass deviation lower than 3 ppm and msigma value under 30 to assess the good fit of the isotope pattern raw formula annotations were then generated using c h n o p s cl i br and f elements then tentative identification level 3 of the schymanski classification schymanski et al 2015 was performed using analyte lists created from the toxic exposome database http www t3db ca foodb

www swgdrug org norman network https www norman network net plantcyc https www plantcyc org knapsack http kanaya naist jp knapsack and swisslipids http www swisslipids org additionally the metabolites were analysed using a statistical enrichment approach that is based on chemical similarity with the online chemrich tool http chemrich fiehnlab ucdavis edu barupal and fiehn 2017 all chemical identifiers smiles pubchem id and inchikey were manually collected using the pubchem identifier exchanger tool https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov idexchange idexchange cgi the identifiers were used to

samples were replicated three times in a non target way each area was analysed separately the samples were clustered in metaboscape 4 0 bruker daltonics according to the seasons and all the adduct forms were grouped in a bucket briefly using the value count of group attributes only compounds found in 80 of group samples water flow areas were selected the metabolic profile was therefore investigated by comparing area by area based on a wilcoxon rank sum test non parametric test results were considered significantly different using the fold change differences 2 or 2 and a p value 0 05 the fold change associated with the different couples and the associated p values were recovered for use in chemrich the complete dataset statistically differential and non differential values was submitted to chemrich with the fold change converted to an average ratio chemrich thresholds were p value 0 05 and fold change 2 or 2 to consider that a compound is significantly up or down regulated in a specific condition here the pond and to obtain the chemical enrichment analysis results 3 results 3 1 water flow process modelling and areas selection the sftw was affected by weather conditions thus different inlet flow rates were measured the distribution of these inlet flow rates measured during eight campaigns over a period of two years is shown in figure s3 among these flow rates one inlet flow rate condition per season figure 1 was simulated to underline the water flow velocity field diversity that could be observed on the sftw simulations of the three slowest flow rates winter with 7 2 m3 h 1 summer with 5 1 m3 h 1 and autumn with 4 2 m3 h 1 induced similar hydraulic behaviour and a preferential flow between the inlet and outlet was observed the increase in the inlet flow rate can generate vortices simulation a in figure 1 rendering the inlet outlet link unclear nevertheless figure s3 highlights the extreme nature of this phenomenon therefore the spring simulation simulation a in figure 1 in which vortices appear was excluded from the rest of the study the similar water flow behaviour observed in the three other simulations provided a global overview of the sftw hydraulic behaviour even if a slow flow rate was created at the sftw inlet variations could be observed and the water flow velocity field seems to be particularly low near the banks in comparison to other sftw areas relatively higher water flow can be observed near the inlet and outlet whereas a low inlet flow rate is always detected in the sftw thus areas were clustered according to perpetual inlet outlet and preferential flow areas or rare areas near the banks water flow according to the three lowest flow rate simulations figure 1 a sampling strategy was defined to collect sludge samples in the different flow rate areas four areas were selected as depicted in figure 2 the principal points of the water treatment system with relatively higher and perpetual flows the inlet area a and outlet area d respectively were selected to overcome these boundary conditions two areas were chosen considering the water flow heterogeneity inside the sftw therefore sludge was collected in an area with an intermediate higher and perpetual flow rate defined in figure 2 as area b and in areas near the banks with very low flow rate area c these areas were used for different seasonal sampling campaigns to analyse micropollutants and to understand the influence of flow rate on the presence of micropollutants in the sludge 3 2 distribution of identified micropollutants according to the water flow areas micropollutant analysis was performed for each season in the areas of interest results are given in figure s4 and dataset 1 micropollutant distributions fluctuate by season and are apparently unrelated to water flow to overcome the seasonal effect and obtain a global overview only the compounds found in all seasons were considered the results are shown in figure 3 this general analysis indicates that the number of micropollutants found in the different sampling areas seems to be similar indeed seven micropollutants were found in areas b and d six in area c and four in area a additionally most of the compounds were found in at least two sampling areas even if some micropollutants were only detected in a single area and more than half of the micropollutants detected 100 in area a 71 in area b and d and 67 in area c were found in at least two areas most micropollutants had concentrations between 40 400 µg kg 1 of sludge and little variation in concentration was noticed between the different detection areas for example irbesartan was detected at concentrations between 76 125 µg kg 1 only celiprolol was found at a higher concentration in area c 491 µg kg 1 in area a and 1187 µg kg 1 in area c 3 3 distribution of micropollutants metabolites in the different water flow areas studies show that the analysis of parent compounds alone underestimates the amounts of micropollutants found in the environment metabolites potential conjugates or degradation products could be found in higher quantities than parent compounds yin et al 2017 therefore micropollutant metabolites predicted derivatives were also analysed for each season in the areas of interest the results are shown in figure s4 and dataset 2 a similar trend can be found in the different seasons with a higher number of metabolites in relatively low water flow areas b c this general trend is highlighted by the compounds found in all seasons in figure 4 and the global overview indicates that more compounds are identified in lower flow rate areas 14 in area b and 15 in area c than in higher flow rate areas 4 in area a and 6 in area d additionally very few compounds are common to different areas and a wide variety of metabolite intensities were detected several drugs and their metabolites were studied figure 5 and higher amounts of tramadol and venlafaxine were found higher diversity in area c and irbesartan metabolites in area b were detected suggesting that the lower flow rate influences metabolization however the number of metabolites detected is not necessarily related to the amount of parent compounds the number of metabolites is positively correlated for tramadol higher numbers of metabolites when tramadol is not detected whereas the opposite phenomenon was observed for venlafaxine higher numbers of metabolites when the venlafaxine concentration is approximately 123 µg kg 1 sludge 4 discussion 4 1 influence of boundary conditions figures 1 and 2 highlight the low velocity field in the sftw which could be caused by several phenomena such as the low inlet flow rates compared to the pond sizes the head losses resulting from the presence of vegetation the shallow depth and the rough sides the influence of water depth was investigated by coggins et al with a focus on the impact of sludge accumulation on hydraulic performance coggins et al 2017 thus the areas of sftw that contain the most accumulated sludge and the areas near the banks have the lowest flow velocity field and are characterised by a very high hydraulic residence time and consequently a low solid transport phenomenon however water quality with higher nutrient removal nitrogen and phosphorus can be improved by increasing residence time akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 huang 2000 a higher water flow velocity field was detected at the boundary points of the system inlet and outlet area due to the boundary conditions constrictions leading to a high rate of sludge renewal 4 2 no correlation between parent compounds distribution and water flow velocities the micropollutant analysis performed in different areas did not highlight significant differences in their number and concentration except for celiprolol indeed almost the same number of micropollutants and similar concentrations were found in these areas however according to the literature the sedimentation and sequestration of compounds in the solid phase should be promoted in lower water flow velocity fields montiel león et al 2019 these comments are supported by studies that have investigated the influence of water flow velocities on contaminant concentrations and sequestration gaullier et al 2020 mali et al 2018 gaullier et al 2020 suggest that higher pesticide storage in lower velocity areas is related to transport types convection is promoted in high velocity areas and mali et al found higher metal deposition in a weaker flow in a port mali et al 2018 nevertheless the higher velocities mentioned in their study impact flow patterns and could partly explain the differences therefore our study used deep knowledge of water flow in treatment systems to determine that water flow velocity fields are not the key parameters governing the distribution of micropollutants the difference in water velocities is unlikely to significantly influence a specific micropollutant distribution the reynolds number in the sftw was low and the flow observed in the sftw was generally laminar or low turbulent except at the inlet and outlet reducing the velocity difference in these areas this trend was confirmed by the analysis of the areas of xenobiotics putatively identified in all the sampling areas shown in figure s6 this broader view highlights that most of the micropollutants are found in similar proportions in different areas fold change 2 absolute value additionally the study of physicochemical properties log kow solubility pka as mentioned in li et al 2019 does not highlight any correlation between micropollutant detection and these properties the impact of water flow velocity could probably be highlighted by other assumptions such as solid transport or higher inlet flow rate probably helps distinguish areas based on their micropollutant composition if velocity differences between sftw areas are increased sequestration could be affected however all the results found for these micropollutants should be tempered with the distribution of all the putative identifications from non targeted analyses figure s7 the general trend emphasizes that the low flow rate area area c seems to accumulate slightly more xenobiotics and plant metabolites than other areas these results are apparently more coherent with those found in the lit erature another assumption that may explain the lack of differences in concentration or area could be related to parent compound degradation as higher sedimentation probably occurs in the lower flow rate areas however this sedimentation should be hidden by degradation which has also been enhanced in these areas 4 3 in situ low water flow areas promote micropollutant degradation parent compounds have been found in minor amounts compared to their metabolites yin et al 2017 this degradation process could not be neglected in the sftw as micropollutant biodegradation with conjugations and deconjugations has been described in this type of system tiwari et al 2017 in our study the distribution of micropollutant metabolites appears to be primarily influenced by water flow and more biotransformation products are found in areas with scarce water flow 14 in area b and 15 in area c versus 4 and 6 in areas a and d respectively however these areas are not located in the principal water flow channel and could be subject to intermittent flow rožman et al highlight that a system with intermittent water flow provides a higher biodegradation capacity than one with permanent water flow due to the biofilm development rožman et al 2018 these conclusions support our observations additionally areas with higher residence time can provide conditions stimulating degradation such as increased potential contact time with microorganisms the influence of prolonged contact time in a bioreactor to improve micropollutant transformation has been demonstrated asif et al 2018 boonnorat et al 2016 similarly the results shown in figure 5 suggest that the higher numbers of micropollutant metabolites in the lower flow rate areas b and c is not necessarily related to the number of parent compounds as phenomena such as metabolite transport could occur a broader analysis of the data shows that the metabolite distribution apparently follows a general trend a closer look at the elemental composition reveals that compounds with less than 15 or 10 carbons showed the same distribution as that described for micropollutant metabolites figure s8 and dataset s3 the lower flow rate areas b or c seem to stimulate compound deposition and transformation and the conditions promoting biodegradation were indicated by the non target analysis and chemical class investigation using chemrich barupal and fiehn 2017 figure s9 the results highlight the specific detection of alkaloids and monoterpenes in the lower velocity areas such observations are not surprising as plants grow near wetland banks additionally phosphatidylethanolamines the primary component of the bacterial membrane were also detected therefore the compound annotations seem to indicate higher biological activities that combine plants and microorganisms furthermore investigation of the networks and biological pathways detected in the different areas figure s10 also suggests a higher biological activity in lower velocity areas complex relationships were primarily observed in the lower velocity areas area c and the network data showed that succinate was mainly found in the low flow rate area on the one hand nguyen et al demonstrated that bacteria fed with this succinate could improve energetic efficiency leading to a higher drug sulfomethoxazole removal rate nguyen et al 2017 on the other hand this activity was also observed with the detection of p cymene detection which is a biogas marker and component of anaerobic digestion moreno et al 2014 finally a general biodegradation process seems to occur in sftw most of the metabolites found 59 seem to be generated according to a biodegradation process using cytochrome p450 hydroxylation or epoxidation followed by different transferase dehydrogenase hydrolase and esterase activities figure s11 cytochrome p450 plays a key role in phase i metabolism for several herbicides can degrade a wide variety of micropollutants due to their low specificity cañameras et al 2015 and could explain the general process described here this study was restricted to biodegradation but other abiotic processes such as photodegradation or environmental conditions ph redox could also be considered to understand the fate of micropollutants in the sftw de laurentiis et al 2012 ávila et al 2013 lee et al 2014 rühmland et al 2015 5 conclusion this study investigated micropollutant distribution and degradation trends in sftw wetlands the investigation was conducted by combining the following a deep knowledge of hydraulic behaviour in the sftw obtained through a 3d model based on real study site geometry large scale screening of micropollutants and their metabolites based on this new approach the results underlined the following micropollutant behaviours in the sftw wetland a homogeneous distribution of parent compounds throughout the sftw wetland higher amounts of micropollutant metabolites in lower flow rate areas than in areas with faster flow rates therefore the low flow rate conditions seem to promote degradation and the results suggest that the velocity differences have an impact on metabolite distribution environmental conditions promoting micropollutant degradation are found in low flow rate conditions higher biological activity was detected due to the higher number of microorganisms or plant metabolites and the analysis of small molecules molecular formula comprised of less than 15 or 10 carbons future research needs should be considered to strengthen micropollutant distribution and degradation trends in water treatment systems for example the results obtained in this study highlighted the independence of micropollutant distribution from the velocity field but were obtained on our models that did not considered for example transport of solids or abiotic transformations therefore these assumptions could be considered in future research additionally the results were only obtained for sftw wetlands to strengthen the conclusions observed in this kind of system the results should be compared with those of different systems operating in different geographical areas with different flow rates funding sources this project was funded by a grant from the agence de l

kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 petrie et al 2015 phillips et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 indeed a wide variety of our daily activities generate micropollutants which end up in wastewater washing cooking or drug consumption and subsequently in wastewater treatment plants wwtps these wastewater treatment systems have not been designed to treat micropollutants nevertheless in the literature waste water treatment systems and particularly constructed wetlands cw show their efficiency in the treatment of some micropollutants hijosa valsero et al 2010 matamoros and bayona 2006 vymazal et al 2017 in this way part of the micropollutants can be caught by the different compartments of these systems whereas others are released into the environment additionally wwtps face sustainability issues reuse of water derived resources and reduction of their environmental footprint wang et al 2015 therefore constructed wetlands and natural based treatment systems seem to be well suited to these new challenges in europe complementary treatment systems have been installed for 20 years and can improve micropollutant removal and reduce the impact of direct release into the environment wwtps could disturb the environmental balance for example tong et al mention the impact of the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in lakes found near a wwtp outlet tong et al 2020 surface flow treatment wetlands sftw are particularly popular in rural communities mara et al 1992 and offer several benefits such as complementary treatment for micropollutants described in one of our previous studies nuel et al 2018 furthermore the literature mentions hydraulics specifically residence time as one of the major factors that could influence micropollutant removal boonnorat et al 2016 ejhed et al 2018 esperanza et al 2007 gros et al 2010 the increase in residence time can promote different mechanisms that are useful for micropollutant management for example longer residence time improves the biodegradation koch et al 1999 siegrist et al 1995 of conventional pollutants such as nutrients concerning micropollutants photodegradation or sorption in sludge could be promoted by higher residence time in this kind of system rühmland et al 2015 thus reducing their release into the environment nonetheless most studies focus on the boundary conditions of the system inlet outlet to characterise removal efficiency and compare global hydraulic parameters such as residence time distribution however these global parameters could also hide the influence of specific areas inside water treatment systems therefore a deep knowledge of hydraulics is crucial to understand the potential influence of water flow velocity on the distribution and degradation of micropollutants and would be useful to optimise the processes nonetheless few studies consider different regions inside a system to compare those that could influence distribution or promote micropollutant removal gaullier et al 2020 among these studies mali et al 2018 used a 2d hydrodynamics model combined with a passive scalar transport equation to determine metal distribution in a port their simulations show the influence of water flow velocity in the studied system another study conducted by gaullier et al 2020 highlighted the heterogeneous distribution of pesticides in constructed wetlands using tracer experiments in different water flow velocity areas nevertheless this study did not consider the degradation process and therefore the fate of these pesticides was not fully investigated as such the aim of this study was to obtain detailed knowledge of water flow velocities in a surface flow wetland and to determine if these velocities could influence micropollutant distribution and degradation therefore we propose the first 3d surface wetland model based on real study site geometry combined with large scale micropollutant screening this transient water flow model was validated by a tracer experiment comparison between experimental tracer experiment and simulation using a passive scalar transport equation and built to define sludge collection areas as sludge is a static compartment micropollutants are sorbed according to their properties and affinity with solids and can provide a general overview of the chronic micropollutant load in this way micropollutant analysis was linked to water flow process modelling to understand the potential influence of the water flow velocity field on the spatial distribution and degradation of micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is an sftw located in lutter 47 27 47 7 n 7 22 29 9 e grand est france and implemented in 2009 the sftw is a shallow water pond with an impervious layer of clay to counter the high permeability of the natural soil the sftw has a surface of 750 m² maximal width of approximately 13 m maximal length of approximately 40 m and a heterogeneous depth the sftw has not yet been cleaned and mud has been accumulating since 2009 this sftw was constructed at the outlet of a two stage vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw that collects wastewater 1000 population equivalent before releasing it to the sftw and finally into the river all details concerning sftw can be found in laurent et al 2015 2 2 hydrodynamics numerical model 2 2 1 water flow and passive scalar transport governing equations computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were performed on openfoam 4 0 using the unsteady solver pimplefoam which was chosen for its ability to solve the navier stokes equations in unsteady mode and consider incompressible and turbulent conditions for the flow resolution such turbulent conditions were observed in the sftw inlet the corresponding continuity 1 and momentum equations 2 are given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u p υ δ u where u is the velocity p the pressure υ the kinematic viscosity and t the time because of calculation costs constraints only water flow was considered in this study a tracker simulation was performed to validate the model considering the tracker as a passive scalar the equation governing the passive scalar transport 3 is given as 3 c t u c 2 d m c q m where c is the tracker concentration u is the velocity t is the time dm is the tracker diffusion coefficient sulforhodamine dm 3 6 10 6 m² s 1 and qm is the pollutant source term a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with a turbulence closure scheme was used to solve these equations the standard k ɛ model was selected for the turbulence as it is well adapted for large flow fields and has been used in several water flow simulations in ponds alvarado et al 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 the simulations were performed using second order schemes and the results were extracted after convergence all simulation results were obtained with residuals lower than 10 7 2 2 2 computational domains and boundary conditions the cfd model geometry was built using data collected in the field indeed all the surface points defining the limits of the computational domain were obtained using a gps system the domain was then split into 1 square meter subdomains and the depth was measured manually using a bathymetry approach all the data were used to build a 3d geometry of the sftw figure s1 shows an overview of the study site used for the 3d model regarding the boundary conditions the following hypothesis was applied to the simulations first an inlet flow rate was defined for each simulation sftw flow rate monitoring was performed using ultrasonic probes ijinus mellac france and built in exponential section venturis isma forbach france as described by nuel et al nuel et al 2017 then the average flow rate was calculated and used for each simulation this hypothesis can be applied as the difference between the maximum and minimum sftw flow rate measurements was not significant according to the results obtained by nuel et al nuel et al 2017 the outlet pressure was considered at the outlet whereas no slip conditions were considered for the bank and the ground of the sftw finally symmetry conditions were used for the water surface for the tracker experiment an inlet mass flow rate was defined with a mass flow rate of approximately 100 mg s during the first 300 s of the simulation subsequently the geometry was meshed the mesh size was chosen to fulfil a y criterion between 30 and 300 in accordance with criteria for the standard k ɛ model according to the recommendations found in versteeg et al versteeg and malalasekera 2007 this y criterion was calculated using equation 4 4 δ s 2 0 026 1 2 y μ 13 14 ρ u 13 14 l 1 14 where u is the averaged velocity m s ρ is the water density kg m 3 µ is the dynamic viscosity kg m 1 s 1 l is the average water depth m and δs is the mesh size in cm using this criterion the recommended mesh size was between 1 1 and 11 cm to reduce the calculation cost the selected mesh size was 10 cm this choice was checked during the model validation step the model resulting from these choices has 1 5 million grid cells 2 2 3 model validation the numerical model results were compared with the tracker experimental results obtained in the field to ensure model and meshing validity tracer campaigns were performed with sulforhodamine b srb c27h29n2nao7s2 as a fluorescent dye to estimate the sftw residence time as described in detail in laurent et al laurent et al 2015 briefly an instantaneous pulse of tracer was injected at the inlet and the tracer concentrations were monitored by a fluorometer ggun fl30 albilia switzerland connected to a peristaltic pump operating continuously at 1 l s 1 fluorometer readings were calibrated on site by water samples collected at the same location and spiked with known tracer amounts these results were then compared to numerical simulations using the passive scalar simulation described in section 2 2 1 alvarado et al alvarado et al 2013 and coggins et al coggins et al 2017 suggest the use of residence time to validate an sftw water flow model figure s2 underlines the proper fit between the simulated and experimental curves thus the model can reproduce the outlet signal based on the results the model was validated for the rest of the study 2 3 chemicals acetic acid and formic acid were acquired from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the extraction solvents acetonitrile methanol and

aldrich 2 5 micropollutants extraction micropollutants were analysed in the sludge samples water flow modelling defines the sludge sampling strategy described in section 3 1 in each defined area a composite of surface sludge the first ten cm was collected in each season as this layer was in direct contact with the wastewater the samples were stored at 4 c before analysis all analyses were performed using 3 biological replicates micropollutants were extracted as described by villette et al 2019a briefly 10 g of sludge was weighed and double extraction was performed the first overnight extraction was performed using 40 ml of acetonitrile water 90 10 with 1 acetic acid at 4 c under shaking with a magnetic stirrer the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 5500 rpm and the supernatant was collected then a second extraction was performed on the pellet using 20 ml of isopropanol acetonitrile 90 10 for 15 min at 4 c under shaking the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 5500 rpm and the supernatant was recovered and freeze dried finally the samples were solubilised in 1 ml of acetonitrile isopropanol water 50 45 5 parallel blank extraction was performed in each season 2 6 micropollutant analysis the samples were analysed in liquid chromatography lc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms the method used targetscreener method bruker was mentioned in villette

and 31978 restek the detailed procedure and operational parameters can be found in villette et al 2019a 2 7 data processing the annotations for the lc hrms ms data were performed using tasq 1 4 bruker daltonics which contains a database of 2204 drugs and injected pesticides and has been used to annotate ions in a targeted way based on the retention time m z value isotopic pattern of the parent ion msigma and qualifier ions daughter ion using this database which contains micropollutant commercial injection standards all identification reached level 1 according to the schymanski classification the selection criteria were a signal to noise ratio higher than 3 a retention time variation lower than 0 3 min an exact mass variation lower than 3 ppm and matching fragment ions when available to obtain the most representative view of the contamination only micropollutants found in all seasons and in 3 biological replicates with available commercial standards were quantified the mean concentration was determined using all the replicates and the standard deviation represents the variation found in the different seasons for each replicate additionally predicted catabolites and conjugates metabolites of the micropollutants were annotated using in silico predictions performed in metabolite predict 2 0 bruker germany pelander et al 2009 this annotation process has already been described in villette et al 2019b briefly 79 biotransformation rules were applied to the structure of the parent drugs to generate metabolites over two generations the software then generated a list of raw formulae containing potential metabolites but also retrieved the enzymes generating the metabolites finally raw formula lists were imported into metaboscape 4 0 for annotation to perform suspect screening of the metabolites the data are compared with raw formulae generated using smartformula as mentioned in villette et al 2019b the metabolites mentioned in this study were only those found in all seasons and in 3 biological replicates finally the data were analysed using a non targeted method following the processing mentioned in villette et al 2019a the annotations were performed using a criterion of mass deviation lower than 3 ppm and msigma value under 30 to assess the good fit of the isotope pattern raw formula annotations were then generated using c h n o p s cl i br and f elements then tentative identification level 3 of the schymanski classification schymanski et al 2015 was performed using analyte lists created from the toxic exposome database http www t3db ca foodb

samples were replicated three times in a non target way each area was analysed separately the samples were clustered in metaboscape 4 0 bruker daltonics according to the seasons and all the adduct forms were grouped in a bucket briefly using the value count of group attributes only compounds found in 80 of group samples water flow areas were selected the metabolic profile was therefore investigated by comparing area by area based on a wilcoxon rank sum test non parametric test results were considered significantly different using the fold change differences 2 or 2 and a p value 0 05 the fold change associated with the different couples and the associated p values were recovered for use in chemrich the complete dataset statistically differential and non differential values was submitted to chemrich with the fold change converted to an average ratio chemrich thresholds were p value 0 05 and fold change 2 or 2 to consider that a compound is significantly up or down regulated in a specific condition here the pond and to obtain the chemical enrichment analysis results 3 results 3 1 water flow process modelling and areas selection the sftw was affected by weather conditions thus different inlet flow rates were measured the distribution of these inlet flow rates measured during eight campaigns over a period of two years is shown in figure s3 among these flow rates one inlet flow rate condition per season figure 1 was simulated to underline the water flow velocity field diversity that could be observed on the sftw simulations of the three slowest flow rates winter with 7 2 m3 h 1 summer with 5 1 m3 h 1 and autumn with 4 2 m3 h 1 induced similar hydraulic behaviour and a preferential flow between the inlet and outlet was observed the increase in the inlet flow rate can generate vortices simulation a in figure 1 rendering the inlet outlet link unclear nevertheless figure s3 highlights the extreme nature of this phenomenon therefore the spring simulation simulation a in figure 1 in which vortices appear was excluded from the rest of the study the similar water flow behaviour observed in the three other simulations provided a global overview of the sftw hydraulic behaviour even if a slow flow rate was created at the sftw inlet variations could be observed and the water flow velocity field seems to be particularly low near the banks in comparison to other sftw areas relatively higher water flow can be observed near the inlet and outlet whereas a low inlet flow rate is always detected in the sftw thus areas were clustered according to perpetual inlet outlet and preferential flow areas or rare areas near the banks water flow according to the three lowest flow rate simulations figure 1 a sampling strategy was defined to collect sludge samples in the different flow rate areas four areas were selected as depicted in figure 2 the principal points of the water treatment system with relatively higher and perpetual flows the inlet area a and outlet area d respectively were selected to overcome these boundary conditions two areas were chosen considering the water flow heterogeneity inside the sftw therefore sludge was collected in an area with an intermediate higher and perpetual flow rate defined in figure 2 as area b and in areas near the banks with very low flow rate area c these areas were used for different seasonal sampling campaigns to analyse micropollutants and to understand the influence of flow rate on the presence of micropollutants in the sludge 3 2 distribution of identified micropollutants according to the water flow areas micropollutant analysis was performed for each season in the areas of interest results are given in figure s4 and dataset 1 micropollutant distributions fluctuate by season and are apparently unrelated to water flow to overcome the seasonal effect and obtain a global overview only the compounds found in all seasons were considered the results are shown in figure 3 this general analysis indicates that the number of micropollutants found in the different sampling areas seems to be similar indeed seven micropollutants were found in areas b and d six in area c and four in area a additionally most of the compounds were found in at least two sampling areas even if some micropollutants were only detected in a single area and more than half of the micropollutants detected 100 in area a 71 in area b and d and 67 in area c were found in at least two areas most micropollutants had concentrations between 40 400 µg kg 1 of sludge and little variation in concentration was noticed between the different detection areas for example irbesartan was detected at concentrations between 76 125 µg kg 1 only celiprolol was found at a higher concentration in area c 491 µg kg 1 in area a and 1187 µg kg 1 in area c 3 3 distribution of micropollutants metabolites in the different water flow areas studies show that the analysis of parent compounds alone underestimates the amounts of micropollutants found in the environment metabolites potential conjugates or degradation products could be found in higher quantities than parent compounds yin et al 2017 therefore micropollutant metabolites predicted derivatives were also analysed for each season in the areas of interest the results are shown in figure s4 and dataset 2 a similar trend can be found in the different seasons with a higher number of metabolites in relatively low water flow areas b c this general trend is highlighted by the compounds found in all seasons in figure 4 and the global overview indicates that more compounds are identified in lower flow rate areas 14 in area b and 15 in area c than in higher flow rate areas 4 in area a and 6 in area d additionally very few compounds are common to different areas and a wide variety of metabolite intensities were detected several drugs and their metabolites were studied figure 5 and higher amounts of tramadol and venlafaxine were found higher diversity in area c and irbesartan metabolites in area b were detected suggesting that the lower flow rate influences metabolization however the number of metabolites detected is not necessarily related to the amount of parent compounds the number of metabolites is positively correlated for tramadol higher numbers of metabolites when tramadol is not detected whereas the opposite phenomenon was observed for venlafaxine higher numbers of metabolites when the venlafaxine concentration is approximately 123 µg kg 1 sludge 4 discussion 4 1 influence of boundary conditions figures 1 and 2 highlight the low velocity field in the sftw which could be caused by several phenomena such as the low inlet flow rates compared to the pond sizes the head losses resulting from the presence of vegetation the shallow depth and the rough sides the influence of water depth was investigated by coggins et al with a focus on the impact of sludge accumulation on hydraulic performance coggins et al 2017 thus the areas of sftw that contain the most accumulated sludge and the areas near the banks have the lowest flow velocity field and are characterised by a very high hydraulic residence time and consequently a low solid transport phenomenon however water quality with higher nutrient removal nitrogen and phosphorus can be improved by increasing residence time akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 huang 2000 a higher water flow velocity field was detected at the boundary points of the system inlet and outlet area due to the boundary conditions constrictions leading to a high rate of sludge renewal 4 2 no correlation between parent compounds distribution and water flow velocities the micropollutant analysis performed in different areas did not highlight significant differences in their number and concentration except for celiprolol indeed almost the same number of micropollutants and similar concentrations were found in these areas however according to the literature the sedimentation and sequestration of compounds in the solid phase should be promoted in lower water flow velocity fields montiel león et al 2019 these comments are supported by studies that have investigated the influence of water flow velocities on contaminant concentrations and sequestration gaullier et al 2020 mali et al 2018 gaullier et al 2020 suggest that higher pesticide storage in lower velocity areas is related to transport types convection is promoted in high velocity areas and mali et al found higher metal deposition in a weaker flow in a port mali et al 2018 nevertheless the higher velocities mentioned in their study impact flow patterns and could partly explain the differences therefore our study used deep knowledge of water flow in treatment systems to determine that water flow velocity fields are not the key parameters governing the distribution of micropollutants the difference in water velocities is unlikely to significantly influence a specific micropollutant distribution the reynolds number in the sftw was low and the flow observed in the sftw was generally laminar or low turbulent except at the inlet and outlet reducing the velocity difference in these areas this trend was confirmed by the analysis of the areas of xenobiotics putatively identified in all the sampling areas shown in figure s6 this broader view highlights that most of the micropollutants are found in similar proportions in different areas fold change 2 absolute value additionally the study of physicochemical properties log kow solubility pka as mentioned in li et al 2019 does not highlight any correlation between micropollutant detection and these properties the impact of water flow velocity could probably be highlighted by other assumptions such as solid transport or higher inlet flow rate probably helps distinguish areas based on their micropollutant composition if velocity differences between sftw areas are increased sequestration could be affected however all the results found for these micropollutants should be tempered with the distribution of all the putative identifications from non targeted analyses figure s7 the general trend emphasizes that the low flow rate area area c seems to accumulate slightly more xenobiotics and plant metabolites than other areas these results are apparently more coherent with those found in the lit erature another assumption that may explain the lack of differences in concentration or area could be related to parent compound degradation as higher sedimentation probably occurs in the lower flow rate areas however this sedimentation should be hidden by degradation which has also been enhanced in these areas 4 3 in situ low water flow areas promote micropollutant degradation parent compounds have been found in minor amounts compared to their metabolites yin et al 2017 this degradation process could not be neglected in the sftw as micropollutant biodegradation with conjugations and deconjugations has been described in this type of system tiwari et al 2017 in our study the distribution of micropollutant metabolites appears to be primarily influenced by water flow and more biotransformation products are found in areas with scarce water flow 14 in area b and 15 in area c versus 4 and 6 in areas a and d respectively however these areas are not located in the principal water flow channel and could be subject to intermittent flow rožman et al highlight that a system with intermittent water flow provides a higher biodegradation capacity than one with permanent water flow due to the biofilm development rožman et al 2018 these conclusions support our observations additionally areas with higher residence time can provide conditions stimulating degradation such as increased potential contact time with microorganisms the influence of prolonged contact time in a bioreactor to improve micropollutant transformation has been demonstrated asif et al 2018 boonnorat et al 2016 similarly the results shown in figure 5 suggest that the higher numbers of micropollutant metabolites in the lower flow rate areas b and c is not necessarily related to the number of parent compounds as phenomena such as metabolite transport could occur a broader analysis of the data shows that the metabolite distribution apparently follows a general trend a closer look at the elemental composition reveals that compounds with less than 15 or 10 carbons showed the same distribution as that described for micropollutant metabolites figure s8 and dataset s3 the lower flow rate areas b or c seem to stimulate compound deposition and transformation and the conditions promoting biodegradation were indicated by the non target analysis and chemical class investigation using chemrich barupal and fiehn 2017 figure s9 the results highlight the specific detection of alkaloids and monoterpenes in the lower velocity areas such observations are not surprising as plants grow near wetland banks additionally phosphatidylethanolamines the primary component of the bacterial membrane were also detected therefore the compound annotations seem to indicate higher biological activities that combine plants and microorganisms furthermore investigation of the networks and biological pathways detected in the different areas figure s10 also suggests a higher biological activity in lower velocity areas complex relationships were primarily observed in the lower velocity areas area c and the network data showed that succinate was mainly found in the low flow rate area on the one hand nguyen et al demonstrated that bacteria fed with this succinate could improve energetic efficiency leading to a higher drug sulfomethoxazole removal rate nguyen et al 2017 on the other hand this activity was also observed with the detection of p cymene detection which is a biogas marker and component of anaerobic digestion moreno et al 2014 finally a general biodegradation process seems to occur in sftw most of the metabolites found 59 seem to be generated according to a biodegradation process using cytochrome p450 hydroxylation or epoxidation followed by different transferase dehydrogenase hydrolase and esterase activities figure s11 cytochrome p450 plays a key role in phase i metabolism for several herbicides can degrade a wide variety of micropollutants due to their low specificity cañameras et al 2015 and could explain the general process described here this study was restricted to biodegradation but other abiotic processes such as photodegradation or environmental conditions ph redox could also be considered to understand the fate of micropollutants in the sftw de laurentiis et al 2012 ávila et al 2013 lee et al 2014 rühmland et al 2015 5 conclusion this study investigated micropollutant distribution and degradation trends in sftw wetlands the investigation was conducted by combining the following a deep knowledge of hydraulic behaviour in the sftw obtained through a 3d model based on real study site geometry large scale screening of micropollutants and their metabolites based on this new approach the results underlined the following micropollutant behaviours in the sftw wetland a homogeneous distribution of parent compounds throughout the sftw wetland higher amounts of micropollutant metabolites in lower flow rate areas than in areas with faster flow rates therefore the low flow rate conditions seem to promote degradation and the results suggest that the velocity differences have an impact on metabolite distribution environmental conditions promoting micropollutant degradation are found in low flow rate conditions higher biological activity was detected due to the higher number of microorganisms or plant metabolites and the analysis of small molecules molecular formula comprised of less than 15 or 10 carbons future research needs should be considered to strengthen micropollutant distribution and degradation trends in water treatment systems for example the results obtained in this study highlighted the independence of micropollutant distribution from the velocity field but were obtained on our models that did not considered for example transport of solids or abiotic transformations therefore these assumptions could be considered in future research additionally the results were only obtained for sftw wetlands to strengthen the conclusions observed in this kind of system the results should be compared with those of different systems operating in different geographical areas with different flow rates funding sources this project was funded by a grant from the agence de l

17251,particulate manganese oxide mnox deposition in drinking water distribution systems dwds gives rise to the risk of water discoloration at the consumers tap however its role in the fate and transport of trace organic pollutants in dwds is not clear perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a persistent organic pollutant frequently detected in natural water was selected to investigate the potential effect of mnox on its transportation behavior under dwds conditions through laboratory batch experiments the results show that pfoa can be greatly combined with mnox formed in situ through a mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine however the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was negligible it was found that 1 mg l mn captured over 50 of pfoa with an initial concentration of 50 ng l during oxidation the water compositions of actual water could contribute to the effect of pfoa accumulation to a certain extent characterization of the solid products revealed that pfoa is homogenously embedded into mnox the combination of pfoa with mnox occurs through a bridging effect of mn ii between the surface hydroxyls of mnox and the cooh group of pfoa the resulting mnox pfoa particles were more inclined to agglomerate enabling possibly easy deposition onto the pipe wall than ordinary mnox particles this study provides insights into the co occurrence of metal deposits with pfoa and the potential risks posed by pfoa accumulation to consumers through the water distribution process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid manganese ii

2016 li et al 2019d quiñones and snyder 2009 drinking water quality can deteriorate during the pipeline distribution process dietrich and burlingame 2015 water discoloration is one of the most common complaints from consumers husband and boxall 2011 lytle et al 2014 vreeburg and boxall 2007 previous studies revealed that manganese mn particles released into bulk water can easily lead to esthetic problems for drinking water cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 ginige et al 2011 part of the particulate mn oxides mnox existing in drinking water distribution systems dwdss arises from the finished water directly without effective treatment by the water treatment plant the residual dissolved mn ii in finished water will continue to be oxidized into oxides in particulate form by residual chlorine li et al 2019b this particulate mnox can migrate to the end of the pipeline or further aggregate deposit and accumulate on the pipe wall as part of loose deposits gerke et al 2016 according to studies in many regions mn species are one of the most abundant inorganic components in loose deposits in dwdss especially in nonmetallic pipes gao et al 2019 li et al 2018 yu et al 2019 during the distribution process the loose deposits can act as a sink for contaminants which will gradually enrich trace pollutants such as toxic metals and radionuclides lytle et al 2014 peng and korshin 2011 loose deposits will also serve as a reservoir for microorganism growth ma et al 2019 while under certain conditions the loose deposits will convert into a source of contaminants and be re released into bulk water becoming a potential risk to public health han et al 2018 li et al 2018 moreover the loose deposit or pipe scale were found to affect the state of trace organic pollutants fang et al 2019 and previous studies have shown that mn species play an important role in the transformation of trace organic chemicals chen and huang 2009 zhang and huang 2005 although the detection of pfoa in drinking water has become more frequent in various regions pfoa levels are generally considered to be low risk in drinking water supplied by most water treatment plants that use uncontaminated source water kaboré et al 2018 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 these risk assessments have been based only on the detected concentration of pfoa in drinking water cordner et al 2019 post et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b while the indirect impact of a dwds environment on pfoa has been ignored few studies have been conducted on pfoa speciation and transportation during drinking water pipeline distribution previous studies of the transport behavior of pfoa in natural water have found that the accumulation effect is mainly dominated by the hydrophobicity of organic matter ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 zhao et al 2012 in natural water metal oxides such as goethite and boehmite play a limited role in accumulating pfoa compared with organic matter which can only adsorb pfoa by electrostatic effects johnson et al 2007 shih and wang 2013 tang et al 2010 a previous investigation of pfass levels in tap water along pipelines found that long chain pfass mainly pfoa tend to accumulate in loose deposits with mn as the main inorganic component chen et al 2019 however the effect of mn species on pfoa transportation is still not clear furthermore when metal species coexist with trace organic pollutants in a dwds the corresponding pipe scale or loose deposit structure can be different zhuang et al 2019 correspondingly the formation and transformation of mnox may also be influenced by water quality characteristics such as metal ions natural organic matter and mn oxidizing and reducing bacteria of water which can affect the fate transport and redox cycling of mn allard et al 2013 cerrato et al 2010 li et al 2019c the motivation of this study is to better understand the transport behavior of pfoa and the possible drinking water quality risks brought about by the coexistence of trace organic pollutants and metal oxides under dwds conditions to explore the role of mn species on pfoa transportation under dwds conditions a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the pfoa accumulation by mnox particles in situ formed through mn ii oxidation by free chlorine in addition the effect of pfoa on the aggregation of in situ formed mnox particles was also observed the involved mechanisms and the associated water quality risks were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents pfoa was purchased from aladdin co shanghai china mass labeled internal standard was purchased from wellington laboratories ontario canada a mn ii stock solution 1 0 g l was prepared via the dissolution of mnso4 h2o in 1 wt hno3 solution a free chlorine stock solution of 0 4 g l as cl2 was prepared daily using sodium hypochlorite naclo and calibrated before use dilute h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust the ph sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from fisher scientific ottawa on canada hplc grade ammonium acetate 99 0 ammonium hydroxide solutions 25 in h2o and acetic acid 99 were purchased from aladdin co shanghai china the actual drinking water for experimental test was taken from a laboratory faucet located in yancheng jiangsu province china all other solutions were prepared using ultra purified water resistivity 18 2 mω cm obtained from a millipore milli q water purification system 2 2 experimental operation mn ii oxidation experiments were conducted in 1 l glass bottles covered with teflon caps in duplicate or more continuous shaking of a thermostatic shaker was performed for batch experiments at 200 rpm and 25 1 c nacl 0 5 mm and nahco3 1 mm were added to provide a suitable ionic strength 1 5 10 3 mol l and a buffer to maintain constant ph dilute naoh and h2so4 solutions were used to adjust the ph to 7 8 0 1 at the start of the experiment mn ii and pfoa stock solutions were added to each reaction batch to produce target concentrations the mn ii oxidation process was started by free chlorine dosing 2 0 mg l to observe the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa under dwds conditions the following reaction conditions were selected free chlorine of 2 0 mg l three different pfoa concentrations 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l and a reaction time of 24 h was used due to differences in water consumption and pipeline length the hydraulic retention time hrt in dwdss varied greatly ranging from hours to days therefore 24 h was selected as the reaction time the change in pfoa concentration in the solution before and after mn ii oxidation was considered to be the accumulated amount an initial dose of 1 mg l mn ii was chosen compared with the actual concentration of mn in drinking water the limit of drinking water in china is 0 1 mg l the dosage of 1 mg l is relatively high however a lower mn concentration under normal free chlorine dosage 4 mg l will yield fewer mn particles that are not sufficient for characterization and the reaction process is too slow to capture some crucial features of the reactions in the batch experiment knocke et al 1987 li et al 2019a 2020 in addition the system with an initial mn ii concentration of 1 mg l can still maintain a more uniform state that is similar to real drinking water in dwdss fig s1 accordingly 1 mg l is a reasonable initial mn ii concentration that can not only be used to carry out the following mechanism study but also is as close as possible to the actual drinking water condition to study the influence of the initial mn ii concentration on the ability to accumulate pfoa during the formation of mnox a series of initial dissolved mn ii concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 mg l 5 mg l 10 mg l were used measurement of the remaining pfoa in the solution was conducted for a duration of 35 h the reaction time of 35 h was determined according to the mnox formation rates under different concentrations of pfoa fig s2 to explore the accumulation effect of mn on pfoa in the whole process after entering a dwds it is necessary to clarify the transformation and migration behavior of mn in the dwds which mainly includes two stages stage i is the process of continuous oxidation of dissolved mn ii by residual chlorine to form suspended mn particles stageii is the formation of mn particles that are continuously agglomerated and deposited onto the pipe wall to distinguish the relative importance of these two stages on pfoa accumulation two groups of experiments were designed pfoa accumulation by in situ formed mnox group 1 and preformed mnox group 2 as shown in fig 1 group 1 the in situ formed mnox experimental group was used to simulate the uptake of pfoa during the mnox formation process stage i in this experiment dissolved mn ii oxidation to particulate mnox and the pfoa uptake process occurs simultaneously dissolved mn ii 1 mg l was added to pfoa solutions with concentrations of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l followed by the addition of 2 mg l free chlorine to start the experiment measurement of the remaining pfoa in the solution was conducted for a duration of 35 h group 2 the preformed mnox experimental group was used to simulate the uptake of pfoa by previously formed mnox stage ii first mnox was prepared by in situ formation of dissolved mn ii in pfoa free systems through chlorine oxidation for 35 h stage i before moving on to the next step of the experiment the free chlorine concentration and ph in each system were adjusted to be the same as those for the initial conditions then 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l pfoa was added to the same reactors containing mnox which was performed in the first 35 h during another 35 h the experiment was continued in the same van to explore the accumulation effect of preformed mnox on pfoa during the agglomeration and deposition stage stage ii 2 3 analytical methods a water sample of 50 ml was collected at selected time intervals and filtered through a glass fiber filter membrane gf f whatman to determine the remaining pfoa in the solution for sample extraction oasis wax spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm waters were used and each water sample was spiked with 2 ng of mass labeled standards detailed information for the extraction is given in the supporting information the pfoa concentrations were analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity hplc system coupled to an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole lc ms system agilent technologies which was operated in the negative electrospray ionization esi mode the detailed ms ms and instrument parameters are provided in tables s1 and s2 a dynamic light scattering dls technique was used to monitor sequential changes in particle size during the reaction by a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd meanwhile a nanoparticle tracking analysis instrument nanosight ns500 nta 2 0 analytical software malvern instrument was used to characterize the size and concentration of particles at the end of the reaction at room temperature the results obtained using dls and nta were mutually confirmed samples for the suspensions that included mn particles were collected at the end of the reaction to characterize the morphologies composition and crystalline structure the suspensions were centrifuged and freeze dried before the characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jeol jsm 7001f coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi x ray diffraction xrd shimadzu xrd7000 and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nexus 670 during each batch experiment a 4 ml sample of suspension was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter at selected times inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer was used to quantify the dissolved mn after being acidized with hno3 q tof lc ms agilent technologies 6545 q tof was used to observe whether pfoa has structural changes after the reaction the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter hach 2100q the ph was measured with a ph meter hach hq 40d residual free chlorine was measured by the dpd method using a hach pocket colorimeter ii chroma was measured by platinum cobalt colorimetry using a colorimeter leici dgb 421 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficacy of pfoa uptake by mnox fig 2 shows the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa in the absence of mn ii the pfoa concentration was found to remain stable in water and no byproducts were formed before and after chlorine oxidation which means free chlorine cannot degrade pfoa figs s3 and s4 in the presence of mn ii the soluble pfoa concentration was significantly reduced by approximately 45 5 27 8 and 23 8 with an initial pfoa concentration of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l respectively fig 2 it indicated that pfoa was substantially transferred from the solution to the in situ formed mnox particles to study the influence of the initial mn ii concentration on the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa a series of initial dissolved mn ii concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 mg l 10 mg l was used as shown in fig 3 the results show that the initial mn ii concentration of 0 1 mg l can achieve 28 71 accumulation efficiency for pfoa during the in situ formation of mnox as the initial mn ii concentration is increased more pfoa was transferred from the solution to the in situ formed mnox particles when 10 mg l mn ii was added 83 71 pfoa was taken up by mnox and the accumulation rate in the whole process was obviously faster previous studies have shown that the process of pure mn oxidation by free chlorine is quite slow at near neutral ph li et al 2019a van benschoten et al 1992 however as the reaction proceeds the oxidation rate will gradually increase due to the autocatalysis of mn ii oxidation allard et al 2013 junta rosso et al 1997 li et al 2020 the higher the initial mn ii dosing the easier the autocatalysis of mn particles and the faster the oxidation rate of mn ii it was further confirmed that the accumulation of pfoa by mnox occurs during the in situ formation of mnox and that the oxidation rate of mn ii affects the accumulation efficiency for pfoa to further compare the accumulation effect for pfoa by in situ formed mnox and preformed mnox the reaction processes were further described for an initial pfoa concentration of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l respectively fig 4 the results show that the in situ formed mnox significantly reduced the pfoa in solution more than 50 of the pfoa with an initial concentration of 50 ng l was accumulated by mnox within 5 h if the process of pfoa accumulation by in situ formed mnox is regarded as an adsorption process the reaction process can be described by kinetics adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic models the accumulation process for pfoa by in situ formed mnox is consistent with the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir adsorption isotherms the kinetic results show that when the initial mn ii of 1 mg l with 50 ng l pfoa the accumulation capacity at equilibrium qe of in situ formed mnox was 34 39 μg g fig s5 table s3 according to the adsorption isotherm results the maximum adsorption capacity qm of in situ formed mnox on pfoa was 86 98 μg g fig s6 table s4 in addition the reaction could be significantly promoted at a higher water temperature and is spontaneous δh 0 δg 0 it can be speculated that the accumulation behavior of in situ formed mnox on pfoa could be further intensified in summer fig s7 table s5 however in the preformed mnox groups it was found that pfoa maintained stable levels indicating that nearly no pfoa was accumulated on the preformed mnox therefore the accumulation of pfoa by mnox occurs dominantly during the process of mnox formation and mainly in the initial stage of oxidation in addition the production of mnox was significantly correlated with the consumption of free chlorine but the decrease in pfoa concentration did not correspond exactly to the decrease in mn ii or free chlorine concentration fig s8 3 2 influence of actual drinking water on accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa to explore whether the phenomenon of pfoa accumulate on mnox is affected when the water background is actual water the tap water taken from a laboratory faucet was selected to provide the actual water quality background table s6 lists the relevant water parameters for the drinking water mn ii 1 mg l free chlorine 2 mg l and pfoa 50 ng l were added to each group of actual water samples and the same operations as in the simulated water experiment were used to compare the pfoa concentration changes in the in situ formed mnox group and the preformed mnox group in actual drinking water the background concentration of pfoa was 42 89 ng l which led to the initial pfoa concentration in the solution reaching approximately 90 100 ng l after adding 50 ng l pfoa fig 5 shows that in actual drinking water it can still be verified that pfoa was accumulated by in situ formed mnox through the mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine and the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was negligible during the 24 h reaction period the pfoa concentration of the in situ formed mnox group was reduced by approximately 39 84 which is significantly higher compared with the 27 8 reduction of pfoa concentration in the 100 ng l pfoa group fig 2 of the simulated water experiment this means that the water background compositions in actual drinking water can have a certain contribution to pfoa accumulation accordingly changes in the pfoa concentration in the water phase with chlorine but without mn ii addition under the actual drinking water background group 3 in fig 5 were observed the results show that the pfoa concentration was reduced by 7 87 during the 24 h after chlorine dosing and the concentration change was greater than that of the preformed mnox group and higher than the negligible reduction efficiency observed when only pfoa and free chlorine coexist in the simulated water fig s3 furthermore the difference in the water background compositions within the 24 h reaction time was mainly reflected in the reduced concentration of dissolved fe table s7 it can be inferred that the dissolved fe in the process of being oxidized into particles in situ might play a role in the accumulation of pfoa similar to the in situ formed mnox process zhuang et al 2019 this means that in a dwds environment metal ions can capture pfoa and even other trace organic pollutants from the water phase in the process of being oxidized into particulate matter in situ this provides a new pathway for the transportation and fate of trace organic pollutants in dwds the changes of the mn oxidation process in the actual water can also affect the accumulation effect on pfoa to be closer to the actual conditions the initial mn ii concentration was adjusted to 0 1 mg l and further explore the relationship between the accumulation process of pfoa and mn ii oxidation rate in actual water and simulated water the results show that when the reaction progressed to about 7 h pfoa concentration was reduced by 37 57 39 99 ng l fig s9a and the mn ii oxidation rate in the actual drinking water reached 72 75 fig s9b the accumulation capacity of mnox is about 549 69 μg pfoa g mn the pfoa concentration in the simulated water dropped by 26 09 and 37 68 of mn ii was oxidized to mnox at 7 h the corresponding accumulation capacity is about 693 47 μg pfoa g mn it indicates that the accumulation capacity of in situ formed mnox in simulated water was higher than that in actual drinking water in the initial stage of oxidation although the oxidation rate of mn ii in simulated water was lower than that in the actual water however after the mn ii is completely oxidized the accumulation of pfoa by in situ formed mnox in the actual water is larger than that of the simulated water which indicates that there are other reactions in the actual water that contribute a certain percentage of pfoa accumulation effect previous studies have shown that mnox can adsorb organic matter and the presence of mg2 ca2 or zn2 can enhance organic matter adsorption wang et al 2019 the investigation results of the actual loose deposits in dwds found that the organic matter in the loose deposits mainly composed of mn also had a certain proportion chen et al 2019 the presence of organic matter is conducive to the hydrophobic adsorption of pfass by sediments and other solid phases ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 pan and you 2010 therefore the organic matter on the mnox particles could also contribute a certain amount of pfoa adsorption capacity the behavior of pfoa being accumulated by in situ mnox is affected by a variety of factors such as organic matter coexisting metal ions etc which deserves a further study in the future 3 3 compositional and structural characteristics of the mnox pfoa particles the surface morphology and elemental distribution of mn particles with pfoa denoted as mnox pfoa was observed by sem eds fig 6 the sem image shows that the mnox pfoa particles exhibit the form of stacked lamellar structure which is consistent with the morphology of mnox reported in previous research lee et al 2010 sun et al 2002 sem images of the pure mnox particles and mnox pfoa particles with different pfoa concentrations are given in fig s10 the surface morphology of the mnox particles always show a similar stacked lamellar structure no matter the level of pfoa eds mapping results show that the particles do contain the f element which is distributed homogenously with mn and o elements it further confirms that pfoa was indeed accumulated by mnox ftir results for mnox pfoa and blank control pure mnox are provided in fig s11 the peak position at 498 cm 1 corresponds to mn o stretching vibrational modes john et al 2019 the bands at approximately 1627 cm 1 and 3416 cm 1 are assigned to the oh stretching of water in the ftir spectra the typical peak band for pfoa is located at approximately 1140 1242 cm 1 which corresponds to the vibrations of the c f bonds and cf2 group and could be used as the monitor of organic fluorine perusich 2000 zhang et al 2013 compared with mnox the c f or cf2 peak appeared in the mnox pfoa sample indicating that pfoa was indeed bound to mnox the weak peak intensity was due to the lower content of pfoa nanogram level xrd patterns for particles with and without pfoa are much similar fig s12 with the structure of manganese oxide hydrate which indicates that pfoa did not change the crystal structure of the mnox xps analysis was performed to compare the mn ii oxidation products in the absence and presence of pfoa fig s13 the o 1 s xps spectra for the mn ii oxidation products with and without pfoa are given in fig 7 for pure mnox the o 1 s spectrum can be fitted by a pair of peaks at 529 7 ev and 531 4 ev corresponding to mn o and mn oh respectively huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a with the introduction of pfoa during the process of in situ formation of mnox a new characteristic peak emerges at 533 1 ev and the relative intensities of mn oh decreased after pfoa addition which can be ascribed to a combination of the surface hydroxyls mn oh of mnox and pfoa mn ii ions could act as bridge between the mn oh of mnox and the cooh of pfoa and transform into a new mn linkage huang et al 2020 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2009 however the o 1 s xps spectra for the preformed mnox coexisting with pfoa are shown in fig s14 and there is no significant difference observed compared with pure mnox particles without pfoa addition fig 7 this result confirms that almost no pfoa combined with the preformed mnox to further demonstrate the possible bridging effect of mn ii the concentration changes of pfoa in the water phase were observed after the re introduction of mn ii and the quenching of free chlorine to prevent the formation of new mnox in the system after the coexistence of preformed mnox and pfoa for a certain period of time to determine whether the presence of mn ii can restart the pfoa accumulation behavior via preformed mnox fig 8 shows that the concentration of pfoa which remained stable in the preformed mnox system decreased after the addition of mn ii indicating that preformed mnox can accumulate pfoa in the presence of sufficient mn ii mn ii might act as a bridge between the surface hydroxyl groups of the preformed mnox and the carboxyl groups of pfoa this explains the observation that pfoa was not able to be accumulated by the mnox already formed but can be accumulated in the process of mn oxidation in addition during the initial process of mnox formation the concentration of mn ii is high and the particle size of mnox particles is smaller than that of the later continuously agglomerated mnox particles changes in the mnox pfoa average particle size during the reaction were determined by dls fig s15 it shows that regardless of the presence of pfoa the particle sizes of the mnox particles in the 30 h oxidation reaction were more than 100 nm higher than that in the initial reaction of 3 h due to agglomeration it has been reported that the aggregation of mnox particles can cause bet surface area reduction liu et al 2009 therefore the initial mnox had a larger specific surface area and thus having more surface hydroxyl groups to combine with mn ii to capture pfoa in the water phase this can reasonably explain the accumulation of pfoa by in situ formed mnox occurred mainly in the initial stage of oxidation and that it was difficult to continue to accumulate pfoa in the later stage the mechanism for pfoa accumulation by mnox is different from the traditional adsorption mechanisms for pfoa reported in previous studies since the terminal group and the c f chain of the pfas induce electrostatic negativity and hydrophobic interactions respectively the electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction are the dominant mechanisms for the adsorption of pfas on sediment minerals soil activated carbon anion exchange resin etc du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 while the metal linkage between mnox and pfoa is also one of the mechanisms affecting the transport behavior of pfoa in the environment it has been reported that the formation of a metal linkage between metal species and pfoa can affect the structure transformation of metal oxides due to the change in electron distribution the f on the pfoa could affect the electron distribution of the mn connected to the cooh and strengthens the connection between the mn units zhuang et al 2019 3 4 agglomeration effect of mnox pfoa particles 3 4 1 particle size and concentration of mnox pfoa particles with progression of the oxidation reaction both mnox particles and mnox pfoa particles were continuously formed and the particle size increased due to agglomeration fig s15 during the whole period the particle size of the mnox was significantly smaller than that of the mnox pfoa particles the mnox pfoa particle size increases with increasing pfoa concentration at the end of the reaction nanoparticle tracking analysis nta was used to detect the concentration and size of the mnox pfoa particles nta can be used to calculate more comprehensive particle information including the particle concentration and average mode 10 50 median and 90 of the particle size distribution fig 9 shows that the average mode and median d50 particle size all increase with increasing pfoa concentration which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by the dls detection method among these particle size the mode result is the most obvious the mode mnox particle size is 285 nm while in the system containing 200 ng l pfoa the mode mnox pfoa particle size reaches 375 nm the experimental results obtained for the mn ii oxidation process monitoring show that the presence of pfoa has no obvious effect on the mn oxidation rate under the experimental conditions fig s2 thus the increase in particle size is not directly related to the formation kinetics of mnox particles however the particle concentration decreased with increasing pfoa concentration table s8 the mnox particle concentration reached 7 72 108 particles ml while in the system containing 200 ng l of pfoa the concentration of mnox pfoa particles decreased by more than half to 3 07 108 particles ml mnox pfoa particles have a larger particle size but are present in a smaller number than mnox indicating that the agglomeration of mnox pfoa particles is stronger meanwhile the fluctuation in the particle size distribution increases with increasing pfoa concentration fig 9 which means that the particle agglomeration becomes more obvious 3 4 2 visual observation visual observation of the agglomeration phenomenon is the most direct method to amplify the difference in agglomeration effect the initial mn ii concentration and the pfoa concentration were increased to 10 mg l and 5 μg l respectively fig s16 shows the solution state after 24 h of mn oxidation with or without pfoa it is obvious that the in situ formed mnox particles have obviously agglomerated during 24 h almost all mnox pfoa particles were deposited onto the bottom of the reactor fig s16b while the deposition of pure mnox particles fig s16a is far less significant than that of mnox pfoa particles it confirmed that mnox pfoa particles were easier to agglomerate than pure mnox particles 3 4 3 zeta potential the changes of the zeta potential of the mnox and mnox pfoa systems before and after the reaction were compared table s9 under the conditions of mn 1 mg l pfoa 200 ng l and cl2 2 mg l the absolute value of the zeta potential for mnox pfoa 10 76 mv after the reaction was lower than that for the pure mnox system 13 07 mv indicating that the mnox pfoa system was relatively less stable and more inclined to agglomerate and deposit li et al 2019c overall pfoa plays a role in promoting the particle agglomeration it is reasonable to speculate that mnox pfoa particles are more conducive to deposit onto the pipe wall in a dwds to form loose deposits than pure mnox particles 3 5 impact of mnox pfoa particles on water quality mnox pfoa particles and mnox particles have different effects on water quality fig s17a show that the systems containing more pfoa have higher turbidity the presence of pfoa changes the particle size quantity and structure of the particulate matter which is accountable for the change of turbidity li et al 2019b however there was no appreciable difference in chroma fig s17b of these systems thus it can be deduced that such concentration level of pfoa might not exacerbate chromaticity problems under actual dwds conditions mnox pfoa particles pose potential water quality risks by interfering with pfoa transportation in dwds as the dissolved mn ii forms a linkage with pfoa during the process of continued oxidation of particulate mnox by residual chlorine in a dwds pfoa will be captured in bulk water and combined into the mnox the suspended mnox will carry pfoa and transport it to the consumer taps in addition the particulate mnox doped with pfoa will more easily agglomerate into particles with a larger size than ordinary mnox particles thus it is easier for it to deposit onto the inner wall of the pipeline to form loose deposits and then accumulate pfoa gradually mn ii oxidation intervened pfoa transportation in a dwds environment will also occur on the solid surface of a loose deposits since the mnox contained in the loose deposits of a dwds can play a role of autocatalysis the oxidation of dissolved mn ii is more likely to occur on the surface of the deposits on the pipe wall therefore such reaction process can capture the pfoa in nearby bulk water and then directly accumulate pfoa in the loose deposits following a hydraulic disturbance or a change in water quality the loose deposits could be released into water which will carry the pfoa accumulated inside to consumers taps leading to secondary pollution for water quality and giving rise to potential risks to human health the transport behavior of pfoa dominated by mn oxidation in a dwds is demonstrated in fig 10 the usepa established a health advisory level for pfoa and the combined concentration of pfoa and pfos in drinking water 70 ng l however particulates can be ingested by consumers and the risk associated with pfoa that combines with particulates is ignored to measure nanogram levels of pfoa in actual tap water an extraction step is required however this process will trap particles which makes it difficult to guarantee that the pfoa combined with particles is extracted completely therefore the concentrations of pfoa in drinking water investigated in the current reports may not be the total concentrations the actual concentration of pfoa ingested by consumers through drinking water is underestimated the underestimated part is related to the amount and type of particulate matter ingested by consumers therefore the formation of mnox particles and the resuspension of loose deposits leads to not only the esthetic problems of discolored water in the traditional consciousness but also health problems associated with providing a carrier and sink for pfoa to reduce the risk of ingesting pfoa through drinking water it is recommended that in addition to controlling pfoa at the source the dissolved mn ii concentration in the finished water should be strictly controlled to prevent further oxidation and deposition during the distribution process which is also a way to reduce the transportation of pfoa and its accumulation onto the loose deposits in a dwds water utilities can use high efficiency mn removal technology to ensure that mn ii is removed to a sufficiently low concentration li et al 2019a previous field studies have observed that when the total mn concentration is greater than 10 μg l deposition behavior is still likely to occur li et al 2019b in addition regular pipe cleaning of dwds including fire hydrant flushing and unidirectional flushing can be helpful to decrease the inventory of mn deposits in dwds 4 conclusions in this work the role of mn species on pfoa transport behaviors under dwds conditions was explored and the associated water quality risks were discussed the main conclusions are as follows pfoa can be greatly combined with mnox formed in situ through a mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine while the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was found to be negligible mn ii could act as a bridge between the surface hydroxyls of mnox and the cooh of pfoa to bind them

17251,particulate manganese oxide mnox deposition in drinking water distribution systems dwds gives rise to the risk of water discoloration at the consumers tap however its role in the fate and transport of trace organic pollutants in dwds is not clear perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a persistent organic pollutant frequently detected in natural water was selected to investigate the potential effect of mnox on its transportation behavior under dwds conditions through laboratory batch experiments the results show that pfoa can be greatly combined with mnox formed in situ through a mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine however the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was negligible it was found that 1 mg l mn captured over 50 of pfoa with an initial concentration of 50 ng l during oxidation the water compositions of actual water could contribute to the effect of pfoa accumulation to a certain extent characterization of the solid products revealed that pfoa is homogenously embedded into mnox the combination of pfoa with mnox occurs through a bridging effect of mn ii between the surface hydroxyls of mnox and the cooh group of pfoa the resulting mnox pfoa particles were more inclined to agglomerate enabling possibly easy deposition onto the pipe wall than ordinary mnox particles this study provides insights into the co occurrence of metal deposits with pfoa and the potential risks posed by pfoa accumulation to consumers through the water distribution process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid manganese ii oxidation accumulation drinking water distribution system transport behavior 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is known to be a kind of representative per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfass which is extremely recalcitrant in the environment rahman et al 2014 pfoa is used extensively in the manufacture of consumer products including nonstick kitchenware surfactants surface treatment agents for textiles firefighting foams paper and paints lindstrom et al 2011 pfoa distributes ubiquitously from seawater and sediments in the arctic kahkashan et al 2019 yeung et al 2017 to seabirds in the antarctic roscales et al 2019 and even human plasma poothong et al 2017 and bones koskela et al 2017 because pfoa is persistent eschauzier et al 2012 bioaccumulative and toxic many countries and organizations have restricted or prohibited its production and emission moreover pfoa has been listed in annex a of the stockholm convention in 2019 unep 2019 and a health advisory level of 70 ng l for pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos c8 individually or combined in drinking water was established by the united states environmental protection agency in 2016 usepa 2016 drinking water is one of the most important routes for pfoa to be ingested by humans and pfoa remains one of the most common pfass found in drinking water bao et al 2012 essumang et al 2017 hu et al 2016 hurley et al 2016 li et al 2019d quiñones and snyder 2009 drinking water quality can deteriorate during the pipeline distribution process dietrich and burlingame 2015 water discoloration is one of the most common complaints from consumers husband and boxall 2011 lytle et al 2014 vreeburg and boxall 2007 previous studies revealed that manganese mn particles released into bulk water can easily lead to esthetic problems for drinking water cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 ginige et al 2011 part of the particulate mn oxides mnox existing in drinking water distribution systems dwdss arises from the finished water directly without effective treatment by the water treatment plant the residual dissolved mn ii in finished water will continue to be oxidized into oxides in particulate form by residual chlorine li et al 2019b this particulate mnox can migrate to the end of the pipeline or further aggregate deposit and accumulate on the pipe wall as part of loose deposits gerke et al 2016 according to studies in many regions mn species are one of the most abundant inorganic components in loose deposits in dwdss especially in nonmetallic pipes gao et al 2019 li et al 2018 yu et al 2019 during the distribution process the loose deposits can act as a sink for contaminants which will gradually enrich trace pollutants such as toxic metals and radionuclides lytle et al 2014 peng and korshin 2011 loose deposits will also serve as a reservoir for microorganism growth ma et al 2019 while under certain conditions the loose deposits will convert into a source of contaminants and be re released into bulk water becoming a potential risk to public health han et al 2018 li et al 2018 moreover the loose deposit or pipe scale were found to affect the state of trace organic pollutants fang et al 2019 and previous studies have shown that mn species play an important role in the transformation of trace organic chemicals chen and huang 2009 zhang and huang 2005 although the detection of pfoa in drinking water has become more frequent in various regions pfoa levels are generally considered to be low risk in drinking water supplied by most water treatment plants that use uncontaminated source water kaboré et al 2018 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 these risk assessments have been based only on the detected concentration of pfoa in drinking water cordner et al 2019 post et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b while the indirect impact of a dwds environment on pfoa has been ignored few studies have been conducted on pfoa speciation and transportation during drinking water pipeline distribution previous studies of the transport behavior of pfoa in natural water have found that the accumulation effect is mainly dominated by the hydrophobicity of organic matter ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 zhao et al 2012 in natural water metal oxides such as goethite and boehmite play a limited role in accumulating pfoa compared with organic matter which can only adsorb pfoa by electrostatic effects johnson et al 2007 shih and wang 2013 tang et al 2010 a previous investigation of pfass levels in tap water along pipelines found that long chain pfass mainly pfoa tend to accumulate in loose deposits with mn as the main inorganic component chen et al 2019 however the effect of mn species on pfoa transportation is still not clear furthermore when metal species coexist with trace organic pollutants in a dwds the corresponding pipe scale or loose deposit structure can be different zhuang et al 2019 correspondingly the formation and transformation of mnox may also be influenced by water quality characteristics such as metal ions natural organic matter and mn oxidizing and reducing bacteria of water which can affect the fate transport and redox cycling of mn allard et al 2013 cerrato et al 2010 li et al 2019c the motivation of this study is to better understand the transport behavior of pfoa and the possible drinking water quality risks brought about by the coexistence of trace organic pollutants and metal oxides under dwds conditions to explore the role of mn species on pfoa transportation under dwds conditions a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the pfoa accumulation by mnox particles in situ formed through mn ii oxidation by free chlorine in addition the effect of pfoa on the aggregation of in situ formed mnox particles was also observed the involved mechanisms and the associated water quality risks were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents pfoa was purchased from aladdin co shanghai china mass labeled internal standard was purchased from wellington laboratories ontario canada a mn ii stock solution 1 0 g l was prepared via the dissolution of mnso4 h2o in 1 wt hno3 solution a free chlorine stock solution of 0 4 g l as cl2 was prepared daily using sodium hypochlorite naclo and calibrated before use dilute h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust the ph sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from fisher scientific ottawa on canada hplc grade ammonium acetate 99 0 ammonium hydroxide solutions 25 in h2o and acetic acid 99 were purchased from aladdin co shanghai china the actual drinking water for experimental test was taken from a laboratory faucet located in yancheng jiangsu province china all other solutions were prepared using ultra purified water resistivity 18 2 mω cm obtained from a millipore milli q water purification system 2 2 experimental operation mn ii oxidation experiments were conducted in 1 l glass bottles covered with teflon caps in duplicate or more continuous shaking of a thermostatic shaker was performed for batch experiments at 200 rpm and 25 1 c nacl 0 5 mm and nahco3 1 mm were added to provide a suitable ionic strength 1 5 10 3 mol l and a buffer to maintain constant ph dilute naoh and h2so4 solutions were used to adjust the ph to 7 8 0 1 at the start of the experiment mn ii and pfoa stock solutions were added to each reaction batch to produce target concentrations the mn ii oxidation process was started by free chlorine dosing 2 0 mg l to observe the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa under dwds conditions the following reaction conditions were selected free chlorine of 2 0 mg l three different pfoa concentrations 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l and a reaction time of 24 h was used due to differences in water consumption and pipeline length the hydraulic retention time hrt in dwdss varied greatly ranging from hours to days therefore 24 h was selected as the reaction time the change in pfoa concentration in the solution before and after mn ii oxidation was considered to be the accumulated amount an initial dose of 1 mg l mn ii was chosen compared with the actual concentration of mn in drinking water the limit of drinking water in china is 0 1 mg l the dosage of 1 mg l is relatively high however a lower mn concentration under normal free chlorine dosage 4 mg l will yield fewer mn particles that are not sufficient for characterization and the reaction process is too slow to capture some crucial features of the reactions in the batch experiment knocke et al 1987 li et al 2019a 2020 in addition the system with an initial mn ii concentration of 1 mg l can still maintain a more uniform state that is similar to real drinking water in dwdss fig s1 accordingly 1 mg l is a reasonable initial mn ii concentration that can not only be used to carry out the following mechanism study but also is as close as possible to the actual drinking water condition to study the influence of the initial mn ii concentration on the ability to accumulate pfoa during the formation of mnox a series of initial dissolved mn ii concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 mg l 5 mg l 10 mg l were used measurement of the remaining pfoa in the solution was conducted for a duration of 35 h the reaction time of 35 h was determined according to the mnox formation rates under different concentrations of pfoa fig s2 to explore the accumulation effect of mn on pfoa in the whole process after entering a dwds it is necessary to clarify the transformation and migration behavior of mn in the dwds which mainly includes two stages stage i is the process of continuous oxidation of dissolved mn ii by residual chlorine to form suspended mn particles stageii is the formation of mn particles that are continuously agglomerated and deposited onto the pipe wall to distinguish the relative importance of these two stages on pfoa accumulation two groups of experiments were designed pfoa accumulation by in situ formed mnox group 1 and preformed mnox group 2 as shown in fig 1 group 1 the in situ formed mnox experimental group was used to simulate the uptake of pfoa during the mnox formation process stage i in this experiment dissolved mn ii oxidation to particulate mnox and the pfoa uptake process occurs simultaneously dissolved mn ii 1 mg l was added to pfoa solutions with concentrations of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l followed by the addition of 2 mg l free chlorine to start the experiment measurement of the remaining pfoa in the solution was conducted for a duration of 35 h group 2 the preformed mnox experimental group was used to simulate the uptake of pfoa by previously formed mnox stage ii first mnox was prepared by in situ formation of dissolved mn ii in pfoa free systems through chlorine oxidation for 35 h stage i before moving on to the next step of the experiment the free chlorine concentration and ph in each system were adjusted to be the same as those for the initial conditions then 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l pfoa was added to the same reactors containing mnox which was performed in the first 35 h during another 35 h the experiment was continued in the same van to explore the accumulation effect of preformed mnox on pfoa during the agglomeration and deposition stage stage ii 2 3 analytical methods a water sample of 50 ml was collected at selected time intervals and filtered through a glass fiber filter membrane gf f whatman to determine the remaining pfoa in the solution for sample extraction oasis wax spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm waters were used and each water sample was spiked with 2 ng of mass labeled standards detailed information for the extraction is given in the supporting information the pfoa concentrations were analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity hplc system coupled to an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole lc ms system agilent technologies which was operated in the negative electrospray ionization esi mode the detailed ms ms and instrument parameters are provided in tables s1 and s2 a dynamic light scattering dls technique was used to monitor sequential changes in particle size during the reaction by a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd meanwhile a nanoparticle tracking analysis instrument nanosight ns500 nta 2 0 analytical software malvern instrument was used to characterize the size and concentration of particles at the end of the reaction at room temperature the results obtained using dls and nta were mutually confirmed samples for the suspensions that included mn particles were collected at the end of the reaction to characterize the morphologies composition and crystalline structure the suspensions were centrifuged and freeze dried before the characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jeol jsm 7001f coupled with energy dispersive

a 4 ml sample of suspension was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter at selected times inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer was used to quantify the dissolved mn after being acidized with hno3 q tof lc ms agilent technologies 6545 q tof was used to observe whether pfoa has structural changes after the reaction the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter hach 2100q the ph was measured with a ph meter hach hq 40d residual free chlorine was measured by the dpd method using a hach pocket colorimeter ii chroma was measured by platinum cobalt colorimetry using a colorimeter leici dgb 421 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficacy of pfoa uptake by mnox fig 2 shows the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa in the absence of mn ii the pfoa concentration was found to remain stable in water and no byproducts were formed before and after chlorine oxidation which means free chlorine cannot degrade pfoa figs s3 and s4 in the presence of mn ii the soluble pfoa concentration was significantly reduced by approximately 45 5 27 8 and 23 8 with an initial pfoa concentration of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l respectively fig 2 it indicated that pfoa was substantially transferred from the solution to the in situ formed mnox particles to study the influence of the initial mn ii concentration on the accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa a series of initial dissolved mn ii concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 mg l 10 mg l was used as shown in fig 3 the results show that the initial mn ii concentration of 0 1 mg l can achieve 28 71 accumulation efficiency for pfoa during the in situ formation of mnox as the initial mn ii concentration is increased more pfoa was transferred from the solution to the in situ formed mnox particles when 10 mg l mn ii was added 83 71 pfoa was taken up by mnox and the accumulation rate in the whole process was obviously faster previous studies have shown that the process of pure mn oxidation by free chlorine is quite slow at near neutral ph li et al 2019a van benschoten et al 1992 however as the reaction proceeds the oxidation rate will gradually increase due to the autocatalysis of mn ii oxidation allard et al 2013 junta rosso et al 1997 li et al 2020 the higher the initial mn ii dosing the easier the autocatalysis of mn particles and the faster the oxidation rate of mn ii it was further confirmed that the accumulation of pfoa by mnox occurs during the in situ formation of mnox and that the oxidation rate of mn ii affects the accumulation efficiency for pfoa to further compare the accumulation effect for pfoa by in situ formed mnox and preformed mnox the reaction processes were further described for an initial pfoa concentration of 50 ng l 100 ng l and 200 ng l respectively fig 4 the results show that the in situ formed mnox significantly reduced the pfoa in solution more than 50 of the pfoa with an initial concentration of 50 ng l was accumulated by mnox within 5 h if the process of pfoa accumulation by in situ formed mnox is regarded as an adsorption process the reaction process can be described by kinetics adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic models the accumulation process for pfoa by in situ formed mnox is consistent with the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir adsorption isotherms the kinetic results show that when the initial mn ii of 1 mg l with 50 ng l pfoa the accumulation capacity at equilibrium qe of in situ formed mnox was 34 39 μg g fig s5 table s3 according to the adsorption isotherm results the maximum adsorption capacity qm of in situ formed mnox on pfoa was 86 98 μg g fig s6 table s4 in addition the reaction could be significantly promoted at a higher water temperature and is spontaneous δh 0 δg 0 it can be speculated that the accumulation behavior of in situ formed mnox on pfoa could be further intensified in summer fig s7 table s5 however in the preformed mnox groups it was found that pfoa maintained stable levels indicating that nearly no pfoa was accumulated on the preformed mnox therefore the accumulation of pfoa by mnox occurs dominantly during the process of mnox formation and mainly in the initial stage of oxidation in addition the production of mnox was significantly correlated with the consumption of free chlorine but the decrease in pfoa concentration did not correspond exactly to the decrease in mn ii or free chlorine concentration fig s8 3 2 influence of actual drinking water on accumulation effect of mnox on pfoa to explore whether the phenomenon of pfoa accumulate on mnox is affected when the water background is actual water the tap water taken from a laboratory faucet was selected to provide the actual water quality background table s6 lists the relevant water parameters for the drinking water mn ii 1 mg l free chlorine 2 mg l and pfoa 50 ng l were added to each group of actual water samples and the same operations as in the simulated water experiment were used to compare the pfoa concentration changes in the in situ formed mnox group and the preformed mnox group in actual drinking water the background concentration of pfoa was 42 89 ng l which led to the initial pfoa concentration in the solution reaching approximately 90 100 ng l after adding 50 ng l pfoa fig 5 shows that in actual drinking water it can still be verified that pfoa was accumulated by in situ formed mnox through the mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine and the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was negligible during the 24 h reaction period the pfoa concentration of the in situ formed mnox group was reduced by approximately 39 84 which is significantly higher compared with the 27 8 reduction of pfoa concentration in the 100 ng l pfoa group fig 2 of the simulated water experiment this means that the water background compositions in actual drinking water can have a certain contribution to pfoa accumulation accordingly changes in the pfoa concentration in the water phase with chlorine but without mn ii addition under the actual drinking water background group 3 in fig 5 were observed the results show that the pfoa concentration was reduced by 7 87 during the 24 h after chlorine dosing and the concentration change was greater than that of the preformed mnox group and higher than the negligible reduction efficiency observed when only pfoa and free chlorine coexist in the simulated water fig s3 furthermore the difference in the water background compositions within the 24 h reaction time was mainly reflected in the reduced concentration of dissolved fe table s7 it can be inferred that the dissolved fe in the process of being oxidized into particles in situ might play a role in the accumulation of pfoa similar to the in situ formed mnox process zhuang et al 2019 this means that in a dwds environment metal ions can capture pfoa and even other trace organic pollutants from the water phase in the process of being oxidized into particulate matter in situ this provides a new pathway for the transportation and fate of trace organic pollutants in dwds the changes of the mn oxidation process in the actual water can also affect the accumulation effect on pfoa to be closer to the actual conditions the initial mn ii concentration was adjusted to 0 1 mg l and further explore the relationship between the accumulation process of pfoa and mn ii oxidation rate in actual water and simulated water the results show that when the reaction progressed to about 7 h pfoa concentration was reduced by 37 57 39 99 ng l fig s9a and the mn ii oxidation rate in the actual drinking water reached 72 75 fig s9b the accumulation capacity of mnox is about 549 69 μg pfoa g mn the pfoa concentration in the simulated water dropped by 26 09 and 37 68 of mn ii was oxidized to mnox at 7 h the corresponding accumulation capacity is about 693 47 μg pfoa g mn it indicates that the accumulation capacity of in situ formed mnox in simulated water was higher than that in actual drinking water in the initial stage of oxidation although the oxidation rate of mn ii in simulated water was lower than that in the actual water however after the mn ii is completely oxidized the accumulation of pfoa by in situ formed mnox in the actual water is larger than that of the simulated water which indicates that there are other reactions in the actual water that contribute a certain percentage of pfoa accumulation effect previous studies have shown that mnox can adsorb organic matter and the presence of mg2 ca2 or zn2 can enhance organic matter adsorption wang et al 2019 the investigation results of the actual loose deposits in dwds found that the organic matter in the loose deposits mainly composed of mn also had a certain proportion chen et al 2019 the presence of organic matter is conducive to the hydrophobic adsorption of pfass by sediments and other solid phases ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 pan and you 2010 therefore the organic matter on the mnox particles could also contribute a certain amount of pfoa adsorption capacity the behavior of pfoa being accumulated by in situ mnox is affected by a variety of factors such as organic matter coexisting metal ions etc which deserves a further study in the future 3 3 compositional and structural characteristics of the mnox pfoa particles the surface morphology and elemental distribution of mn particles with pfoa denoted as mnox pfoa was observed by sem eds fig 6 the sem image shows that the mnox pfoa particles exhibit the form of stacked lamellar structure which is consistent with the morphology of mnox reported in previous research lee et al 2010 sun et al 2002 sem images of the pure mnox particles and mnox pfoa particles with different pfoa concentrations are given in fig s10 the surface morphology of the mnox particles always show a similar stacked lamellar structure no matter the level of pfoa eds mapping results show that the particles do contain the f element which is distributed homogenously with mn and o elements it further confirms that pfoa was indeed accumulated by mnox ftir results for mnox pfoa and blank control pure mnox are provided in fig s11 the peak position at 498 cm 1 corresponds to mn o stretching vibrational modes john et al 2019 the bands at approximately 1627 cm 1 and 3416 cm 1 are assigned to the oh stretching of water in the ftir spectra the typical peak band for pfoa is located at approximately 1140 1242 cm 1 which corresponds to the vibrations of the c f bonds and cf2 group and could be used as the monitor of organic fluorine perusich 2000 zhang et al 2013 compared with mnox the c f or cf2 peak appeared in the mnox pfoa sample indicating that pfoa was indeed bound to mnox the weak peak intensity was due to the lower content of pfoa nanogram level xrd patterns for particles with and without pfoa are much similar fig s12 with the structure of manganese oxide hydrate which indicates that pfoa did not change the crystal structure of the mnox xps analysis was performed to compare the mn ii oxidation products in the absence and presence of pfoa fig s13 the o 1 s xps spectra for the mn ii oxidation products with and without pfoa are given in fig 7 for pure mnox the o 1 s spectrum can be fitted by a pair of peaks at 529 7 ev and 531 4 ev corresponding to mn o and mn oh respectively huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a with the introduction of pfoa during the process of in situ formation of mnox a new characteristic peak emerges at 533 1 ev and the relative intensities of mn oh decreased after pfoa addition which can be ascribed to a combination of the surface hydroxyls mn oh of mnox and pfoa mn ii ions could act as bridge between the mn oh of mnox and the cooh of pfoa and transform into a new mn linkage huang et al 2020 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2009 however the o 1 s xps spectra for the preformed mnox coexisting with pfoa are shown in fig s14 and there is no significant difference observed compared with pure mnox particles without pfoa addition fig 7 this result confirms that almost no pfoa combined with the preformed mnox to further demonstrate the possible bridging effect of mn ii the concentration changes of pfoa in the water phase were observed after the re introduction of mn ii and the quenching of free chlorine to prevent the formation of new mnox in the system after the coexistence of preformed mnox and pfoa for a certain period of time to determine whether the presence of mn ii can restart the pfoa accumulation behavior via preformed mnox fig 8 shows that the concentration of pfoa which remained stable in the preformed mnox system decreased after the addition of mn ii indicating that preformed mnox can accumulate pfoa in the presence of sufficient mn ii mn ii might act as a bridge between the surface hydroxyl groups of the preformed mnox and the carboxyl groups of pfoa this explains the observation that pfoa was not able to be accumulated by the mnox already formed but can be accumulated in the process of mn oxidation in addition during the initial process of mnox formation the concentration of mn ii is high and the particle size of mnox particles is smaller than that of the later continuously agglomerated mnox particles changes in the mnox pfoa average particle size during the reaction were determined by dls fig s15 it shows that regardless of the presence of pfoa the particle sizes of the mnox particles in the 30 h oxidation reaction were more than 100 nm higher than that in the initial reaction of 3 h due to agglomeration it has been reported that the aggregation of mnox particles can cause bet surface area reduction liu et al 2009 therefore the initial mnox had a larger specific surface area and thus having more surface hydroxyl groups to combine with mn ii to capture pfoa in the water phase this can reasonably explain the accumulation of pfoa by in situ formed mnox occurred mainly in the initial stage of oxidation and that it was difficult to continue to accumulate pfoa in the later stage the mechanism for pfoa accumulation by mnox is different from the traditional adsorption mechanisms for pfoa reported in previous studies since the terminal group and the c f chain of the pfas induce electrostatic negativity and hydrophobic interactions respectively the electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction are the dominant mechanisms for the adsorption of pfas on sediment minerals soil activated carbon anion exchange resin etc du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 while the metal linkage between mnox and pfoa is also one of the mechanisms affecting the transport behavior of pfoa in the environment it has been reported that the formation of a metal linkage between metal species and pfoa can affect the structure transformation of metal oxides due to the change in electron distribution the f on the pfoa could affect the electron distribution of the mn connected to the cooh and strengthens the connection between the mn units zhuang et al 2019 3 4 agglomeration effect of mnox pfoa particles 3 4 1 particle size and concentration of mnox pfoa particles with progression of the oxidation reaction both mnox particles and mnox pfoa particles were continuously formed and the particle size increased due to agglomeration fig s15 during the whole period the particle size of the mnox was significantly smaller than that of the mnox pfoa particles the mnox pfoa particle size increases with increasing pfoa concentration at the end of the reaction nanoparticle tracking analysis nta was used to detect the concentration and size of the mnox pfoa particles nta can be used to calculate more comprehensive particle information including the particle concentration and average mode 10 50 median and 90 of the particle size distribution fig 9 shows that the average mode and median d50 particle size all increase with increasing pfoa concentration which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by the dls detection method among these particle size the mode result is the most obvious the mode mnox particle size is 285 nm while in the system containing 200 ng l pfoa the mode mnox pfoa particle size reaches 375 nm the experimental results obtained for the mn ii oxidation process monitoring show that the presence of pfoa has no obvious effect on the mn oxidation rate under the experimental conditions fig s2 thus the increase in particle size is not directly related to the formation kinetics of mnox particles however the particle concentration decreased with increasing pfoa concentration table s8 the mnox particle concentration reached 7 72 108 particles ml while in the system containing 200 ng l of pfoa the concentration of mnox pfoa particles decreased by more than half to 3 07 108 particles ml mnox pfoa particles have a larger particle size but are present in a smaller number than mnox indicating that the agglomeration of mnox pfoa particles is stronger meanwhile the fluctuation in the particle size distribution increases with increasing pfoa concentration fig 9 which means that the particle agglomeration becomes more obvious 3 4 2 visual observation visual observation of the agglomeration phenomenon is the most direct method to amplify the difference in agglomeration effect the initial mn ii concentration and the pfoa concentration were increased to 10 mg l and 5 μg l respectively fig s16 shows the solution state after 24 h of mn oxidation with or without pfoa it is obvious that the in situ formed mnox particles have obviously agglomerated during 24 h almost all mnox pfoa particles were deposited onto the bottom of the reactor fig s16b while the deposition of pure mnox particles fig s16a is far less significant than that of mnox pfoa particles it confirmed that mnox pfoa particles were easier to agglomerate than pure mnox particles 3 4 3 zeta potential the changes of the zeta potential of the mnox and mnox pfoa systems before and after the reaction were compared table s9 under the conditions of mn 1 mg l pfoa 200 ng l and cl2 2 mg l the absolute value of the zeta potential for mnox pfoa 10 76 mv after the reaction was lower than that for the pure mnox system 13 07 mv indicating that the mnox pfoa system was relatively less stable and more inclined to agglomerate and deposit li et al 2019c overall pfoa plays a role in promoting the particle agglomeration it is reasonable to speculate that mnox pfoa particles are more conducive to deposit onto the pipe wall in a dwds to form loose deposits than pure mnox particles 3 5 impact of mnox pfoa particles on water quality mnox pfoa particles and mnox particles have different effects on water quality fig s17a show that the systems containing more pfoa have higher turbidity the presence of pfoa changes the particle size quantity and structure of the particulate matter which is accountable for the change of turbidity li et al 2019b however there was no appreciable difference in chroma fig s17b of these systems thus it can be deduced that such concentration level of pfoa might not exacerbate chromaticity problems under actual dwds conditions mnox pfoa particles pose potential water quality risks by interfering with pfoa transportation in dwds as the dissolved mn ii forms a linkage with pfoa during the process of continued oxidation of particulate mnox by residual chlorine in a dwds pfoa will be captured in bulk water and combined into the mnox the suspended mnox will carry pfoa and transport it to the consumer taps in addition the particulate mnox doped with pfoa will more easily agglomerate into particles with a larger size than ordinary mnox particles thus it is easier for it to deposit onto the inner wall of the pipeline to form loose deposits and then accumulate pfoa gradually mn ii oxidation intervened pfoa transportation in a dwds environment will also occur on the solid surface of a loose deposits since the mnox contained in the loose deposits of a dwds can play a role of autocatalysis the oxidation of dissolved mn ii is more likely to occur on the surface of the deposits on the pipe wall therefore such reaction process can capture the pfoa in nearby bulk water and then directly accumulate pfoa in the loose deposits following a hydraulic disturbance or a change in water quality the loose deposits could be released into water which will carry the pfoa accumulated inside to consumers taps leading to secondary pollution for water quality and giving rise to potential risks to human health the transport behavior of pfoa dominated by mn oxidation in a dwds is demonstrated in fig 10 the usepa established a health advisory level for pfoa and the combined concentration of pfoa and pfos in drinking water 70 ng l however particulates can be ingested by consumers and the risk associated with pfoa that combines with particulates is ignored to measure nanogram levels of pfoa in actual tap water an extraction step is required however this process will trap particles which makes it difficult to guarantee that the pfoa combined with particles is extracted completely therefore the concentrations of pfoa in drinking water investigated in the current reports may not be the total concentrations the actual concentration of pfoa ingested by consumers through drinking water is underestimated the underestimated part is related to the amount and type of particulate matter ingested by consumers therefore the formation of mnox particles and the resuspension of loose deposits leads to not only the esthetic problems of discolored water in the traditional consciousness but also health problems associated with providing a carrier and sink for pfoa to reduce the risk of ingesting pfoa through drinking water it is recommended that in addition to controlling pfoa at the source the dissolved mn ii concentration in the finished water should be strictly controlled to prevent further oxidation and deposition during the distribution process which is also a way to reduce the transportation of pfoa and its accumulation onto the loose deposits in a dwds water utilities can use high efficiency mn removal technology to ensure that mn ii is removed to a sufficiently low concentration li et al 2019a previous field studies have observed that when the total mn concentration is greater than 10 μg l deposition behavior is still likely to occur li et al 2019b in addition regular pipe cleaning of dwds including fire hydrant flushing and unidirectional flushing can be helpful to decrease the inventory of mn deposits in dwds 4 conclusions in this work the role of mn species on pfoa transport behaviors under dwds conditions was explored and the associated water quality risks were discussed the main conclusions are as follows pfoa can be greatly combined with mnox formed in situ through a mn ii oxidation process by free chlorine while the accumulation of pfoa by preformed mnox was found to be negligible mn ii could act as a bridge between the surface hydroxyls of mnox and the cooh of pfoa to bind them together compared with regular mnox particles mnox pfoa particles were more inclined to agglomerate and produce higher turbidity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17252,the recent development of successful model approaches that predict the photochemical behaviour of surface waters has greatly aided in the understanding of how water environments work and will likely work in the future from a photochemical point of view however the inherent multi wavelength polychromatic nature of environmental photochemistry causes the relevant mathematics to be quite complex which discourages many scientists to carry out photochemical calculations to greatly simplify model mathematics this paper proposes a new approach that is based on a monochromatic approximation to the polychromatic problem introducing the concept of what is here defined as equivalent monochromatic wavelengths emws the emw is the single wavelength that reproduces the behaviour of the polychromatic system using a monochromatic lambert beer based equation the emw approach largely simplifies calculations getting rid of integrals and allowing for much more straightforward and manageable equations to be obtained in particular this work shows that i the emw approach although approximated entails a negligible loss in accuracy compared to the exact polychromatic treatment of photochemical reactions ii in the case of direct photolysis the quantum yield is to be replaced by an apparent photon efficiency that is not bound to be 1 quantum yields can actually be 1 for chain reactions and few other cases but this is not the point here iii the monochromatic lambert beer equations work in most cases once the emw is identified with the present exception of sunlight absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom the latter spans a very wide wavelength range from 300 to at least 600 nm which makes a single wavelength treatment more difficult however a relatively small modification to the monochromatic lambert beer equation allows for successfully using the emw approach in the case of cdom as well the near perfect coincidence between polychromatic and emw based predictions of photodegradation kinetics is here shown for the pollutants atrazine bentazone carbamazepine diclofenac diuron and ibuprofen extension to additional compounds requires translation of the traditional polychromatic language into the emw one hopefully this contribution will introduce a new paradigm in the mathematical description of photochemical reactions in environmental waters it could also become a new and simple way to treat multi wavelength systems in general photochemistry studies thereby completely changing the way multi wavelength problems are dealt with graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polychromatic systems lambert beer monochromatic equations photochemical modelling natural attenuation of pollutants numerical data fit 1 introduction natural attenuation processes that occur in surface waters play a very important role in the degradation of water pollutants although natural attenuation alone is not sufficient to fight pollution the impact of human activities on water environments would be much higher than is currently observed were attenuation processes not operational schwarzenbach et al 2006 fenner et al 2013 photochemical reactions triggered directly or indirectly by sunlight are an important component in natural attenuation and they are particularly effective against dissolved water soluble biorecalcitrant compounds cermola et al 2005 young et al 2013 remucal et al 2014 vione et al 2014 trivella et al 2015 trawinski and skibinski 2017 yassine et al 2018 water solubility and biorecalcitrance are quite common among the so called contaminants of emerging concerns cecs which end up in surface waters largely because of their insufficient removal by wastewater treatment plants wwtps indeed the use of the activated sludge step for pollutant degradation selects for compounds that are both biorecalcitrant otherwise they would be biodegraded by bacteria and water soluble otherwise they would attach to the biomass and end up in the separated sludge phase not the aqueous one castiglioni et al 2006 gao et al 2012 richardson and ternes 2014 photochemical reactions in surface waters can be divided into direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry in the former the pollutant absorbs sunlight and gets transformed as a consequence pace and barreca 2014 in indirect photoreactions sunlight is absorbed by naturally occurring photosensitisers chromophoric dissolved organic matter or cdom nitrate and nitrite to produce a range of reactive transient species the hydroxyl radical oh the carbonate radical co3 singlet oxygen 1o2 as well as cdom triplet states 3cdom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 mcneill and canonica 2016 the photogenerated reactive transients quickly reach steady state concentrations due to the production consumption budget they react with pollutants to induce degradation but this is generally a secondary consumption pathway the radical oh is in fact mostly scavenged by dissolved organic matter dom not necessarily chromophoric and by hco3 and co3 2 as well as by br in saltwater co3 is scavenged by dom 3cdom are mainly deactivated by ground state o2 in part to yield 1o2 finally 1o2 is mainly quenched by collision with water molecules zepp et al 1977a vione et al 2014 photochemical reactions can be studied in the laboratory although it is difficult to completely reproduce the natural environment under laboratory conditions especially as far as water column depths are concerned recently it has become possible to reliably model surface water photoreactions based on pollutant photoreactivity data absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields second order reaction rate constants with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and on photochemically relevant environmental factors sunlight irradiance and spectrum water chemistry and depth zhou et al 2018 vione and scozzaro 2019 a major feature of environmental photochemistry is its multi wavelength nature or polychromaticity indeed a range of wavelengths occurs in all solar radiation photosensitiser absorption and pollutant absorption this means that light absorption and as a consequence photoreactivity calculations are multi wavelength ones and are largely based on numerical integrals zepp et al 1977b zepp et al 1987 bodrato and vione 2014 the main drawback of this state of things is that the procedures needed to compute photoreactions are not easy and require either i dedicated software which is freely available but may have limitations or be difficult to customise epa 2020 vione 2020 or ii the self development of calculation spreadsheets which requires advanced it skills zhou et al 2018 these difficulties are probably the main obstacle that has limited so far the diffusion of photochemistry modelling within the scientific community plane et al 1987 gerecke et al 2001 halladja et al 2007 bintou et al 2015 silva et al 2015 carena et al 2017 silva et al 2019 apell and mcneill 2019 it is also the author s opinion that photochemical modelling would be greatly simplified were it possible to formulate a general equation that describes photoreaction kinetics without recurring to integrals this paper shows that this goal can actually be reached indeed polychromatic environmental photoreactions are conducive to a monochromatic approximation which allows for the formulation of the above mentioned general equation this approximation greatly simplifies computations while entailing a negligible loss in accuracy in other words for every photoreaction e g the production of 1o2 by irradiated cdom it is possible to find a single monochromatic wavelength which closely approximates the behaviour of the polychromatic system such wavelength is here defined as equivalent monochromatic wavelength λ eq or emw in this way it is possible to use a monochromatic lambert beer equation or a slightly modified one vide infra to suitably approximate the photoreaction system the emw based approach to photochemical calculations that is presented here could introduce a completely new paradigm for the description of environmental photoreactions it could allow for highly simplified photochemical calculations and eventually for a much higher number of scientists to have access to photochemical modelling 2 methods the model calculations concerning the polychromatic systems were carried out by using the apex software aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics apex predicts degradation kinetics and lifetimes in surface waters based on parameters that describe pollutant photodegradation absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields second order reaction rate constants with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and on features that are connected with the photochemical reactivity of the aquatic environments solar spectrum and irradiance water chemistry and spectrum depth of the water column bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 to do so apex carries out multi wavelength calculations that make wide use of numerical integrals braslavky 2007 using polychromatic equations that will be presented later on wherever relevant for the discussion the use of apex to do these calculations is simply much faster than carrying out numerical integrals one by one not all the quantities used in this work explicitly appear in the output files e g apex explicitly reports the steady state concentrations of oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom but not their formation rates vide infra but one can obtain the desired data by applying suitable back calculations to the apex output briefly apex produces csv files that can be processed by e g microsoft excel to obtain the desired quantities the results of polychromatic calculations were plotted using the fig p software fig p software corporation ontario canada the same software was also used to fit the polychromatic data with monochromatic equations based on the lambert beer law braslavky 2007 which were slightly modified whenever necessary to improve the data fit e g for cdom absorption and related quantities basically the form of the monochromatic equations emw approach is similar to that of the polychromatic ones except that the emw approach does not make use of integrals that in fact do not appear in the monochromatic lambert beer law the relevant polychromatic and emw equations will be presented wherever required in the next results and discussion section a suitable starting point to identify the emw that best reproduces the behaviour of the polychromatic system is to take water absorbance into account the absorbance of surface waters is mostly accounted for by cdom especially in the 300 500 nm wavelength interval that is most significant for photochemical reactions bracchini et al 2004 galgani et al 2011 on this basis water absorbance can be expressed as follows a w λ 100 a 1 λ d o c d where a w λ is unitless a 1 λ has units of l mgc 1 cm 1 the doc dissolved organic carbon is in mgc l 1 d water depth in m and 100 is the conversion factor between m and cm the parameter a 1 λeq is the most useful fit parameter that allows for the identification of λeq because water absorbance and wavelength are univocally linked by the relationship a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ that often holds for surface waters λ is here expressed in nm vione et al 2010 therefore once a 1 λeq is determined by data fit it is quite easy to derive the value of λeq the latter allows for fixing the other two important parameters that depend on the wavelength in the polychromatic approach they are p λeq the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight and εs λeq the molar absorption coefficient of the substrate pollutant s bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 by applying the data fit procedure to the different processes direct photolysis and reactions with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and by summing up the respective fit equations one obtains an approximated emw equation that expresses the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constant of the relevant pollutant k s for ease of writing and suitability of software use excel and maplev vide infra this single emw equation was actually split into a set of individual equations that are more easily managed the predictions of the emw equation set of equations were then compared with the results of apex modelling emw calculations were carried out by means of xls spreadsheets which are here reported as part of the supplementary material hereinafter sm to aid potential users a dedicated spreadsheet is here provided for each studied pollutant additionally in order to show that the approximated emw equation can be managed with plot drawing software without too much sophistication 3d plots of k s vs doc and d were drawn by using maplev waterloo software ontario canada the maple scripts that are needed to obtain the 3d plots are provided as sm one for each studied pollutant the choice of pollutants for this work was guided by the availability of photoreactivity parameters and at the same time of comparison results between field data of photodegradation kinetics and apex predictions in other words pollutants were chosen for which photoreactivity data in the field exist which have already been reproduced well with apex this means that the chosen pollutants also need to have known values of photolysis quantum yield and second order reaction rate constants with the photogenerated transients otherwise predictions with apex cannot be made the available field data were thus used to validate the application of apex to the relevant pollutants and in turn the approximated emw predictions were validated by comparing them with the apex results the comparison between apex predictions and field photoreactivity data is provided in table 1 for the different pollutants under study 3 results and discussion 3 1 monochromatic approximations to the polychromatic problem 3 1 1 indirect photochemistry the formation rate of 3cdom from irradiated cdom can be computed by considering the polychromatic absorption of sunlight by cdom itself braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 1 r 3 c d o m 10 d λ φ 3 c d o m p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ where r 3 c d o m has units of mol l 1 s 1 d m is the optical path length of sunlight in water in a first approximation it can be assimilated to the water depth zepp et al 1977 bodrato and vione 2014 10 1000 100 is the ratio of two conversion factors i between l and cm3 1000 and ii between m and cm 100 φ 3 c d o m unitless or mol einstein 1 is the photogeneration quantum yield of 3cdom from cdom p λ einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight a 1 λ l mgc 1 cm 1 is the specific absorbance of cdom over an optical path length of 1 cm often it is a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015λ vione et al 2010 finally doc mgc l 1 is the dissolved organic carbon note that φ 3 c d o m is a wavelength averaged value and its use is only an approximation because i there is compelling experimental evidence that the quantum yield of 3cdom generation by irradiated cdom decreases as the wavelength increases marchisio et al 2015 thus the 3cdom quantum yield should read as φ 3 c d o m λ and ii different types of cdom show different photoreactivity dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mcneill and canonica 2016 wang et al 2020 however presently available data concerning the wavelength trend of φ 3 c d o m λ are quite rough they consist of just three figures referred to the uvb uva and blue spectral ranges marchisio et al 2015 and do not provide a considerable improvement over the use of just one average value work is currently in progress to obtain a more refined wavelength trend for φ 3 c d o m λ as well as for φ 1 o 2 λ and φ o h λ moreover although different values of φ 3 c d o m have been reported upon irradiation of different cdom specimens mcneill and canonica 2016 the irradiation of natural water samples from quite different environments lowland lakes of different trophicity mountain lakes has provided surprisingly small variability in φ 3 c d o m λ marchisio et al 2015 perhaps suggesting that the same chromophores may be operational in different contexts the most important differences have been observed upon irradiation of water samples taken soon after water de icing and thus relative to water that had undergone very little photo processing prior to sampling de laurentiis et al 2013 it might thus be suggested that a previous history of cdom irradiation may play key role in defining photoreactivity and that sunlight exposure might be a very effective equalizer as far as cdom photoreactivity is concerned certainly cdom irradiation is able to equalize the absorption spectra of cdom itself berto et al 2013 starting from equation 1 it is interesting to see whether there is a single wavelength at which the photochemical behaviour of cdom reproduces the polychromatic trend of e g r 3 c d o m as a function of doc and d they are the most important water parameters as far as photochemistry is concerned vione et al 2014 the monochromatic emw equation for r 3 c d o m should have a lambert beer form as follows braslavsky 2007 2 r 3 c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p 3 c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d where p λeq einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight at the wavelength λeq and a 1 λeq l mgc 1 cm 1 is the specific absorbance of cdom at λeq the quantity ϕ a p p 3 c d o m deserves additional explanation it replaces the quantum yield φ 3 c d o m but it is not exactly a quantum yield it is rather the ratio between the reaction rate of a polychromatic process and the absorption of monochromatic radiation at λeq in this case by cdom because radiation absorption at a single wavelength is much lower than polychromatic absorption which sums up absorption of radiation at all relevant wavelengths it would not be surprising to find ϕ a p p 1 even if φ 1 hereinafter ϕ a p p will be named apparent photon efficiency fig 1 a reports as solid squares the apex polychromatic results for r 3 c d o m as a function of both doc varied in a range of up to 25 mgc l 1 and d up to 10 m which conditions are relevant to most reasonably sunlit i e not too deep or coloured surface waters where photochemistry has good chances to be important vione et al 2014 the polychromatic values were obtained by means of equation 1 considering a standard sunlight spectrum with uv irradiance 290 400 nm of 22 w m 2 as can be found in mid july at mid latitude at 9 am or 3 pm solar time it is the default spectrum used in apex see also fig s1 in sm bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 the dashed curves represent the fit of the polychromatic data with equation 2 emw approximation with the constraint of matching λeq between p λeq and a 1 λeq that is the two quantities should correspond to the same wavelength that when found is defined as λeq or emw the same value of λeq 500 nm in the present case was used for all the fit curves this means that optimisation was done on the intermediate data set that corresponding to d 3 m and the optimised results were then applied to all the other sets with d as the only variable the fit quality is here acceptable photochemistry modelling is affected by higher uncertainties but not impressive the main issue is that the polychromatic and the monochromatic functions have different curvatures because penetration of sunlight into the water column is not the same at all wavelengths therefore shorter wavelengths play a more important role at low d and longer wavelengths become prevalent at high d the lambert beer monochromatic approximation with a single value of the specific water absorbance a 1 λeq cannot reproduce well such a polychromatic behaviour to improve the quality of the approximation one should find a way to enable the monochromatic equation to assume different curvatures at different depths which cannot be done in the sheer lambert beer monochromatic form that affords only a single curvature a suitable solution to this problem is to modify equation 2 by adding an exponent which depends on d and provides the needed change in curvature as d changes note that this exponent has no physical meaning it is only a way to make the monochromatic equation adjust its curvature as d varies nevertheless it is a quite easy way to maintain the monochromatic form while at the same time emulating the features of the polychromatic equation by playing a bit with data fit it was found that a suitable fit function has the following form 3 r 3 c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p 3 c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ with λeq 560 nm α 3 0 10 4 m 2 β 2 2 10 4 m 1 γ 0 58 and ϕ a p p 3 c d o m 0 33 one gets the very good data fit that is reported as the dashed curves in fig 1 b equation 3 is only phenomenological derived by a modification of the lambert beer function but it predicts the polychromatic trend very well at all values of doc and d note that p 560nm 3 3 10 10 einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 and a 1 560nm 1 0 10 4 l mgc 1 cm 1 moreover one has ϕ a p p 3 c d o m φ 3 c d o m because of the monochromatic approximation in the case of 1o2 the polychromatic calculation of its formation rate reads as follows see solid squares in fig 2 a braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 4 r 1 o 2 10 d λ φ 1 o 2 p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ because 1o2 is photogenerated by irradiated cdom like 3cdom the emw approximation assumes the form already seen with exponent added 5 r 1 o 2 10 d ϕ a p p 1 o 2 p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ where λeq p λeq a 1 λeq α β and γ are the same as already seen for r 3 c d o m which is reasonable because cdom is the light absorbing species for both 3cdom and 1o2 while ϕ a p p 1 o 2 0 32 the predictions of equation 5 with these parameters are shown as the dashed curves in fig 2 a in quite good agreement with polychromatic equation 4 the radical oh can be generated by cdom no3 and no2 the formation rate of oh by cdom reads as follows in respectively the polychromatic braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 and emw approaches 6 r o h c d o m 10 d λ φ o h c d o m p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ 7 r o h c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p o h c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ with the usual values of λeq p λeq a 1 λeq α β and γ and with ϕ a p p o h c d o m 7 7 10 3 the exponent α d 2 β d γ is the same as for 3cdom and 1o2 because cdom is also in this case the photosensitiser that yields oh the agreement between the emw and polychromatic results is again quite good see fig 2 b note that the same formal approach formation quantum yield times cdom absorption was used here for the formation rates of 3cdom 1o2 and oh by irradiated cdom however there is an important difference between the formation pathway of oh and that of 3cdom 1o2 3cdom 1o2 share the involvement of 3cdom although the wavelength trends are quite different marchisio et al 2015 partanen et al 2020 this probably happens because some of the cdom photosensitisers that produce 1o2 might be unable to oxidise the 3cdom probe molecules mcneill and canonica 2016 actually oh formation involves 3cdom only to a partial extent while water oxidation by 3cdom is probably not an important oh source although some triplet states but probably only a small minority of them are actually able to oxidise h2o and or oh sur et al 2011 about half of oh photogeneration by cdom involves h2o2 that might well be generated by 3cdom reactions see reactions 8 10 where s is an oxidisable organic molecule page et al 2011 however the other half of oh photogeneration likely involves the photolysis of poly hydroxylated compounds that occur in irradiated cdom sun et al 2015 and here there is no clear evidence of 3cdom involvement still in all these cases the oh photogeneration process is triggered by irradiated cdom which justifies the approach of formation quantum yield times cdom absorption that was used here it will be interesting to compare the detailed wavelength trends of φ 3 c d o m λ and φ o h λ work in progress to see whether different pathways might result into different trends currently available data suggest some similarities but they are too few to enable proper comparison marchisio et al 2015 8 3 cdom s cdo m s 9 cdo m o 2 cdom o 2 h h o 2 10 h o 2 o 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 in the case of nitrate and nitrite one should consider the fact that unlike cdom these two species are not the main radiation absorbers in surface waters therefore competition for sunlight between no3 no2 and cdom should be taken into account the polychromatic and emw treatments of the oh formation rates read respectively as follows braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 11 r o h s e n s 10 d λ φ o h s e n s p λ ε s e n s λ s e n s a 1 λ d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ 12 r o h s e n s 10 d ϕ a p p o h s e n s p λ e q ε s e n s λ e q s e n s a 1

quite good agreement between the polychromatic and emw calculations is reported in fig 2 c no3 and fig 2 d no2 interestingly in the case of the photoproduction of oh by no3 or no2 as photosensitisers there was no need to introduce an exponent in the emw equation this means that the lambert beer equation at the right λeq reproduced well the polychromatic behaviour the reason is that cdom absorbs sunlight in a very wide wavelength interval 300 600 nm where a pure lambert beer law cannot predict absorption well at any single wavelength in contrast the wavelength range of sunlight absorption by no3 300 340 nm and no2 300 420 nm is more limited vione et al 2007 and as a consequence more amenable to a emw approach it is also interesting to observe that the photochemical production rates of 3cdom 1o2 and oh by irradiated cdom increased with increasing doc while the production rates of oh by no3 and no2 had the opposite trend the reason is that the absorption of radiation by cdom is higher at higher doc due to the higher amount of cdom in solution at the same time elevated cdom efficiently out competes no3 and no2 for radiation absorption which means that no3 and no2 absorb radiation to a lesser extent at higher doc and produce less oh as a consequence vione et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 3 1 2 direct photolysis the different pollutants substrates under study s atz btz cbz dcl diu and ibu undergo direct photolysis as well the direct photolysis rate constant k d p of a substrate s upon absorption of radiation over a range of wavelengths should consider competition for sunlight between s and cdom therefore the photolysis rate constant k d p s can be expressed as follows braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 13 k d p s 10 d λ p λ φ d p s ε s λ τ a 1 λ d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ where φ d p s unitless or einstein mol 1 is the direct photolysis quantum yield of the pollutant s ε s λ l mol 1 cm 1 its molar absorption coefficient see fig s1 in

latitude 15 july i e day 1 taking the respective sunlight irradiances and the day night cycle into account bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 all the other quantities have been defined previously the

direct photolysis of s the monochromatic approximation to the polychromatic trend is as good as usual see fig s2 in sm and there was no need to add an exponent to equation 14 to obtain a decent data fit the reason is that the wavelength range where the pollutants under study absorb sunlight is reasonably limited up to one hundred nm but usually much shorter see fig s1 in sm therefore a pure monochromatic trend can approximate the polychromatic one well provided that λeq is correctly identified chosen in particular it was found λeq 340 nm for atz 350 nm for btz 333 nm for cbz 320 nm for dcl 310 nm for diu and 350 nm for ibu the values of the other parameters p λeq a 1 λeq εs λeq are provided in table s1 sm 3 2 modelling of pollutants photodegradation kinetics polychromatic vs

solvent zepp et al 1977 buxton et al 1988 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 bodrato and vione 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 the case of co3 is a bit different because the carbonate radical is not produced directly by the photosensitisers but rather indirectly upon interaction between oh 3cdom and inorganic carbon oh hco3 oh co3 2 3cdom co3 2 canonica et al 2005 therefore the steady state co3

range of 15 240 l mgc 1 s 1 for different dom specimens and it decreases with increasing e2 e3 the ratio of water absorbance values at 250 and 365 nm this finding means that k c o 3 d o m is higher if c dom is more aromatic the value of k c o 3 d o m has a key impact on co3 as shown in fig s3 of the sm therefore all other conditions being equal waters with highly aromatic dom might have low co3

obtained before moreover considering the ratio between polychromatic and monochromatic absorption one gets η c o 3 1 7 therefore one can use equation 20 to obtain the value of p a cdom which replaced in equation 19 gives co3 considering all the different photochemical processes it is possible to derive the steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transients equations 16 19 and substitute them together with the direct photolysis rate constant equation 14 into equation 15 to finally obtain the emw assessment of the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of the studied compounds the polychromatic modelling of lifetimes is carried out efficiently by the apex software thus one can compare the polychromatic exact and monochromatic approximate approaches to rate constants and lifetimes the comparison is shown in fig 3 where the solid squares represent the apex results and the dashed curves are the emw predictions obtained by using equation 15 again one observes quite good agreement for all the doc and depth conditions which cover a wide range of environmental values for surface waters wetzel 2001 this finding means that it is possible to reliably model phototransformation reactions by using a monochromatic approach based on emws which allows for simpler equations to be obtained without numerical integrals and thus considerably simplifies the mathematical treatment of photochemical modelling note the trend with a minimum of k atz vs doc in fig 3 a and to a lesser extent that of k diu vs doc in fig 3 e such a trend is due to the fact that increasing doc inhibits direct photolysis as well as oh and co3 reactions while enhancing the 3cdom and 1o2 processes one observes a similar trend whenever the 3cdom and or 1o2 reaction becomes sufficiently fast at high doc marchetti et al 2013 vione et al 2014 the excellent agreement between the polychromatic approach and the emw based one ensures that the data used to validate the apex polychromatic model see table 1 can also be used for a validation of the emw approximation therefore also the emw approach is able to predict quite well the field data of pollutant photodegradation 3 3 implications for the modelling of freshwater photochemistry it is the impression of the writer that the huge potential provided by photochemistry modelling which also encompasses the relationship between surface water photoreactions and climate change vione and scozzaro 2019 is presently exploited only in small part one of the reasons may be that thus far modelling has made use of polychromatic calculations which is fully justified because the natural environment is indeed polychromatic that are however quite difficult to implement therefore one either has to use dedicated software bodrato and vione 2014 epa 2020 vione 2020 which often behaves as a black box and may be difficult to customise or has to develop own spreadsheets that have to include numerical integration procedures zhou et al 2018 the latter require advanced programming skills that probably discourage many potential users this paper shows that it is possible to greatly simplify the mathematics and computational weight of the modelling process by replacing the polychromatic approach with a monochromatic one based on emws without significant loss in accuracy moreover the ability of the emw approach to carry out a reasonably correct prediction of the field lifetimes of two additional pollutants that do not undergo direct photolysis such as the pharmaceutical metabolite and pesticide isomer clofibric acid and the artificial sweetener acesulfame k is shown in table 2 compared to polychromatic models the emw approach allows for a simpler set of mathematical equations to be obtained the set of equations and their parameter values are summarised in the sm table s1 which can be included into a spreadsheet or into graphics software excel spreadsheets to predict the first order phototransformation rate constants and lifetimes of the studied pollutants are provided as sm the sm also provides maple v scripts to draw 3d plots of the photodegradation rate constants vs doc and d these 3d plots are shown in fig 4 for the different pollutants under study the present results constitute a proof of concept that the emw approach works well and is fully equivalent to the rigorous polychromatic treatment of photodegradation reactions as far as freshwater photochemistry is concerned all calculations are here referred to mid july mid latitude water conditions the following implementations should be introduced in forthcoming work to enable the adoption of emw as the standard approach to surface water photochemistry modelling i extend the emw approach to other contaminants in particular as far as the direct photolysis is concerned indeed each compound needs its own emw treatment to find the values of λ eq and ϕ app d p for instance the apex database contains about 40 compounds in addition to those studied here vione 2020 and it could constitute a good starting point for the work of translation of the polychromatic language into the emw one ii extend the results to other latitudes and seasons the present findings are limited to mid july at mid latitude because the used values of p λ eq and τ are referred to those conditions p λ eq and τ are clearly functions of season and latitude ncar 2015 and obtaining explicit forms for both would be the key to deriving a general worldwide valid equation for surface water photochemistry as far as the former point is concerned it is useful to get some insight into how to find the value of λeq that fits well the polychromatic data take such data e g those of the direct photolysis rate constant vs the doc for different depths d they are the data reported in fig s2 in sm these data can be generated by apex with the appropriate input values and equation 14 as the fit function the curvature of the function is key to a good data fit and it primarily depends on a 1 λeq therefore one should first fit the polychromatic data of k d p s vs doc with equation 14 by fixing d and τ at their respective values and by defining a 1 λeq p λeq ϕ app d p s and ε s λeq as free floating parameters the obtained value of a 1 λeq is the only important fit result because it allows for λeq to be obtained from a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015λ λ 66 7 ln a 1 λ 53 3 note that ln a 1 λ varies from 5 to 8 in the range of 300 500 nm that done one can fix the values of p λeq and ε s λeq the next data fit can thus be carried out by taking only ϕ app d p s as free floating variable in this way all the emw parameters can be properly obtained the last step is to check that equation 14 with the proper parameters predicts well the polychromatic results at all values of d 4 conclusions an equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw is here defined as the single wavelength that closely reproduces the behaviour of a polychromatic system once the emw is found it is possible to replace the polychromatic integrals with a much simpler monochromatic lambert beer equation to derive radiation absorption and photoreaction rates a pure emw based lambert beer equation works less well in the case of cdom absorption and related quantities however it is possible to solve the problem by introducing a slight modification to the lambert beer equation while maintaining its monochromatic nature if the emw language is adopted as standard in photochemistry calculations it has the potential to greatly simplify computations of all

17252,the recent development of successful model approaches that predict the photochemical behaviour of surface waters has greatly aided in the understanding of how water environments work and will likely work in the future from a photochemical point of view however the inherent multi wavelength polychromatic nature of environmental photochemistry causes the relevant mathematics to be quite complex which discourages many scientists to carry out photochemical calculations to greatly simplify model mathematics this paper proposes a new approach that is based on a monochromatic approximation to the polychromatic problem introducing the concept of what is here defined as equivalent monochromatic wavelengths emws the emw is the single wavelength that reproduces the behaviour of the polychromatic system using a monochromatic lambert beer based equation the emw approach largely simplifies calculations getting rid of integrals and allowing for much more straightforward and manageable equations to be obtained in particular this work shows that i the emw approach although approximated entails a negligible loss in accuracy compared to the exact polychromatic treatment of photochemical reactions ii in the case of direct photolysis the quantum yield is to be replaced by an apparent photon efficiency that is not bound to be 1 quantum yields can actually be 1 for chain reactions and few other cases but this is not the point here iii the monochromatic lambert beer equations work in most cases once the emw is identified with the present exception of sunlight absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom the latter spans a very wide wavelength range from 300 to at least 600 nm which makes a single wavelength treatment more difficult however a relatively small modification to the monochromatic lambert beer equation allows for successfully using the emw approach in the case of cdom as well the near perfect coincidence between polychromatic and emw based predictions of photodegradation kinetics is here shown for the pollutants atrazine bentazone carbamazepine diclofenac diuron and ibuprofen extension to additional compounds requires translation of the traditional polychromatic language into the emw one hopefully this contribution will introduce a new paradigm in the mathematical description of photochemical reactions in environmental waters it could also become a new and simple way to treat multi wavelength systems in general photochemistry studies thereby completely changing the way multi wavelength problems are dealt with graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polychromatic systems lambert beer monochromatic equations photochemical modelling natural attenuation of pollutants numerical data fit 1 introduction natural attenuation processes that occur in surface waters play a very important role in the degradation of water pollutants although natural attenuation alone is not sufficient to fight pollution the impact of human activities on water environments would be much higher than is currently observed were attenuation processes not operational schwarzenbach et al 2006 fenner et al 2013 photochemical reactions triggered directly or indirectly by sunlight are an important component in natural attenuation and they are particularly effective against dissolved water soluble biorecalcitrant compounds cermola et al 2005 young et al 2013 remucal et al 2014 vione et al 2014 trivella et al 2015 trawinski and skibinski 2017 yassine et al 2018 water solubility and biorecalcitrance are quite common among the so called contaminants of emerging concerns cecs which end up in surface waters largely because of their insufficient removal by wastewater treatment plants wwtps indeed the use of the activated sludge step for pollutant degradation selects for compounds that are both biorecalcitrant otherwise they would be biodegraded by bacteria and water soluble otherwise they would attach to the biomass and end up in the separated sludge phase not the aqueous one castiglioni et al 2006 gao et al 2012 richardson and ternes 2014 photochemical reactions in surface waters can be divided into direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry in the former the pollutant absorbs sunlight and gets transformed as a consequence pace and barreca 2014 in indirect photoreactions sunlight is absorbed by naturally occurring photosensitisers chromophoric dissolved organic matter or cdom nitrate and nitrite to produce a range of reactive transient species the hydroxyl radical oh the carbonate radical co3 singlet oxygen 1o2 as well as cdom triplet states 3cdom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 mcneill and canonica 2016 the photogenerated reactive transients quickly reach steady state concentrations due to the production consumption budget they react with pollutants to induce degradation but this is generally a secondary consumption pathway the radical oh is in fact mostly scavenged by dissolved organic matter dom not necessarily chromophoric and by hco3 and co3 2 as well as by br in saltwater co3 is scavenged by dom 3cdom are mainly deactivated by ground state o2 in part to yield 1o2 finally 1o2 is mainly quenched by collision with water molecules zepp et al 1977a vione et al 2014 photochemical reactions can be studied in the laboratory although it is difficult to completely reproduce the natural environment under laboratory conditions especially as far as water column depths are concerned recently it has become possible to reliably model surface water photoreactions based on pollutant photoreactivity data absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields second order reaction rate constants with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and on photochemically relevant environmental factors sunlight irradiance and spectrum water chemistry and depth zhou et al 2018 vione and scozzaro 2019 a major feature of environmental photochemistry is its multi wavelength nature or polychromaticity indeed a range of wavelengths occurs in all solar radiation photosensitiser absorption and pollutant absorption this means that light absorption and as a consequence photoreactivity calculations are multi wavelength ones and are largely based on numerical integrals zepp et al 1977b zepp et al 1987 bodrato and vione 2014 the main drawback of this state of things is that the procedures needed to compute photoreactions are not easy and require either i dedicated software which is freely available but may have limitations or be difficult to customise epa 2020 vione 2020 or ii the self development of calculation spreadsheets which requires advanced it skills zhou et al 2018 these difficulties are probably the main obstacle that has limited so far the diffusion of photochemistry modelling within the scientific community plane et al 1987 gerecke et al 2001 halladja et al 2007 bintou et al 2015 silva et al 2015 carena et al 2017 silva et al 2019 apell and mcneill 2019 it is also the author s opinion that photochemical modelling would be greatly simplified were it possible to formulate a general equation that describes photoreaction kinetics without recurring to integrals this paper shows that this goal can actually be reached indeed polychromatic environmental photoreactions are conducive to a monochromatic approximation which allows for the formulation of the above mentioned general equation this approximation greatly simplifies computations while entailing a negligible loss in accuracy in other words for every photoreaction e g the production of 1o2 by irradiated cdom it is possible to find a single monochromatic wavelength which closely approximates the behaviour of the polychromatic system such wavelength is here defined as equivalent monochromatic wavelength λ eq or emw in this way it is possible to use a monochromatic lambert beer equation or a slightly modified one vide infra to suitably approximate the photoreaction system the emw based approach to photochemical calculations that is presented here could introduce a completely new paradigm for the description of environmental photoreactions it could allow for highly simplified photochemical calculations and eventually for a much higher number of scientists to have access to photochemical modelling 2 methods the model calculations concerning the polychromatic systems were carried out by using the apex software aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics apex predicts degradation kinetics and lifetimes in surface waters based on parameters that describe pollutant photodegradation absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields second order reaction rate constants with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and on features that are connected with the photochemical reactivity of the aquatic environments solar spectrum and irradiance water chemistry and spectrum depth of the water column bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 to do so apex carries out multi wavelength calculations that make wide use of numerical integrals braslavky 2007 using polychromatic equations that will be presented later on wherever relevant for the discussion the use of apex to do these calculations is simply much faster than carrying out numerical integrals one by one not all the quantities used in this work explicitly appear in the output files e g apex explicitly reports the steady state concentrations of oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom but not their formation rates vide infra but one can obtain the desired data by applying suitable back calculations to the apex output briefly apex produces csv files that can be processed by e g microsoft excel to obtain the desired quantities the results of polychromatic calculations were plotted using the fig p software fig p software corporation ontario canada the same software was also used to fit the polychromatic data with monochromatic equations based on the lambert beer law braslavky 2007 which were slightly modified whenever necessary to improve the data fit e g for cdom absorption and related quantities basically the form of the monochromatic equations emw approach is similar to that of the polychromatic ones except that the emw approach does not make use of integrals that in fact do not appear in the monochromatic lambert beer law the relevant polychromatic and emw equations will be presented wherever required in the next results and discussion section a suitable starting point to identify the emw that best reproduces the behaviour of the polychromatic system is to take water absorbance into account the absorbance of surface waters is mostly accounted for by cdom especially in the 300 500 nm wavelength interval that is most significant for photochemical reactions bracchini et al 2004 galgani et al 2011 on this basis water absorbance can be expressed as follows a w λ 100 a 1 λ d o c d where a w λ is unitless a 1 λ has units of l mgc 1 cm 1 the doc dissolved organic carbon is in mgc l 1 d water depth in m and 100 is the conversion factor between m and cm the parameter a 1 λeq is the most useful fit parameter that allows for the identification of λeq because water absorbance and wavelength are univocally linked by the relationship a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ that often holds for surface waters λ is here expressed in nm vione et al 2010 therefore once a 1 λeq is determined by data fit it is quite easy to derive the value of λeq the latter allows for fixing the other two important parameters that depend on the wavelength in the polychromatic approach they are p λeq the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight and εs λeq the molar absorption coefficient of the substrate pollutant s bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 by applying the data fit procedure to the different processes direct photolysis and reactions with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom and by summing up the respective fit equations one obtains an approximated emw equation that expresses the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constant of the relevant pollutant k s for ease of writing and suitability of software use excel and maplev vide infra this single emw equation was actually split into a set of individual equations that are more easily managed the predictions of the emw equation set of equations were then compared with the results of apex modelling emw calculations were carried out by means of xls spreadsheets which are here reported as part of the supplementary material hereinafter sm to aid potential users a dedicated spreadsheet is here provided for each studied pollutant additionally in order to show that the approximated emw equation can be managed with plot drawing software without too much sophistication 3d plots of k s vs doc and d were drawn by using maplev waterloo software ontario canada the maple scripts that are needed to obtain the 3d plots are provided as sm one for each studied pollutant the choice of pollutants for this work was guided by the availability of photoreactivity parameters and at the same time of comparison results between field data of photodegradation kinetics and apex predictions in other words pollutants were chosen for which photoreactivity data in the field exist which have already been reproduced well with apex this means that the chosen pollutants also need to have known values of photolysis quantum yield and second order reaction rate constants with the photogenerated transients otherwise predictions with apex cannot be made the available field data were thus used to validate the application of apex to the relevant pollutants and in turn the approximated emw predictions were validated by comparing them with the apex results the comparison between apex predictions and field photoreactivity data is provided in table 1 for the different pollutants under study 3 results and discussion 3 1 monochromatic approximations to the polychromatic problem 3 1 1 indirect photochemistry the formation rate of 3cdom from irradiated cdom can be computed by considering the polychromatic absorption of sunlight by cdom itself braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 1 r 3 c d o m 10 d λ φ 3 c d o m p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ where r 3 c d o m has units of mol l 1 s 1 d m is the optical path length of sunlight in water in a first approximation it can be assimilated to the water depth zepp et al 1977 bodrato and vione 2014 10 1000 100 is the ratio of two conversion factors i between l and cm3 1000 and ii between m and cm 100 φ 3 c d o m unitless or mol einstein 1 is the photogeneration quantum yield of 3cdom from cdom p λ einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight a 1 λ l mgc 1 cm 1 is the specific absorbance of cdom over an optical path length of 1 cm often it is a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015λ vione et al 2010 finally doc mgc l 1 is the dissolved organic carbon note that φ 3 c d o m is a wavelength averaged value and its use is only an approximation because i there is compelling experimental evidence that the quantum yield of 3cdom generation by irradiated cdom decreases as the wavelength increases marchisio et al 2015 thus the 3cdom quantum yield should read as φ 3 c d o m λ and ii different types of cdom show different photoreactivity dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mcneill and canonica 2016 wang et al 2020 however presently available data concerning the wavelength trend of φ 3 c d o m λ are quite rough they consist of just three figures referred to the uvb uva and blue spectral ranges marchisio et al 2015 and do not provide a considerable improvement over the use of just one average value work is currently in progress to obtain a more refined wavelength trend for φ 3 c d o m λ as well as for φ 1 o 2 λ and φ o h λ moreover although different values of φ 3 c d o m have been reported upon irradiation of different cdom specimens mcneill and canonica 2016 the irradiation of natural water samples from quite different environments lowland lakes of different trophicity mountain lakes has provided surprisingly small variability in φ 3 c d o m λ marchisio et al 2015 perhaps suggesting that the same chromophores may be operational in different contexts the most important differences have been observed upon irradiation of water samples taken soon after water de icing and thus relative to water that had undergone very little photo processing prior to sampling de laurentiis et al 2013 it might thus be suggested that a previous history of cdom irradiation may play key role in defining photoreactivity and that sunlight exposure might be a very effective equalizer as far as cdom photoreactivity is concerned certainly cdom irradiation is able to equalize the absorption spectra of cdom itself berto et al 2013 starting from equation 1 it is interesting to see whether there is a single wavelength at which the photochemical behaviour of cdom reproduces the polychromatic trend of e g r 3 c d o m as a function of doc and d they are the most important water parameters as far as photochemistry is concerned vione et al 2014 the monochromatic emw equation for r 3 c d o m should have a lambert beer form as follows braslavsky 2007 2 r 3 c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p 3 c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d where p λeq einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight at the wavelength λeq and a 1 λeq l mgc 1 cm 1 is the specific absorbance of cdom at λeq the quantity ϕ a p p 3 c d o m deserves additional explanation it replaces the quantum yield φ 3 c d o m but it is not exactly a quantum yield it is rather the ratio between the reaction rate of a polychromatic process and the absorption of monochromatic radiation at λeq in this case by cdom because radiation absorption at a single wavelength is much lower than polychromatic absorption which sums up absorption of radiation at all relevant wavelengths it would not be surprising to find ϕ a p p 1 even if φ 1 hereinafter ϕ a p p will be named apparent photon efficiency fig 1 a reports as solid squares the apex polychromatic results for r 3 c d o m as a function of both doc varied in a range of up to 25 mgc l 1 and d up to 10 m which conditions are relevant to most reasonably sunlit i e not too deep or coloured surface waters where photochemistry has good chances to be important vione et al 2014 the polychromatic values were obtained by means of equation 1 considering a standard sunlight spectrum with uv irradiance 290 400 nm of 22 w m 2 as can be found in mid july at mid latitude at 9 am or 3 pm solar time it is the default spectrum used in apex see also fig s1 in sm bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 the dashed curves represent the fit of the polychromatic data with equation 2 emw approximation with the constraint of matching λeq between p λeq and a 1 λeq that is the two quantities should correspond to the same wavelength that when found is defined as λeq or emw the same value of λeq 500 nm in the present case was used for all the fit curves this means that optimisation was done on the intermediate data set that corresponding to d 3 m and the optimised results were then applied to all the other sets with d as the only variable the fit quality is here acceptable photochemistry modelling is affected by higher uncertainties but not impressive the main issue is that the polychromatic and the monochromatic functions have different curvatures because penetration of sunlight into the water column is not the same at all wavelengths therefore shorter wavelengths play a more important role at low d and longer wavelengths become prevalent at high d the lambert beer monochromatic approximation with a single value of the specific water absorbance a 1 λeq cannot reproduce well such a polychromatic behaviour to improve the quality of the approximation one should find a way to enable the monochromatic equation to assume different curvatures at different depths which cannot be done in the sheer lambert beer monochromatic form that affords only a single curvature a suitable solution to this problem is to modify equation 2 by adding an exponent which depends on d and provides the needed change in curvature as d changes note that this exponent has no physical meaning it is only a way to make the monochromatic equation adjust its curvature as d varies nevertheless it is a quite easy way to maintain the monochromatic form while at the same time emulating the features of the polychromatic equation by playing a bit with data fit it was found that a suitable fit function has the following form 3 r 3 c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p 3 c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ with λeq 560 nm α 3 0 10 4 m 2 β 2 2 10 4 m 1 γ 0 58 and ϕ a p p 3 c d o m 0 33 one gets the very good data fit that is reported as the dashed curves in fig 1 b equation 3 is only phenomenological derived by a modification of the lambert beer function but it predicts the polychromatic trend very well at all values of doc and d note that p 560nm 3 3 10 10 einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 and a 1 560nm 1 0 10 4 l mgc 1 cm 1 moreover one has ϕ a p p 3 c d o m φ 3 c d o m because of the monochromatic approximation in the case of 1o2 the polychromatic calculation of its formation rate reads as follows see solid squares in fig 2 a braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 4 r 1 o 2 10 d λ φ 1 o 2 p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ because 1o2 is photogenerated by irradiated cdom like 3cdom the emw approximation assumes the form already seen with exponent added 5 r 1 o 2 10 d ϕ a p p 1 o 2 p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ where λeq p λeq a 1 λeq α β and γ are the same as already seen for r 3 c d o m which is reasonable because cdom is the light absorbing species for both 3cdom and 1o2 while ϕ a p p 1 o 2 0 32 the predictions of equation 5 with these parameters are shown as the dashed curves in fig 2 a in quite good agreement with polychromatic equation 4 the radical oh can be generated by cdom no3 and no2 the formation rate of oh by cdom reads as follows in respectively the polychromatic braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 and emw approaches 6 r o h c d o m 10 d λ φ o h c d o m p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ 7 r o h c d o m 10 d ϕ a p p o h c d o m p λ e q 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d α d 2 β d γ with the usual values of λeq p λeq a 1 λeq α β and γ and with ϕ a p p o h c d o m 7 7 10 3 the exponent α d 2 β d γ is the same as for 3cdom and 1o2 because cdom is also in this case the photosensitiser that yields oh the agreement between the emw and polychromatic results is again quite good see fig 2 b note that the same formal approach formation quantum yield times cdom absorption was used here for the formation rates of 3cdom 1o2 and oh by irradiated cdom however there is an important difference between the formation pathway of oh and that of 3cdom 1o2 3cdom 1o2 share the involvement of 3cdom although the wavelength trends are quite different marchisio et al 2015 partanen et al 2020 this probably happens because some of the cdom photosensitisers that produce 1o2 might be unable to oxidise the 3cdom probe molecules mcneill and canonica 2016 actually oh formation involves 3cdom only to a partial extent while water oxidation by 3cdom is probably not an important oh source although some triplet states but probably only a small minority of them are actually able to oxidise h2o and or oh sur et al 2011 about half of oh photogeneration by cdom involves h2o2 that might well be generated by 3cdom reactions see reactions 8 10 where s is an oxidisable organic molecule page et al 2011 however the other half of oh photogeneration likely involves the photolysis of poly hydroxylated compounds that occur in irradiated cdom sun et al 2015 and here there is no clear evidence of 3cdom involvement still in all these cases the oh photogeneration process is triggered by irradiated cdom which justifies the approach of formation quantum yield times cdom absorption that was used here it will be interesting to compare the detailed wavelength trends of φ 3 c d o m λ and φ o h λ work in progress to see whether different pathways might result into different trends currently available data suggest some similarities but they are too few to enable proper comparison marchisio et al 2015 8 3 cdom s cdo m s 9 cdo m o 2 cdom o 2 h h o 2 10 h o 2 o 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 in the case of nitrate and nitrite one should consider the fact that unlike cdom these two species are not the main radiation absorbers in surface waters therefore competition for sunlight between no3 no2 and cdom should be taken into account the polychromatic and emw treatments of the oh formation rates read respectively as follows braslavsky 2007 bodrato and

quite good agreement between the polychromatic and emw calculations is reported in fig 2 c no3 and fig 2 d no2 interestingly in the case of the photoproduction of oh by no3 or no2 as photosensitisers there was no need to introduce an exponent in the emw equation this means that the lambert beer equation at the right λeq reproduced well the polychromatic behaviour the reason is that cdom absorbs sunlight in a very wide wavelength interval 300 600 nm where a pure lambert beer law cannot predict absorption well at any single wavelength in contrast the wavelength range of sunlight absorption by no3 300 340 nm and no2 300 420 nm is more limited vione et al 2007 and as a consequence more amenable to a emw approach it is also interesting to observe that the photochemical production rates of 3cdom 1o2 and oh by irradiated cdom increased with increasing doc while the production rates of oh by no3 and no2 had the opposite trend the reason is that the absorption of radiation by cdom is higher at higher doc due to the higher amount of cdom in solution at the same time elevated cdom efficiently out competes no3 and no2 for radiation absorption which means that no3 and no2 absorb radiation to a lesser extent at higher doc and produce less oh as a consequence vione et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 3 1 2 direct photolysis the different pollutants substrates under study s atz btz cbz dcl diu and ibu undergo direct photolysis as well the direct photolysis rate constant k d p of a substrate s upon absorption of radiation over a range of wavelengths should consider competition for sunlight between s and cdom therefore the photolysis rate constant k d p s can be expressed as follows braslavsky 2007 bodrato and vione 2014 13 k d p s 10 d λ p λ φ d p s ε s λ τ a 1 λ d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ d o c d d λ where φ d p s unitless or einstein mol 1 is the direct photolysis quantum yield of the pollutant s ε s λ l mol 1 cm 1 its molar absorption coefficient see fig s1 in sm and τ 3 6 104 s day 1 the conversion factor between the standard kinetic unit under constant irradiation s 1 22 w m 2 constant uv irradiance and the inverse of a sunny day equivalent to mid latitude 15 july i e day 1 taking the respective sunlight irradiances and the day night cycle into account bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 all the other quantities have been defined previously the emw approximation takes the following form 14 k d p s 10 d p λ e q ϕ a p p d p s ε s λ e q τ a 1 λ e q d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ e q d o c d where ϕ app d p s is the apparent photon efficiency for the direct photolysis of s the monochromatic approximation to the polychromatic trend is as good as usual see fig s2 in sm and there was no need to add an exponent to equation 14 to obtain a decent data fit the reason is that the wavelength range where the pollutants under study absorb sunlight is reasonably limited up to one hundred nm but usually much shorter see fig s1 in sm therefore a pure monochromatic trend can approximate the polychromatic one well provided that λeq is correctly identified chosen in particular it was found λeq 340 nm for atz 350 nm for btz 333 nm for cbz 320 nm for dcl 310 nm for diu and 350 nm for ibu the values of the other parameters p λeq a 1 λeq εs λeq are provided in table s1 sm 3 2 modelling of pollutants photodegradation kinetics polychromatic vs monochromatic approaches the pseudo first order rate constant for the photodegradation of s in surface waters can be expressed as the sum of the contributions of all photochemical processes bodrato

because the products k s j j yield values in s 1 while k d p s has already been defined in day 1 units the values of the second order reaction rate constants of the studied pollutants with oh 3cdom 1o2 and co3 are reported in table s1 sm the steady state concentrations of oh 3cdom and 1o2 can be expressed as a function of the formation rates defined previously equations 3 5 7 12 as follows vione

o 3 2 c o 3 2 k o h n o 2 n o 2 k o h b r b r is the scavenging rate constant of oh by the main solution components see table s1 sm for the values of the relevant second order reaction rate constants k d 5 105 s 1 is the decay constant of 3cdom in aerated solution mostly accounted for by interaction with molecular o2 and k q 2 5 105 s 1 is the 1o2 quenching constant upon collision with the water solvent zepp et al 1977 buxton et al 1988 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 bodrato and vione 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 the case of co3 is a bit different because the carbonate radical is not produced directly by the photosensitisers but rather indirectly upon interaction between oh 3cdom and inorganic carbon oh hco3 oh co3 2 3cdom co3 2 canonica et al 2005 therefore the steady state co3 can be expressed as follows bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 19 c o 3 o h k o h h c o 3 h c o 3 k o h c o 3 2 c o 3 2 η c o 3 c o 3 2 p a c d o m k c o 3 d o m d o c here it was used k c o 3 d o m 102 l mgc 1 s 1 which roughly agrees with past literature findings canonica et al 2005 and also with a recent study yan et al 2019 in particular yan et al 2019 report that k c o 3 d o m varies in the range of 15 240 l mgc 1 s 1 for different dom specimens and it decreases with increasing e2 e3 the ratio of water absorbance values at 250 and 365 nm this finding means that k c o 3 d o m is higher if c dom is more aromatic the value of k c o 3 d o m has a key impact on co3 as shown in fig s3 of the sm therefore all other conditions being equal waters with highly aromatic dom might have low co3 considering that r 3 c d o m ϕ a p p 3 c d o m p a cdom from equation 3 one gets the following 20 p a c d o m 10 d p 560 n m 1 10 100 a 1 560 n m d o c d α d 2 β d γ with the values of α β and γ obtained before moreover considering the ratio between polychromatic and monochromatic absorption one gets η c o 3 1 7 therefore one can use equation 20 to obtain the value of p a cdom which replaced in equation 19 gives co3 considering all the different photochemical processes it is possible to derive the steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transients equations 16 19 and substitute them together with the direct photolysis rate constant equation 14 into equation 15 to finally obtain the emw assessment of the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of the studied compounds the polychromatic modelling of lifetimes is carried out efficiently by the apex software thus one can compare the polychromatic exact and monochromatic approximate approaches to rate constants and lifetimes the comparison is shown in fig 3 where the solid squares represent the apex results and the dashed curves are the emw predictions obtained by using equation 15 again one observes quite good agreement for all the doc and depth conditions which cover a wide range of environmental values for surface waters wetzel 2001 this finding means that it is possible to reliably model phototransformation reactions by using a monochromatic approach based on emws which allows for simpler equations to be obtained without numerical integrals and thus considerably simplifies the mathematical treatment of photochemical modelling note the trend with a minimum of k atz vs doc in fig 3 a and to a lesser extent that of k diu vs doc in fig 3 e such a trend is due to the fact that increasing doc inhibits direct photolysis as well as oh and co3 reactions while enhancing the 3cdom and 1o2 processes one observes a similar trend whenever the 3cdom and or 1o2 reaction becomes sufficiently fast at high doc marchetti et al 2013 vione et al 2014 the excellent agreement between the polychromatic approach and the emw based one ensures that the data used to validate the apex polychromatic model see table 1 can also be used for a validation of the emw approximation therefore also the emw approach is able to predict quite well the field data of pollutant photodegradation 3 3 implications for the modelling of freshwater photochemistry it is the impression of the writer that the huge potential provided by photochemistry modelling which also encompasses the relationship between surface water photoreactions and climate change vione and scozzaro 2019 is presently exploited only in small part one of the reasons may be that thus far modelling has made use of polychromatic calculations which is fully justified because the natural environment is indeed polychromatic that are however quite difficult to implement therefore one either has to use dedicated software bodrato and vione 2014 epa 2020 vione 2020 which often behaves as a black box and may be difficult to customise or has to develop own spreadsheets that have to include numerical integration procedures zhou et al 2018 the latter require advanced programming skills that probably discourage many potential users this paper shows that it is possible to greatly simplify the mathematics and computational weight of the modelling process by replacing the polychromatic approach with a monochromatic one based on emws without significant loss in accuracy moreover the ability of the emw approach to carry out a reasonably correct prediction of the field lifetimes of two additional pollutants that do not undergo direct photolysis such as the pharmaceutical metabolite and pesticide isomer clofibric acid and the artificial sweetener acesulfame k is shown in table 2 compared to polychromatic models the emw approach allows for a simpler set of mathematical equations to be obtained the set of equations and their parameter values are summarised in the sm table s1 which can be included into a spreadsheet or into graphics software excel spreadsheets to predict the first order phototransformation rate constants and lifetimes of the studied pollutants are provided as sm the sm also provides maple v scripts to draw 3d plots of the photodegradation rate constants vs doc and d these 3d plots are shown in fig 4 for the different pollutants under study the present results constitute a proof of concept that the emw approach works well and is fully equivalent to the rigorous polychromatic treatment of photodegradation reactions as far as freshwater photochemistry is concerned all calculations are here referred to mid july mid latitude water conditions the following implementations should be introduced in forthcoming work to enable the adoption of emw as the standard approach to surface water photochemistry modelling i extend the emw approach to other contaminants in particular as far as the direct photolysis is concerned indeed each compound needs its own emw treatment to find the values of λ eq and ϕ app d p for instance the apex database contains about 40 compounds in addition to those studied here vione 2020 and it could constitute a good starting point for the work of translation of the polychromatic language into the emw one ii extend the results to other latitudes and seasons the present findings are limited to mid july at mid latitude because the used values of p λ eq and τ are referred to those conditions p λ eq and τ are clearly functions of season and latitude ncar 2015 and obtaining explicit forms for both would be the key to deriving a general worldwide valid equation for surface water photochemistry as far as the former point is concerned it is useful to get some insight into how to find the value of λeq that fits well the polychromatic data take such data e g those of the direct photolysis rate constant vs the doc for different depths d they are the data reported in fig s2 in sm these data can be generated by apex with the appropriate input values and equation 14 as the fit function the curvature of the function is key to a good data fit and it primarily depends on a 1 λeq therefore one should first fit the polychromatic data of k d p s vs doc with equation 14 by fixing d and τ at their respective values and by defining a 1 λeq p λeq ϕ app d p s and ε s λeq as free floating parameters the obtained value of a 1 λeq is the only important fit result because it allows for λeq to be obtained from a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015λ λ 66 7 ln a 1 λ 53 3 note that ln a 1 λ varies from 5 to 8 in the range of 300 500 nm that done one can fix the values of p λeq and ε s λeq the next data fit can thus be carried out by taking only ϕ app d p s as free floating variable in this way all the emw parameters can be properly obtained the last step is to check that equation 14 with the proper parameters predicts well the polychromatic results at all values of d 4 conclusions an equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw is here defined as the single wavelength that closely reproduces the behaviour of a polychromatic system once the emw is found it is possible to replace the polychromatic integrals with a much simpler monochromatic lambert beer equation to derive radiation absorption and photoreaction rates a pure emw based lambert beer equation works less well in the case of cdom absorption and related quantities however it is possible to solve the problem by introducing a slight modification to the lambert beer equation while maintaining its monochromatic nature if the emw language is adopted as standard in photochemistry calculations it has the potential to greatly simplify computations of all

17253,it has been reported that anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactors have the potential for energy recovery since dissolved methane was almost rejected by commercial forward osmosis membranes notwithstanding upgraded biogas has to be achieved by removing as much carbon dioxide as possible in this study a novel anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor microbial electrolysis cell anombr mec system was developed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment the anombr mec elicited an excellent and stable soluble chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus removal as the experiment progressed unwanted carbon dioxide produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a sno2 nanoparticles electrocatalytic cathode in an electrocatalytic assisted mec with the highest faradic efficiency of formate being 85 at 1 2v compared to anombr the methane content increased from 55 to 90 at the end of operation and methane yield experienced a1 6 fold increment in the anombr mec microbial community analysis revealed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter converted the produced h2 and formate to methane at saline conditions these results have demonstrated an efficient strategy based on the integration of an electrocatalytic assisted mec into anombr for upgrading biogas enhancing methane yield and wastewater treatment graphical

anaerobic digestion ad technology combined the advantages of wastewater treatment and capturing biogas from ad of waste sludge food residues manure and municipal wastewater angelidaki et al 2018 maegaard et al 2019 nevertheless dissolved methane d ch4 in the anaerobic effluents accounted for 11 88 of total methane dependent on type of anaerobic digester and temperature which results in a low energy recovery efficiency of anaerobic bioreactor and severe green gas effect crone et al 2016 henares et al 2017 liu et al 2014 recently the potential of anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactors anombrs for methane recovery has been demonstrated by our previous research since most of d ch4 was rejected by commercial cellulose triacetate membrane forward osmosis fo membranes gao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a but the raw biogas consists of ch4 50 70 co2 50 30 and the trace amounts of o2 n2 and h2s which could not substitute vehicle fuel or bio natural gas for generating heat and electricity due to low methane purity therefore biogas upgrading of anombr is the main challenge for further application kougias et al 2017 sarker et al 2018 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a to date various methods including water scrubbing physical or chemical absorption and membrane separation processes have been developed to remove co2 as much as possible sarker et al 2018 however expensive material high energy input chemical consumption and capital cost are the major drawbacks for these biogas upgrading techniques dou et al 2018 electrocatalytic assisted microbial electrolysis cell mec

jiang et al 2019a zhao et al reported that a multi walled carbon nanotubes and cobalt tetra amino phthalocyanine composite modified cathode presented a well performance for reduction of co2 to formate in the mec which was only driven by a single microbial fuel cell zhao et al 2012 the above progresses inspired us that electrocatalytic assisted mec could provide the possibility of biogas upgrading

membranes hu et al 2018 qiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a a coupled anombr with electrocatalytic assisted mec system anombr mec was proposed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment for the first time among various metal catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of co2 sno2 nanoparticles sno2 nps as an environmental friendly material was wildly used as cathode catalyst due to its high faradic efficiency fe and excellent selectivity fan et al 2018 huang and hu 2018 zhang et al 2014 in the proposed anombr mec biogas in the headspace of anombr flowed into cathode chamber of electrocatalytic assisted mec where co2 was electrocatalytic reduced to formate by sno2 nps cathode and then hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the anombr could directly convert the produced formate and by product h2 to methane when formate enriched catholyte was pumped into feed tank it should be noted that biogas upgrading in this study derive from electrochemical co2 reduction under mild and low cost conditions rather than previous bioelectrochemical reduction of co2 zeppilli et al 2020 which is expected for enhancing co2 capture and biogas upgrading efficiency on the other hand compare to biogas upgrading from h2 dependent methanogenesis zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the ph of catholyte in the electrocatalytic assisted mec can be relatively stable since the large proton consumption from hydrogen evolution reactions hers is avoided and consequently ph of anombr system could maintain a suitable ph scope for metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in this study sno2 nps

the increasing of current density suggested that sno2 nps cathode has an obvious electrochemical co2 reduction activity in addition the onset potential of sno2 nps was 1 15 v vs sce 0 65 v vs rhe which indicated that the overpotential of sno2 nps was only 0 4 v compared to theoretical potential of co2 reduction to formate 0 25 v vs rhe the catalytic performance of co2 reduction of sno2 nps cathode was further studied by potentiostatic electrolysis fig 2b illustrated fe of formate and byproduct h2 when cathode potential was set in the range from 1 4 to 2 0 mv the fe of formate increased initially reached 70 at 1 5 v for the first time and the maximum fe of formate was 78 1 at 1 7 v but the fe of formate dropped to 38 because of a competitive relationship between the hers and formate production fan et al 2018 all above results suggested that the reduction of co2 progress could be enhanced from 1 4 v to 1 7v and thereby selection of 1 5 v as the optimal cathodic potential could comprehensively take into account the energy saving suppression of the hers and relatively high fe of formate 3 2 water flux and conductivity change of reactors in this study a novel anombr mec system was developed for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biogas upgrading conductivity of supernatant and water flux presented a good repetition characteristic within four runs from fig 3 the conductivity built up was observed in the anombr and anombr mec due to salt accumulation from the influent and reverse diffusion of ds which was a reason for water flux decline of anombr and anombr mec fig 3 showed that water flux of anombr severely dropped from 5 7 0 13 lmh to 3 5 0 02 lmh at a decreasing rate of 0 73 lmh d within 3 days operation in the period from days 4 to days 15 water flux decreased mildly from 3 1 0 2 lmh to 0 5 0 01 lmh at a rate of 0 22 lmh d the water flux changes of anombr mec were similar to that of anombr where water flux decreased from 4 9 0 2 lmh to 3 3 0 42 lmh within 3 days and then decreased from 2 9 0 15 lmh to 0 4 0 04 lmh respectively which was probably due to higher accumulation rate of bio foulants in the initial stage wang et al 2019 it has been reported that the reverse diffusion of ds contributed to 74 9 of conductivity increasing of anombr when commercial cta fo membrane was used as fo membrane in the anombr hou et al 2017 this phenomenon significantly leaded to reducing the osmotic pressure difference between both sides of active layer of cta fo membrane in initial stage membrane fouling was the other reason for water flux decline induced from foulants attached onto the membrane surface wang et al 2019 demonstrated that bio foulants including carbohydrates and proteins significantly were main components of foulants on the membrane surface as shown in fig s1 protein concentration of smp significantly increased within 3 days during first run operation which execrated the water flux decline caused by increasing filtration and mass transfer resistance however cta fo membrane showed a good capacity of fouling reversibility based on the fact that bio foulants on the membrane surface could be cleaned by tap water easily fig s2 and thereby water flux can be recovered in a high level table 1 3 3 biogas upgrading of anombr mec system 3 3 1 performance progress anombrs have drawn increasing attentions for organic wastewater treatment owing to its low energy demand high organic loading and methane production chang et al 2019 but biogas upgrading for anombrs is priority consideration before further application in this study an electrocatalytic assisted mec equipped with a bioanode and sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode was applied to electrochemical reduction of co2 where the organic oxidation by bioanode in the mec could provide protons and electrons for sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode our results indicated that the optimal reduction potential of sno2 nps cathode was 1 5 v vs sce and the open circuit of bioanode potential was around 0 3 v vs sce fig s4 therefore an extra voltage of 1 2 v was needed to trigger electrochemical co2 reduction in the electrocatalytic assisted mec which reduced high applied voltage input significantly compared to abiotic electrochemical cell liu et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 during operation of days 31 days 45 the mass of sn in the catholyte ranged from 0 0132 mg to 0 0245 mg and the average mass of dissolved sn was 0 015 mg 0 003 fig s5 which demonstrated the stability of sno2 nps catalysts fe of formate showed a two stage profile with operation time increasing fig 4 for example fe of formate was maintained at 75 85 when the mec was operated for days 31 to days 40 and then fe of formate gradually decreased within days 38 to days 45 the main reason for fe decline was probably due to electrochemical co2 reduction to formate in the mec and directly utilization of co2 by methanogens meanwhile the decreasing water flux induced by membrane fouling of fo was not beneficial to increase ch4 and co2 production rate however in days 45 to days 55 water flux recovered to 4 725 lmh after physically cleaning of fo membrane which resulted in faster ch4 and co2 production rate and higher co2 content than the values in days 40 to days 45 therefore the fe of formate increased to 80 again the concentration of scod in the influent supernatant permeate and removal efficiency was shown in fig 5 a with scod in the influent around 4000 mg l concentration of scod in the reactor supernatant decreased and then remained at 200 mg l the gradual decrease in scod concentration indicated that anaerobic bacteria and archaea were gradually acclimated at a halophilic condition and metabolism was maintained at a stable level the concentration of scod in the permeate of two system was less than 40 mg l and the total removal rate of scod at a stable condition was greater than 95 which was the result of synergistic effect of fo membrane rejection and biodegradation fig s6 showed that nh4 in the penetrate increased from 5 mg l to 31 mg l which resulted in the decreasing total removal rate of ammonia nitrogen with anombr operation the unsatisfactory total removal rate of nh4 by anombr at the end of operation was due to lack of biological removal of nh4 in anaerobic digestion and 70 80 of rejection by cta fo membrane probably chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 with regard to the po4 3 profile the concentrate of po4 3 was observed in the bulk solution but po4 3 was not detected in the penetrate which was due to the completely rejection of po4 3 for cta fo membrane gu et al 2015 3 3 2 biogas component and ch4 yield in the anombr days 1 to days 30 the components of ch4 and co2 are 53 8 4 0 and 30 4 4 1 respectively fig 5b but component of ch4 during biogas upgrading period days 31 to days 60 gradually rose and finally reached at 90 1 7 the corresponding component of co2 in the biogas gradually decreased and co2 cannot be detected in the biogas finally in addition compared to the component of h2 in the abiotic electrochemical cell the component of h2 in the anombr mec account for only 0 035 which might be attributed to metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the bioreactor during biogas recycle the accumulation of ch4 volume was 2302 5 126 2 ml and 3496 5 16 3 ml in the anombr and anombr mec respectively although a nearly parallelism of biological cod removal 91 7 92 0 95 6 and 93 0 calculated by eq 1 was obtained in the anombr and anombr mec respectively the accumulation of ch4 volume in anombr mec was almost 1 6 fold that of no voltage added anombr fig 5c furthermore formate was not detected in the bioreactor when it was pumped into feed tank of anombr every day fig s3 the results indicated that diverse anaerobic metabolism of methanogenic community especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens contributed to enhanced methane yield and co2 removal during biogas upgrading period it has been reported that formate despite its low component in metabolite of anaerobic digestion and rapid consumption conversion plays a more important role than h2 since the transfer of formate was more important for anaerobic syntrophic propionate and butyrate degradation compared interspecies transfer of h2 lv et al 2020 pan et al 2016 as demonstrated by our results the performance results demonstrated that an around 95 of scod removal almost 100 of po4 3 p removal 90 content of ch4 and 1 6 fold of methane yield in the anombr mec system due to the synergistic effect of electrochemical co2 reduction and methanogenesis step of ad table 1 the proposed anombr mec may apply for the treatment of food industrial wastewaters since this type of wastewater is in general highly biodegradable and nontoxic and contains high concentrations of organic matter galib et al 2016 lin et al 2013 svojitka et al 2017 on the other hand the seawater instead of nacl solution can be used as draw solution which are further beneficial to its competition 3 4 vfas ph and microbial community analysis vfas including acetic acid propionic acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid are further monitored since they are important intermediate products during ad and good indicators of process imbalance in anaerobic digesters gu et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 a acetic acid represented the main proportion of the vfas in the supernatant of the anombr and anombr mec and the concentrations of propionic acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid were relatively low in the supernatant the concentration of acetic acid in the four runs increased with time in the initial stage and then they began to decrease until the concentration maintained at around 81 8 mg l 86 7 mg l 53 7 mg l and 64 5 mg l respectively the increasing in acetic acid concentration was attributed to that the discharge of supernatant at the end of each run might affected the acetate up take rates of the methanogens but acetic acid concentration decreased with the extension of operation time because of conversion of acetic acid to methane and co2 in the reactors where acetogens and methanogens perform harmoniously zhao et al reported that ph of the coupled ad mec system could reach 9 3 caused by protons consumption continuously zhao et al 2016 however anombr and anombr mec system have a good buffering capacity to resist ph disturbance which was mainly attributed to rejection of hco3 co3 2 by fo membrane the maximum ph in the anombr and anombr mec was 7 48 and 7 82 respectively fig 6b the higher ph in anombr mec was due to that formate enriched catholyte of mec was flowed into the anombr as a carbon resource in present study anombr mec could be potentially advantageous over ad mec by maintaining relative appropriate ph for methanogens the microbial community structures in the anombr under salinity condition might be affected by the introduction of mec equipped with sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode hence the relative abundance of bacteria and archaea for anombr initial anaerobic sludge control sample and 20 d sample and anombr mec 35 d and 60 d sample were analyzed using dna sequencing technology fig 7 at the phylum level firmicutes bacteroidetes spirochaetes proteobacteria chloroflexi were the main bacteria in which gram positive firmicutes and gram negative bacteroidetes were commonly found as anaerobic digesters in mixed culture glucose fermentation jiang et al 2019a jiang et al 2018 at the class level fig 7b the abundance of bacilli was highest in the control sample 60 3 but clostridia bacteroidia spirochaetia gammaproteobacteria anaerolineae were the dominant bacteria during anombr operation the abundance of clostridia was 8 2 16 2 and 18 0 for 20 d 35 d and 60 d samples respectively with regard to bacteroidia the abundance was 13 1 11 0 and 17 8 for 20 d 35 d and 60 d samples respectively bacteroidia and clostridia were the most important microorganisms for hydrolysis and acidification in the anaerobic digestion clostridia as the main bacteria of firmicutes at the class level could convert complex macromolecules into alcohol hydrogen co2 and vfas zhao et al 2018 clostridia and bacteroidia were salt sensitive bacteria in which the relative abundance of bacteroidia decreased from 12 55 in phase 2 g l to 3 05 in phase 50 g l zhao et al 2018 when conductivity of supernatant increased from 3 19 35 d and 5 1 ms cm 60 d respectively the total abundances of two bacteria were 27 2 and 35 8 respectively which indicated that the mild salt accumulation of anombr did not affect the hydrolysis and acidification process the total abundances of spirochaetia and gammaproteobacteria which mainly played the part of the degradation of vfa and the oxidation process of acetic acid lee et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 were 12 8 25 7 and 27 8 respectively indicating that the higher abundance of two bacteria contributed to consume more vfa of anombr mec fig 6a the formate and byproduct of h2 in the mec would change archaea community and thereby affected the progress of ch4 production methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter are the main methanogens at the genus level fig 7c the abundances of methanosaeta were 47 1 75 2 for anombr and 65 9 and 27 1 for anombr mec respectively the anaerobic digestion of methanogenesis includes hydrogenotrophic methanogen which produce methane through reduction of co2 hydrogen and formate and acetoclastic methanogen using acetic acid lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogen was the main dominant bacterial species in the anombr indicating that the conversion of acetic acid process to ch4 was the main methanogenic process in the anombr however with the integrating of mec the abundances of methanobacterium increased from 16 4 and 12 8 in the anombr to 24 1 and 32 7 in the anombr mec system and the total abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter increased from 19 5 and 16 6 to 24 9 and 55 5 during biogas upgrading period which suggested that the hydrogen and formate produced from mec participated in the methanogenesis process since h2 and formate can act as electron shuttles for methane production allowing mediated interspecies electron transfer to occur during ch4 production capson tojo et al 2018 similarly bo et al found that ch4 content of 90 and the increased by 2 3 fold of methane was achieved from an ad mec since methanocorpusculum methanospirillum methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanoculleus enriched in bioanode can use the hydrogen produced by the stainless steel cathode and co2 to produce ch4 bo et al 2014 it could be seen that from fig 7d that the higher concentration of coenzyme f420 for anombr mec than anombr also indicated that anombr mec has better methanogenic activity caused by existence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for consumption of co2 h2 and formate meanwhile the concentration of coenzyme f420 increased and then maintained relatively stable during each run of anombr operation fig 7d and the methane yield in the current study is promising compared to the values of previous anmbr lin et al 2013 svojitka et al 2017 which further suggested that the bioactivity methanogens was not significantly affected by a built up salinity environment the similar results were also demonstrated by many reports gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the above results demonstrated that the synergistic effect of acetoclastic methanogenesis formate dependent methanogenesis and h2 dependent methanogenesis co2 4h2 ch4 2h2o contributed to the biogas upgrading and higher methane yield of anombr mec finally at saline conditions 4 conclusions a laboratory scale anombr mec system was demonstrated for simultaneous biogas upgrading enhancing ch4 yield and wastewater treatment in this novel process the anombr mec presented high and stable organic and phosphorus removal compared to traditional anombr ch4 content of 90 and 1 6 fold of ch4 yield was achieved in the anombr mec due to the integrating hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with electrochemical co2 reduction during biogas upgrading period the unwanted co2 produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a sno2 nps electrocatalysis cathode in a two chamber mec and the highest fe of formate was 85 methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter were responsible for enhancing methane yield via converting h2 and formate at saline conditions the findings of this research suggested that coupled anombr mec is a promising

17253,it has been reported that anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactors have the potential for energy recovery since dissolved methane was almost rejected by commercial forward osmosis membranes notwithstanding upgraded biogas has to be achieved by removing as much carbon dioxide as possible in this study a novel anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor microbial electrolysis cell anombr mec system was developed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment the anombr mec elicited an excellent and stable soluble chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus removal as the experiment progressed unwanted carbon dioxide produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a sno2 nanoparticles electrocatalytic cathode in an electrocatalytic assisted mec with the highest faradic efficiency of formate being 85 at 1 2v compared to anombr the methane content increased from 55 to 90 at the end of operation and methane yield experienced a1 6 fold increment in the anombr mec microbial community analysis revealed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter converted the produced h2 and formate to methane at saline conditions these results have demonstrated an efficient strategy based on the integration of an electrocatalytic assisted mec into anombr for upgrading biogas enhancing methane yield and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactor anombr microbial electrolysis cell mec sno2 nanoparticles electrochemical reduction biogas upgrading 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad technology combined the advantages of wastewater treatment and capturing biogas from ad of waste sludge food residues manure and municipal wastewater angelidaki et al 2018 maegaard et al 2019 nevertheless dissolved methane d ch4 in the anaerobic effluents accounted for 11 88 of total methane dependent on type of anaerobic digester and temperature which results in a low energy recovery efficiency of anaerobic bioreactor and severe green gas effect crone et al 2016 henares et al 2017 liu et al 2014 recently the potential of anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactors anombrs for methane recovery has been demonstrated by our previous research since most of d ch4 was rejected by commercial cellulose triacetate membrane forward osmosis fo membranes gao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a but the raw biogas consists of ch4 50 70 co2 50 30 and the trace amounts of o2 n2 and h2s which could not substitute vehicle fuel or bio natural gas for generating heat and electricity due to low methane purity therefore biogas upgrading of anombr is the main challenge for further application kougias et al 2017 sarker et al 2018 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a to date various methods including water scrubbing physical or chemical absorption and membrane separation processes have been developed to remove co2 as much as possible sarker et al 2018 however expensive material high energy input chemical consumption and capital cost are the major drawbacks for these biogas upgrading techniques dou et al 2018 electrocatalytic assisted microbial electrolysis cell mec provided a more efficient route for co2 valorization at a low power input and an enhancing yield rate of designed products huang and hu 2018 jiang et al 2019b li et al 2013 when the cathode potential was 1 1v vs ag agcl co2 was reduced by zn catalysis cathode to formate and carbon monoxide which were further converted into acetic acid and other carboxylic acids by electroactivity of microorganisms jiang et al 2019a zhao et al reported that a multi walled carbon nanotubes and cobalt tetra amino phthalocyanine composite modified cathode presented a well performance for reduction of co2 to formate in the mec which was only driven by a single microbial fuel cell zhao et al 2012 the above progresses inspired us that electrocatalytic assisted mec could provide the possibility of biogas upgrading through co2 capture with regard to the combining advantages of high removal efficiency of co2 through electrocatalytic assisted mec and excellent rejection characteristics of commercial cta fo membranes hu et al 2018 qiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a a coupled anombr with electrocatalytic assisted mec system anombr mec was proposed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment for the first time among various metal catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of co2 sno2 nanoparticles sno2 nps as an environmental friendly material was wildly used as cathode catalyst due to its high faradic efficiency fe and excellent selectivity fan et al 2018 huang and hu 2018 zhang et al 2014 in the proposed anombr mec biogas in the headspace of anombr flowed into cathode chamber of electrocatalytic assisted mec where co2 was electrocatalytic reduced to formate by sno2 nps cathode and then hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the anombr could directly convert the produced formate and by product h2 to methane when formate enriched catholyte was pumped into feed tank it should be noted that biogas upgrading in this study derive from electrochemical co2 reduction under mild and low cost conditions rather than previous bioelectrochemical reduction of co2 zeppilli et al 2020 which is expected for enhancing co2 capture and biogas upgrading efficiency on the other hand compare to biogas upgrading from h2 dependent methanogenesis zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the ph of catholyte in the electrocatalytic assisted mec can be relatively stable since the large proton consumption from hydrogen evolution reactions hers is avoided and consequently ph of anombr system could maintain a suitable ph scope for metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in this study sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode was prepared and then optimal cathode potential was selected according to fe of formate the performance of anombr mec system was evaluated including conductivity and water flux level soluble chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and phosphate removal biogas components and ch4 yield volatile fatty acids vfas concentration change of ph and high throughput 16s rrna gene

mω milli q water purification system was obtained to prepare electrolyte solutions and influent of anombr the synthetic wastewater was mainly composed of glucose ammonium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate the cod value of influent was maintained at around 4000 mg l and the cod n p ratio was 200 5 1 the other trace components were identical to previous study zhang et al 2017 cellulose triacetate with embedded polyester screen support cta es fo membrane from hydration technologies inc hti usa were used in this study 2 2 abiotic electrochemical co2 reduction tests the catalyst loaded cathodes were prepared by mixing 85 wt of sno2 nps 10 wt of cb and 5 wt of pvdf slurry in which the loading of sno2 nps was controlled to 1 mg cm2 the mixtures of sno2 and cb were ground for 30 min and then black powder with pvdf was transferred to a 5 ml centrifuge tube in which nmp as dispersant was added after ultrasonic dispersion the slurry was uniformly coated on 2 5 2 cm2 carbon paper and then dried at 60 c for 12 h at room temperature 25 abiotic electrochemical co2 reduction tests were carried out in a two chambered electrochemical cell separated by a nafion 117 membrane work volume of every cell 150 ml the as prepared sno2 nps electrode a saturated calomel electrode sce and carbon paper blank electrode in a three electrode system was used as working electrode reference electrode and counter electrode respectively 150 ml 0 1 m khco3 saturated with co2 ph 6 8 after purging co2 for 30 min was used as catholyte all the potential values were recorded versus sce in this study the potentiostatic mode was used for abiotic co2 reduction test and the cathode potential was set in the range from 1 4 to 2 0 mv vs sce the optimal cathodic potential was evaluated by fe of formate 2 3 anombr mec configuration and setup the barrel shape anombr with working volume of 2 0 l diameter 15 0 cm height 12 0 cm was made of organic glass the anaerobic sludge dalian xiajiahe wastewater treatment plant was pre cultivated in the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and then was inoculated into anombr at 35 1 the mlss and mlvss concentration of anaerobic sludge were 4 8 and 2 7 g l respectively an external cross flow fo membrane model effective membrane area 70 cm2 with active layer facing the feed solution al fs orientation was used in this study the supernatant of anombr and draw solution on both sides of the fo membrane were circulated by two peristaltic pumps longerbt100 2j china with a cross flow rate of 7 4 cm s the anombr operation was divided into two runs first run days 1 days 15 second run days 16 days 30 and each run was 15 days cycles the fo membrane was cleaned by tap water flush after each run due to membrane fouling and reused for next run conductivity ph and temperature were monitored by water quality analyzer wtw multi 3510 germany 1 5 l of 0 5 m nacl solution was used as the draw solution ds when conductivity of

bioanode the potential was around 300 mv vs sce was transferred to the mec the anolyte and catholyte was the mixture of glucose based nutrient solution 75 ml supplementary data and anaerobic sludge pre cultivated in the uasb 75 ml and 150 ml of 0 1 m khco3 respectively titanium wires were used to connect to bioanode and electrocatalytic cathode the optimal potential of catalysis cathode could be obtained from abiotic co2 reduction tests hence the optimal voltage between bioanode and electrocatalytic cathode of mec could be calculated and then supplied by a dc power wanptek kps303d china the bioanode chamber of mec was equipped with a sce reference electrode 232 inesa scientific instrument co ltd and a data acquisition system piso 813 icp das was used to monitor the voltage across an external resistor rex 10ω for current calculating during anombr mec operation a peristaltic pump was used to recycle biogas between the headspace of anombr and cathodic chamber of mec where co2 in the biogas was reduced to formate the anolyte was refreshed at the end of days 45 and the catholyte was refreshed every day therefore the formate enriched catholyte was pumped into feed tank as a carbon source but the cod value of influent in the anombr mec was consistent with the value of anombr 2 4 analysis and calculations all samples of anombr supernatant and ds for soluble chemical oxygen demand

nps lsv of sno2 nps was tested in a n2 and co2 saturated 0 1 m khco3 solution the current density reached 4 8 ma cm2 and 7 2 ma cm2 at 1 5 v under n2 and co2 saturated catholyte respectively fig 2 a the increasing of current density suggested that sno2 nps cathode has an obvious electrochemical co2 reduction activity in addition the onset potential of sno2 nps was 1 15 v vs sce 0 65 v vs rhe which indicated that the overpotential of sno2 nps was only 0 4 v compared to theoretical potential of co2 reduction to formate 0 25 v vs rhe the catalytic performance of co2 reduction of sno2 nps cathode was further studied by potentiostatic electrolysis fig 2b illustrated fe of formate and byproduct h2 when cathode potential was set in the range from 1 4 to 2 0 mv the fe of formate increased initially reached 70 at 1 5 v for the first time and the maximum fe of formate was 78 1 at 1 7 v but the fe of formate dropped to 38 because of a competitive relationship between the hers and formate production fan et al 2018 all above results suggested that the reduction of co2 progress could be enhanced from 1 4 v to 1 7v and thereby selection of 1 5 v as the optimal cathodic potential could comprehensively take into account the energy saving suppression of the hers and relatively high fe of formate 3 2 water flux and conductivity change of reactors in this study a novel anombr mec system was developed for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biogas upgrading conductivity of supernatant and water flux presented a good repetition characteristic within four runs from fig 3 the conductivity built up was observed in the anombr and anombr mec due to salt accumulation from the influent and reverse diffusion of ds which was a reason for water flux decline of anombr and anombr mec fig 3 showed that water flux of anombr severely dropped from 5 7 0 13 lmh to 3 5 0 02 lmh at a decreasing rate of 0 73 lmh d within 3 days operation in the period from days 4 to days 15 water flux decreased mildly from 3 1 0 2 lmh to 0 5 0 01 lmh at a rate of 0 22 lmh d the water flux changes of anombr mec were similar to that of anombr where water flux decreased from 4 9 0 2 lmh to 3 3 0 42 lmh within 3 days and then decreased from 2 9 0 15 lmh to 0 4 0 04 lmh respectively which was probably due to higher accumulation rate of bio foulants in the initial stage wang et al 2019 it has been reported that the reverse diffusion of ds contributed to 74 9 of conductivity increasing of anombr when commercial cta fo membrane was used as fo membrane in the anombr hou et al 2017 this phenomenon significantly leaded to reducing the osmotic pressure difference between both sides of active layer of cta fo membrane in initial stage membrane fouling was the other reason for water flux decline induced from foulants attached onto the membrane surface wang et al 2019 demonstrated that bio foulants including carbohydrates and proteins significantly were main components of foulants on the membrane surface as shown in fig s1 protein concentration of smp significantly increased within 3 days during first run operation which execrated the water flux decline caused by increasing filtration and mass transfer resistance however cta fo membrane showed a good capacity of fouling reversibility based on the fact that bio foulants on the membrane surface could be cleaned by tap water easily fig s2 and thereby water flux can be recovered in a high level table 1 3 3 biogas upgrading of anombr mec system 3 3 1 performance progress anombrs have drawn increasing attentions for organic wastewater treatment owing to its low energy demand high organic loading and methane production chang et al 2019 but biogas upgrading for anombrs is priority consideration before further application in this study an electrocatalytic assisted mec equipped with a bioanode and sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode was applied to electrochemical reduction of co2 where the organic oxidation by bioanode in the mec could provide protons and electrons for sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode our results indicated that the optimal reduction potential of sno2 nps cathode was 1 5 v vs sce and the open circuit of bioanode potential was around 0 3 v vs sce fig s4 therefore an extra voltage of 1 2 v was needed to trigger electrochemical co2 reduction in the electrocatalytic assisted mec which reduced high applied voltage input significantly compared to abiotic electrochemical cell liu et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 during operation of days 31 days 45 the mass of sn in the catholyte ranged from 0 0132 mg to 0 0245 mg and the average mass of dissolved sn was 0 015 mg 0 003 fig s5 which demonstrated the stability of sno2 nps catalysts fe of formate showed a two stage profile with operation time increasing fig 4 for example fe of formate was maintained at 75 85 when the mec was operated for days 31 to days 40 and then fe of formate gradually decreased within days 38 to days 45 the main reason for fe decline was probably due to electrochemical co2 reduction to formate in the mec and directly utilization of co2 by methanogens meanwhile the decreasing water flux induced by membrane fouling of fo was not beneficial to increase ch4 and co2 production rate however in days 45 to days 55 water flux recovered to 4 725 lmh after physically cleaning of fo membrane which resulted in faster ch4 and co2 production rate and higher co2 content than the values in days 40 to days 45 therefore the fe of formate increased to 80 again the concentration of scod in the influent supernatant permeate and removal efficiency was shown in fig 5 a with scod in the influent around 4000 mg l concentration of scod in the reactor supernatant decreased and then remained at 200 mg l the gradual decrease in scod concentration indicated that anaerobic bacteria and archaea were gradually acclimated at a halophilic condition and metabolism was maintained at a stable level the concentration of scod in the permeate of two system was less than 40 mg l and the total removal rate of scod at a stable condition was greater than 95 which was the result of synergistic effect of fo membrane rejection and biodegradation fig s6 showed that nh4 in the penetrate increased from 5 mg l to 31 mg l which resulted in the decreasing total removal rate of ammonia nitrogen with anombr operation the unsatisfactory total removal rate of nh4 by anombr at the end of operation was due to lack of biological removal of nh4 in anaerobic digestion and 70 80 of rejection by cta fo membrane probably chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 with regard to the po4 3 profile the concentrate of po4 3 was observed in the bulk solution but po4 3 was not detected in the penetrate which was due to the completely rejection of po4 3 for cta fo membrane gu et al 2015 3 3 2 biogas component and ch4 yield in the anombr days 1 to days 30 the components of ch4 and co2 are 53 8 4 0 and 30 4 4 1 respectively fig 5b but component of ch4 during biogas upgrading period days 31 to days 60 gradually rose and finally reached at 90 1 7 the corresponding component of co2 in the biogas gradually decreased and co2 cannot be detected in the biogas finally in addition compared to the component of h2 in the abiotic electrochemical cell the component of h2 in the anombr mec account for only 0 035 which might be attributed to metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the bioreactor during biogas recycle the accumulation of ch4 volume was 2302 5 126 2 ml and 3496 5 16 3 ml in the anombr and anombr mec respectively although a nearly parallelism of biological cod removal 91 7 92 0 95 6 and 93 0 calculated by eq 1 was obtained in the anombr and anombr mec respectively the accumulation of ch4 volume in anombr mec was almost 1 6 fold that of no voltage added anombr fig 5c furthermore formate was not detected in the bioreactor when it was pumped into feed tank of anombr every day fig s3 the results indicated that diverse anaerobic metabolism of methanogenic community especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens contributed to enhanced methane yield and co2 removal during biogas upgrading period it has been reported that formate despite its low component in metabolite of anaerobic digestion and rapid consumption conversion plays a more important role than h2 since the transfer of formate was more important for anaerobic syntrophic propionate and butyrate degradation compared interspecies transfer of h2 lv et al 2020 pan et al 2016 as demonstrated by our results the performance results demonstrated that an around 95 of scod removal almost 100 of po4 3 p removal 90 content of ch4 and 1 6 fold of methane yield in the anombr mec system due to the synergistic effect of electrochemical co2 reduction and methanogenesis step of ad table 1 the proposed anombr mec may apply for the treatment of food industrial wastewaters since this type of wastewater is in general highly biodegradable and nontoxic and contains high concentrations of organic matter galib et al 2016 lin et al 2013 svojitka et al 2017 on the other hand the seawater instead of nacl solution can be used as draw solution which are further beneficial to its competition 3 4 vfas ph and microbial community analysis vfas including acetic acid propionic acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid are further monitored since they are important intermediate products during ad and good indicators of process imbalance in anaerobic digesters gu et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 a acetic acid represented the main proportion of the vfas in the supernatant of the anombr and anombr mec and the concentrations of propionic acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid were relatively low in the supernatant the concentration of acetic acid in the four runs increased with time in the initial stage and then they began to decrease until the concentration maintained at around 81 8 mg l 86 7 mg l 53 7 mg l and 64 5 mg l respectively the increasing in acetic acid concentration was attributed to that the discharge of supernatant at the end of each run might affected the acetate up take rates of the methanogens but acetic acid concentration decreased with the extension of operation time because of conversion of acetic acid to methane and co2 in the reactors where acetogens and methanogens perform harmoniously zhao et al reported that ph of the coupled ad mec system could reach 9 3 caused by protons consumption continuously zhao et al 2016 however anombr and anombr mec system have a good buffering capacity to resist ph disturbance which was mainly attributed to rejection of hco3 co3 2 by fo membrane the maximum ph in the anombr and anombr mec was 7 48 and 7 82 respectively fig 6b the higher ph in anombr mec was due to that formate enriched catholyte of mec was flowed into the anombr as a carbon resource in present study anombr mec could be potentially advantageous over ad mec by maintaining relative appropriate ph for methanogens the microbial community structures in the anombr under salinity condition might be affected by the introduction of mec equipped with sno2 nps electrocatalytic cathode hence the relative abundance of bacteria and archaea for anombr initial anaerobic sludge control sample and 20 d sample and anombr mec 35 d and 60 d sample were analyzed using dna sequencing technology fig 7 at the phylum level firmicutes bacteroidetes spirochaetes proteobacteria chloroflexi were the main bacteria in which gram positive firmicutes and gram negative bacteroidetes were commonly found as anaerobic digesters in mixed culture glucose fermentation jiang et al 2019a jiang et al 2018 at the class level fig 7b the abundance of bacilli was highest in the control sample 60 3 but clostridia bacteroidia spirochaetia gammaproteobacteria anaerolineae were the dominant bacteria during anombr operation the abundance of clostridia was 8 2 16 2 and 18 0 for 20 d 35 d and 60 d samples respectively with regard to bacteroidia the abundance was 13 1 11 0 and 17 8 for 20 d 35 d and 60 d samples respectively bacteroidia and clostridia were the most important microorganisms for hydrolysis and acidification in the anaerobic digestion clostridia as the main bacteria of firmicutes at the class level could convert complex macromolecules into alcohol hydrogen co2 and vfas zhao et al 2018 clostridia and bacteroidia were salt sensitive bacteria in which the relative abundance of bacteroidia decreased from 12 55 in phase 2 g l to 3 05 in phase 50 g l zhao et al 2018 when conductivity of supernatant increased from 3 19 35 d and 5 1 ms cm 60 d respectively the total abundances of two bacteria were 27 2 and 35 8 respectively which indicated that the mild salt accumulation of anombr did not affect the hydrolysis and acidification process the total abundances of spirochaetia and gammaproteobacteria which mainly played the part of the degradation of vfa and the oxidation process of acetic acid lee et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 were 12 8 25 7 and 27 8 respectively indicating that the higher abundance of two bacteria contributed to consume more vfa of anombr mec fig 6a the formate and byproduct of h2 in the mec would change archaea community and thereby affected the progress of ch4 production methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter are the main methanogens at the genus level fig 7c the abundances of methanosaeta were 47 1 75 2 for anombr and 65 9 and 27 1 for anombr mec respectively the anaerobic digestion of methanogenesis includes hydrogenotrophic methanogen which produce methane through reduction of co2 hydrogen and formate and acetoclastic methanogen using acetic acid lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogen was the main dominant bacterial species in the anombr indicating that the conversion of acetic acid process to ch4 was the main methanogenic process in the anombr however with the integrating of mec the abundances of methanobacterium increased from 16 4 and 12 8 in the anombr to 24 1 and 32 7 in the anombr mec system and the total abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter increased from 19 5 and 16 6 to 24 9 and 55 5 during biogas upgrading period which suggested that the hydrogen and formate produced from mec participated in the methanogenesis process since h2 and formate can act as electron shuttles for methane production allowing mediated interspecies electron transfer to occur during ch4 production capson tojo et al 2018 similarly bo et al found that ch4 content of 90 and the increased by 2 3 fold of methane was achieved from an ad mec since methanocorpusculum methanospirillum methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanoculleus enriched in bioanode can use the hydrogen produced by the stainless steel cathode and co2 to produce ch4 bo et al 2014 it could be seen that from fig 7d that the higher concentration of coenzyme f420 for anombr mec than anombr also indicated that anombr mec has better methanogenic activity caused by existence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for consumption of co2 h2 and formate meanwhile the concentration of coenzyme f420 increased and then maintained relatively stable during each run of anombr operation fig 7d and the methane yield in the current study is promising compared to the values of previous anmbr lin et al 2013 svojitka et al 2017 which further suggested that the bioactivity methanogens was not significantly affected by a built up salinity environment the similar results were also demonstrated by many reports gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the above results demonstrated that the synergistic effect of acetoclastic methanogenesis formate dependent methanogenesis and h2 dependent methanogenesis co2 4h2 ch4 2h2o contributed to the biogas upgrading and higher methane yield of anombr mec finally at saline conditions 4 conclusions a laboratory scale anombr mec system was demonstrated for simultaneous biogas upgrading enhancing ch4 yield and wastewater treatment in this novel process the anombr mec presented high and stable organic and phosphorus removal compared to traditional anombr ch4 content of 90 and 1 6 fold of ch4 yield was achieved in the anombr mec due to the integrating hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with electrochemical co2 reduction during biogas upgrading period the unwanted co2 produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a sno2 nps electrocatalysis cathode in a two chamber mec and the highest fe of formate was 85 methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter were responsible for enhancing methane yield via converting h2 and formate at saline conditions the findings of this research suggested that coupled anombr mec is a promising process to promote biogas quality and yield in the industrial level credit authorship contribution statement tianyu gao visualization writing original draft writing review editing hanmin zhang

17254,groundwater is an important drinking water resource to ensure clean drinking water managed aquifer recharge mar could be an attractive solution when recharging with treated wastewater the installation of reactive barriers e g with compost or other organic materials at mar facilities may improve pollutant removal to link pollutant transformation processes and microbiology in reactive barriers we simulated infiltration through different sand compost mixtures using laboratory columns with depth specific sampling of water and barrier material we also evaluated the effect of inoculation with activated sludge our focus was on the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and nitrogen species with parallel monitoring of the development of microbial communities during 17 weeks of operation the columns were fed with synthetic wastewater containing five organic micropollutants 1 2 µg l each and ammonium 2 mg n l unique communities developed in the columns in relation to barrier material with high effects of compost addition and minor effect of inoculation removal of the micropollutant paracetamol acetaminophen occurred in all columns while sulfamethoxazole was only removed in columns with 50 compost by contrast limited removal was observed for sulfadiazine carbamazepine and diuron with the latter two displaying transient removal attributed sorption oxygen was depleted within the top few cm of the columns when compost was present but this was sufficient to remove all ammonium through nitrification the fate of accumulated nitrate at deeper layers depended on the fraction of compost with more compost leading to removal of nitrate by denitrification but also by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium hampering the overall nitrogen removal efficiency introducing compost as reactive barrier in mar facilities has a large effect on the microbial communities and processes but whether it will provide overall cleaner water to the underlying aquifer is uncertain and will depend very much on the type of pollutant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords compost wastewater effluent groundwater pollutant degradation column experiments bacterial community composition 1 introduction today s world is challenged by drinking water scarcity in many regions with the problem accelerating due to climate change and population growth leading to extended drought periods water pollution and increased water consumption thus there is an urgent demand for the development of sustainable methods ensuring safe drinking water schwarzenbach et al 2006 managed aquifer recharge mar has the potential to be an attractive solution as it can be operated as an environmentally and economical sustainable technology for removing pollutants alidina et al 2014b regnery et al 2017 and allows reuse of discharged water to replenish groundwater reservoirs loos et al 2013 yet mar is often operated as a black box with only superficial understanding of the processes and factors governing removal of pollutants regnery et al 2017 effluents from wastewater treatment plants are potential sources of water that may be recycled by mar however such water usually contains high nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and trace amounts of organic pollutants collectively named organic micropollutants omps ec 2013 ec et al 2016 loos et al 2013 nikolaou et al 2007 petrie et al 2015 omps cover pharmaceuticals personal care products e g antiseptics veterinary and illicit drugs fragrances sunscreens pesticides e g herbicides and industrial chemicals and their metabolites although omps are often present at very low concentrations ng µg l their presence in groundwater and subsequently in drinking water is undesired and raises considerable concerns for human health especially when present in complex mixtures and for prolonged exposure periods loos et al 2013 onesios and bouwer 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2006 it is therefore important to know whether omps and nutrients are removed by mar to secure that they are not leaching to the groundwater resources two major processes enable removal of omps degradation including biodegradation mediated primarily by microorganisms and sorption since the concentrations of omps are usually too low to stimulate expression of specific enzymes by microorganisms biodegradation is normally a co metabolic process i e the molecules are transformed by non specific enzymes involved primarily in other processes dalton and stirling 1982 for instance omps can sometimes be efficiently removed during parallel n transformation processes carried out by de nitrifying bacteria and archaea benner et al 2013 tran et al 2013 omp attenuation is dependent on the specific local conditions such as temperature ph or oxygen levels and organic matter content and often relies on biological processes hence efficiencies may vary seasonally and between different mar facilities who 2012 and also depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the chemicals schaffer et al 2015 reactive permeable barriers that act as biological and physical filters as the water passes have been used in groundwater remediation where they are typically placed vertically in a plume of pollutants see faisal et al 2018 for a recent review horizontal barriers have also been proposed to increase pollutant removal during mar for example with wood chips for the removal of nitrate beganskas et al 2018 but might also be used for the removal of omps compost added to a sand barrier at a full scale mar facility was shown to enhance removal of some omps while others remained unaffected valhondo et al 2015 2014 recently enhanced degradation of some omps was also seen in a pilot scale mar facility with compost barriers valhondo et al 2020 the compost may act as a source of sorption sites degrading microorganisms and nutrients stimulating microbial activity and is also assumed to create redox gradients that can increase nutrient and omps removal kästner and miltner 2016 valhondo et al 2015 2014 although barrier experiments are promising they do not provide insight into the types and spatial scales of the processes responsible of pollutant degradation and the microbiology underpinning these processes which is needed for the design of efficient barriers our main goal was to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of compost amendment on processes and microorganisms involved in the simultaneous removal of ammonium and omps during passage through a reactive barrier of a constructed mar facility further we evaluated the effect of inoculating with microorganisms from a wastewater treatment plant on omp degradation and n removal processes to achieve these goals we set up a replicated laboratory column experiment allowing for depth specific sampling of water and barrier material and evaluated performance with different amounts of compost and inoculation with activated sludge compared to large scale field trials this setup allowed for more controlled conditions and finer resolution of measurements in time and space to link degradation processes with oxygen availability time depth and microbial community composition and functional communities involved in specific n transformation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 barrier materials and packing the barriers used in the study were made of sand mixed with compost organic matter contents of 0 6 and 25 5 and ph of 8 4 and 7 8 respectively ph measured with deionized water in proportion of material water of 1 2 5 the materials originated from a field trial mar facility in palamós spain valhondo et al 2020 the non commercial compost material was produced by a local farmer by mixing green and brown crop residues in the area the purpose of our study however was not to closely mimic this field site but to disclose the effect of compost amended reactive barriers on pollutant removal processes occurring in the top layer of a constructed mar facility as always with model systems some parameters will differ from those under field conditions in our case these could include fluctuations in infiltration rate pollutant concentration and temperature the barriers were created by packing plexiglas columns see below with either pure sand or a mixture of sand with 10 or 50 compost v v fig 1 on top of each barrier a layer of sand was added to prevent floating of any components of the barrier like e g plant material the bottom of each column beneath the barrier was packed with a layer of coarse quartz sand to ensure homogeneous outflow of the columns and reduce risk of clogging all columns were wet packed columns filled with water before adding barrier to avoid capture of air bubbles 2 2 column conditions the columns were equipped with side ports allowing for sampling of water and barrier material as well as oxygen sensors presense germany located at 4 8 13 and 20 cm depth below the top of the barrier fig 1 inoculation microbial seeding of selected barriers was done with fresh activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant biofos lynetten copenhagen by passing 1 l of a decanted fraction through the columns over 10 h at 1 67 ml min duplicate columns were prepared for each of the five treatments 1 sand inoculated 2 10 compost inoculated 3 50 compost inoculated 4 sand not inoculated and 5 10 compost not inoculated the columns were operated for 17 weeks in the dark at 22 c the flow was a top to bottom gravity flow of 0 5 ml min resulting in an empty bed residence time of approximately 30 h in the barrier 33 h including the quartz sand at the outlet the columns were fed with a synthetic treated wastewater solution composed of two separate solutions mixed in a ratio of 9 1 at the columns inlet to obtain the desired final concentrations table s1 the first solutions contained phosphate buffer 3 mm ph 7 5 and essential micronutrients and was kept at 22 c the other solution was a mixture of ammonium as the sole source of n 2 mg n l yeast extract 1 5 mg doc l difco and humic acids 2 mg doc l humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich serving as organic carbon sources and five omps table s1 spiked to 1 µg l each except of paracetamol that was spiked to 2 µg l prepared at sterile conditions kept at 1 c and exchanged weekly to prevent biodegradation the latter solution was transferred with tubes made of polytetrafluoroethylen ptfe teflon and viton passing through peristaltic pump to prevent sorption of omps otherwise polyethylene and silicone tubing was used the composition of the synthetic wastewater effluent was based on analyses of n species and inorganic elements in samples of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants in copenhagen denmark lynetten and palamós spain the concentration of omps was chosen to be representative of typical omp concentrations in treated wastewater the concentrations were not expected to affect the microbial communities in the barrier as even for antibiotics minimal selective concentrations are normally much higher than 1 µg l stanton et al 2020 and specifically for sulfonamide antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole effect concentrations are reported to be orders of magnitudes higher bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 a tracer test with tritiated water 3h2o moravek usa was conducted before pollutants and organic matter was included in the influent by applying a flow of 0 5 ml min just after packing the columns the headspace water level was then lowered to 1 mm above the column material and 600 µl 3h2o 3 106 dpm ml was distributed across the surface outlet fractions of 7 ml were then collected in a fraction collector for 56 h and 3h2o in selected fractions were quantified by liquid scintillation counting of 1 ml subsamples tri carb 2810 tr perkinelmer the tracer test was repeated just before termination of the experiment after the last sampling of water but before disassembling the columns and splitting the column material the flow through in the barrier material was controlled by gravity in the columns like in full scale mar systems clogging was checked by measuring the height of the water column above the barrier while keeping the outflow level constant except for some clogging in the outlet tubes of the 50 compost columns clogging was not a big issue however there was an increase in headspace height and hence a decreased ability for the water to pass the barrier over time in five of the 10 columns the columns with increased headspace height represented all barrier compositions and treatments and it is therefore not possible to conclude how the tested barrier compositions affect clogging tendencies relative to one another 2 3 sampling and analyses 2 3 1 quantification of organic micropollutants all omps and internal standards were or analytical purity grade 98 the stock solutions of the omps were prepared in hplc grade acetonitrile or methanol and the working solution was stored at 20 c diluted working solutions were prepared on daily basis and kept refrigerated up to 48 h for omps quantification 10 ml of sample was taken into

community analysis the structure composition and diversity of the microbial communities in the columns were determined by illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the 16s rrna gene was

with only 8 cycles and an elongation time of 45 s the product of the second pcr was also pooled inspected by gel electrophoresis and purified with the sera mag bead purification kit and then subjected to quality control on the bioanalyzer agilent ca us after quantification with the qubit fluorometer two libraries were created by pooling equal amounts of purified amplicons sequencing was performed by scilife lab uppsala sweden on an illumina miseq platform 2 250 bp the raw sequence dataset is available under bioproject accession number prjna662356 the raw reads were trimmed to remove additional bases upstream of the primers fastx toolkit and read quality was checked using fastqc the paired reads were merged with pear zhang et al 2014 with a minimum overlap of 20 bp only reads with 300 600 bp were kept for further analysis in addition the maximum expected error was calculated for all merged reads and those with ee 1 were discarded using vsearch rognes et al 2016 the sequences were screened for chimeras by de novo search and clustered by de novo clustering into otus at a nucleotide similarity threshold of 97 with vsearch this resulted in 7 543 879 high quality sequences clustered into 8954 otus the representative sequences of all otus were classified using the least common ancestor algorithm in the sina aligner and the silva reference database ssu132 ref nr pruesse et al 2012 the

present in the activated sludge sample all analyses were performed within the r environment r development core team 2019 with the vegan phyloseq and labdsv packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2015 roberts 2013 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of the columns the tracer test showed a clear effect of the barrier type on the water flow fig s1 the sand columns showed sharp almost gaussian shaped tracer peaks indicating piston flow conditions and an average residence time of 14 h 430 ml the addition of compost resulted in wider peaks with tails most pronounced at 50 compost the average residence time was also higher in the compost columns but with 50 compost a fraction of the water passed the columns faster than with 0 and 10 compost the most likely explanation is that the more compost the more dispersion and fractions of stagnant areas without water movement during the first week of operation with synthetic wastewater effluent but omitting ammonium organic carbon sources and omps there was no consumption of oxygen along the sand barrier profile fig 2 a with compost in the barrier all oxygen was consumed at 10 and 15 cm depth 50 and 10 compost respectively once pollutants and organic matter were included in the influent oxygen was usually depleted within the top 4 cm in all columns fig 2b c therefore aerobic degradation and nitrification was possible only in the top of the columns whereas the barrier below allowed anaerobic processes including nitrate reduction the exceptions were three of the sand columns without compost displaying measurable oxygen concentrations throughout the columns fig 2b c why one of the columns with sand was fully oxygen depleted with depth is unknown 3 2 development of microbial communities the total abundance of bacteria increased with increasing amount of compost in the barrier fig 3 in the early stages of the experiment there was a decrease in abundance with depth in all treatments fig 3a however at the end of experiment the abundances were similar along the column depth within each treatment except in the top sand layer above the barrier where the abundances were similar between treatments fig 3b the microbial community structure was also defined by the barrier material with the biggest difference between columns with and without addition of compost pc1 in fig 4 also time and inoculation with activated sludge had a significant but small effect on the microbial community structure permanova and pc2 in fig 4 dominant phyla within the columns were proteobacteria 39 actinobacteria 21 and chloroflexi 11 table s5 both actinobacteria and chloroflexi increased with increasing amount of compost while proteobacteria were most abundant in the sand columns further the relative abundance of actinobacteria and chloroflexi increased in the sand columns throughout the experiment we also detected thaumarchaeota and nitrospirae with highest relative abundance in the sand columns both phyla are involved in nitrification diversity of the microbial communities dropped in the beginning of the experiment irrespective of barrier material but recovered with time fig s6 at the end of the experiment species richness remained lower in the sand compared to columns with compost addition but shannon s diversity was comparable across the columns the communities in the top sand in all columns developed independently from compost mixed into the underlying barrier fig s7 3 3 n transformation processes and the functional groups involved ammonium was effectively removed from the inlet water following passage through the columns towards the end of the experiment fig 5 all the ammonium was eliminated within the first 4 cm of the barriers along with an increase in nitrate and depletion of oxygen fig 2 however occasionally elevated concentrations of ammonium were found in the lower part of the columns with 50 compost fig 5a and fig s2 subsequent nitrate removal was strongly dependent on the content of compost ranging from complete elimination of nitrate in barriers with 50 compost to negligible removal in sand fig 5b nitrite removal patterns were less distinct yet generally showed production and reduction of nitrite during the passage of the barriers fig 5c with virtually no leaching from the columns outlet after 50 days of operation fig s2b for the genes involved in n transformation processes the general pattern was similar to the total number of bacteria with abundances positively related to the amount of compost in the barrier throughout the experimental period fig 6 and supplementary figs s4 and s5 the exception was an increased abundance of bacterial amoa in the non inoculated columns with 10 compost at all depths at the last sampling point day 119 there was no major effect of depth on the n cycling genes except that the abundances of all genes were lower in the top sand in columns containing compost similar to what was seen for the total number of bacteria over time the denitrification genes nirs all treatments and nirk 0 and 10 compost had minor variation in abundances while nirk in 50 compost decreased over time fig s5 for other genes there was a clear increase over the course of the experiment most pronounced for the dnra gene nrfa that increased in all columns also archaeal amoa increased with time especially in sand columns and was higher than the number of bacterial amoa fig s4 inoculation did not influence the gene abundances apart from an increase in bacterial amoa in non inoculated 10 compost columns towards the end of the experiment the amoa in comammox nitrospira was detected but due to the formation of unspecific pcr products visible on the gel quantification was not possible based on gel images however the strongest signal was from comammox amoa clade a in all sand layers and in the treatment with sand and no inoculation from the upper layers down to 13 cm depth data not shown sequencing data on the relative abundances of total nitrospira which include comammox as well as nitrite oxidizing bacteria showed an increase in all columns with time fig 7 by the end of the experiment nitrospira was abundant in the top sand of all columns and higher in the top of the non inoculated columns compared to their inoculated counterparts 3 4 removal of organic micropollutants removal of omps during passage through the columns i e the sum of degradation and sorption was assessed as relative decrease in concentration measured in the column outlet as compared to the inlet the apparent removal efficiency varied among compounds and over time fig 8 removal of paracetamol was improved by i presence of compost ii inoculation and iii time fig 8 barriers with 50 compost showed very efficient paracetamol removal from the beginning of the experiment 92 other barriers initially showed lower efficiency but with increasing removal capacity over time and by the end of the experiment all columns showed complete removal of paracetamol interestingly paracetamol showed as the only omp positive effects of inoculation of the barriers figs 8 and 9 depth profiles based on samples taken from different depths in the columns at certain time points showed that paracetamol was removed primarily in the top of the barriers down to 4 8 cm fig 9 occasionally dissipation of paracetamol was also observed in the lower depths especially in barriers with compost at the early phase of the experiment after the last water sampling the flow was increased 3x for 48 h to check the robustness of the paracetamol removal to resist increased flow even at this higher flow all paracetamol was removed in all columns fig s8 however while 95 of paracetamol was removed within the top 4 cm at normal flow at this stage of the experiment fig 9 only 20 40 paracetamol was removed in the top 4 cm of non inoculated columns operated at higher flow rate by contrast inoculated columns showed full removal in the top 4 cm even at 3x higher flow rate fig s8 the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole showed some dynamics in removal fig 8 in columns with both pure sand and 10 compost limited removal was observed on average 3 and 7 respectively with a slight decrease over time for the columns with 10 compost and some effect of inoculation on average 11 removal for inoculated and 4 removal for non inoculated columns on the other hand amendment with 50 compost resulted in significantly higher removal of sulfamethoxazole reaching up to 84 in those 50 compost barriers a clear development over time could be observed resulting in sulfamethoxazole removal increasing from 30 in week 2 to 73 on average during weeks 4 15 the removal of sulfamethoxazole occurred at all depths of the barrier fig s3 sulfadiazine the other sulfonamide showed low removal average 14 for all treatments throughout the experiment and the effect of compost addition was limited removal patterns for carbamazepine and diuron were similar clearly controlled by the compost content of the barriers the apparent removal at day 14 reached 100 for 50 compost and somewhat lower for 10 compost successively decreasing over the first 7 weeks and leveling off at approximately 5 and 20 respectively for carbamazepine and diuron pure sand columns did not show any pronounced removal at any stage of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 removal of organic micropollutants in reactive barriers the introduction of a barrier resulted in a 10 to 100 times higher bacterial abundance depending on the concentration of compost fig 3 and the resulting microbial community differed in composition and richness from the non barrier sand only community fig 4 although the microbial communities were unique with respect to barrier material they displayed a directional development over time independent of barrier material overall this indicates predictable responses and different degradation capacities in relation to the treatments the application of barriers with compost had beneficial effects on removal of paracetamol and sulfamethoxazole and a minor effect on diuron and sulfadiazine yet apart from paracetamol a fraction of each of the compounds in many cases substantial would eventually pass the barriers arguably leaching to the underlying aquifers thus a simple compost amendment seems to only slightly improve overall omp removal the removal of paracetamol occurring primarily in the top of the barriers i e in the oxic zone suggests aerobic degradation fig 9 however some removal occurred in the anaerobic zone of the columns which could be due to either the existence of anaerobic degradation pathways or sorption fig 9 day 14 and 62 however sorption of paracetamol in soils and aquifers is limited löffler et al 2005 lorphensri et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2009 which can be expected from its low hydrophobicity table s3 instead reports of anaerobic biodegradation of paracetamol e g yang et al 2020 support biodegradation initially the barrier as well as inoculation had a positive effect on paracetamol degradation but the communities adapted and after 15 weeks paracetamol degradation was complete both with and without the barriers and with and without inoculation the applied concentration of 2 µg l paracetamol cannot provide much energy for growth and it is likely that it is not the paracetamol itself that leads to this adaptation but rather transformation of primary substrates such as nitrogen species or organic compounds alidina et al 2014a rauch williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 co metabolic degradation of paracetamol by nitrifying or denitrifying bacteria has to our knowledge not been reported and organic constituents of yeast extract and or humic acid are the most likely primary source of energy for the paracetamol degraders in the barriers with compost organic substances in the compost are also a likely additional source of energy in the case of sulfamethoxazole improvement in the removal was obtained with 50 compost recently barriers with compost were shown to enhance the removal of several omps and it was assumed that the organic material generated redox gradients favorable for degradation of various compounds valhondo et al 2020 in agreement the removal pattern of sulfamethoxazole with depth in the present study fig s3 was similar to the decrease in nitrate formed in the top of the columns fig 5 opening up for the possibility that sulfamethoxazole was co metabolically degraded concomitant to nitrate reduction processes dnra and or denitrification nevertheless sulfamethoxazole may form nitro sulfamethoxazole in the presence of nitrite nödler et al 2012 which could also explain the apparent relationship between nitrate reduction and sulfamethoxazole degradation since this process is reversible nödler et al 2012 the formation of nitro sulfamethoxazole cannot not be considered an efficient removal process however co metabolic degradation of sulfamethoxazole by autotrophic denitrifiers was recently demonstrated zhang et al 2020 and previously heterotrophic denitrifiers have been proposed to degrade sulfamethoxazole dependent on availability of easily degradable organic matter yang et al 2018 thus co metabolic degradation by denitrifiers using organic matter in the compost could also explain the observed removal of sulfamethoxazole either way it is not clear why sulfamethoxazole was not degraded at 10 compost fig 8 where nitrate reduction and nitrite formation also occurred fig 5 sulfamethoxazole degradation has however also been observed at sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions yang et al 2018 and these processes could have contributed to the removal of sulfamethoxazole in barriers with high compost content although both diuron and carbamazepine initially seemed to be removed very efficiently with compost the actual elimination of these compounds was limited the declining removal over time indicates no degradation nor permanent or irreversible sorption but only retarded transport through the barriers due to a multitude of sorption desorption events indeed significant sorption of diuron and carbamazepine to compost was found kd 58 and 28 respectively table s3 partitioning coefficients can be related to retardation in saturated sediment through the equation rf 1 kd p n li and shuman 1997 us epa 1999 where rf is the retardation factor p is the bulk density of the soil and n is the porosity from the experimental kd values table s3 it is hence possible to calculate retardation factors of 12 and 24 for carbamazepine and diuron in 10 compost and 42 and 87 in 50 compost these rough calculations ignoring smaller effects of diffusion and mixing suggest a breakthrough of carbamazepine after 8 and 30 days in 10 and 50 compost respectively and for diuron after 16 and 61 days in 10 and 50 compost which fit well with the observed breakthrough times fig 8 this is a further indication that the transient removal of carbamazepine and diuron was due to reversible sorption the apparent removal of a fraction of diuron 14 35 towards the end of the experiment could result from non reversible sorption or bio degradation the latter supported by similar levels of removal for both 10 and 50 compost barriers and the slight effect of inoculation 4 2 removal of inorganic nitrogen in reactive barriers all columns had an efficient removal of ammonium in the upper part of the column independent of barrier type since bacterial amoa genes showed very low abundance and the archaeal counterpart increased during the experiment archaea may have been the main ammonium oxidizers in the inoculated columns although dominance does not necessarily indicate the most active group sterngren et al 2015 nitrospira were also detected in all columns and it is known that in waterworks sand filters these can be important ammonium oxidizers fowler et al 2018 although it is not possible from sequencing data to distinguish between comammox nitrospira that oxidize both ammonium and nitrite and other nitrospira that oxidize only nitrite as the second step in nitrification the high increase of nitrospira in all columns indicates that they could also have been involved in ammonium oxidation especially in the non inoculated columns this is supported by the specific although not quantitative detection of comammox bacteria in the columns compost stimulated n removal although ammonium was formed in barriers with 50 compost this suggests that the reduction of nitrate may occur not only by denitrification but also by dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra in agreement the nrfa involved in dnra increased in abundance with 50 compost reaching 109 copies g 1 wet weight towards the end of the experiment indicating increased genetic potential for dnra an increase in nrfa was observed in all columns over time but still in one to two orders of magnitude lower abundance in the other treatments the reduction of nitrate through dnra requires labile organic matter and dnra activity has previously been shown to be controlled by the amount of labile organic matter with higher c nitrate ratios leading to more nitrate reduction through dnra fazzolari et al 1998 kraft et al 2014 putz et al 2018 van den berg et al 2015 it has also been suggested that dnra activity is mainly important under highly reduced conditions buresh and patrick 1981 but subsequently it was shown that dnra may occur also at much less reduced condition fazzolari et al 1998 silver et al 2001 the reason for dnra to be related to the amount of compost present in our barriers is probably related to the amount of labile organic matter and maybe also to differences in redox conditions since ammonium was formed in the deeper parts of the 50 compost columns 4 3 the impact of inoculation on pollutant removal inoculation impacted the microbial community structure to a lesser extent than barrier material and effects of inoculation on pollutant degradation was mainly detected in the sand nevertheless inoculation showed pronounced effects in case of paracetamol removal both with regards to the time before full removal was achieved fig 8 and for the robustness of the degradation to resist increased flow fig s8 we assume that the effect of inoculation was related exclusively to the introduction of microorganisms rather than a small and transient pulse of organic carbon from the aqueous fraction of the activated sludge recently enhanced paracetamol degradation has been reported for polluted sediments amended with degrader bacterial strains enriched by adaptation at high paracetamol exposure 100 mg kg 1 yang et al 2020 yet not much is known about which organisms are responsible for degrading the different omps at trace concentrations an indicator species analysis on the inoculated vs non inoculated sand samples of day 44 79 showed that it was mainly proteobacteria and bacteroidetes that were specific to the inoculated samples as well as being present in the activated sludge this included two species belonging to pseudomonas pseudomonadales a group known to include paracetamol degraders żur et al 2018 whether these were responsible for the improved paracetamol degradation in inoculated columns is speculative but our data demonstrate that specific bacteria originating from the activated sludge and potentially good pollutant degraders thrive in the barriers the effect of inoculation on transformation of nitrogen species was small when looking at individual n species in the outlet fig 5 however the microbial taxa involved in n transformation processes were affected by inoculation most clearly seen by an increased growth of nitrospira in the non inoculated columns by contrast an increase in archaeal amoa was observed in all columns but those with 50 compost and it was most pronounced in inoculated columns without compost fig s5 the archaeal amoa gene was however not abundant in the inoculum itself so it is not clear why inoculation would have this effect although the benefits of inoculation were limited it did not have any negative effect on the removal efficiency of omps or ammonium therefore such procedure could be used to achieve faster maturation of newly constructed or poorly performing mar systems on the other hand activated sludge might contain pathogens hence application should be done with moderation to avoid transfer of these microbes into aquifers 4 4 outlook mar is an attractive approach for providing clean groundwater due to low maintenance and minimal impact on the environment but are mar technologies effective enough for restoration of drinking water resources and could the introduction of reactive barriers be a step towards achieving this based on our study as well as on the literature it is clear that some compounds are highly recalcitrant in reactive barriers while others are removed only partially and yet others may convert to uncharacterized transformation products the proposed benefit of compost in a reactive barrier for removal of omp in mar systems valhondo et al 2015 2014 or soil remediation kästner and miltner 2016 was relatively minor in our study all this poses potential risks of omps and other pollutants leaching to aquifers even with the inclusion of reactive barriers and the eventual impact of filtration of source water containing omps treated wastewater or surface water through a mar system would depend on site specific characteristics such as soil properties or microbial communities hermes et al 2019 but also on dilution rates in the aquifer this would be the case with or without the inclusion of reactive barriers we showed that the establishment of barriers with compost leads to instant removal of oxygen which means that the microbial degradation of omps below a few cm from the surface will be dependent on anaerobic degradation pathways generally these are less effective at degrading most organic pollutants a possible solution would be extending aerobic conditions and increasing contact of the water with oxygen this can be achieved by cultivating plants on the surface of the mar systems as plant roots can increase diversity of redox conditions in the sediment valhondo et al 2014 another approach could be based on sequential infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration providing more oxic and carbon limited conditions favorable for an enhanced transformation of omps hellauer et al 2018 müller et al 2017 and oxidation of ammonium such technology known as sequential mar technology smart or sequential biofiltration sbf has proven to increase attenuation of some omps as compared to the conventional approach but did not affect the fate of highly recalcitrant pollutants including carbamazepine hellauer et al 2018 to remove such highly recalcitrant omps additional treatments such as ozonation or activated carbon filtration may be needed before infiltration of the treated wastewater although also these methods cannot guarantee removal of all omps müller et al 2019 summers et al 2013 apart from pollutant removal it must also be considered that barriers with compost led to an instant increase in microbial abundance and diversity and induced the development of a different microbial community this may have further implications at mar facilities such as increased risk of clogging or leaching of microorganisms to underlying aquifers 5 conclusions the establishment of barriers with composts or other organic materials at managed aquifer recharge facilities has been suggested as a tool to enhance removal of pollutants especially organic micropollutants when recharging with treated wastewater our experiments with such barriers lead to conclude as follows compost increases microbial abundance and leads to the establishment of a different microbial community but whether establishing reactive barriers with compost is advantageous will depend on the pollutants present in the inlet water and whether adaptation can be expected to occur for example ammonium was removed by complete nitrification in the top of all columns but the conversion rate and pathway of the accumulated nitrate at lower depths depended on the amount of compost compost in barriers creates anaerobic conditions which means degradation below a few cm depth will be dependent on anaerobic pathways for pollutant removal processes requiring labile organic matter and or anoxic conditions a layer of compost is therefore advantageous nitrate and sulfamethoxazole are two such examples where increased amounts of compost increased removal to allow sufficient time for processes requiring aerobic conditions a thicker layer of sand on top of the compost might be needed inoculation of the sand with activated sludge is then an option to speed up maturation as exemplified by the improved

17254,groundwater is an important drinking water resource to ensure clean drinking water managed aquifer recharge mar could be an attractive solution when recharging with treated wastewater the installation of reactive barriers e g with compost or other organic materials at mar facilities may improve pollutant removal to link pollutant transformation processes and microbiology in reactive barriers we simulated infiltration through different sand compost mixtures using laboratory columns with depth specific sampling of water and barrier material we also evaluated the effect of inoculation with activated sludge our focus was on the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and nitrogen species with parallel monitoring of the development of microbial communities during 17 weeks of operation the columns were fed with synthetic wastewater containing five organic micropollutants 1 2 µg l each and ammonium 2 mg n l unique communities developed in the columns in relation to barrier material with high effects of compost addition and minor effect of inoculation removal of the micropollutant paracetamol acetaminophen occurred in all columns while sulfamethoxazole was only removed in columns with 50 compost by contrast limited removal was observed for sulfadiazine carbamazepine and diuron with the latter two displaying transient removal attributed sorption oxygen was depleted within the top few cm of the columns when compost was present but this was sufficient to remove all ammonium through nitrification the fate of accumulated nitrate at deeper layers depended on the fraction of compost with more compost leading to removal of nitrate by denitrification but also by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium hampering the overall nitrogen removal efficiency introducing compost as reactive barrier in mar facilities has a large effect on the microbial communities and processes but whether it will provide overall cleaner water to the underlying aquifer is uncertain and will depend very much on the type of pollutant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords compost wastewater effluent groundwater pollutant degradation column experiments bacterial community composition 1 introduction today s world is challenged by drinking water scarcity in many regions with the problem accelerating due to climate change and population growth leading to extended drought periods water pollution and increased water consumption thus there is an urgent demand for the development of sustainable methods ensuring safe drinking water schwarzenbach et al 2006 managed aquifer recharge mar has the potential to be an attractive solution as it can be operated as an environmentally and economical sustainable technology for removing pollutants alidina et al 2014b regnery et al 2017 and allows reuse of discharged water to replenish groundwater reservoirs loos et al 2013 yet mar is often operated as a black box with only superficial understanding of the processes and factors governing removal of pollutants regnery et al 2017 effluents from wastewater treatment plants are potential sources of water that may be recycled by mar however such water usually contains high nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and trace amounts of organic pollutants collectively named organic micropollutants omps ec 2013 ec et al 2016 loos et al 2013 nikolaou et al 2007 petrie et al 2015 omps cover pharmaceuticals personal care products e g antiseptics veterinary and illicit drugs fragrances sunscreens pesticides e g herbicides and industrial chemicals and their metabolites although omps are often present at very low concentrations ng µg l their presence in groundwater and subsequently in drinking water is undesired and raises considerable concerns for human health especially when present in complex mixtures and for prolonged exposure periods loos et al 2013 onesios and bouwer 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2006 it is therefore important to know whether omps and nutrients are removed by mar to secure that they are not leaching to the groundwater resources two major processes enable removal of omps degradation including biodegradation mediated primarily by microorganisms and sorption since the concentrations of omps are usually too low to stimulate expression of specific enzymes by microorganisms biodegradation is normally a co metabolic process i e the molecules are transformed by non specific enzymes involved primarily in other processes dalton and stirling 1982 for instance omps can sometimes be efficiently removed during parallel n transformation processes carried out by de nitrifying bacteria and archaea benner et al 2013 tran et al 2013 omp attenuation is dependent on the specific local conditions such as temperature ph or oxygen levels and organic matter content and often relies on biological processes hence efficiencies may vary seasonally and between different mar facilities who 2012 and also depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the chemicals schaffer et al 2015 reactive permeable barriers that act as biological and physical filters as the water passes have been used in groundwater remediation where they are typically placed vertically in a plume of pollutants see faisal et al 2018 for a recent review horizontal barriers have also been proposed to increase pollutant removal during mar for example with wood chips for the removal of nitrate beganskas et al 2018 but might also be used for the removal of omps compost added to a sand barrier at a full scale mar facility was shown to enhance removal of some omps while others remained unaffected valhondo et al 2015 2014 recently enhanced degradation of some omps was also seen in a pilot scale mar facility with compost barriers valhondo et al 2020 the compost may act as a source of sorption sites degrading microorganisms and nutrients stimulating microbial activity and is also assumed to create redox gradients that can increase nutrient and omps removal kästner and miltner 2016 valhondo et al 2015 2014 although barrier experiments are promising they do not provide insight into the types and spatial scales of the processes responsible of pollutant degradation and the microbiology underpinning these processes which is needed for the design of efficient barriers our main goal was to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of compost amendment on processes and microorganisms involved in the simultaneous removal of ammonium and omps during passage through a reactive barrier of a constructed mar facility further we evaluated the effect of inoculating with microorganisms from a wastewater treatment plant on omp degradation and n removal processes to achieve these goals we set up a replicated laboratory column experiment allowing for depth specific sampling of water and barrier material and evaluated performance with different amounts of compost and inoculation with activated sludge compared to large scale field trials this setup allowed for more controlled conditions and finer resolution of measurements in time and space to link degradation processes with oxygen availability time depth and microbial community composition and functional communities involved in specific n transformation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 barrier materials and packing the barriers used in the study were made of sand mixed with compost organic matter contents of 0 6 and 25 5 and ph of 8 4 and 7 8 respectively ph measured with deionized water in proportion of material water of 1 2 5 the materials originated from a field trial mar facility in palamós spain valhondo et al 2020 the non commercial compost material was produced by a local farmer by mixing green and brown crop residues in the area the purpose of our study however was not to closely mimic this field site but to disclose the effect of compost amended reactive barriers on pollutant removal processes occurring in the top layer of a constructed mar facility as always with model systems some parameters will differ from those under field conditions in our case these could include fluctuations in infiltration rate pollutant concentration and temperature the barriers were created by packing plexiglas columns see below with either pure sand or a mixture of sand with 10 or 50 compost v v fig 1 on top of each barrier a layer of sand was added to prevent floating of any components of the barrier like e g plant material the bottom of each column beneath the barrier was packed with a layer of coarse quartz sand to ensure homogeneous outflow of the columns and reduce risk of clogging all columns were wet packed columns filled with water before adding barrier to avoid capture of air bubbles 2 2 column conditions the columns were equipped with side ports allowing for sampling of water and barrier material as well as oxygen sensors presense germany located at 4 8 13 and 20 cm depth below the top of the barrier fig 1 inoculation microbial seeding of selected barriers was done with fresh activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant biofos lynetten copenhagen by passing 1 l of a decanted fraction through the columns over 10 h at 1 67 ml min duplicate columns were prepared for each of the five treatments 1 sand inoculated 2 10 compost inoculated 3 50 compost inoculated 4 sand not inoculated and 5 10 compost not inoculated the columns were operated for 17 weeks in the dark at 22 c the flow was a top to bottom gravity flow of 0 5 ml min resulting in an empty bed residence time of approximately 30 h in the barrier 33 h including the quartz sand at the outlet the columns were fed with a synthetic treated wastewater solution composed of two separate solutions mixed in a ratio of 9 1 at the columns inlet to obtain the desired final concentrations table s1 the first solutions contained phosphate buffer 3 mm ph 7 5 and essential micronutrients and was kept at 22 c the other solution was a mixture of ammonium as the sole source of n 2 mg n l yeast extract 1 5 mg doc l difco and humic acids 2 mg doc l humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich serving as organic carbon sources and five omps table s1 spiked to 1 µg l each except of paracetamol that was spiked to 2 µg l prepared at sterile conditions kept at 1 c and exchanged weekly to prevent biodegradation the latter solution was transferred with tubes made of polytetrafluoroethylen ptfe teflon and viton passing through peristaltic pump to prevent sorption of omps otherwise polyethylene and silicone tubing was used the composition of the synthetic wastewater effluent was based on analyses of n species and inorganic elements in samples of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants in copenhagen denmark lynetten and palamós spain the concentration of omps was chosen to be representative of typical omp concentrations in treated wastewater the concentrations were not expected to affect the microbial communities in the barrier as even for antibiotics minimal selective concentrations are normally much higher than 1 µg l stanton et al 2020 and specifically for sulfonamide antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole effect concentrations are reported to be orders of magnitudes higher bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 a tracer test with tritiated water 3h2o moravek usa was conducted before pollutants and organic matter was included in the influent by applying a flow of 0 5 ml min just after packing the columns the headspace water level was then lowered to 1 mm above the column material and 600 µl 3h2o 3 106 dpm ml was distributed across the surface outlet fractions of 7 ml were then collected in a fraction collector for 56 h and 3h2o in selected fractions were quantified by liquid scintillation counting of 1 ml subsamples tri carb 2810 tr perkinelmer the tracer test was repeated just before termination of the experiment after the last sampling of water but before disassembling the columns and splitting the column material the flow through in the barrier material was controlled by gravity in the columns like in full scale mar systems clogging was checked by measuring the height of the water column above the barrier while keeping the outflow level constant except for some clogging in the outlet tubes of the 50 compost columns clogging was not a big issue however there was an increase in headspace height and hence a decreased ability for the water to pass the barrier over time in five of the 10 columns the columns with increased headspace height represented all barrier compositions and treatments and it is therefore not possible to conclude how the tested barrier compositions affect clogging tendencies relative to one another 2 3 sampling and analyses 2 3 1 quantification of organic micropollutants all omps and internal standards were or analytical purity grade 98 the stock solutions of the omps were prepared in hplc grade acetonitrile or

community analysis the structure composition and diversity of the microbial communities in the columns were determined by illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the 16s rrna gene was

to quality control on the bioanalyzer agilent ca us after quantification with the qubit fluorometer two libraries were created by pooling equal amounts of purified amplicons sequencing was performed by scilife lab uppsala sweden on an illumina miseq platform 2 250 bp the raw sequence dataset is available under bioproject accession number prjna662356 the raw reads were trimmed to remove additional bases upstream of the primers fastx toolkit and read quality was checked using fastqc the paired reads were merged with pear zhang et al 2014 with a minimum overlap of 20 bp only reads with 300 600 bp were kept for further analysis in addition the maximum expected error was calculated for all merged reads and those with ee 1 were discarded using vsearch rognes et al 2016 the sequences were screened for chimeras by de novo search and clustered by de novo clustering into otus at a nucleotide similarity threshold of 97 with vsearch this resulted in 7 543 879 high quality sequences clustered into 8954 otus the representative sequences of all otus were classified using the least common ancestor algorithm in the sina aligner and the silva reference database ssu132 ref nr pruesse et al 2012 the sequencing data were rarefied to 14 653 reads per sample to account for differences in sequencing depth between samples and alpha diversity was calculated as shannon s diversity index and species

and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds effects of barrier material inoculation and time on the community structure were determined using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova to identify specific otus characteristic to inoculated vs non inoculated sand samples we performed an indicator species analysis and compared significant otus p 0 001 to the communities present in the activated sludge sample all analyses were performed within the r environment r development core team 2019 with the vegan phyloseq and labdsv packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2015 roberts 2013 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of the columns the tracer test showed a clear effect of the barrier type on the water flow fig s1 the sand columns showed sharp almost gaussian shaped tracer peaks indicating piston flow conditions and an average residence time of 14 h 430 ml the addition of compost resulted in wider peaks with tails most pronounced at 50 compost the average residence time was also higher in the compost columns but with 50 compost a fraction of the water passed the columns faster than with 0 and 10 compost the most likely explanation is that the more compost the more dispersion and fractions of stagnant areas without water movement during the first week of operation with synthetic wastewater effluent but omitting ammonium organic carbon sources and omps there was no consumption of oxygen along the sand barrier profile fig 2 a with compost in the barrier all oxygen was consumed at 10 and 15 cm depth 50 and 10 compost respectively once pollutants and organic matter were included in the influent oxygen was usually depleted within the top 4 cm in all columns fig 2b c therefore aerobic degradation and nitrification was possible only in the top of the columns whereas the barrier below allowed anaerobic processes including nitrate reduction the exceptions were three of the sand columns without compost displaying measurable oxygen concentrations throughout the columns fig 2b c why one of the columns with sand was fully oxygen depleted with depth is unknown 3 2 development of microbial communities the total abundance of bacteria increased with increasing amount of compost in the barrier fig 3 in the early stages of the experiment there was a decrease in abundance with depth in all treatments fig 3a however at the end of experiment the abundances were similar along the column depth within each treatment except in the top sand layer above the barrier where the abundances were similar between treatments fig 3b the microbial community structure was also defined by the barrier material with the biggest difference between columns with and without addition of compost pc1 in fig 4 also time and inoculation with activated sludge had a significant but small effect on the microbial community structure permanova and pc2 in fig 4 dominant phyla within the columns were proteobacteria 39 actinobacteria 21 and chloroflexi 11 table s5 both actinobacteria and chloroflexi increased with increasing amount of compost while proteobacteria were most abundant in the sand columns further the relative abundance of actinobacteria and chloroflexi increased in the sand columns throughout the experiment we also detected thaumarchaeota and nitrospirae with highest relative abundance in the sand columns both phyla are involved in nitrification diversity of the microbial communities dropped in the beginning of the experiment irrespective of barrier material but recovered with time fig s6 at the end of the experiment species richness remained lower in the sand compared to columns with compost addition but shannon s diversity was comparable across the columns the communities in the top sand in all columns developed independently from compost mixed into the underlying barrier fig s7 3 3 n transformation processes and the functional groups involved ammonium was effectively removed from the inlet water following passage through the columns towards the end of the experiment fig 5 all the ammonium was eliminated within the first 4 cm of the barriers along with an increase in nitrate and depletion of oxygen fig 2 however occasionally elevated concentrations of ammonium were found in the lower part of the columns with 50 compost fig 5a and fig s2 subsequent nitrate removal was strongly dependent on the content of compost ranging from complete elimination of nitrate in barriers with 50 compost to negligible removal in sand fig 5b nitrite removal patterns were less distinct yet generally showed production and reduction of nitrite during the passage of the barriers fig 5c with virtually no leaching from the columns outlet after 50 days of operation fig s2b for the genes involved in n transformation processes the general pattern was similar to the total number of bacteria with abundances positively related to the amount of compost in the barrier throughout the experimental period fig 6 and supplementary figs s4 and s5 the exception was an increased abundance of bacterial amoa in the non inoculated columns with 10 compost at all depths at the last sampling point day 119 there was no major effect of depth on the n cycling genes except that the abundances of all genes were lower in the top sand in columns containing compost similar to what was seen for the total number of bacteria over time the denitrification genes nirs all treatments and nirk 0 and 10 compost had minor variation in abundances while nirk in 50 compost decreased over time fig s5 for other genes there was a clear increase over the course of the experiment most pronounced for the dnra gene nrfa that increased in all columns also archaeal amoa increased with time especially in sand columns and was higher than the number of bacterial amoa fig s4 inoculation did not influence the gene abundances apart from an increase in bacterial amoa in non inoculated 10 compost columns towards the end of the experiment the amoa in comammox nitrospira was detected but due to the formation of unspecific pcr products visible on the gel quantification was not possible based on gel images however the strongest signal was from comammox amoa clade a in all sand layers and in the treatment with sand and no inoculation from the upper layers down to 13 cm depth data not shown sequencing data on the relative abundances of total nitrospira which include comammox as well as nitrite oxidizing bacteria showed an increase in all columns with time fig 7 by the end of the experiment nitrospira was abundant in the top sand of all columns and higher in the top of the non inoculated columns compared to their inoculated counterparts 3 4 removal of organic micropollutants removal of omps during passage through the columns i e the sum of degradation and sorption was assessed as relative decrease in concentration measured in the column outlet as compared to the inlet the apparent removal efficiency varied among compounds and over time fig 8 removal of paracetamol was improved by i presence of compost ii inoculation and iii time fig 8 barriers with 50 compost showed very efficient paracetamol removal from the beginning of the experiment 92 other barriers initially showed lower efficiency but with increasing removal capacity over time and by the end of the experiment all columns showed complete removal of paracetamol interestingly paracetamol showed as the only omp positive effects of inoculation of the barriers figs 8 and 9 depth profiles based on samples taken from different depths in the columns at certain time points showed that paracetamol was removed primarily in the top of the barriers down to 4 8 cm fig 9 occasionally dissipation of paracetamol was also observed in the lower depths especially in barriers with compost at the early phase of the experiment after the last water sampling the flow was increased 3x for 48 h to check the robustness of the paracetamol removal to resist increased flow even at this higher flow all paracetamol was removed in all columns fig s8 however while 95 of paracetamol was removed within the top 4 cm at normal flow at this stage of the experiment fig 9 only 20 40 paracetamol was removed in the top 4 cm of non inoculated columns operated at higher flow rate by contrast inoculated columns showed full removal in the top 4 cm even at 3x higher flow rate fig s8 the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole showed some dynamics in removal fig 8 in columns with both pure sand and 10 compost limited removal was observed on average 3 and 7 respectively with a slight decrease over time for the columns with 10 compost and some effect of inoculation on average 11 removal for inoculated and 4 removal for non inoculated columns on the other hand amendment with 50 compost resulted in significantly higher removal of sulfamethoxazole reaching up to 84 in those 50 compost barriers a clear development over time could be observed resulting in sulfamethoxazole removal increasing from 30 in week 2 to 73 on average during weeks 4 15 the removal of sulfamethoxazole occurred at all depths of the barrier fig s3 sulfadiazine the other sulfonamide showed low removal average 14 for all treatments throughout the experiment and the effect of compost addition was limited removal patterns for carbamazepine and diuron were similar clearly controlled by the compost content of the barriers the apparent removal at day 14 reached 100 for 50 compost and somewhat lower for 10 compost successively decreasing over the first 7 weeks and leveling off at approximately 5 and 20 respectively for carbamazepine and diuron pure sand columns did not show any pronounced removal at any stage of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 removal of organic micropollutants in reactive barriers the introduction of a barrier resulted in a 10 to 100 times higher bacterial abundance depending on the concentration of compost fig 3 and the resulting microbial community differed in composition and richness from the non barrier sand only community fig 4 although the microbial communities were unique with respect to barrier material they displayed a directional development over time independent of barrier material overall this indicates predictable responses and different degradation capacities in relation to the treatments the application of barriers with compost had beneficial effects on removal of paracetamol and sulfamethoxazole and a minor effect on diuron and sulfadiazine yet apart from paracetamol a fraction of each of the compounds in many cases substantial would eventually pass the barriers arguably leaching to the underlying aquifers thus a simple compost amendment seems to only slightly improve overall omp removal the removal of paracetamol occurring primarily in the top of the barriers i e in the oxic zone suggests aerobic degradation fig 9 however some removal occurred in the anaerobic zone of the columns which could be due to either the existence of anaerobic degradation pathways or sorption fig 9 day 14 and 62 however sorption of paracetamol in soils and aquifers is limited löffler et al 2005 lorphensri et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2009 which can be expected from its low hydrophobicity table s3 instead reports of anaerobic biodegradation of paracetamol e g yang et al 2020 support biodegradation initially the barrier as well as inoculation had a positive effect on paracetamol degradation but the communities adapted and after 15 weeks paracetamol degradation was complete both with and without the barriers and with and without inoculation the applied concentration of 2 µg l paracetamol cannot provide much energy for growth and it is likely that it is not the paracetamol itself that leads to this adaptation but rather transformation of primary substrates such as nitrogen species or organic compounds alidina et al 2014a rauch williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 co metabolic degradation of paracetamol by nitrifying or denitrifying bacteria has to our knowledge not been reported and organic constituents of yeast extract and or humic acid are the most likely primary source of energy for the paracetamol degraders in the barriers with compost organic substances in the compost are also a likely additional source of energy in the case of sulfamethoxazole improvement in the removal was obtained with 50 compost recently barriers with compost were shown to enhance the removal of several omps and it was assumed that the organic material generated redox gradients favorable for degradation of various compounds valhondo et al 2020 in agreement the removal pattern of sulfamethoxazole with depth in the present study fig s3 was similar to the decrease in nitrate formed in the top of the columns fig 5 opening up for the possibility that sulfamethoxazole was co metabolically degraded concomitant to nitrate reduction processes dnra and or denitrification nevertheless sulfamethoxazole may form nitro sulfamethoxazole in the presence of nitrite nödler et al 2012 which could also explain the apparent relationship between nitrate reduction and sulfamethoxazole degradation since this process is reversible nödler et al 2012 the formation of nitro sulfamethoxazole cannot not be considered an efficient removal process however co metabolic degradation of sulfamethoxazole by autotrophic denitrifiers was recently demonstrated zhang et al 2020 and previously heterotrophic denitrifiers have been proposed to degrade sulfamethoxazole dependent on availability of easily degradable organic matter yang et al 2018 thus co metabolic degradation by denitrifiers using organic matter in the compost could also explain the observed removal of sulfamethoxazole either way it is not clear why sulfamethoxazole was not degraded at 10 compost fig 8 where nitrate reduction and nitrite formation also occurred fig 5 sulfamethoxazole degradation has however also been observed at sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions yang et al 2018 and these processes could have contributed to the removal of sulfamethoxazole in barriers with high compost content although both diuron and carbamazepine initially seemed to be removed very efficiently with compost the actual elimination of these compounds was limited the declining removal over time indicates no degradation nor permanent or irreversible sorption but only retarded transport through the barriers due to a multitude of sorption desorption events indeed significant sorption of diuron and carbamazepine to compost was found kd 58 and 28 respectively table s3 partitioning coefficients can be related to retardation in saturated sediment through the equation rf 1 kd p n li and shuman 1997 us epa 1999 where rf is the retardation factor p is the bulk density of the soil and n is the porosity from the experimental kd values table s3 it is hence possible to calculate retardation factors of 12 and 24 for carbamazepine and diuron in 10 compost and 42 and 87 in 50 compost these rough calculations ignoring smaller effects of diffusion and mixing suggest a breakthrough of carbamazepine after 8 and 30 days in 10 and 50 compost respectively and for diuron after 16 and 61 days in 10 and 50 compost which fit well with the observed breakthrough times fig 8 this is a further indication that the transient removal of carbamazepine and diuron was due to reversible sorption the apparent removal of a fraction of diuron 14 35 towards the end of the experiment could result from non reversible sorption or bio degradation the latter supported by similar levels of removal for both 10 and 50 compost barriers and the slight effect of inoculation 4 2 removal of inorganic nitrogen in reactive barriers all columns had an efficient removal of ammonium in the upper part of the column independent of barrier type since bacterial amoa genes showed very low abundance and the archaeal counterpart increased during the experiment archaea may have been the main ammonium oxidizers in the inoculated columns although dominance does not necessarily indicate the most active group sterngren et al 2015 nitrospira were also detected in all columns and it is known that in waterworks sand filters these can be important ammonium oxidizers fowler et al 2018 although it is not possible from sequencing data to distinguish between comammox nitrospira that oxidize both ammonium and nitrite and other nitrospira that oxidize only nitrite as the second step in nitrification the high increase of nitrospira in all columns indicates that they could also have been involved in ammonium oxidation especially in the non inoculated columns this is supported by the specific although not quantitative detection of comammox bacteria in the columns compost stimulated n removal although ammonium was formed in barriers with 50 compost this suggests that the reduction of nitrate may occur not only by denitrification but also by dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra in agreement the nrfa involved in dnra increased in abundance with 50 compost reaching 109 copies g 1 wet weight towards the end of the experiment indicating increased genetic potential for dnra an increase in nrfa was observed in all columns over time but still in one to two orders of magnitude lower abundance in the other treatments the reduction of nitrate through dnra requires labile organic matter and dnra activity has previously been shown to be controlled by the amount of labile organic matter with higher c nitrate ratios leading to more nitrate reduction through dnra fazzolari et al 1998 kraft et al 2014 putz et al 2018 van den berg et al 2015 it has also been suggested that dnra activity is mainly important under highly reduced conditions buresh and patrick 1981 but subsequently it was shown that dnra may occur also at much less reduced condition fazzolari et al 1998 silver et al 2001 the reason for dnra to be related to the amount of compost present in our barriers is probably related to the amount of labile organic matter and maybe also to differences in redox conditions since ammonium was formed in the deeper parts of the 50 compost columns 4 3 the impact of inoculation on pollutant removal inoculation impacted the microbial community structure to a lesser extent than barrier material and effects of inoculation on pollutant degradation was mainly detected in the sand nevertheless inoculation showed pronounced effects in case of paracetamol removal both with regards to the time before full removal was achieved fig 8 and for the robustness of the degradation to resist increased flow fig s8 we assume that the effect of inoculation was related exclusively to the introduction of microorganisms rather than a small and transient pulse of organic carbon from the aqueous fraction of the activated sludge recently enhanced paracetamol degradation has been reported for polluted sediments amended with degrader bacterial strains enriched by adaptation at high paracetamol exposure 100 mg kg 1 yang et al 2020 yet not much is known about which organisms are responsible for degrading the different omps at trace concentrations an indicator species analysis on the inoculated vs non inoculated sand samples of day 44 79 showed that it was mainly proteobacteria and bacteroidetes that were specific to the inoculated samples as well as being present in the activated sludge this included two species belonging to pseudomonas pseudomonadales a group known to include paracetamol degraders żur et al 2018 whether these were responsible for the improved paracetamol degradation in inoculated columns is speculative but our data demonstrate that specific bacteria originating from the activated sludge and potentially good pollutant degraders thrive in the barriers the effect of inoculation on transformation of nitrogen species was small when looking at individual n species in the outlet fig 5 however the microbial taxa involved in n transformation processes were affected by inoculation most clearly seen by an increased growth of nitrospira in the non inoculated columns by contrast an increase in archaeal amoa was observed in all columns but those with 50 compost and it was most pronounced in inoculated columns without compost fig s5 the archaeal amoa gene was however not abundant in the inoculum itself so it is not clear why inoculation would have this effect although the benefits of inoculation were limited it did not have any negative effect on the removal efficiency of omps or ammonium therefore such procedure could be used to achieve faster maturation of newly constructed or poorly performing mar systems on the other hand activated sludge might contain pathogens hence application should be done with moderation to avoid transfer of these microbes into aquifers 4 4 outlook mar is an attractive approach for providing clean groundwater due to low maintenance and minimal impact on the environment but are mar technologies effective enough for restoration of drinking water resources and could the introduction of reactive barriers be a step towards achieving this based on our study as well as on the literature it is clear that some compounds are highly recalcitrant in reactive barriers while others are removed only partially and yet others may convert to uncharacterized transformation products the proposed benefit of compost in a reactive barrier for removal of omp in mar systems valhondo et al 2015 2014 or soil remediation kästner and miltner 2016 was relatively minor in our study all this poses potential risks of omps and other pollutants leaching to aquifers even with the inclusion of reactive barriers and the eventual impact of filtration of source water containing omps treated wastewater or surface water through a mar system would depend on site specific characteristics such as soil properties or microbial communities hermes et al 2019 but also on dilution rates in the aquifer this would be the case with or without the inclusion of reactive barriers we showed that the establishment of barriers with compost leads to instant removal of oxygen which means that the microbial degradation of omps below a few cm from the surface will be dependent on anaerobic degradation pathways generally these are less effective at degrading most organic pollutants a possible solution would be extending aerobic conditions and increasing contact of the water with oxygen this can be achieved by cultivating plants on the surface of the mar systems as plant roots can increase diversity of redox conditions in the sediment valhondo et al 2014 another approach could be based on sequential infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration providing more oxic and carbon limited conditions favorable for an enhanced transformation of omps hellauer et al 2018 müller et al 2017 and oxidation of ammonium such technology known as sequential mar technology smart or sequential biofiltration sbf has proven to increase attenuation of some omps as compared to the conventional approach but did not affect the fate of highly recalcitrant pollutants including carbamazepine hellauer et al 2018 to remove such highly recalcitrant omps additional treatments such as ozonation or activated carbon filtration may be needed before infiltration of the treated wastewater although also these methods cannot guarantee removal of all omps müller et al 2019 summers et al 2013 apart from pollutant removal it must also be considered that barriers with compost led to an instant increase in microbial abundance and diversity and induced the development of a different microbial community this may have further implications at mar facilities such as increased risk of clogging or leaching of microorganisms to underlying aquifers 5 conclusions the establishment of barriers with composts or other organic materials at managed aquifer recharge facilities has been suggested as a tool to enhance removal of pollutants especially organic micropollutants when recharging with treated wastewater our experiments with such barriers lead to conclude as follows compost increases microbial abundance and leads to the establishment of a different microbial community but whether establishing reactive barriers with compost is advantageous will depend on the pollutants present in the inlet water and whether adaptation can be expected to occur for example ammonium was removed by complete nitrification in the top of all columns but the conversion rate and pathway of the accumulated nitrate at lower depths depended on the amount of compost compost in barriers creates anaerobic conditions which means degradation below a few cm depth will be dependent on anaerobic pathways for pollutant removal processes requiring labile organic matter and or anoxic conditions a layer of compost is therefore advantageous nitrate and sulfamethoxazole are two such examples where increased amounts of compost increased removal to allow sufficient time for processes requiring aerobic conditions a thicker layer of sand on top of the compost might be needed inoculation of the sand with activated sludge is then an option to speed up maturation as exemplified by the improved
