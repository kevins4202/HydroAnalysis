15455,the generation of chlorinated byproducts during the electrochemical oxidation eo of cl laden wastewater is a significant concern we aim to propose a concept of converting reactive species e g reactive chlorines and ho resulting from electrolysis into 1o2 via the addition of h2o2 which substantially alleviates chlorinated organic formation when phenol was used as a model organic compound the results showed that the h2o2 involving eo system outperformed the h2o2 absent system in terms of higher rate constants 5 95 10 2 min 1 vs 2 97 10 2 min 1 and a much lower accumulation of total organic chlorinated products 1 42 mg l 1 vs 8 18 mg l 1 during a 60 min operation the rate constants of disappearance of a variety of phenolic compounds were positively correlated with the hammett constants σ suggesting that the reactive species preferred oxidizing phenols with electron rich groups after the identification of 1o2 that was abundant in the bulk solution with the use of electron paramagnetic resonance and computational kinetic simulation the routes of 1o2 generation were revealed despite the consensus as to the contribution of reaction between h2o2 and clo to 1o2 formation we conclude that the predominant pathway is through h2o2 reaction with electrogenerated ho or chlorine radicals cl and cl2 to produce o2 followed by self combination density functional theory calculations theoretically showed the difficulty in forming chlorinated byproducts for the 1o2 initiated phenol oxidation in the presence of cl which by contrast easily occurred for the cl or ho initiated phenol reaction the experiments run with real coking wastewater containing high concentration phenols further demonstrated the superiority of the h2o2 involving eo system the findings imply that this unique method for treating cl laden organic wastewater is expected to be widely adopted for generalizing eo technology for environmental applications image graphical abstract keywords

request 1 introduction the electrochemical oxidation eo of organic pollutants in wastewater has received considerable attention in recent years because of its advantages such as high efficiency cleanness flexibility and sustainability thanks to the development of sustainable energy as a power source chaplin 2014 jeon et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 sirés et al 2014 the eo process can proceed via i direct electron transfer to the anode surface chaplin 2014 panizza and cerisola 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 and ii indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species ros e g ho eq 1

electrolysis of water or ions e g cl in the solution respectively the efficiency of surface related eo including direct and indirect ho mediated pathways is highly limited by the mass transfer of pollutants from the bulk to the anode surface or its surroundings díaz et al 2011 fabiańska et al 2014 liu et al 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 it has been reported that rcs including chlorine radicals and free chlorine mediated eo plays a vital role in improving efficiency because the majority of rcs are available in the bulk solution and the bulk chemical process avoids the diffusion of pollutants cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 jasper et al 2016 yang et al 2016 nevertheless this process has an undesirable drawback the formation of chlorinated byproducts that are even more toxic and recalcitrant than the parent molecules are cho and hoffmann 2014 jasper et al 2016 jasper et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yang et al 2016 inhibiting their generation and concurrently boosting eo efficiency are outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed in this study we address these concerns by converting rcs into singlet oxygen 1o2 a reactive electrophile capable of oxidizing a variety of electron rich organic molecules the creation of 1o2 in the cl containing eo system is hypothesized to occur when h2o2 is added to the electrolytic cell leveraging the homogenous reactions between hclo clo and h2o2 eq 6 chen et al 2019 di mascio et al 2019 guo and liu 2020 previous studies have shown that 1o2 enables the selective oxidative degradation of unsaturated organics such as phenols mi et al 2021 yan et al 2021a olefins barrios et al 2021 di mascio et al 2019 and polycyclic aromatic compounds ji et al 2021 yan et al 2021a with the pathways including electrophilic addition or single electron transfer highly depending on the molecular structures of contaminants moreover 1o2 existing in the bulk solution is more resistant to being quenched by cl and natural organic matter than ho barrios et al 2021 duan et al 2020 ji et al 2021 long et al 2022 you et al 2021 1o2 has been demonstrated to show extraordinary oxidative capability for destroying organic pollutants under high salinity conditions lee et al 2009 yi et al 2019 as such the conversion of rcs into 1o2 is expected to suppress the production of chlorinated compounds despite the presence of cl to date to the best of our knowledge few studies have demonstrated the evolution of 1o2 from rcs in an electrochemical system and explored its critical role in attenuating the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts 1 h 2 o h o ads h e 2 c l c l ads e 3 c l c l ads c l 2 e 4 c l 2 h 2 o hclo c l h 5 hclo cl o h 6 cl o h 2 o 2 1 o 2 c l h 2 o in this study phenolic compounds with different substituted groups were selected as the probe substances because phenolic wastewater has a wide range of sources including pharmaceutical synthesis cheng et al 2018 gadipelly et al 2014 pesticide production pliego et al 2012 and plastic manufacturing chen et al 2016 ji et al 2021 which use phenolic compounds as raw materials as well as the coal and petroleum industry which produces phenolic wastes wei et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the aims of the current research are to i demonstrate the uniqueness of the h2o2 involving eo system for treating cl laden wastewater in terms of enhanced oxidation capacity and more importantly remarkable inhibition of chlorinated byproduct formation ii identify the generation of 1o2 in this system and elaborate the role of 1o2 in promoting the destruction of phenolic compounds and iii distinguish the pathways of phenol degradation as a consequence of reactive species conversion into 1o2 to achieve these goals multiple lines of evidence from the experimental and theoretical aspects were provided these include examination of the reaction rates of phenol degradation in different systems determination of total organic chlorine tocl and typical reaction intermediates evaluation of the toxicity of the eo treated solution with bioluminescent bacteria recognition of reactive species by electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests and kinetic modeling study and density functional theory dft calculations of the energy barrier of chlorinated byproduct formation in addition eo treatments with coking wastewater

diffusion coefficients of phenolic compounds were analyzed according to the procedures described previously liu et al 2019 as shown in text s6 the steady state concentrations of the reactive species

elementary reactions table s3 and the detailed calculation methods are elaborated in text s7 the acute toxicity of the solution before and after different eo treatments was evaluated using a luminescent bacteria assay with photobacterium phosphoreum song et al 2009 yang et al 2021 which was supplied by nanjing cas kuake technology co ltd china the luminescence intensity of the bacteria

enhanced electrooxidation of phenols with inhibited toxic byproduct formation by h2o2 addition to distinguish the oxidative capacity of different oxidation systems phenol was selected as a model compound and its disappearance as a function of time was examined and compared fig 1 a only 12 6 of phenol was removed after a 60 min operation when the eo treatment of phenol was processed in cl free na2so4 electrolyte this is likely due to mass transfer limitation as phenol oxidation under such a case generally proceeds via either direct electron transfer or ho mediation for the former pathway the reaction primarily occurs in the vicinities of the anode fan et al 2019 for the latter pathway ho normally reacts with phenol at near diffusion controlled rates in electrochemical systems liu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 when the electrolyte contains cl the conversion proportion significantly rose to 87 4 within 60 min which means a rcs dominated mechanism for this oxidation reaction rcs like cl and free chlorines have a longer lifetime than ho alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 li et al 2018 piskarev 2021 sheps et al 2005 allowing the oxidation of phenol to occur in the bulk solution meanwhile chlorine radicals are selective oxidants and react rapidly with phenolic compounds k cl 109 1010 m 1 s 1 which exceed the rate constants of ho initiated reactions by 1 orders of magnitude zhang and parker 2018 lei et al 2019 the addition of h2o2 to the solution further improved the reaction as the removal efficiency approached 96 1 note that the chemical reaction of h2o2 same dose as the eo case and phenol yielded a very low conversion a proportion of 1 7 after 60 min implying the h2o2 stimulated production of a more oxidative species the disappearance kinetics during all eo treatments were found to be a good fit with the first order law fig s1 the reaction rate constant increased from 2 97 10 2 without h2o2 to 5 95 10 2 min 1 with h2o2 fig s2 shows the variations in ph as a function of reaction time in different systems which reflect the reactions generating h or oh in the electrochemical reactors a slight decrease in ph was observable in the cl free system possibly attributed to more amounts of h released from the anodic water and phenol oxidation relative to oh released from the cathodic water reduction for the system in the presence of cl the chlorine evolution reactions not creating h should dominate at the anode and the continuous production of oh at the cathode was thus responsible for the ph rise the addition of h2o2 to the cl containing eo system provoked the decrease in ph to some extent because the reactions between h2o2 and rcs should cause the liberation of h such reactions will be discussed later more importantly the addition of h2o2 can substantially abate the release of chlorinated intermediates which is a common problem for the rcs promoted oxidation of organic matter figs 1b and 1c illustrate that certain amounts of monochlorophenols i e 2 cp and 4 cp and dichlorophenols i e 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dcp were accumulated in the cl containing eo system whereas limited amounts were detected in the same reactor with h2o2 for example the maximum yields of 2 cp and 4 cp in the cl containing eo system were 0 14 and 0 21 mm respectively while these values in the h2o2 involving eo system significantly decreased 10 24 μm 2 cp and 62 44 μm 4 cp the peak concentrations of 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dcp also substantially declined from 23 91 to 1 87 μm and from 14 04 to 0 89 μm respectively for the rcs dominated case the concentrations of cps reached the peak values at a time 20 min earlier than that 40 min of dcps indicating that the chlorination reaction of phenol proceeds via the pathway involving the step by step addition of cl to the benzene ring the levels of dcps were much lower than those of cps because the cl atom withdraws electrons from the benzene ring making the subsequent chlorination reaction difficult to occur li et al 2019a li et al 2019b as such no trichlorophenols were detected throughout the study fig 1d shows that the yield of total chlorophenols rose until the breakpoint after which they descended with the prolonged electrolysis time for the rcs initiated eo process with the duration from 0 to 20 min being dominated by phenol conversion and the duration from 20 to 60 min corresponding to chlorophenol degradation this implies that minimizing the amount of these chlorinated phenols requires the extension of the electrolysis time necessary to avoid increased toxicity during eo treatment of cl containing wastewater jasper et al 2017 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however the time dependent accumulation of total chlorophenols can be mitigated distinctly with the introduction of h2o2 additionally the extent of phenol mineralization was evaluated based on the change in toc the time course toc concentration is presented in fig s3 the presence of h2o2 facilitated the mineralization of phenol as 9 22 mg l 1 toc was removed after 60 min compared with the value of 5 27 mg l 1 associated with the absence of h2o2 the mce also increased from 20 7 to 34 0 because the time dependent mineralization of phenol should cause the appearance of various chlorinated organic products that are difficult to quantify the amounts of tocl generated throughout the electrolysis process were also quantified it can be seen from fig 2 a that tocl accumulated rapidly and eventually reached the concentration of 8 18 mg l 1 over a 60 min operation when the eo was performed in the cl containing electrolyte the addition of h2o2 resulted in the limited accumulation of chlorinated products as only 1 42 mg l 1 tocl was detected after the same period which was only 17 4 of that in the eo system without h2o2 these observations confirm the superiority of the h2o2 involving eo system over the h2o2 absent eo system with respect to the remarkably less production of toxic intermediates as the tocl concentrations were found to be positively correlated with the toxicity of the water samples the acute toxicity of the oxidation intermediates and products was assessed through the biotoxicity assay with bioluminescent bacteria photobacterium phosphoreum song et al 2009 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 fig 2b illustrates that the eo treatment in the presence of cl significantly increased the toxicity of the solution in photobacterium when the operation time was increased to 20 min afterwards there was a decrease in the inhibition percentage suggesting that the extended electrolysis time could result in the opening of benzene rings and the formation of small molecule chlorinated products with less bacterial inhibition wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 of particular note is the gradual decrease in the inhibition ratio with the increase in time when h2o2 was supplemented this observation clearly indicates a significantly suppressed toxicity because of the less chlorinated byproducts produced which benefits from h2o2 adjustment moreover a variety of phenolic compounds i e phenols with different para substituent groups were selected for eo treatments during which the impact of h2o2 addition on the rate and extent of their degradation was examined as shown in fig s4 and 3a the presence of h2o2 amplified the removal rate of most phenols except for p nitrophenol these observations imply that phenolic compounds with electron rich groups are more prone to being destroyed in the h2o2 involving eo system than those with electron efficient groups the rate constants of disappearance of phenolic compounds were found to follow the order kp oh kp och3 kp ch3 kp h kp no 2 for all the investigated phenols the h2o2 involving eo system substantially reduced the concentrations of tocl produced fig 3 b suggesting that it has a certain universality in inhibiting the generation of organochlorine byproducts to discriminate whether the surface bound reactive species or the bulk reactive species were predominant for the oxidation of phenols the first order rate constants k were correlated with the hammett constant σ of the p substituted groups and the diffusion coefficient d of phenols to the electrode fabiańska et al 2014 liu et al 2019 no correlation between k and d was observed indicating that the degradation of phenols in the h2o2 involving eo system was not diffusion controlled fig 3c this observation was contrary to that reported in a previous study concerning similar eo treatments of phenols but with tio2 anodes which claimed that a surface bound ho mediated reaction was the dominant mechanism liu et al 2019 on the other hand an apparent linear relationship between k and σ was displayed fig 3d meaning that the feature of the substituent groups was the key to the degradation rate the lower value of σ corresponding to the increased degrees of electron donating capability led to an increase in the reaction rate all the findings are suggestive of the presence of more selective oxidants that are inclined to react with organics containing electron rich groups 3 2 identification of key reactive species to identify the predominant reactive species responsible for phenol oxidation and transformation in different treatments multiple lines of evidence from epr tests and scavenging experiments were provided as shown in fig 4 a the typical 1 2 2 1 quartet dmpo ho signal was recorded in the epr spectrum of the eo system in na2so4 electrolyte suggesting that the production of ho resulted from water electrolysis at the anode panizza and cerisola 2009 zheng et al 2020 an additional triplet signal was seen in the cl containing electrolyte which was ascribed to the dmpo cl adduct originating from the in situ reaction of cl and dmpo shen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 this implies the anodic oxidation of aqueous cl to cl which accompanies the generation of ho from the anodic oxidation of water an interesting note was that the dmpo signals belonging to ho and cl disappeared when h2o2 was added to the eo system the epr tests using temp as a spin trapping agent revealed the presence of a typical three line characteristic signal an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 that was assigned to 1o2 fig 4b this signal was exclusively observed in the h2o2 involving eo system it can therefore be deduced from these observations that radical species such as ho and cl were successfully converted into non radical species such as 1o2 quenching experiments were also carried out to envisage the possible active species contributing to the removal of phenols in the h2o2 involving eo system to exclude the contribution of direct anodic oxidation to phenol removal in this system a reference experiment was conducted using dmso as a scavenger that was supposed to quench all the surface bound radicals e g cl ads and ho ads sun et al 2019 they are precursors of other reactive species such that the availability of excess dmso can extinguish all the indirect oxidation processes radjenovic et al 2015 yang et al 2022 fig s8 presents that the proportion of phenol transformation in the presence of dmso was less than 3 0 after 60 min indicating that the direct oxidation has a trivial role on phenol removal moreover various quenching agents including nb for ho scavenging zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 tba for ho and cl scavenging yan et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 bq for o2 scavenging ji et al 2021 yi et al 2019 and ffa for 1o2 scavenging hu et al 2017 ji et al 2021 mi et al 2021 were selected for the examinations as shown in fig 4c a slight decrease 7 5 after a 60 min operation in the proportion of phenol disappearance was observed in the presence of nb suggesting that a ho involving reaction is not the dominant pathway for phenol destruction tba can react rapidly with ho and cl which suppressed the percentage of phenol removal by 35 4 this indicates that cl may also be engaged in oxidizing phenol another possible explanation was that both ho and cl are predecessor species for the generation of 1o2 this point will be elaborated later the addition of bq led to a decrease in the proportion of phenol removal by 33 2 indicating that ho2 o2 might also play a vital role in destroying phenol note that a more pronounced quenching effect decreased by 75 1 was observed with the addition of ffa consolidating that 1o2 is the main contributor to the removal of phenol 3 3 proposed mechanism for 1o2 generation the above results corroborate that the introduction of h2o2 can effectively regulate the types of active species resulting in the generation of 1o2 the commonly accepted pathway for 1o2 production is the homogeneous reaction between clo and h2o2 which has been documented in healthcare reports chen et al 2019 di mascio et al 2019 in our scenario the electrolysis of cl led to the generation of cl which was further combined with cl resulting in the formation of free chlorines including cl2 hclo and clo according to eqs 1 5 clo should be the major chlorine species as the whole reactions were run at ph 7 fig 5 a shows that negligible free chlorines were detected in the h2o2 involving eo system contrarily their concentrations in the cl containing reactor increased progressively with the prolonged time also the supplement of h2o2 at 30 min induced an immediate decline in the concentrations of free chlorines fig 5b indicates that the concentration of h2o2 gradually decreased in the eo systems with a much higher level of h2o2 reduction being discovered in the cl containing eo system than in the cl free eo system the abovementioned result implies the participation of h2o2 and clo in 1o2 production nevertheless we propose that the pathway via recombination of ho2 o2 cannot be excluded from the mechanisms governing the formation of 1o2 in the h2o2 involving eo system indeed the oxidation of h2o2 by ho and chlorine radicals is thermodynamically favorable because of their higher redox potentials e ho 2 7 v vs nhe e cl 2 5 vs nhe and e cl 2 2 2 vs nhe than e o 2 h 2 o 1 66 v vs nhe lei et al 2019 sawyer et al 1981 zhang et al 2018 in addition the proposal of such a pathway is based on the fast reactions between h2o2 and ho k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 and those between h2o2 and chlorine radicals k h2o2 cl 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 k h 2 o 2 cl 2 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 which ensure radical transformation from electrogenerated ho cl cl2 to ho2 o2 eqs 7 10 cheng et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 previous studies concerning non radical based advanced oxidation have shown that ho2 o2 is the key intermediate to 1o2 generation concluding that the radical radical reactions of ho2 o2 recombination are responsible for the evolution of 1o2 eqs 11 13 ji et al 2021 yang et al 2019b yi et al 2019 additional epr tests were performed to confirm the presence of o2 as a consequence of h2o2 addition and the possibility of o2 contribution to 1o2 evolution fig 5c presents the epr results obtained from different eo systems when the high concentration methanol the volume ratio of methanol to water was set as 1 1 was used as the electrolyte note that this experiment was performed based on the fact that methanol is a low polar solvent that can improve the reaction activity of ho2 o2 with dmpo bai et al 2022 because of the quenching of ho cl cl2 by methanol no signals related to them were displayed in the eo systems with and without cl however the addition of h2o2 yielded the appearance of typical characteristic signals of dmpo ooh adducts assigned to o2 the visibility of o2 signals was attributed to the competitive reaction between h2o2 and ho cl cl2 and the resistance of o2 reaction with methanol bq was frequently used as a quencher for o2 and its presence markedly weakened the signal of the dmpo ooh adducts it is apparent that the addition of bq can eventually reduce temp related 1o2 signals fig 5d confirming the role of o2 in mediating the formation of 1o2 7 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 8 cl h 2 o 2 ho 2 cl h 9 cl 2 h 2 o 2 ho 2 2 cl h 10 ho 2 o 2 h 11 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 12 ho 2 o 2 ho 2 1 o 2 13 2 o 2 2 h 2 o ho 2 1 o 2 2 oh in this regard a computational kinetic model was used to understand the role of h2o2 on the transformation mechanism of reactive species the steady state concentrations of the reactive species ho cl cl2 and 1o2 produced from different eo systems were simulated by kintecus a software package designed to solve ordinary differential equations in line with the method described in the literature cheng et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 57 elementary reactions were used to establish the kinetic model in the h2o2 involving eo system the steady state concentration ho ss cl ss cl2 ss and 1o2 ss were calculated to be 7 30 10 16 1 45 10 16 1 40 10 14 and 1 98 10 12 m respectively fig 5e compared with their steady state concentrations in the eo system without h2o2 fig s9 a conclusion was drawn that h2o2 suppressed the accumulation of ho cl and cl2 and triggered 1o2 generation which was in good agreement with the epr results an interesting note from fig 5f is that the values of 1o2 ss remarkably declined if the ho2 o2 self combination reactions were excluded from the model simulation by contrast the exclusion of h2o2 and clo reaction slightly affected the yields of 1o2 ss this consolidates that the self combination of ho2 o2 that was resulted from h2o2 reaction with ho cl and cl2 instead of h2o2 reaction with clo is the major mechanism responsible for 1o2 production 3 4 proposed pathways of phenol degradation during eo treatments the intermediates during eo treatments with and without the involvement of h2o2 were qualitatively detected using hrms which aided in proposing the pathways of phenol degradation fig 6 the formulas and structures of the intermediate products are illustrated in table s4 during the cl involving electrolysis the ho and cl initiated oxidation resulted in the generation of monochlorophenol dichlorophenol hydroquinone and chlorohydroquinone corresponding to the ms signals at m z 128 m z 162 m z 110 and m z 144 respectively figs s10 s13 according to chen et al the ho attacked destruction of phenol proceeds with the first step of radical addition path i causing radical adduct formation chen et al 2020 through this pathway phenol was oxidized to catechol which has two isomers resorcinol and hydroquinone further radical cl addition reaction yielded the formation of chlorohydroquinone alternatively phenol with electron rich moieties was vulnerable to attack by cl path ii alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 producing monochlorophenol that was subsequently converted to chlorohydroquinone and dichlorophenol under the action of ho and cl respectively in addition to the ring containing intermediates a number of ring opened and chlorinated products including those at m z 232 m z 184 m z 182 m z 150 m z 138 and m z 110 could be detected figs s14 s18 they emerged from the ring cleavage by further cl attack the determination of these chlorinated products clearly confirms the unavoidable formation of toxic intermediates during eo treatment of organic pollutants in the presence of cl on the other hand once h2o2 was added to the electrolyte although a small amount of chlorophenols were also produced figs s19 21 fewer types of chlorinated intermediates were formed table s4 moreover benzoquinone maleic acid fumaric acid and oxalic acid whose peaks were at m z 108 m z 116 m z 116 and m z 90 respectively were exclusively detected in the h2o2 involving eo system fig s22 it has been reported that phenol reacts with 1o2 preferably via the cycloaddition pathway path iii al nu airat et al 2019 barrios et al 2021 li et al 2019a this affords the production of benzoquinone resulting from the replacement of hydrogen with the ketone group on the benzene ring structure the ring opening of benzoquinone by further 1o2 attack led to the generation of small molecule acids e g maleic acid fumaric acid oxalic acid and acetic acid that are less toxic than the chlorinated compounds are 3 5 interpretation of 1o2 enhanced phenol oxidation with substantial inhibition of chlorinated product formation the pollutant decay experiments clearly indicated that the electrogenerated cl initiated phenol oxidation exhibited much higher rates than did the electrogenerated ho mediated reaction the rates of disappearance of most phenols were further improved with the aid of 1o2 previous studies have shown that the electrogenerated ho as a result of water electrolysis is mainly adsorbed on the anode surface díaz et al 2011 liu et al 2019 panizza and cerisola 2009 because the lifetime of ho is only 0 15 μs and its distance in the aqueous solution is less than 2 mm li et al 2018 piskarev 2021 the chlorine radicals stemming from cl electrolysis are mostly present in the bulk solution cho et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 so that the free cl outperforms surface bound ho because of the avoidance of diffusion limitation in comparison to ho 1o2 is also mainly available in the solution and has a longer lifetime barrios et al 2021 the close contact between 1o2 and the pollutants was therefore beneficial to reactant accessibility explaining the observed high degradation performance to interpret the difference in the chlorinated intermediates observed in this study the dft calculations were used to theoretically predict the ease of chlorinated byproduct formation by considering three scenarios i cl reaction with phenol ii ho reaction with phenol in the presence of cl and iii 1o2 reaction with phenol in the presence of cl fig 7 illustrates the energy profiles of the intermediates and the barrier heights of all transition states in the computational model for i cl attacks phenol via the addition pathway lei et al 2019 and the calculation results indicate that the energy barrier of this process is only 14 9 kcal mol 1 when phenol is transformed to p chlorophenol this means that the formation of the chlorinated product can occur rapidly for ii the reaction of ho with phenol to produce pho through the hydrogen atom abstraction pathway is considered for the calculations of the possibility of chlorinated product formation chen et al 2020 pho can further react with ho by electron transfer followed by combination with h to generate phoh a subsequent combination with cl would generate p chlorophenol the energy barrier of the ho mediated chlorination process is 20 9 kcal mol 1 indicating that the above process can also take place at room temperature with relatively fast kinetics for iii the oxidation of phenol by 1o2 is supposed to occur through the cycloaddition reaction pathway al nu airat et al 2019 al nu airat et al 2020 the unstable 1 4 peroxide int 2 would be generated and stabilized to int 3 two consecutive proton transfer processes then occur inducing the generation of int 5 which is converted to p benzoquinone with the water elimination step an energy barrier of 32 2 kcal mol 1 is required for such a conversion additionally the combination of intermediate products with cl to generate chlorinated products is considered it should be noted that only int 5 may participate in the reaction with cl to form 2 chloro p benzoquinone via the substitution and water elimination steps the calculated energy barrier for the reaction is 69 1 kcal mol 1 much higher than the reaction without the inclusion of cl these results provide compelling evidence that 1o2 initiated phenol oxidation in the presence of cl is less inclined to engage in the formation of chlorinated products compared with ho and cl promoted phenol oxidation 3 6 feasibility of the 1o2 initiated system for promoting phenol oxidation in coking wastewater the practical feasibility of our strategy to accelerate phenol oxidation and prevent toxic chlorinated product formation was further verified in a more realistic situation coking wastewater containing high concentration phenolic pollutants and having high toxicity was used and it was subjected to eo treatments with and without the addition of h2o2 table 1 no external cl was added to the solution because of its inherent availability in raw coal and thus in wastewater table s2 summarizes the abatement of volatile phenols major organics in the coking wastewater as well as cod upon different eo treatments the 16 h eo operation allowed a reduction in the content of volatile phenols from 894 5 to 339 2 mg l 1 and cod from 6440 6 to 4810 3 mg l 1 resulting in approximately 62 1 and 25 4 removal efficiency respectively there was a remarkable enhancement effect owing to h2o2 addition the h2o2 involving system led to much higher removal efficiencies of volatile phenols 93 3 and cod 35 4 the difference in the extent of organic decomposing was also reflected by the 3d fluorescence spectra 3d eems data figs s23 and s24 the introduction of h2o2 caused a significant elimination in the relevant fluorescence peaks with the increase in electrolysis time as well as a more pronounced extent of decreased signals compared with the case in the absence of h2o2 toxicity assessments were also performed with the initial and treated coking wastewater the observed decrease in the acute toxicity was higher for the use of h2o2 with the luminescence ir being reduced by 67 4 electrolysis without involvement of h2o2 yielded only a 14 4 reduction in luminescence inhibition all results confirm that the proposed eo strategy is effective in decomposing phenolic organics and attenuating the toxicity of wastewater this finding implies that the eo technology developed in the current study is important for alleviating the biotoxicity of coking wastewater making it a promising pretreatment step for traditional biological methods conclusions minimizing the generation of toxic byproducts upon treatment of cl laden wastewater is one of the significant challenges that must be addressed before eo technology can be widely adopted for application in wastewater treatment this study proposes and validates the concept of reactive species conversion into 1o2 via the addition of h2o2 which stimulates phenol oxidation and circumvents the problem of chlorinated byproduct formation comparisons of disappearance kinetics for a variety of phenolic compounds between the h2o2 absent and h2o2 involving eo systems clearly demonstrated that the latter enabled higher reaction rates particularly for phenols with electron donating substitutes and significantly suppressed the production of chlorinated organics and thus the acute toxicity of the solution the epr experiments and computational kinetic model evidenced the abundance of 1o2 in the bulk solution in the h2o2 involving electrochemical reactor it is revealed that 1o2 was produced mainly via h2o2 reaction with electrogenerated ho and cl to create o2 followed by its self combination to form 1o2 the dft calculations supported the susceptible emergence of chlorinated products as a consequence of cl or ho initiated phenol oxidation however their appearance resulting from phenol reaction with 1o2 in the presence of cl hardly happens as predicted by the relatively higher energy barrier that needs to be surpassed tests with the real coking wastewater confirmed the benefits of the 1o2 based eo system for the destruction of phenolic compounds which facilitated pollutant removal and alleviated the side effects of chlorinated organic formation the current work should pave a new avenue for effective and on site 1o2 generation from an electrochemical perspective and the findings would enrich the theory of 1o2 engaged advanced oxidation technology declaration

15455,the generation of chlorinated byproducts during the electrochemical oxidation eo of cl laden wastewater is a significant concern we aim to propose a concept of converting reactive species e g reactive chlorines and ho resulting from electrolysis into 1o2 via the addition of h2o2 which substantially alleviates chlorinated organic formation when phenol was used as a model organic compound the results showed that the h2o2 involving eo system outperformed the h2o2 absent system in terms of higher rate constants 5 95 10 2 min 1 vs 2 97 10 2 min 1 and a much lower accumulation of total organic chlorinated products 1 42 mg l 1 vs 8 18 mg l 1 during a 60 min operation the rate constants of disappearance of a variety of phenolic compounds were positively correlated with the hammett constants σ suggesting that the reactive species preferred oxidizing phenols with electron rich groups after the identification of 1o2 that was abundant in the bulk solution with the use of electron paramagnetic resonance and computational kinetic simulation the routes of 1o2 generation were revealed despite the consensus as to the contribution of reaction between h2o2 and clo to 1o2 formation we conclude that the predominant pathway is through h2o2 reaction with electrogenerated ho or chlorine radicals cl and cl2 to produce o2 followed by self combination density functional theory calculations theoretically showed the difficulty in forming chlorinated byproducts for the 1o2 initiated phenol oxidation in the presence of cl which by contrast easily occurred for the cl or ho initiated phenol reaction the experiments run with real coking wastewater containing high concentration phenols further demonstrated the superiority of the h2o2 involving eo system the findings imply that this unique method for treating cl laden organic wastewater is expected to be widely adopted for generalizing eo technology for environmental applications image graphical abstract keywords

electrolysis of water or ions e g cl in the solution respectively the efficiency of surface related eo including direct and indirect ho mediated pathways is highly limited by the mass transfer of pollutants from the bulk to the anode surface or its surroundings díaz et al 2011 fabiańska et al 2014 liu et al 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 it has been reported that rcs including chlorine radicals and free chlorine mediated eo plays a vital role in improving efficiency because the majority of rcs are available in the bulk solution and the bulk chemical process avoids the diffusion of pollutants cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 jasper et al 2016 yang et al 2016 nevertheless this process has an undesirable drawback the formation of chlorinated byproducts that are even more toxic and recalcitrant than the parent molecules are cho and hoffmann 2014 jasper et al 2016 jasper et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yang et al 2016 inhibiting their generation and concurrently boosting eo efficiency are outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed in this study we address these concerns by converting rcs into singlet oxygen 1o2 a reactive electrophile capable of oxidizing a variety of electron rich organic molecules the creation of 1o2 in the cl containing eo system is hypothesized to occur when h2o2 is added to the electrolytic cell leveraging the homogenous reactions between hclo clo and h2o2 eq 6 chen et al 2019 di mascio et al 2019 guo and liu 2020 previous studies have shown that 1o2 enables the selective oxidative degradation of unsaturated organics such as phenols mi et al 2021 yan et al 2021a olefins barrios et al 2021 di mascio et al 2019 and polycyclic aromatic compounds ji et al 2021 yan et al 2021a with the pathways including electrophilic addition or single electron transfer highly depending on the molecular structures of contaminants moreover 1o2 existing in the bulk solution is more resistant to being quenched by cl and natural organic matter than ho barrios et al 2021 duan et al 2020 ji et al 2021 long et al 2022 you et al 2021 1o2 has been demonstrated to show extraordinary oxidative capability for destroying organic pollutants under high salinity conditions lee et al 2009 yi et al 2019 as such the conversion of rcs into 1o2 is expected to suppress the production of chlorinated compounds despite the presence of cl to date to the best of our knowledge few studies have demonstrated the evolution of 1o2 from rcs in an electrochemical system and explored its critical role in attenuating the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts 1 h 2 o h o ads h e 2 c l c l ads e 3 c l c l ads c l 2 e 4 c l 2 h 2 o hclo c l h 5 hclo cl o h 6 cl o h 2 o 2 1 o 2 c l h 2 o in this study

of 1o2 in promoting the destruction of phenolic compounds and iii distinguish the pathways of phenol degradation as a consequence of reactive species conversion into 1o2 to achieve these goals multiple lines of evidence from the experimental and theoretical aspects were provided these include examination of the reaction rates of phenol degradation in different systems determination of total

elementary reactions table s3 and the detailed calculation methods are elaborated in text s7 the acute toxicity of the solution before and after different eo treatments was evaluated using a

enhanced electrooxidation of phenols with inhibited toxic byproduct formation by h2o2 addition to distinguish the oxidative capacity of different oxidation systems phenol was selected as a model compound and its disappearance as a function of time was examined and compared fig 1 a only 12 6 of phenol was removed after a 60 min operation when the eo treatment of phenol was processed in cl free na2so4 electrolyte this is likely due to mass transfer limitation as phenol oxidation under such a case generally proceeds via either direct electron transfer or ho mediation for the former pathway the reaction primarily occurs in the vicinities of the anode fan et al 2019 for the latter pathway ho normally reacts with phenol at near diffusion controlled rates in electrochemical systems liu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 when the electrolyte contains cl the conversion proportion significantly rose to 87 4 within 60 min which means a rcs dominated mechanism for this oxidation reaction rcs like cl and free chlorines have a longer lifetime than ho alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 li et al 2018 piskarev 2021 sheps et al 2005 allowing the oxidation of phenol to occur in the bulk solution meanwhile chlorine radicals are selective oxidants and react rapidly with phenolic compounds k cl 109 1010 m 1 s 1 which exceed the rate constants of ho initiated reactions by 1 orders of magnitude zhang and parker 2018 lei et al 2019 the addition of h2o2 to the solution further improved the reaction as the removal efficiency approached 96 1 note that the chemical reaction of h2o2 same dose as the eo case and phenol yielded a very low conversion a proportion of 1 7 after 60 min implying the h2o2 stimulated production of a more oxidative species the disappearance kinetics during all eo treatments were found to be a good fit with the first order law fig s1 the reaction rate constant increased from 2 97 10 2 without h2o2 to 5 95 10 2 min 1 with h2o2 fig s2 shows the variations in ph as a function of reaction time in different systems which reflect the reactions generating h or oh in the electrochemical reactors a slight decrease in ph was observable in the cl free system possibly attributed to more amounts of h released from the anodic water and phenol oxidation relative to oh released from the cathodic water reduction for the system in the presence of cl the chlorine evolution reactions not creating h should dominate at the anode and the continuous production of oh at the cathode was thus responsible for the ph rise the addition of h2o2 to the cl containing eo system provoked the decrease in ph to some extent because the reactions between h2o2 and rcs should cause the liberation of h such reactions will be discussed later more importantly the addition of h2o2 can substantially abate the release of chlorinated intermediates which is a common problem for the rcs promoted oxidation of organic matter figs 1b and 1c illustrate that certain amounts of monochlorophenols i e 2 cp and 4 cp and dichlorophenols i e 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dcp were accumulated in the cl containing eo system whereas limited amounts were detected in the same reactor with h2o2 for example the maximum yields of 2 cp and 4 cp in the cl containing eo system were 0 14 and 0 21 mm respectively while these values in the h2o2 involving eo system significantly decreased 10 24 μm 2 cp and 62 44 μm 4 cp the peak concentrations of 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dcp also substantially declined from 23 91 to 1 87 μm and from 14 04 to 0 89 μm respectively for the rcs dominated case the concentrations of cps reached the peak values at a time 20 min earlier than that 40 min of dcps indicating that the chlorination reaction of phenol proceeds via the pathway involving the step by step addition of cl to the benzene ring the levels of dcps were much lower than those of cps because the cl atom withdraws electrons from the benzene ring making the subsequent chlorination reaction difficult to occur li et al 2019a li et al 2019b as such no trichlorophenols were detected throughout the study fig 1d shows that the yield of total chlorophenols rose until the breakpoint after which they descended with the prolonged electrolysis time for the rcs initiated eo process with the duration from 0 to 20 min being dominated by phenol conversion and the duration from 20 to 60 min corresponding to chlorophenol degradation this implies that minimizing the amount of these chlorinated phenols requires the extension of the electrolysis time necessary to avoid increased toxicity during eo treatment of cl containing wastewater jasper et al 2017 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however the time dependent accumulation of total chlorophenols can be mitigated distinctly with the introduction of h2o2 additionally the extent of phenol mineralization was evaluated based on the change in toc the time course toc concentration is presented in fig s3 the presence of h2o2 facilitated the mineralization of phenol as 9 22 mg l 1 toc was removed after 60 min compared with the value of 5 27 mg l 1 associated with the absence of h2o2 the mce also increased from 20 7 to 34 0 because the time dependent mineralization of phenol should cause the appearance of various chlorinated organic products that are difficult to quantify the amounts of tocl generated throughout the electrolysis process were also quantified it can be seen from fig 2 a that tocl accumulated rapidly and eventually reached the concentration of 8 18 mg l 1 over a 60 min operation when the eo was performed in the cl containing electrolyte the addition of h2o2 resulted in the limited accumulation of chlorinated products as only 1 42 mg l 1 tocl was detected after the same period which was only 17 4 of that in the eo system without h2o2 these observations confirm the superiority of the h2o2 involving eo system over the h2o2 absent eo system with respect to the remarkably less production of toxic intermediates as the tocl concentrations were found to be positively correlated with the toxicity of the water samples the acute toxicity of the oxidation intermediates and products was assessed through the biotoxicity assay with bioluminescent bacteria photobacterium phosphoreum song et al 2009 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 fig 2b illustrates that the eo treatment in the presence of cl significantly increased the toxicity of the solution in photobacterium when the operation time was increased to 20 min afterwards there was a decrease in the inhibition percentage suggesting that the extended electrolysis time could result in the opening of benzene rings and the formation of small molecule chlorinated products with less bacterial inhibition wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 of particular note is the gradual decrease in the inhibition ratio with the increase in time when h2o2 was supplemented this observation clearly indicates a significantly suppressed toxicity because of the less chlorinated byproducts produced which benefits from h2o2 adjustment moreover a variety of phenolic compounds i e phenols with different para substituent groups were selected for eo treatments during which the impact of h2o2 addition on the rate and extent of their degradation was examined as shown in fig s4 and 3a the presence of h2o2 amplified the removal rate of most phenols except for p nitrophenol these observations imply that phenolic compounds with electron rich groups are more prone to being destroyed in the h2o2 involving eo system than those with electron efficient groups the rate constants of disappearance of phenolic compounds were found to follow the order kp oh kp och3 kp ch3 kp h kp no 2 for all the investigated phenols the h2o2 involving eo system substantially reduced the concentrations of tocl produced fig 3 b suggesting that it has a certain universality in inhibiting the generation of organochlorine byproducts to discriminate whether the surface bound reactive species or the bulk reactive species were predominant for the oxidation of phenols the first order rate constants k were correlated with the hammett constant σ of the p substituted groups and the diffusion coefficient d of phenols to the electrode fabiańska et al 2014 liu et al 2019 no correlation between k and d was observed indicating that the degradation of phenols in the h2o2 involving eo system was not diffusion controlled fig 3c this observation was contrary to that reported in a previous study concerning similar eo treatments of phenols but with tio2 anodes which claimed that a surface bound ho mediated reaction was the dominant mechanism liu et al 2019 on the other hand an apparent linear relationship between k and σ was displayed fig 3d meaning that the feature of the substituent groups was the key to the degradation rate the lower value of σ corresponding to the increased degrees of electron donating capability led to an increase in the reaction rate all the findings are suggestive of the presence of more selective oxidants that are inclined to react with organics containing electron rich groups 3 2 identification of key reactive species to identify the predominant reactive species responsible for phenol oxidation and transformation in different treatments multiple lines of evidence from epr tests and scavenging experiments were provided as shown in fig 4 a the typical 1 2 2 1 quartet dmpo ho signal was recorded in the epr spectrum of the eo system in na2so4 electrolyte suggesting that the production of ho resulted from water electrolysis at the anode panizza and cerisola 2009 zheng et al 2020 an additional triplet signal was seen in the cl containing electrolyte which was ascribed to the dmpo cl adduct originating from the in situ reaction of cl and dmpo shen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 this implies the anodic oxidation of aqueous cl to cl which accompanies the generation of ho from the anodic oxidation of water an interesting note was that the dmpo signals belonging to ho and cl disappeared when h2o2 was added to the eo system the epr tests using temp as a spin trapping agent revealed the presence of a typical three line characteristic signal an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 that was assigned to 1o2 fig 4b this signal was exclusively observed in the h2o2 involving eo system it can therefore be deduced from these observations that radical species such as ho and cl were successfully converted into non radical species such as 1o2 quenching experiments were also carried out to envisage the possible active species contributing to the removal of phenols in the h2o2 involving eo system to exclude the contribution of direct anodic oxidation to phenol removal in this system a reference experiment was conducted using dmso as a scavenger that was supposed to quench all the surface bound radicals e g cl ads and ho ads sun et al 2019 they are precursors of other reactive species such that the availability of excess dmso can extinguish all the indirect oxidation processes radjenovic et al 2015 yang et al 2022 fig s8 presents that the proportion of phenol transformation in the presence of dmso was less than 3 0 after 60 min indicating that the direct oxidation has a trivial role on phenol removal moreover various quenching agents including nb for ho scavenging zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 tba for ho and cl scavenging yan et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 bq for o2 scavenging ji et al 2021 yi et al 2019 and ffa for 1o2 scavenging hu et al 2017 ji et al 2021 mi et al 2021 were selected for the examinations as shown in fig 4c a slight decrease 7 5 after a 60 min operation in the proportion of phenol disappearance was observed in the presence of nb suggesting that a ho involving reaction is not the dominant pathway for phenol destruction tba can react rapidly with ho and cl which suppressed the percentage of phenol removal by 35 4 this indicates that cl may also be engaged in oxidizing phenol another possible explanation was that both ho and cl are predecessor species for the generation of 1o2 this point will be elaborated later the addition of bq led to a decrease in the proportion of phenol removal by 33 2 indicating that ho2 o2 might also play a vital role in destroying phenol note that a more pronounced quenching effect decreased by 75 1 was observed with the addition of ffa consolidating that 1o2 is the main contributor to the removal of phenol 3 3 proposed mechanism for 1o2 generation the above results corroborate that the introduction of h2o2 can effectively regulate the types of active species resulting in the generation of 1o2 the commonly accepted pathway for 1o2 production is the homogeneous reaction between clo and h2o2 which has been documented in healthcare reports chen et al 2019 di mascio et al 2019 in our scenario the electrolysis of cl led to the generation of cl which was further combined with cl resulting in the formation of free chlorines including cl2 hclo and clo according to eqs 1 5 clo should be the major chlorine species as the whole reactions were run at ph 7 fig 5 a shows that negligible free chlorines were detected in the h2o2 involving eo system contrarily their concentrations in the cl containing reactor increased progressively with the prolonged time also the supplement of h2o2 at 30 min induced an immediate decline in the concentrations of free chlorines fig 5b indicates that the concentration of h2o2 gradually decreased in the eo systems with a much higher level of h2o2 reduction being discovered in the cl containing eo system than in the cl free eo system the abovementioned result implies the participation of h2o2 and clo in 1o2 production nevertheless we propose that the pathway via recombination of ho2 o2 cannot be excluded from the mechanisms governing the formation of 1o2 in the h2o2 involving eo system indeed the oxidation of h2o2 by ho and chlorine radicals is thermodynamically favorable because of their higher redox potentials e ho 2 7 v vs nhe e cl 2 5 vs nhe and e cl 2 2 2 vs nhe than e o 2 h 2 o 1 66 v vs nhe lei et al 2019 sawyer et al 1981 zhang et al 2018 in addition the proposal of such a pathway is based on the fast reactions between h2o2 and ho k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 and those between h2o2 and chlorine radicals k h2o2 cl 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 k h 2 o 2 cl 2 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 which ensure radical transformation from electrogenerated ho cl cl2 to ho2 o2 eqs 7 10 cheng et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 previous studies concerning non radical based advanced oxidation have shown that ho2 o2 is the key intermediate to 1o2 generation concluding that the radical radical reactions of ho2 o2 recombination are responsible for the evolution of 1o2 eqs 11 13 ji et al 2021 yang et al 2019b yi et al 2019 additional epr tests were performed to confirm the presence of o2 as a consequence of h2o2 addition and the possibility of o2 contribution to 1o2 evolution fig 5c presents the epr results obtained from different eo systems when the high concentration methanol the volume ratio of methanol to water was set as 1 1 was used as the electrolyte note that this experiment was performed based on the fact that methanol is a low polar solvent that can improve the reaction activity of ho2 o2 with dmpo bai et al 2022 because of the quenching of ho cl cl2 by methanol no signals related to them were displayed in the eo systems with and without cl however the addition of h2o2 yielded the appearance of typical characteristic signals of dmpo ooh adducts assigned to o2 the visibility of o2 signals was attributed to the competitive reaction between h2o2 and ho cl cl2 and the resistance of o2 reaction with methanol bq was frequently used as a quencher for o2 and its presence markedly weakened the signal of the dmpo ooh adducts it is apparent that the addition of bq can eventually reduce temp related 1o2 signals fig 5d confirming the role of o2 in mediating the formation of 1o2 7 ho h 2 o 2 ho

used to understand the role of h2o2 on the transformation mechanism of reactive species the steady state concentrations of the reactive species ho cl cl2 and 1o2 produced from different eo systems were simulated by kintecus a software package designed to solve ordinary differential equations in line with the method described in the literature cheng et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 57 elementary reactions were used to establish the kinetic model in the h2o2 involving eo system the steady state concentration ho ss cl ss cl2 ss and 1o2 ss were calculated to be 7 30 10 16 1 45 10 16 1 40 10 14 and 1 98 10 12 m respectively fig 5e compared with their steady state concentrations in the eo system without h2o2 fig s9 a conclusion was drawn that h2o2 suppressed the accumulation of ho cl and cl2 and triggered 1o2 generation which was in good agreement with the epr results an interesting note from fig 5f is that the values of 1o2 ss remarkably declined if the ho2 o2 self combination reactions were excluded from the model simulation by contrast the exclusion of h2o2 and clo reaction slightly affected the yields of 1o2 ss this consolidates that the self combination of ho2 o2 that was resulted from h2o2 reaction with ho cl and cl2 instead of h2o2 reaction with clo is the major mechanism responsible for 1o2 production 3 4 proposed pathways of phenol degradation during eo treatments the intermediates during eo treatments with and without the involvement of h2o2 were qualitatively detected using hrms which aided in proposing the pathways of phenol degradation fig 6 the formulas and structures of the intermediate products are illustrated in table s4 during the cl involving electrolysis the ho and cl initiated oxidation resulted in the generation of monochlorophenol dichlorophenol hydroquinone and chlorohydroquinone corresponding to the ms signals at m z 128 m z 162 m z 110 and m z 144 respectively figs s10 s13 according to chen et al the ho attacked destruction of phenol proceeds with the first step of radical addition path i causing radical adduct formation chen et al 2020 through this pathway phenol was oxidized to catechol which has two isomers resorcinol and hydroquinone further radical cl addition reaction yielded the formation of chlorohydroquinone alternatively phenol with electron rich moieties was vulnerable to attack by cl path ii alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 producing monochlorophenol that was subsequently converted to chlorohydroquinone and dichlorophenol under the action of ho and cl respectively in addition to the ring containing intermediates a number of ring opened and chlorinated products including those at m z 232 m z 184 m z 182 m z 150 m z 138 and m z 110 could be detected figs s14 s18 they emerged from the ring cleavage by further cl attack the determination of these chlorinated products clearly confirms the unavoidable formation of toxic intermediates during eo treatment of organic pollutants in the presence of cl on the other hand once h2o2 was added to the electrolyte although a small amount of chlorophenols were also produced figs s19 21 fewer types of chlorinated intermediates were formed table s4 moreover benzoquinone maleic acid fumaric acid and oxalic acid whose peaks were at m z 108 m z 116 m z 116 and m z 90 respectively were exclusively detected in the h2o2 involving eo system fig s22 it has been reported that phenol reacts with 1o2 preferably via the cycloaddition pathway path iii al nu airat et al 2019 barrios et al 2021 li et al 2019a this affords the production of benzoquinone resulting from the replacement of hydrogen with the ketone group on the benzene ring structure the ring opening of benzoquinone by further 1o2 attack led to the generation of small molecule acids e g maleic acid fumaric acid oxalic acid and acetic acid that are less toxic than the chlorinated compounds are 3 5 interpretation of 1o2 enhanced phenol oxidation with substantial inhibition of chlorinated product formation the pollutant decay experiments clearly indicated that the electrogenerated cl initiated phenol oxidation exhibited much higher rates than did the electrogenerated ho mediated reaction the rates of disappearance of most phenols were further improved with the aid of 1o2 previous studies have shown that the electrogenerated ho as a result of water electrolysis is mainly adsorbed on the anode surface díaz et al 2011 liu et al 2019 panizza and cerisola 2009 because the lifetime of ho is only 0 15 μs and its distance in the aqueous solution is less than 2 mm li et al 2018 piskarev 2021 the chlorine radicals stemming from cl electrolysis are mostly present in the bulk solution cho et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 so that the free cl outperforms surface bound ho because of the avoidance of diffusion limitation in comparison to ho 1o2 is also mainly available in the solution and has a longer lifetime barrios et al 2021 the close contact between 1o2 and the pollutants was therefore beneficial to reactant accessibility explaining the observed high degradation performance to interpret the difference in the chlorinated intermediates observed in this study the dft calculations were used to theoretically predict the ease of chlorinated byproduct formation by considering three scenarios i cl reaction with phenol ii ho reaction with phenol in the presence of cl and iii 1o2 reaction with phenol in the presence of cl fig 7 illustrates the energy profiles of the intermediates and the barrier heights of all transition states in the computational model for i cl attacks phenol via the addition pathway lei et al 2019 and the calculation results indicate that the energy barrier of this process is only 14 9 kcal mol 1 when phenol is transformed to p chlorophenol this means that the formation of the chlorinated product can occur rapidly for ii the reaction of ho with phenol to produce pho through the hydrogen atom abstraction pathway is considered for the calculations of the possibility of chlorinated product formation chen et al 2020 pho can further react with ho by electron transfer followed by combination with h to generate phoh a subsequent combination with cl would generate p chlorophenol the energy barrier of the ho mediated chlorination process is 20 9 kcal mol 1 indicating that the above process can also take place at room temperature with relatively fast kinetics for iii the oxidation of phenol by 1o2 is supposed to occur through the cycloaddition reaction pathway al nu airat et al 2019 al nu airat et al 2020 the unstable 1 4 peroxide int 2 would be generated and stabilized to int 3 two consecutive proton transfer processes then occur inducing the generation of int 5 which is converted to p benzoquinone with the water elimination step an energy barrier of 32 2 kcal mol 1 is required for such a conversion additionally the combination of intermediate products with cl to generate chlorinated products is considered it should be noted that only int 5 may participate in the reaction with cl to form 2 chloro p benzoquinone via the substitution and water elimination steps the calculated energy barrier for the reaction is 69 1 kcal mol 1 much higher than the reaction without the inclusion of cl these results provide compelling evidence that 1o2 initiated phenol oxidation in the presence of cl is less inclined to engage in the formation of chlorinated products compared with ho and cl promoted phenol oxidation 3 6 feasibility of the 1o2 initiated system for promoting phenol oxidation in coking wastewater the practical feasibility of our strategy to accelerate phenol oxidation and prevent toxic chlorinated product formation was further verified in a more realistic situation coking wastewater containing high concentration phenolic pollutants and having high toxicity was used and it was subjected to eo treatments with and without the addition of h2o2 table 1 no external cl was added to the solution because of its inherent availability in raw coal and thus in wastewater table s2 summarizes the abatement of volatile phenols major organics in the coking wastewater as well as cod upon different eo treatments the 16 h eo operation allowed a reduction in the content of volatile phenols from 894 5 to 339 2 mg l 1 and cod from 6440 6 to 4810 3 mg l 1 resulting in approximately 62 1 and 25 4 removal efficiency respectively there was a remarkable enhancement effect owing to h2o2 addition the h2o2 involving system led to much higher removal efficiencies of volatile phenols 93 3 and cod 35 4 the difference in the extent of organic decomposing was also reflected by the 3d fluorescence spectra 3d eems data figs s23 and s24 the introduction of h2o2 caused a significant elimination in the relevant fluorescence peaks with the increase in electrolysis time as well as a more pronounced extent of decreased signals compared with the case in the absence of h2o2 toxicity assessments were also performed with the initial and treated coking wastewater the observed decrease in the acute toxicity was higher for the use of h2o2 with the luminescence ir being reduced by 67 4 electrolysis without involvement of h2o2 yielded only a 14 4 reduction in luminescence inhibition all results confirm that the proposed eo strategy is effective in decomposing phenolic organics and attenuating the toxicity of wastewater this finding implies that the eo technology developed in the current study is important for alleviating the biotoxicity of coking wastewater making it a promising pretreatment step for traditional biological methods conclusions minimizing the generation of toxic byproducts upon treatment of cl laden wastewater is one of the significant challenges that must be addressed before eo technology can be widely adopted for application in wastewater treatment this study proposes and validates the concept of reactive species conversion into 1o2 via the addition of h2o2 which stimulates phenol oxidation and circumvents the problem of chlorinated byproduct formation comparisons of disappearance kinetics for a variety of phenolic compounds between the h2o2 absent and h2o2 involving eo systems clearly demonstrated that the latter enabled higher reaction rates particularly for phenols with electron donating substitutes and significantly suppressed the production of chlorinated organics and thus the acute toxicity of the solution the epr experiments and computational kinetic model evidenced the abundance of 1o2 in the bulk solution in the h2o2 involving electrochemical reactor it is revealed that 1o2 was produced mainly via h2o2 reaction with electrogenerated ho and cl to create o2 followed by its self combination to form 1o2 the dft calculations supported the susceptible emergence of chlorinated products as a consequence of cl or ho initiated phenol oxidation however their appearance resulting from phenol reaction with 1o2 in the presence of cl hardly happens as predicted by the relatively higher energy barrier that needs to be surpassed tests with the real coking wastewater confirmed the benefits of the 1o2 based eo system for the destruction of phenolic compounds which facilitated pollutant removal and alleviated the side effects of chlorinated organic formation the current work should pave a new avenue for effective and on site 1o2 generation from an electrochemical perspective and the findings would enrich the theory of 1o2 engaged advanced oxidation technology declaration

and other applications seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample many of these technologies have been subject to interlaboratory validation studies aw et al 2019 ebentier et al 2013 shanks et al 2016 2012 with several methods now available as standardized protocols usepa 2013 2019a 2019b as the use of qpcr expands beyond a subject of research to routine environmental and public health laboratory testing it is necessary to develop calibration and validation materials that encourage consistent testing protocols across laboratories increased implementation of qpcr based fecal characterization methods has revealed the need for a readily available standard calibration material calibrant allowing for the routine generation of high quality calibration models standard curves necessary to interpret measurements qpcr calibration models are generated from a dilution series of a calibrant typically five to six 10 fold dilution concentrations with at least three replicate measurements per dilution level the calibration model is then determined by plotting the resulting dilution measurements against log10 transformed dna target copy quantities and fitting a linear trend line to the data as a result the precision and accuracy of qpcr measurements are strongly influenced by the quality and reproducibility of the calibration model the use of a reliable calibrant combined with protocol standardization has been shown to improve qpcr measurement precision both within and between laboratories ebentier et al 2013 in response to this need the u s environmental protection agency epa designed a dna construct that functions with multiple qpcr protocols willis et al 2022 and collaborated with the national institute of standards and technology nist to develop a large scale preparation for distribution on a national scale kralj et al 2021 the result is standard reference material 2917 nist srm 2917 a linearized double stranded

reaction the material was certified by nist based on a comprehensive demonstration of concentration homogeneity and stability of randomly selected srm 2917 aliquots at each dilution level via a series of droplet digital pcr experiments kralj et al 2021 in addition a single laboratory performance assessment demonstrated that srm 2917 functions with all qpcr protocols willis et al 2022 however the within and between lab variability of the calibrant across multiple laboratories had not been characterized preventing the development of suitable data acceptance benchmarks for future practitioners to assess the interlaboratory performance of srm 2917 a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate calibration model generation and develop potential benchmark metrics performance was determined based on repeated testing of 12 qpcr methods by 14 participating laboratories labs 1 to 14 each laboratory followed an identical protocol utilizing the same qpcr reagent preparations and amplification consumables results were used to assess the quality of calibration models generated on a single instrument run basis single instrument run data were then combined for each qpcr assay to create global calibration models using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo approach allowing for the characterization of within and between lab variability aw et al 2019 finally global calibration model slope and

performance was assessed based on repeated measures of srm 2917 across 14 laboratories resulting in 924 calibration models all qpcr single instrument calibration models exhibited a high degree of linearity with r 2 0 992 table 2 well above the expert recommended 0 980 threshold bustin and nolan 2006 with 61 1 565 of 924 yielding values 0 999 a similar trend was observed for single instrument run calibration model e values where 99 5 919 of 925 fell within the expert recommended 0 90 to 1 10 range bustin et al 2009 together these performance metrics suggest that srm 2917 is a highly reliable standard calibrant that allows for the consistent generation of high quality calibration models within and between laboratories interlaboratory findings also confirm results in a recent single laboratory performance assessment willis et al 2022 and suggest that future molecular water quality monitoring efforts implementing srm 2917 combined with standardized qpcr protocols should lead to more comparable data sets and help reduce error in concentration estimates 4 2 srm 2917 within and between lab variability a total of 84 single instrument runs generated across 14 laboratories were used to construct a global calibration model for each qpcr assay global calibration models revealed multiple within and between lab variability trends for example within lab standard deviations were always less than or equal to between lab values regardless of model parameter slope or intercept this difference was most pronounced with intercept estimates where the average between lab standard deviation was 3 2 times higher relative to within lab values table 4 higher variability in calibration model intercepts is expected in part due to potential instrument excitation and emission parameter differences from one apparatus to another i e wavelengths slit widths exposure times svec et al 2015 as well as inevitable differences in qpcr assay optimization quencher technology and dna target sequence composition the evaluation of across laboratory variability in repeated cq measurements at each srm 2917 dilution level fig 3 demonstrates that each qpcr assay exhibits a heteroscedastic trend where measurement error is highest at the lowest concentration a feature characteristic of qpcr calibration models bustin 2006 in addition it is worth noting that the largest global standard deviation was only 0 70 cq cpq 064 dilution level 1 10 3 copies 2 µl with 74 5 41 of 55 of values 0 50 suggesting that the range of instruments number of replicates per sample test n 3 and template volume 2 µl used in this study did not introduce substantial variation in srm 2917 measurements 4 3 potential srm 2917 data acceptance metrics data sets from labs 1 to 14 enabled generation of assay specific global calibration models resulting in 95 bci values that include within and between lab variability offering potential data acceptance metrics for future use of srm 2917 performance metrics can verify that laboratory conditions are suitable i e reagents instrumentation and or that analysts exhibit an appropriate qpcr method proficiency level performance metrics can also be used for laboratory training purposes and to support future accreditation protocols as an alternative to assay specific 95 bci benchmarks a srm 2917 universal interval consisting of the lower and upper bounds across all qpcr assays may be useful for example minimum and maximum global calibration model slope 95 bci values fell within a range of 3 51 rum2bac to 3 24 cowm2 equivalent to an e of 0 93 and 1 03 respectively using test laboratory data labs 15 to 16 95 3 122 of 128 of single instrument run calibration models would be considered suitable for sample quantification fig 4 the potential use of a slope srm 2917 universal interval is further supported based on the observation that global calibration model slope 95 bci values for each qpcr assay overlap table 3 indicating no significant difference between 11 qpcr assays using the same standard calibrant in contrast to global slope trends global intercept minimum and maximum 95 bci bounds ranged from 35 0 pig2bac to 41 5 cpq 064 and do not overlap across all qpcr assays table 4 suggesting that the variability may be too large for a meaningful intercept srm 2917 universal performance metric intercept is typically less reproducible between laboratories instruments and assays compared to slope pfaffl and bustin 2006 further supporting this conclusion while global slope values remained similar across qpcr assays in this study some researchers report that slope can significantly shift from one instrument to another ruijter et al 2021 the interlaboratory data reported here was generated using six different instrument models from the same manufacturer additional research is warranted to evaluate the utility of potential srm 2917 data acceptance metrics across a broader group of instrument types 4 4 implications for water quality management access to a high quality calibrant that functions with a broad range of pcr based methods will have multiple implications for water quality management a readily available calibrant subject to rigorous performance assessment is a necessary step toward large scale method adoption not only in the water quality testing arena but also in the public acceptance of these technologies srm 2917 a single calibrant preparation functions with multiple qpcr water quality methods allowing for future experiment customization to assess public health risks due to fecal pollution in water as well as to characterize key pollutant sources srm 2917 will also help reduce variability in qpcr measurements allowing for calibration model generation with greater precision and eliminating the need for multiple calibrant preparations when using more than one qpcr assay avoiding error introduced from repeated dilution and concentration determination steps in addition global calibration model slope parameters derived from interlaboratory data sets can serve as data acceptance metrics allowing practitioners and the public to evaluate the technical quality of future calibration models against an established yardstick it is important to note that while such benchmarks could not be established for the ec23s857 qpcr assay in this study due to unacceptable levels of e coli 23s rrna gene contamination performance metrics are reported elsewhere sivaganesan et al 2019 using a similarly prepared standard control material sivaganesan et al 2018 while the ec23s857 qpcr assay functions with srm 2917 willis et al 2022 control experiments to characterize potential contamination in each reagent lot prior to sample testing is highly recommended finally the utility of srm 2917 ought to reach beyond qpcr based water quality monitoring applications srm 2917 should also function with digital pcr and potentially other molecular technologies that can selectively detect and quantify a nucleic acid target this flexibility will likely accelerate method development validation and implementation of newer technologies to characterize fecal pollution in surface water stormwater wastewater irrigation water or in any other sample types that may contain fecal waste 5 conclusions this study investigated the interlaboratory variability in repeated measurements of the recently developed srm 2917 using standardized protocols for 12 qpcr surface water quality assays using a bayesian approach special attention was placed on within and between lab variability to establish potential future data acceptance metrics key findings include interlaboratory performance assessment suggests that srm 2917 is suitable for broad scale implementation single instrument calibration models exhibited a high degree of linearity with r 2 0 992 and suitable e values in 99 5 of experiments calibration model slope and intercept parameter within lab variability was always less than or equal to between lab variability regardless of qpcr assay global calibration model slope parameters can serve as performance benchmarks allowing practitioners and the public to evaluate the technical quality of future srm 2917 calibration models against an established yardstick future use of srm 2917 should reduce variability in data sets improve the comparability of results

and other applications seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample many of these technologies have been subject to interlaboratory validation studies aw et al 2019 ebentier et al 2013 shanks et al 2016 2012 with several methods now available as standardized protocols usepa 2013 2019a 2019b as the use of qpcr expands beyond a subject of research to routine environmental and public health laboratory testing it is necessary to develop calibration and validation materials that encourage consistent testing protocols across laboratories increased implementation of qpcr based fecal characterization methods has revealed the need for a readily available standard calibration material calibrant allowing for the routine generation of high quality calibration models standard curves necessary to interpret measurements qpcr calibration models are generated from a dilution series of a calibrant typically five to six 10 fold dilution concentrations with at least three replicate measurements per dilution level the calibration model is then determined by plotting the resulting dilution measurements against log10 transformed dna target copy quantities and fitting a linear trend line to the data as a result the precision and accuracy of qpcr measurements are strongly influenced by the quality and reproducibility of the calibration model the use of a reliable calibrant combined with protocol standardization has been shown to improve qpcr measurement precision both within and between laboratories ebentier et al 2013 in response to this need the u s environmental protection agency epa designed a dna construct that functions with multiple qpcr protocols willis et al 2022 and collaborated with the national institute of standards and technology nist to develop a large scale preparation for distribution on a national scale kralj et al 2021 the result is standard reference material 2917 nist srm 2917 a linearized double stranded plasmid dna construct that harbors an insert containing multiple surface water quality monitoring qpcr target sequences these qpcr methods allow for the estimation of the total level of fecal pollution enterococci and escherichia coli and identification of key fecal pollution sources i e human ruminant cattle pig dog in a sample over 1000 sets of the calibrant each consisting of five dilution levels were manufactured by nist allowing for the generation of qpcr calibration models with a range of quantification spanning approximately 10 to 105 copies of each target sequence per reaction the material was certified by nist based on a comprehensive demonstration of concentration homogeneity and stability of randomly selected srm 2917 aliquots at each dilution level via a series of droplet digital pcr experiments kralj et al 2021 in addition a single laboratory performance assessment demonstrated that srm 2917 functions with all qpcr protocols willis et al 2022 however the within and between lab variability of the calibrant across multiple laboratories had not been characterized preventing the development of suitable data acceptance benchmarks for future practitioners to assess the interlaboratory performance of srm 2917 a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate calibration model generation and develop potential benchmark metrics performance was determined based on repeated testing of 12 qpcr methods by 14 participating laboratories labs 1 to 14 each laboratory followed an identical protocol utilizing the same qpcr reagent preparations and amplification consumables results were used to assess the quality of calibration models generated on a single instrument run basis single instrument run data were then combined for each qpcr assay to create global calibration models using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo approach allowing for the characterization of within and between lab variability aw et al 2019 finally global calibration model slope and intercept parameters were explored as future srm 2917 data acceptance metrics using comparable data sets generated from two additional laboratories labs 15 and 16 findings demonstrate that interlaboratory measurements are highly reproducible regardless of qpcr assay and that select global calibration model metrics may be useful benchmarks for future investigations of assay performance 2

proposed in a previous interlaboratory study of the ec23s857 qpcr assay sivaganesan et al 2019 these guidelines were not met by the polymerase reagent lot used in the current study data not shown

performance benchmarks with test laboratory calibration models to evaluate the utility of global calibration model slope and intercept trends as potential srm 2917 performance benchmarks comparable

performance was assessed based on repeated measures of srm 2917 across 14 laboratories resulting in 924 calibration models all qpcr single instrument calibration models exhibited a high degree of linearity with r 2 0 992 table 2 well above the expert recommended 0 980 threshold bustin and nolan 2006 with 61 1 565 of 924 yielding values 0 999 a similar trend was observed for single instrument run calibration model e values where 99 5 919 of 925 fell within the expert recommended 0 90 to 1 10 range bustin et al 2009 together these performance metrics suggest that srm 2917 is a highly reliable standard calibrant that allows for the consistent generation of high quality calibration models within and between laboratories interlaboratory findings also confirm results in a recent single laboratory performance assessment willis et al 2022 and suggest that future molecular water quality monitoring efforts implementing srm 2917 combined with standardized qpcr protocols should lead to more comparable data sets and help reduce error in concentration estimates 4 2 srm 2917 within and between lab variability a total of 84 single instrument runs generated across 14 laboratories were used to construct a global calibration model for each qpcr assay global calibration models revealed multiple within and between lab variability trends for example within lab standard deviations were always less than or equal to between lab values regardless of model parameter slope or intercept this difference was most pronounced with intercept estimates where the average between lab standard deviation was 3 2 times higher relative to within lab values table 4 higher variability in calibration model intercepts is expected in part due to potential instrument excitation and emission parameter differences from one apparatus to another i e wavelengths slit widths exposure times svec et al 2015 as well as inevitable differences in qpcr assay optimization quencher technology and dna target sequence composition the evaluation of across laboratory variability in repeated cq measurements at each srm 2917 dilution level fig 3 demonstrates that each qpcr assay exhibits a heteroscedastic trend where measurement error is highest at the lowest concentration a feature characteristic of qpcr calibration models bustin 2006 in addition it is worth noting that the largest global standard deviation was only 0 70 cq cpq 064 dilution level 1 10 3 copies 2 µl with 74 5 41 of 55 of values 0 50 suggesting that the range of instruments number of replicates per sample test n 3 and template volume 2 µl used in this study did not introduce substantial variation in srm 2917 measurements 4 3 potential srm 2917 data acceptance metrics data sets from labs 1 to 14 enabled generation of assay specific global calibration models resulting in 95 bci values that include within and between lab variability offering potential data acceptance metrics for future use of srm 2917 performance metrics can verify that laboratory conditions are suitable i e reagents instrumentation and or that analysts exhibit an appropriate qpcr method proficiency level performance metrics can also be used for laboratory training purposes and to support future accreditation protocols as an alternative to assay specific 95 bci benchmarks a srm 2917 universal interval consisting of the lower and upper bounds across all qpcr assays may be useful for example minimum and maximum global calibration model slope 95 bci values fell within a range of 3 51 rum2bac to 3 24 cowm2 equivalent to an e of 0 93 and 1 03 respectively using test laboratory data labs 15 to 16 95 3 122 of 128 of single instrument run calibration models would be considered suitable for sample quantification fig 4 the potential use of a slope srm 2917 universal interval is further supported based on the observation that global calibration model slope 95 bci values for each qpcr assay overlap table 3 indicating no significant difference between 11 qpcr assays using the same standard calibrant in contrast to global slope trends global intercept minimum and maximum 95 bci bounds ranged from 35 0 pig2bac to 41 5 cpq 064 and do not overlap across all qpcr assays table 4 suggesting that the variability may be too large for a meaningful intercept srm 2917 universal performance metric intercept is typically less reproducible between laboratories instruments and assays compared to slope pfaffl and bustin 2006 further supporting this conclusion while global slope values remained similar across qpcr assays in this study some researchers report that slope can significantly shift from one instrument to another ruijter et al 2021 the interlaboratory data reported here was generated using six different instrument models from the same manufacturer additional research is warranted to evaluate the utility of potential srm 2917 data acceptance metrics across a broader group of instrument types 4 4 implications for water quality management access to a high quality calibrant that functions with a broad range of pcr based methods will have multiple implications for water quality management a readily available calibrant subject to rigorous performance assessment is a necessary step toward large scale method adoption not only in the water quality testing arena but also in the public acceptance of these technologies srm 2917 a single calibrant preparation functions with multiple qpcr water quality methods allowing for future experiment customization to assess public health risks due to fecal pollution in water as well as to characterize key pollutant sources srm 2917 will also help reduce variability in qpcr measurements allowing for calibration model generation with greater precision and eliminating the need for multiple calibrant preparations when using more than one qpcr assay avoiding error introduced from repeated dilution and concentration determination steps in addition global calibration model slope parameters derived from interlaboratory data sets can serve as data acceptance metrics allowing practitioners and the public to evaluate the technical quality of future calibration models against an established yardstick it is important to note that while such benchmarks could not be established for the ec23s857 qpcr assay in this study due to unacceptable levels of e coli 23s rrna gene contamination performance metrics are reported elsewhere sivaganesan et al 2019 using a similarly prepared standard control material sivaganesan et al 2018 while the ec23s857 qpcr assay functions with srm 2917 willis et al 2022 control experiments to characterize potential contamination in each reagent lot prior to sample testing is highly recommended finally the utility of srm 2917 ought to reach beyond qpcr based water quality monitoring applications srm 2917 should also function with digital pcr and potentially other molecular technologies that can selectively detect and quantify a nucleic acid target this flexibility will likely accelerate method development validation and implementation of newer technologies to characterize fecal pollution in surface water stormwater wastewater irrigation water or in any other sample types that may contain fecal waste 5 conclusions this study investigated the interlaboratory variability in repeated measurements of the recently developed srm 2917 using standardized protocols for 12 qpcr surface water quality assays using a bayesian approach special attention was placed on within and between lab variability to establish potential future data acceptance metrics key findings include interlaboratory performance assessment suggests that srm 2917 is suitable for broad scale implementation single instrument calibration models exhibited a high degree of linearity with r 2 0 992 and suitable e values in 99 5 of experiments calibration model slope and intercept parameter within lab variability was always less than or equal to between lab variability regardless of qpcr assay global calibration model slope parameters can serve as performance benchmarks allowing practitioners and the public to evaluate the technical quality of future srm 2917 calibration models against an established yardstick future use of srm 2917 should reduce variability in data sets improve the comparability of results within and between laboratories and increase overall confidence in measurements however qpcr technology is rapidly evolving and continuously undergoing procedural modifications as the field advances

15457,ion adsorption rare earth element ree deposits are the main reservoirs of rees worldwide and are widely exploited in south china microbial diversity is essential for maintaining the performance and function of mining ecosystems investigating the ecological patterns underlying the ree mine microbiome is essential to understand ecosystem responses to environmental changes and to improve the bioremediation of mining areas we applied 16s rrna and its gene sequence analyses to investigate the composition characteristics of prokaryotic bacteria archaea and fungal communities in a river impacted by ree acid mine drainage ree amd the river formed a unique micro ecosystem including the main prokaryotic taxa of proteobacteria acidobacteria crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota as well as the main fungal taxa of ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota analysis of microbial diversity showed that unlike prokaryotic communities that responded drastically to pollution disturbances fungal communities were less affected by ree amd but fluctuated significantly in different seasons ecological network analysis revealed that fungal communities have lower connectivity and centrality and higher modularity than prokaryotic networks indicating that fungal communities have more stable network structures the introduction of ree amd mainly reduced the complexity of the community network and the number of keystone species while the proportion of negative prokaryotic fungal associations in the network increased ecological process analysis revealed that compared to the importance of environmental selection for prokaryotes stochastic processes might have contributed primarily to fungal communities in ree mining areas these findings confirm that the different assembly mechanisms of prokaryotic and fungal communities are key to the differences in their responses to environmental perturbations the findings also provide the first insights into microbiota assembly patterns in ree amd and important ecological knowledge for the formation and development of microbial communities in ree mining areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rare earth element ree mine microbiome assembly pattern co occurrence network prokaryotic community fungal community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rare earth elements rees are a group of elements with similar physicochemical properties including lanthanides scandium and yttrium cornell 1993 owing to their importance in emerging high tech industries intelligent electric equipment medicines and renewable energy the global demand for rees is increasing alonso et al 2012 industrial activities consume rees and discharge rees to ocean and terrestrial environments including seawater akagi and edanami 2017 ocean sediments consani et al 2020 river estuaries hatje et al 2016 river water and soil da silva et al 2018 liu et al 2019 discharged rees are toxic to living beings gonzalez et al 2015 including unicellular algae freitas et al 2020 siciliano et al 2021 protozoa herrmann et al 2016 zooplanktons barry and meehan 2000 crustaceans henriques et al 2019 and fishes zhao et al 2021 owing to the bioaccumulation toxicity and environmental stress caused by rees contamination macmillan et al 2019 the ecological effects and environmental hazards of rees are of great concern adeel et al 2019 mining activities are the main sources of anthropogenic ree pollution zhong et al 2020 acid mine drainage amd generated during mining activities is an important path of pollutant transportation and often causes serious contamination and acidification of surrounding rivers by elements johnson and hallberg 2005 in contrast to traditional heavy metal amd ree amd generated by ion adsorption ree mines which are heap leached by ammonium sulfate during extraction is often accompanied by high concentrations of ammonia and sulfates in addition to concentrated rees rees are mainly present in the form of ree so4 and ree3 whose speciation and fate are largely influenced by ph iron fe aluminum al clay minerals and organic matter in the water and sediment liu et al 2019 similar geochemical features have also been found in rees containing neutral drainage from coal waste and washing plants shahhosseini et al 2017 mine wastewater pollution can significantly disturb the microbial ecosystems of archaea bacteria and fungi mining activities considerably change on the microbial community and alter its diversity and structure chao et al 2016 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2015 kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 correspondingly interplay of the microbial community with mine pollution or development of diverse metabolic potentials allow adaptation to environmental stress for instance the oxidation of iron and sulfur is an important energy source for acidophilic chemoautotrophic microorganisms which would also accelerate the acidification of mine water and the release of metallic sulfides aliaga goltsman et al 2015 baker and banfield 2003 for the limited organic carbon and nitrogen in mine wastewater baker and banfield 2003 functional groups involved in carbon and nitrogen fixation would play crucial roles in maintaining the nutrient supply assisting microbial community colonization and sustaining the stability of the mine ecosystem barrie and hallberg 2009 as a key question in microbial ecology and ecosystem management and recovery it is important to study the ecological responses of microbial communities to geochemical changes caused by mine wastewater this issue is not completely understood especially for ree mines the responses of the different microbes may also vary for instance fungi are often more resistant to environmental stress than prokaryotes bacteria and archaea however prokaryotes may be better restored than fungi de vries and shade 2013 de vries et al 2012 engelhardt et al 2018 these prior investigations provided insights into the influence of mining activity on the microbial community however a clear illustration of the assembly patterns of prokaryotes and fungi in mining areas and a mechanistic explanation of the different ecological processes are still lacking the community assembly mechanism is an important topic in the research on microbial ecological processes zhou et al 2014 knowledge of the assembly patterns is important in explaining the formation and succession of microbial community structures in mining areas community assembly is typically mediated by stochastic and deterministic processes ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 deterministic processes have been proven to be more dominant in bacterial community assembly in most cases hanson et al 2012 lindström and langenheder 2012 pontarp et al 2012 similar research on fungi is scarce although fungi are one of the key components of microbial ecosystems keeling and campo 2017 massana and logares 2013 thus far our understanding of the ecological processes involved in fungal community assembly is very limited fungi cells has organelles with multiple functions and the cell organization is more complex than prokaryote massana and logares 2013 these cell functions would then help fungi to develop more distinctive responses to environmental screening which may not be found in bacteria logares et al 2018 environmental filtering has been most considered in the deterministic process of microbial ecology study for mining areas numerous studies have shown that environmental ph metals and nutrients mediate the formation of a community structure chao et al 2016 kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 nevertheless the effects of the interactions among communities on assembly have been ignored especially the interactions between bacteria and fungi it has been demonstrated that bacterial fungal relationships directly influence community stability and could accurately reflect changes in microbial ecological functions jiao et al 2021 hence it is critical to reveal the microbial community assembly and interactions to better understand the formation of microbial diversity and community secession in mining areas zhou and ning 2017 which is of significance for assessing the pollution remediation and ecological recovery of mining areas in this study an ree mining area in south china was investigated water and sediment samples were collected from polluted rivers during different seasons the significant gradient in geochemical characteristics within the study area provided ideal conditions to explore the microbial community responses to environmental disturbances in the ree mining area by analyzing 16s rrna and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer its amplicons we aimed to 1 identify the community diversity and taxonomic composition of prokaryotes and fungi in typical ion adsorption ree mining areas 2 reveal the co occurrence network and interaction characteristics between prokaryotic and fungal communities and 3 understand the inherent ecological mechanisms underlying the differences in community assembly between the microbes belonging to two different kingdoms 2 materials and methods 2 1

tubes all sediment samples were stored at 20 c in a mobile freezer before being transported to the laboratory then one aliquot of each sediment sample was freeze dried and passed through a sieve for physicochemical analysis the residual sediment samples were transferred to a 80 c freezer before being analyzed for microbial communities detailed physicochemical analyses and results can be found in

an illumina miseq platform at novogene co ltd in beijing the sequences were submitted to the genome sequence archive 16s rrna and its amplicon sequences were found at cra003488 and cra006584 respectively 2 3 processing and analyzing of sequence data raw sequences were processed using the qiime2 2020 11 platform bolyen et al 2019 the raw sequences were denoised and filtered using dada2

16 0 ibm corp usa was used to analyze the variances in the physiochemical properties and community diversity fisher s least significant difference test was performed when necessary for multiple comparisons at the significance level of p 0 05 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was applied to investigate the influence of pollution levels seasons and environmental conditions on β diversity based on the weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices function of deseqdatasetfrommatrix in the deseq2 package of r was employed to identify the enrichment or deficiency of asvs under various

the present study 1 quantification of community assembly processes including heterogeneous selection homogeneous selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and undominated by null model analysis i e calculating beta nearest taxon index βnti and bray curtis based raup crick index rcbray chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 βντι 2 suggests homogeneous selection whereas βντι 2 suggests heterogeneous selection when βντι is 2 rcbray 0 95 suggests homogenizing dispersal and rcbray 0 95 suggests dispersal limitation βντι 2 and rcbray 0 95 represents as undominated process this analysis was performed in an environmental microbiological metagenomics analysis platform http mem rcees ac cn 8080 feng et al 2017 2 evaluation of the potential role of stochastic processes by using neutral community model ncm sloan et al 2006 the relationship between relative abundance of asvs and frequency of occurrence was fitted to ncm by using r code according to burns et al 2016 3 results 3 1 contamination in the studied ree mining area based on the physiochemical properties and chemical concentrations in the collected water and sediment samples chen et al 2022 it can be concluded that mining activities in the studied area seriously pollute the surrounding environment a significant gradient of geochemical conditions from upstream to downstream was observed p 0 05 according to the multiple physiochemical properties including ph nh4 no3 so4 2 ec tc and rees cluster analysis of water samples based on bray curtis similarity measurements suggests a clear distinction between hp mp lp and ck samples fig s2 for the aqueous samples ph is in the range of 4 17 8 06 6 49 1 10 average standard deviation whereas the hp samples feature with significant acidification p 0 05 ec is in the range of 37 1 1 39 103 386 313 μs cm 1 as affected by the long term extraction by ammonium sulfate the highest concentrations of nh4 39 8 22 8 mg l 1 and so4 2 213 110 mg l 1 were found in hp sites which far exceeded the highest pollution criteria of china s environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 the concentrations of rees in polluted water samples 5 56 14 1 mg l 1 varied significantly but were still much higher than that in ck samples 17 4 32 6 μg l 1 for sediment samples the highest concentration of rees was detected in mp sites instead of hp sites where the concentration of rees reached 621 195 mg kg 1 which was significantly higher than that in the ck samples 162 53 3 mg kg 1 the gradients of other physiochemical properties from upstream to downstream in the sediment were similar to those in the cover water with less deviations the ph values showed significant seasonal variation the lowest ph of all samples was 5 30 in winter and became more acidic 4 17 in summer the concentrations of nh4 and no3 also seasonally fluctuated with values of 75 4 mg kg 1 and 105 0 mg kg 1 respectively in winter and lower values in summer 58 1 mg kg 1 and 68 0 mg kg 1 respectively chen et al 2022 however the concentrations of rees in the water and sediment did not display significant seasonal differences 3 2 microbial community diversities in the studied area faith s phylogenetic diversity and observed features indices were used to indicate the within sample diversity i e α diversity of microbial communities fig 1 and s3 as shown in fig 1a and b the α diversity of the prokaryotic community was significantly affected by wastewater pollution from ree mines p 0 05 in the sediment the prokaryotic community α diversity generally decreased with elevated pollution levels fig 1b compared with ck the sediments of polluted sites had much lower α diversity p 0 05 the changes in prokaryotic community α diversity in the river water showed a different pattern the α diversity was increased in the lp and mp sites and was decreased in the hp site fig 1a the highest prokaryotic community α diversity was found in mp water the fungal community α diversity in either water or sediment samples did not display significant changes with the various pollution levels fig 1e and f suggesting a limited influence of mining pollution on fungal community α diversity comparison among seasons suggested higher prokaryotic community α diversity of water in autumn and winter than in spring and summer fig 1c seasonal comparison of sediment did not suggest significant seasonal fluctuations fig 1d for the fungal community the α diversities of water and sediment samples were higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter fig 1g and h for between sample diversity i e β diversity pcoa based on weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices was performed fig 2 and s4 the results of the prokaryotic community β diversity revealed that water and sediment samples clustered according to the collection sites with different pollution levels fig 2a and b indicating the significant impact of mining pollution on the river prokaryotic community p 0 01 no seasonal influence on β diversity of the prokaryotic community was observed in contrast the β diversity of the fungal community was not significantly influenced by pollution levels as summarized in fig 2c and d the first principal coordinate pcoa1 could only explain 18 6 water and 15 9 sediment of the variation between the samples collected from different sites suggesting a poor explanation of community changes by pollution levels 3 3 taxonomic composition of the microbial communities the microbial taxonomic composition at the phylum level is summarized in table s1 proteobacteria bacteroidetes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and crenarchaeota were identified as the dominant prokaryotic phyla in water samples accounting for 56 5 of the total relative abundance the fungal community was dominated by the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota which accounted for 33 1 of the total abundance fungi were not considerably abundant to explore the influence of water pollution the abundance of asvs was compared between hp and ck samples and enriched or depleted asvs were identified as illustrated in fig s5 and table s2 1346 prokaryotic asvs were enriched in hp water they mainly belonged to the orders rhodospirillales cenarchaeales burkholderiales and acidimicrobiales as well 1421 prokaryotic asvs were depleted they belonged to acidimicrobiales saprospirales sphingobacteriales and synechococcales relatively fewer differences in fungal asvs abundance were found between hp and ck samples a total of 343 asvs in chytridiomycota mortierellomycota and ascomycota were enriched whereas 238 asvs in chytridiomycota ascomycota and rozellomycota were depleted proteobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the dominant prokaryotic phyla 70 3 in the sediment ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla 31 3 table s1 as affected by water pollution a large number of asvs were enriched or depleted in abundance in the hp sediment compared with that in the ck sediment fig s5 and table s2 for the prokaryotic community 3253 asvs were enriched in the orders xanthomonadales rhodospirillales saprospirales and cenarchaeales and 1135 were depleted in oscillatoriales pseudanabaenales sphingomonadales and nitrospirales in the fungal community 153 asvs in mortierellomycota ascomycota and chytridiomycota were enriched and 159 asvs in basidiomycota ascomycota and rozellomycota were depleted 3 4 co occurrence network of the microbial communities the intra kingdom co occurrence networks of the prokaryotic and fungal communities are shown in fig s6 and s7 respectively according to the constructed co occurrence networks and the calculated topological indices table s3 and s4 the average network degree for prokaryotic and fungal communities was 9 6 and 6 3 respectively in the water and 7 8 and 8 2 respectively in the sediment the average total links were 1178 and 335 respectively for the prokaryotic and fungal communities in water and 897 and 460 respectively in the sediment the respective average clustering coefficient was 0 41 and 0 37 in water and 0 39 and 0 24 in sediment these results suggest that prokaryotic communities have a higher order organized co occurrence network in water than in sediment in contrast the fungal community has a more complex network in sediment than in water the fungal community was also found with a higher ratio of co exclusion negative links to modularity 11 3 0 39 in water and 23 0 0 37 in sediment compared with the prokaryotic community the ratio of negative links to modularity was 12 1 0 52 in water and 8 6 0 46 in sediment table s4 in the intra kingdom co occurrence network of the fungal community the top 10 hub nodes with the highest degree and closeness centrality were dominantly connected with other nodes via negative links which was especially significant in the sediment samples regarding the influence of pollution table s4 contamination weakened the positive correlations co occurrence links within the prokaryotic or fungal community but strengthened the negative correlations co exclusion links inter kingdom co occurrence network was constructed fig 3 a the results suggest that the introduction of wastewater due to ree mining activities destroys the stability of the microbial community network the ratio of negative links to modularity in the network of hp samples was 17 8 0 82 in water and 25 1 0 67 in sediment the ratios were lower than those in ck samples 11 2 0 184 in water and 36 0 0 61 in sediment as a result of pollution the number of nodes links and network degree significantly declined whereas the inter kingdom negative correlations were markedly enhanced fig 3 3 5 keystone species identified by the network analysis changes in the co occurrence network would alter the roles of the specific nodes in the community the nodes were classified as module hubs network hubs connectors and peripherals based on the calculated within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the model hubs and connectors have been identified as keystone species shi et al 2016 which are highly connected taxa which exert a considerable influence on microbiome structure and functions banerjee et al 2018 in total there were 16 prokaryotic species and 19 fungal species identified as keystone species in polluted samples which were much fewer than those identified in ck samples 31 prokaryotes and 26 fungi fig 4 and table s5 the keystone species in the polluted sites were mainly in the prokaryotic phyla proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae euryarchaeota and parvarchaeota also named micrarchaeota rinke et al 2021 in the gtdb database and the fungal phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota the keystone species in the ck samples were mainly in the prokaryotic phyla proteobacteria cyanobacteria tm7 actinobacteria bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia with the same fungal phyla as those in the polluted sites at the order level the keystone species in polluted samples were mainly in 12 prokaryotic orders including burkholderiales rhizobiales nitrospirales thermoplasmata and micrarchaeles and 16 fungal orders including hypocreales polyporales saccharomycetales eurotiales and xylariales the total relative abundance of module hubs and connectors in the polluted sites was 3 73 and 3 12 in water and sediment respectively 3 6 prokaryotic and fungal community assembly processes we calculated βnti and rcbray to quantify the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to prokaryotic and fungal community assembly in ree amd as summarized in fig 5 deterministic processes dominated the prokaryotic community assembly in water the total contribution of homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection was the highest in hp samples 77 9 followed by lp 76 9 mp 63 3 and ck 46 7 these findings imply that the pollution reinforced the deterministic processes in prokaryotic community assembly in the sediment prokaryotic community assembly was also dominated by deterministic processes with contributions of 73 6 70 6 79 7 and 68 5 for hp mp lp and ck sites respectively in contrast for fungal communities in water the assembly is more mediated by stochastic processes the contribution of stochastic processes was the highest in hp 61 4 followed by mp 58 8 ck 56 9 and lp 37 0 similarly stochastic processes also dominated the sediment fungal community assembly with contributions of 51 7 57 8 53 2 and 60 9 for hp mp lp and ck sites respectively these results could be supported by the ncm analysis fig s8 the goodness of fit r2 was better for fungal communities 0 621 0 750 in water and 0 677 0 786 in sediment than that for prokaryotic communities 0 456 0 468 in water and 0 442 0 52 in sediment in hp mp and lp samples indicating that the neutral assembly processes e g dispersal and ecological drift may play a more important role in fungal community assembly the seasonal variation of community assembly was also analyzed fig s9 although the results fluctuated with seasons the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to prokaryotic and fungal community had similar pattern in polluted water and sediments microbial communities face environmental stress abt analysis was performed to estimate the impact of different environmental factors on microbial diversity during the deterministic selection processes in water samples fig s10 the concentration of rees was found the most influential factor mediating the diversity of prokaryotic communities contributing 21 2 followed by nh4 17 1 no3 14 8 and ph 13 4 for fungi the impact of rees was much lower 3 02 while the major mediating factors were ph 22 4 no3 17 2 and so4 2 15 0 in sediments fig s11 the diversity of the prokaryotic community was mainly influenced by ph 23 1 nh4 18 3 and rees 11 7 whereas the fungal community was not very sensitive to ph or rees but was more associated with no3 30 0 aluminum 17 2 and copper 14 4 our previous study revealed that ree speciation including ree3 ree so4 ree co3 ree fa ree and fulvic acid complexation varied significantly from upstream to downstream in the same studied river fig s12 liu et al 2019 cca and vpa analyses were presently performed to evaluate the effects of ree speciation on prokaryotic and fungal communities the results indicate that ree speciation could significantly affect prokaryotic and fungal communities with similar patterns table s6 ree3 explained the largest community variation 12 57 and 9 05 for prokaryotic and fungal communities respectively followed by inorganic ree so4 and ree co3 and organic ree fa complex species of ree 4 discussions 4 1 prokaryotes and fungi responded differently to pollution and seasonal changes wastewater from ree mines imposes selective stress to the river environment this can allow prokaryotic phyla able to adapt to the extreme environment such as acidobacteria bacteroidetes crenarchaeota od1 proteobacteria and nitrospirae to occupy the major niche remarkably archaea such as crenarchaeota were very abundant in hp water samples up to 40 table s1 generally archaea are widely found typically in low numbers in some typical amd waters baker et al 2006 lopez archilla et al 2001 ziegler et al 2013 however archaea have been reported to play crucial roles in specific microecological systems surrounding mines baker et al 2006 hua et al 2015 lopez archilla et al 2001 ziegler et al 2013 for ree mines the ecological roles of the archaeal community especially their potential roles in ecological recovery require further in depth investigation contrary to the sensitive responses of prokaryotes to pollution stress the fungal community was less sensitive to the impact of mining contamination the abundance and diversity of fungi under pollution gradients did not show significant variation fig 1e and f however the diversity of the fungal community changed significantly with seasonal changes fig 1g and h implying a distinct seasonal secession of the fungal community it has been reported that fungi may be influenced by environmental factors and spatial isolation however the overall changes could be better explained by seasonality zhang et al 2021 differences in ecological responses between prokaryotic and fungal kingdoms have also been reported barnard et al 2013 wang et al 2018 however the mechanisms still require further investigation fungi are considered to have better capabilities to obtain resources than bacteria as their growth pattern provides wider access to nutrients from the surrounding environment and better maintains basal metabolism yuste et al 2011 fungi are also considered to be more resistant to arid and saline alkali stresses de vries et al 2018 in the present study the predominant fungi were found in the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota and rozellomycota which are similar to the taxonomic composition in stressed environments such as heavy metal polluted soils and hot spring sediments liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 most fungi in the ascomycota are lichenized fungi plant litter decomposers endophyte fungi or saprophytic nutritionists which play important roles in material circulation and energy flow in ecosystems narendrula kotha and nkongolo 2017 ascomycota may also be capable of denitrification and could participate in the release of n2o under aerobic conditions and denitrify via the complex adenosine triphosphate atp energy system under anoxic conditions aldossari and ishii 2021 at the class level it was found that acidophilic fungi such as sordariomycetes and sordariomycetes are enriched in hp samples which were also widely found in the acidic stressed environments sim et al 2018 compared to intensive research on bacteria research on fungal communities in mining environments has rarely been reported using the high throughput sequencing technique in this study more than thousands of fungal asvs were detected but 59 1 could only be assigned as unclassified table s1 indicating that more knowledge about fungi is needed these enriched fungi in ree mining areas should have good resistance to pollution stress and thus could be potentially important microbial resources for ecological remediation through abt analysis based on machine learning it was found that the critical environmental factors that mediated prokaryotic and fungal communities were also different fig s10 and s11 although ph is the most important environmental factor that mediates microbial communities in heavy metal mines in most reports kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 it is not the most crucial factor for the prokaryotic community in ree contaminated water rees concentration was identified as the most influential factor for the prokaryotic community in the studied water samples furthermore according to the cca and vpa analyses the speciation of ree significantly influenced the microbial community following the order of ree3 inorganic complexes ree so4 and ree co3 organic complex ree fa table s6 this is consistent with the bioavailability of different speciation free ions are believed to be the most mobile and readily available to microbes the formation of inorganic complex species e g ree so4 has little influence on ree bioavailability gu et al 2000 while organic matter om could significantly decrease ree bioavailability and thus alleviate toxicity by forming the ree om complex lachaux et al 2022 the influence of ree on microbial communities may be strongly related to the bioavailability of the different ree speciation such a relationship between rees speciation and the influence on prokaryotic community may also explain the different contributions of rees in their impacts in water and sediment fig s9 and s11 as reported in our earlier study liu et al 2019 rees in the colloidal particles and sediment were mainly associated with the fe al oxyhydroxides organic matters carbonates and clay minerals thus their bioavailability would be largely constrained and the direct influence on the prokaryotic community is further limited once in contact with the cell rees may precipitate with phosphates on the cell surface significantly changing the permeability of cells chen et al 2012 after entering the cell rees can inhibit the growth of microbes by competing for metalloenzyme active sites fujita et al 2015 destroying basic physiological processes rezanka et al 2016 promoting cell agglomeration bergsten torralba et al 2020 causing severe gene toxicity hanana et al 2021 and reducing the reproduction rezanka et al 2016 remarkably different with heavy metals rees were recently reported with special roles in mediating microbial growth and metabolism in addition to the negative impacts such as the low carbon metabolism associated with carbon capture processes chistoserdova 2011 skovran and martinez gomez 2015 such a positive influence would be involved in the microbial community succession in rees disturbing habitats however to date ree dependent enzymes have only been found in bacteria good et al 2016 keltjens et al 2014 which may explain why the impact of rees on the prokaryotic community was more significant but that on the fungal community was very limited in this study in addition to amplicon analysis techniques including metagenomics transcriptome analysis and culturomics would help to further explore the mechanisms by which rees influence microbial community composition and microbial metabolism 4 2 fungal community network was more stable than prokaryotic community the interactions among microbial species including both positive co occurrence and negative exclusion interactions and the modularity of the ecological network directly influence the stability of microbial communities coyte et al 2015 de vries et al 2018 grilli et al 2016 hernandez et al 2021 in the present study the prokaryotic and fungal co occurrence networks showed distinguishing characteristics table s3 and s4 and also changed differently with contamination fig 3 and table s4 the prokaryotic community had higher connectivity and centralization and features with low modularity table s4 therefore it would be less stable than the fungal community when disturbed by contamination the ratio of positive links to modularity was higher in the prokaryotic community than in the fungal community in ck fig s6 and s7 which results in poor stability under stress a high ratio of positive links refers to a high ratio of niche overlap and or positive interactions among the taxonomic groups barberan et al 2012 according to the stress gradient hypothesis which was firstly put forward by piccardi et al 2019 that the microbes in the community tended to facilitate each other rather than to compete when under stressed environment bacteria could cooperate during detoxification or cross feeding processes such as the symbiotic relationship between acidiphilium and ferrovum in surface water hammarlund and harcombe 2019 piccardi et al 2019 however such positive relationship may also bring damage to the community stability for the reason that the positive feedback loop between the positively associated microbes would accelerate the collapse within the network coyte et al 2015 stone 2020 additionally due to the high inter module connectivity the low modularity in the prokaryotic community aggravates the instability coyte et al 2015 grilli et al 2016 hernandez et al 2021 differences in the network structure between prokaryotes and fungi have also been reported in microbial communities under drought conditions under arid stress the bacterial network was reportedly destabilized while the fungal community remained stable de vries et al 2018 bacteria archaea and fungi vary significantly in size farjalla et al 2012 luan et al 2020 and have varying metabolic characteristics delong et al 2010 dispersal potential and interactions with the host or other microbes cottenie 2005 these differences would then influence the taxonomic composition and community assembly presently contamination due to ree mining promoted inter kingdom negative interactions between prokaryotic and fungal communities fig 3b and c in addition the results also suggest that the complexity of the ecological network and the number of keystone species decline as affected by wastewater pollution from the ree mine for both the prokaryotic and fungal communities figs 3 and 4 previous reports have revealed the importance of network complexity and keystone species in preserving ecological functions de vries et al 2018 ruan et al 2020 changes in the structure of the microbial community network could reflect the hazards imposed by ree mining activities on the surrounding ecosystem interestingly positive links dominate in the intra kingdom co occurrence networks while the inter kingdom interactions in the polluted sites are dominated by negative associations which might be due to the competition for the same substrates between prokaryotes and fungi under the stress of contamination gao et al 2021 4 3 stochastic processes are more important for fungal community than prokaryotic community revealing the microbial community assembly would help understand the ecological mechanisms of the responses to environmental disturbances in depth wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 deterministic and stochastic processes are two controversial mechanisms for microbial community assembly the contributions of these two processes can be employed to estimate when where why and how the assembly process occurs chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 based on the systematic development null model analysis the relative contribution of deterministic processes i e homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection varied in different habitats pollution levels and seasons in the deterministic processes heterogeneous selection dominated in all the samples fig 5 and s9 this might be associated with the significant dissimilarity of community diversity among the two habitat types different pollution levels and seasons fig 2 for instance as sediment is often considered as the most heterogeneous habitat in aquatic ecosystems yao et al 2019 the contributions of heterogeneous selection were observed as higher in the sediment than in the corresponding water with the same pollution level fig 5 for another the heterogeneity in the chemical composition among polluted samples was higher than that in ck samples which would become further heavier due to the seasonal variations in water levels kumar et al 2013 this may also make chance for higher contribution of heterogeneous selection in polluted samples than that in ck fig 5 for stochastic processes i e homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation dispersal limitation showed the higher contribution fig 5 this is consistent with other s reports on the community assembly process in various aquatic ecosystems including river chen et al 2020 lakes jiao et al 2020 and marine environment zhang et al 2018 geographic distance was commonly considered as the main reason of dispersal limitation in previous studies hanson et al 2012 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however the influence of distance in this local study may not be as significant as that in the reported studies on larger spatial scales recently dispersal limitation was also found to contribute higher than homogenizing dispersal in an amd related local study she et al 2021 suggesting local factors may also hinder the microbial dispersal processes which requires more in depth investigations to illustrate the associated mechanisms remarkably we found that the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in the community assembly for prokaryotes and fungi are quite different and the mediating mechanisms vary with the pollution level fig 5 and s8 contrary to the prokaryotic community which is dominated by deterministic processes the fungal community is more strongly mediated by stochastic processes fig 6 in contrast to the prokaryotes filtered by environmental factors the fungal community assembly process may be governed more by the limitation of population dispersal caused by seasonal characteristics such as water quantity water yield temperature and vegetation coverage which is consistent with the observed seasonal secession of the fungal community it has also been found in the south pole logares et al 2018 and lakes in tibet liu et al 2020 that the community assembly processes for prokaryotes and fungi are mediated by different mechanisms the growth pattern of hyphae enhances the water absorption and nutrition assessment of fungi resulting in better resistance to environmental stresses thus limiting the influence of deterministic processes barnard et al 2013 yuste et al 2011 additionally the cell composition of fungi is usually more complicated in structure and function than that of prokaryotes massana and logares 2013 which would promote the adaptation of ecological niches and weaken environmental filtering effects the results of the diversity and co occurrence network analyses support this view figs 1 and 3 furthermore compared with prokaryotes fungi generally have larger body sizes and narrow metabolic plasticity based on the size plasticity hypothesis farjalla et al 2012 this may constrain the fungi dispersion in a relatively short distance wang et al 2020 and significantly hinder fungal migration e g from upstream to downstream or from surface of water body to benthic zone thus generate larger dispersal limitation than prokaryotic communities fig 5 and s9 due to the strong dispersal limitation the fungal community also showed more co exclusion links in the network which is consistent with other reports fukami et al 2010 powell et al 2015 in previous research and practical applications microbial communities have been used as an indication of environmental disturbances xu et al 2020 community diversity has also been employed to reveal the pollution situation and ecological recovery in mine remediation chao et al 2016 however it was found in this study that the declined contamination could promote the stochastic processes for either the prokaryotic or fungal communities suggesting that the microbial diversity would be difficult to predict during ecological succession nevertheless the results of this study would help to deepen the understanding of the impact of stochastic processes on microbial communities in mining areas and would also help to determine the favored conditions i e succession stages seasons or remediation strategies for stochastic processes 5 conclusions mining activities of ion adsorption ree mines bring environmental stress to aqueous microbes the long term application of the heap leaching technique has released a large volume of wastewater to the surrounding river streams acidified water and sediment and caused severe contamination by rees nh4 and so4 2 the ree mining wastewater featured distinguishing characteristics from typical amd caused by heavy metals in the present study the microbial community diversity and composition in a river polluted by ree mining wastewater was explored for the first time and the different responses of the two different kingdoms of prokaryotes and fungi to environmental disturbances were emphasized revealing the major network characteristics and assembly mechanisms the main conclusions are as follows 1 with regard to community diversity prokaryotic and fungal communities respond differently to ree mining pollution the prokaryotic community is significantly altered by contamination while the fungal community is less influenced by contamination but is more sensitive to seasonal changes in ree mining areas rees ph and nh4 are the most important environmental factors that mediate the prokaryotic community in the water but the influence of rees on the fungal community is limited 2 the co occurrence network of prokaryotes is characterized by high connectivity and centralization but low modularity and thus is less stable under environmental disturbances the fungal community exhibited a more stable network structure in the polluted sites the complexity of the networks and number of keystone species decreased while the ratio of inter kingdom negative links was promoted 3 contrary to the prokaryotic community which is dominated by deterministic processes the fungal community is more strongly mediated by stochastic processes the dispersal limitation is the key mechanism that controls fungal diversity stochastic processes are promoted when pollution is alleviated implying that the microbial community diversity would become harder to predict during ecological succession in mining areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15457,ion adsorption rare earth element ree deposits are the main reservoirs of rees worldwide and are widely exploited in south china microbial diversity is essential for maintaining the performance and function of mining ecosystems investigating the ecological patterns underlying the ree mine microbiome is essential to understand ecosystem responses to environmental changes and to improve the bioremediation of mining areas we applied 16s rrna and its gene sequence analyses to investigate the composition characteristics of prokaryotic bacteria archaea and fungal communities in a river impacted by ree acid mine drainage ree amd the river formed a unique micro ecosystem including the main prokaryotic taxa of proteobacteria acidobacteria crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota as well as the main fungal taxa of ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota analysis of microbial diversity showed that unlike prokaryotic communities that responded drastically to pollution disturbances fungal communities were less affected by ree amd but fluctuated significantly in different seasons ecological network analysis revealed that fungal communities have lower connectivity and centrality and higher modularity than prokaryotic networks indicating that fungal communities have more stable network structures the introduction of ree amd mainly reduced the complexity of the community network and the number of keystone species while the proportion of negative prokaryotic fungal associations in the network increased ecological process analysis revealed that compared to the importance of environmental selection for prokaryotes stochastic processes might have contributed primarily to fungal communities in ree mining areas these findings confirm that the different assembly mechanisms of prokaryotic and fungal communities are key to the differences in their responses to environmental perturbations the findings also provide the first insights into microbiota assembly patterns in ree amd and important ecological knowledge for the formation and development of microbial communities in ree mining areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rare earth element ree mine

elements with similar physicochemical properties including lanthanides scandium and yttrium cornell 1993 owing to their importance in emerging high tech industries intelligent electric equipment medicines and renewable energy the global demand for rees is increasing alonso et al 2012 industrial activities consume rees and discharge rees to ocean and terrestrial environments including seawater akagi and edanami 2017 ocean sediments consani et al 2020 river estuaries hatje et al 2016 river water and soil da silva et al 2018 liu et al 2019 discharged rees are toxic to living beings gonzalez

2021 owing to the bioaccumulation toxicity and environmental stress caused by rees contamination macmillan et al 2019 the ecological effects and environmental hazards of rees are of great concern adeel et al 2019 mining activities are the main sources of anthropogenic ree pollution zhong et al 2020 acid mine drainage amd generated during mining activities is an important path of pollutant transportation and often causes serious contamination and acidification of surrounding rivers by elements johnson and hallberg 2005 in contrast to traditional heavy metal amd ree amd generated by ion adsorption ree mines which are heap leached by ammonium sulfate during extraction is often accompanied by high concentrations of ammonia and sulfates in addition to concentrated rees rees are mainly present in the form of ree so4 and ree3 whose speciation and fate are largely influenced by ph iron fe aluminum al clay minerals and organic matter in the water and sediment liu et al 2019 similar geochemical features have also been found in rees containing neutral drainage from coal waste and washing plants shahhosseini et al 2017 mine wastewater pollution can significantly disturb the microbial ecosystems of archaea bacteria and fungi mining activities considerably change on the microbial community and alter its diversity and structure chao et al 2016 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2015 kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 correspondingly interplay of the microbial community with mine pollution or development of diverse metabolic potentials allow adaptation to environmental stress for instance the oxidation of iron and sulfur is an important energy source for acidophilic chemoautotrophic microorganisms which would also accelerate the acidification of mine water and the release of metallic sulfides aliaga goltsman et al 2015 baker and banfield 2003 for the limited organic carbon and nitrogen in mine wastewater baker and banfield 2003 functional groups involved in carbon and nitrogen fixation would play crucial roles in maintaining the nutrient supply assisting microbial community colonization and sustaining the stability of the mine ecosystem barrie and hallberg 2009 as a key question in microbial ecology and ecosystem management and recovery it is important to study the ecological responses of microbial communities to geochemical changes caused by mine wastewater this issue is not completely understood especially for ree mines the responses of the different microbes may also vary for instance fungi are often more resistant to environmental stress than prokaryotes bacteria and archaea however prokaryotes may be better restored than fungi de vries and shade 2013 de vries et al 2012 engelhardt et al 2018 these prior investigations provided insights into the influence of mining activity on the microbial community however a clear illustration of the assembly patterns of prokaryotes and fungi in mining areas and a mechanistic explanation of the different ecological processes are still lacking the community assembly mechanism is an important topic in the research on microbial ecological processes zhou et al 2014 knowledge of the assembly patterns is important in explaining the formation and succession of microbial community structures in mining areas community assembly is typically mediated by stochastic and deterministic processes ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 deterministic processes have been proven to be more dominant in bacterial community assembly in most cases hanson et al 2012 lindström and langenheder 2012 pontarp et al 2012 similar research on fungi is scarce although fungi are one of the key components of microbial ecosystems keeling and campo 2017 massana and logares 2013 thus far our understanding of the ecological processes involved in fungal community assembly is very limited fungi cells has organelles with multiple functions and the cell organization is more complex than prokaryote massana and logares 2013 these cell functions would then help fungi to develop more distinctive responses to environmental screening which may not be found in bacteria logares et al 2018 environmental filtering has been most considered in the deterministic process of microbial ecology study for mining areas numerous studies have shown that environmental ph metals and nutrients mediate the formation of a community structure chao et al 2016 kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 nevertheless the effects of the interactions among communities on assembly have been ignored especially the interactions between bacteria and fungi it has been demonstrated that bacterial fungal relationships directly influence community stability and could accurately reflect changes in microbial ecological functions jiao et al 2021 hence it is critical to reveal the microbial community assembly and interactions to better understand the formation of microbial diversity and community secession in mining areas zhou and ning 2017 which is of significance for assessing the pollution remediation and ecological recovery of mining areas in this study an ree mining area in south china was investigated water and sediment samples were collected from polluted rivers during different seasons the significant gradient in geochemical characteristics within the study area provided ideal conditions to explore the microbial community responses to environmental disturbances in the ree mining area by analyzing 16s rrna and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer its amplicons we aimed to 1 identify the community diversity and taxonomic composition of prokaryotes and fungi in typical ion adsorption ree mining areas 2 reveal the co occurrence network and interaction characteristics between prokaryotic and fungal communities and 3 understand the inherent ecological mechanisms underlying the differences in community assembly between the microbes belonging to two different kingdoms 2 materials and methods 2 1

contamination in the studied ree mining area based on the physiochemical properties and chemical concentrations in the collected water and sediment samples chen et al 2022 it can be concluded that mining activities in the studied area seriously pollute the surrounding environment a significant gradient of geochemical conditions from upstream to downstream was observed p 0 05 according to the multiple physiochemical properties including ph nh4 no3 so4 2 ec tc and rees cluster analysis of water samples based on bray curtis similarity measurements suggests a clear distinction between hp mp lp and ck samples fig s2 for the aqueous samples ph is in the range of 4 17 8 06 6 49 1 10 average standard deviation whereas the hp samples feature with significant acidification p 0 05 ec is in the range of 37 1 1 39 103 386 313 μs cm 1 as affected by the long term extraction by ammonium sulfate the highest concentrations of nh4 39 8 22 8 mg l 1 and so4 2 213 110 mg l 1 were found in hp sites which far exceeded the highest pollution criteria of china s environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 the concentrations of rees in polluted water samples 5 56 14 1 mg l 1 varied significantly but were still much higher than that in ck samples 17 4 32 6 μg l 1 for sediment samples the highest concentration of rees was detected in mp sites instead of hp sites where the concentration of rees reached 621 195 mg kg 1 which was significantly higher than that in the ck samples 162 53 3 mg kg 1 the gradients of other physiochemical properties from upstream to downstream in the sediment were similar to those in the cover water with less deviations the ph values showed significant seasonal variation the lowest ph of all samples was 5 30 in winter and became more acidic 4 17 in summer the concentrations of nh4 and no3 also seasonally fluctuated with values of 75 4 mg kg 1 and 105 0 mg kg 1 respectively in winter and lower values in summer 58 1 mg kg 1 and 68 0 mg kg 1 respectively chen et al 2022 however the concentrations of rees in the water and sediment did not display significant seasonal differences 3 2 microbial community diversities in the studied area

diversity of the prokaryotic community was significantly affected by wastewater pollution from ree mines p 0 05 in the sediment the prokaryotic community α diversity generally decreased with elevated pollution levels fig 1b compared with ck the sediments of polluted sites had much lower α diversity p 0 05 the changes in prokaryotic community α diversity in the river water showed a different pattern the α diversity was increased in the lp and mp sites and was decreased in the hp site fig 1a the highest prokaryotic community α diversity was found in mp water the fungal community α diversity in either water or sediment samples did not display significant changes with the various pollution levels fig 1e and f suggesting a limited influence of mining pollution on fungal community α diversity comparison among seasons suggested higher prokaryotic community α diversity of water in autumn and winter than in spring and summer fig 1c seasonal comparison of sediment did not suggest significant seasonal fluctuations fig 1d for the fungal community the α diversities of water and sediment samples were higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter fig 1g and h for between sample diversity i e β diversity pcoa based on weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices was performed fig 2 and s4 the results of the prokaryotic community β diversity revealed that water and sediment samples clustered according to the collection sites with different pollution levels fig 2a and b indicating the significant impact of mining pollution on the river prokaryotic community p 0 01 no seasonal influence on β diversity of the prokaryotic community was observed in contrast the β diversity of the fungal community was not significantly influenced by pollution levels as summarized in fig 2c and d the first principal coordinate pcoa1 could only explain 18 6 water and 15 9 sediment of the variation between the samples collected from different sites suggesting a poor explanation of community changes by pollution levels 3 3 taxonomic composition of the microbial communities the microbial taxonomic composition at the phylum level is summarized in table s1 proteobacteria bacteroidetes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and crenarchaeota were identified as the dominant prokaryotic phyla in water samples accounting for 56 5 of the total relative abundance the fungal community was dominated by the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota which accounted for 33 1 of the total abundance fungi were not considerably abundant to explore the influence of water pollution the abundance of asvs was compared between hp and ck samples and enriched or depleted asvs were identified as illustrated in fig s5 and table s2 1346 prokaryotic asvs were enriched in hp water they mainly belonged to the orders rhodospirillales cenarchaeales burkholderiales and acidimicrobiales as well 1421 prokaryotic asvs were depleted they belonged to acidimicrobiales saprospirales sphingobacteriales and synechococcales relatively fewer differences in fungal asvs abundance were found between hp and ck samples a total of 343 asvs in chytridiomycota mortierellomycota and ascomycota were enriched whereas 238 asvs in chytridiomycota ascomycota and rozellomycota were depleted proteobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the dominant prokaryotic phyla 70 3 in the sediment ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla 31 3 table s1 as affected by water pollution a large number of asvs were enriched or depleted in abundance in the hp sediment compared with that in the ck sediment fig s5 and table s2 for the prokaryotic community 3253 asvs were enriched in the orders xanthomonadales rhodospirillales saprospirales and cenarchaeales and 1135 were depleted in oscillatoriales pseudanabaenales sphingomonadales and nitrospirales in the fungal community 153 asvs in mortierellomycota ascomycota and chytridiomycota were enriched and 159 asvs in basidiomycota ascomycota and rozellomycota were depleted 3 4 co occurrence network of the microbial communities the intra kingdom co occurrence networks of the prokaryotic and fungal communities are shown in fig s6 and s7 respectively according to the constructed co occurrence networks and the calculated topological indices table s3 and s4 the average network degree for prokaryotic and fungal communities was 9 6 and 6 3 respectively in the water and 7 8 and 8 2 respectively in the sediment the average total links were 1178 and 335 respectively for the prokaryotic and fungal communities in water and 897 and 460 respectively in the sediment the respective average clustering coefficient was 0 41 and 0 37 in water and 0 39 and 0 24 in sediment these results suggest that prokaryotic communities have a higher order organized co occurrence network in water than in sediment in contrast the fungal community has a more complex network in sediment than in water the fungal community was also found with a higher ratio of co exclusion negative links to modularity 11 3 0 39 in water and 23 0 0 37 in sediment compared with the prokaryotic community the ratio of negative links to modularity was 12 1 0 52 in water and 8 6 0 46 in sediment table s4 in the intra kingdom co occurrence network of the fungal community the top 10 hub nodes with the highest degree and closeness centrality were dominantly connected with other nodes via negative links which was especially significant in the sediment samples regarding the influence of pollution table s4 contamination weakened the positive correlations co occurrence links within the prokaryotic or fungal community but strengthened the negative correlations co exclusion links inter kingdom co occurrence network was constructed fig 3 a the results suggest that the introduction of wastewater due to ree mining activities destroys the stability of the microbial community network the ratio of negative links to modularity in the network of hp samples was 17 8 0 82 in water and 25 1 0 67 in sediment the ratios were lower than those in ck samples 11 2 0 184 in water and 36 0 0 61 in sediment as a result of pollution the number of nodes links and network degree significantly declined whereas the inter kingdom negative correlations were markedly enhanced fig 3 3 5 keystone species identified by the network analysis changes in the co occurrence network would alter the roles of the specific nodes in the community the nodes were classified as module hubs network hubs connectors and peripherals based on the calculated within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the model hubs and connectors have been identified as keystone species shi et al 2016 which are highly connected taxa which exert a considerable influence on microbiome structure and functions banerjee et al 2018 in total there were 16 prokaryotic species and 19 fungal species identified as keystone species in polluted samples which were much fewer than those identified in ck samples 31 prokaryotes and 26 fungi fig 4 and table s5 the keystone species in the polluted sites were mainly in the prokaryotic phyla proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae euryarchaeota and parvarchaeota also named micrarchaeota rinke et al 2021 in the gtdb database and the fungal phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota the keystone species in the ck samples were mainly in the prokaryotic phyla proteobacteria cyanobacteria tm7 actinobacteria bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia with the same fungal phyla as those in the polluted sites at the order level the keystone species in polluted samples were mainly in 12 prokaryotic orders including burkholderiales rhizobiales nitrospirales thermoplasmata and micrarchaeles and 16 fungal orders including hypocreales polyporales saccharomycetales eurotiales and xylariales the total relative abundance of module hubs and connectors in the polluted sites was 3 73 and 3 12 in water and sediment respectively 3 6 prokaryotic and fungal community assembly processes we calculated βnti and rcbray to quantify the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to prokaryotic and fungal community assembly in ree amd as summarized in fig 5 deterministic processes dominated the prokaryotic community assembly in water the total contribution of homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection was the highest in hp samples 77 9 followed by lp 76 9 mp 63 3 and ck 46 7 these findings imply that the pollution reinforced the deterministic processes in prokaryotic community assembly in the sediment prokaryotic community assembly was also dominated by deterministic processes with contributions of 73 6 70 6 79 7 and 68 5 for hp mp lp and ck sites respectively in contrast for fungal communities in water the assembly is more mediated by stochastic processes the contribution of stochastic processes was the highest in hp 61 4 followed by mp 58 8 ck 56 9 and lp 37 0 similarly stochastic processes also dominated the sediment fungal community assembly with contributions of 51 7 57 8 53 2 and 60 9 for hp mp lp and ck sites respectively these results could be supported by the ncm analysis fig s8 the goodness of fit r2 was better for fungal communities 0 621 0 750 in water and 0 677 0 786 in sediment than that for prokaryotic communities 0 456 0 468 in water and 0 442 0 52 in sediment in hp mp and lp samples indicating that the neutral assembly processes e g dispersal and ecological drift may play a more important role in fungal community assembly the seasonal variation of community assembly was also analyzed fig s9 although the results fluctuated with seasons the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to prokaryotic and fungal community had similar pattern in polluted water and sediments microbial communities face environmental stress abt analysis was performed to estimate the impact of different environmental factors on microbial diversity during the deterministic selection processes in water samples fig s10 the concentration of rees was found the most influential factor mediating the diversity of prokaryotic communities contributing 21 2 followed by nh4 17 1 no3 14 8 and ph 13 4 for fungi the impact of rees was much lower 3 02 while the major mediating factors were ph 22 4 no3 17 2 and so4 2 15 0 in sediments fig s11 the diversity of the prokaryotic community was mainly influenced by ph 23 1 nh4 18 3 and rees 11 7 whereas the fungal community was not very sensitive to ph or rees but was more associated with no3 30 0 aluminum 17 2 and copper 14 4 our previous study revealed that ree speciation including ree3 ree so4 ree co3 ree fa ree and fulvic acid complexation varied significantly from upstream to downstream in the same studied river fig s12 liu et al 2019 cca and vpa analyses were presently performed to evaluate the effects of ree speciation on prokaryotic and fungal communities the results indicate that ree speciation could significantly affect prokaryotic and fungal communities with similar patterns table s6 ree3 explained the largest community variation 12 57 and 9 05 for prokaryotic and fungal communities respectively followed by inorganic ree so4 and ree co3 and organic ree fa complex species of ree 4 discussions 4 1 prokaryotes and fungi responded differently to pollution and seasonal changes wastewater from ree mines imposes selective stress to the river environment this can allow prokaryotic phyla able to adapt to the extreme environment such as acidobacteria bacteroidetes crenarchaeota od1 proteobacteria and nitrospirae to occupy the major niche remarkably archaea such as crenarchaeota were very abundant in hp water samples up to 40 table s1 generally archaea are widely found typically in low numbers in some typical amd waters baker et al 2006 lopez archilla et al 2001 ziegler et al 2013 however archaea have been reported to play crucial roles in specific microecological systems surrounding mines baker et al 2006 hua et al 2015 lopez archilla et al 2001 ziegler et al 2013 for ree mines the ecological roles of the archaeal community especially their potential roles in ecological recovery require further in depth investigation contrary to the sensitive responses of prokaryotes to pollution stress the fungal community was less sensitive to the impact of mining contamination the abundance and diversity of fungi under pollution gradients did not show significant variation fig 1e and f however the diversity of the fungal community changed significantly with seasonal changes fig 1g and h implying a distinct seasonal secession of the fungal community it has been reported that fungi may be influenced by environmental factors and spatial isolation however the overall changes could be better explained by seasonality zhang et al 2021 differences in ecological responses between prokaryotic and fungal kingdoms have also been reported barnard et al 2013 wang et al 2018 however the mechanisms still require further investigation fungi are considered to have better capabilities to obtain resources than bacteria as their growth pattern provides wider access to nutrients from the surrounding environment and better maintains basal metabolism yuste et al 2011 fungi are also considered to be more resistant to arid and saline alkali stresses de vries et al 2018 in the present study the predominant fungi were found in the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota and rozellomycota which are similar to the taxonomic composition in stressed environments such as heavy metal polluted soils and hot spring sediments liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 most fungi in the ascomycota are lichenized fungi plant litter decomposers endophyte fungi or saprophytic nutritionists which play important roles in material circulation and energy flow in ecosystems narendrula kotha and nkongolo 2017 ascomycota may also be capable of denitrification and could participate in the release of n2o under aerobic conditions and denitrify via the complex adenosine triphosphate atp energy system under anoxic conditions aldossari and ishii 2021 at the class level it was found that acidophilic fungi such as sordariomycetes and sordariomycetes are enriched in hp samples which were also widely found in the acidic stressed environments sim et al 2018 compared to intensive research on bacteria research on fungal communities in mining environments has rarely been reported using the high throughput sequencing technique in this study more than thousands of fungal asvs were detected but 59 1 could only be assigned as unclassified table s1 indicating that more knowledge about fungi is needed these enriched fungi in ree mining areas should have good resistance to pollution stress and thus could be potentially important microbial resources for ecological remediation through abt analysis based on machine learning it was found that the critical environmental factors that mediated prokaryotic and fungal communities were also different fig s10 and s11 although ph is the most important environmental factor that mediates microbial communities in heavy metal mines in most reports kuang et al 2013 xu et al 2020 it is not the most crucial factor for the prokaryotic community in ree contaminated water rees concentration was identified as the most influential factor for the prokaryotic community in the studied water samples furthermore according to the cca and vpa analyses the speciation of ree significantly influenced the microbial community following the order of ree3 inorganic complexes ree so4 and ree co3 organic complex ree fa table s6 this is consistent with the bioavailability of different speciation free ions are believed to be the most mobile and readily available to microbes the formation of inorganic complex species e g ree so4 has little influence on ree bioavailability gu et al 2000 while organic matter om could significantly decrease ree bioavailability and thus alleviate toxicity by forming the ree om complex lachaux et al 2022 the influence of ree on microbial communities may be strongly related to the bioavailability of the different ree speciation such a relationship between rees speciation and the influence on prokaryotic community may also explain the different contributions of rees in their impacts in water and sediment fig s9 and s11 as reported in our earlier study liu et al 2019 rees in the colloidal particles and sediment were mainly associated with the fe al oxyhydroxides organic matters carbonates and clay minerals thus their bioavailability would be largely constrained and the direct influence on the prokaryotic community is further limited once in contact with the cell rees may precipitate with phosphates on the cell surface significantly changing the permeability of cells chen et al 2012 after entering the cell rees can inhibit the growth of microbes by competing for metalloenzyme active sites fujita et al 2015 destroying basic physiological processes rezanka et al 2016 promoting cell agglomeration bergsten torralba et al 2020 causing severe gene toxicity hanana et al 2021 and reducing the reproduction rezanka et al 2016 remarkably different with heavy metals rees were recently reported with special roles in mediating microbial growth and metabolism in addition to the negative impacts such as the low carbon metabolism associated with carbon capture processes chistoserdova 2011 skovran and martinez gomez 2015 such a positive influence would be involved in the microbial community succession in rees disturbing habitats however to date ree dependent enzymes have only been found in bacteria good et al 2016 keltjens et al 2014 which may explain why the impact of rees on the prokaryotic community was more significant but that on the fungal community was very limited in this study in addition to amplicon analysis techniques including metagenomics transcriptome analysis and culturomics would help to further explore the mechanisms by which rees influence microbial community composition and microbial metabolism 4 2 fungal community network was more stable than prokaryotic community the interactions among microbial species including both positive co occurrence and negative exclusion interactions and the modularity of the ecological network directly influence the stability of microbial communities coyte et al 2015 de vries et al 2018 grilli et al 2016 hernandez et al 2021 in the present study the prokaryotic and fungal co occurrence networks showed distinguishing characteristics table s3 and s4 and also changed differently with contamination fig 3 and table s4 the prokaryotic community had higher connectivity and centralization and features with low modularity table s4 therefore it would be less stable than the fungal community when disturbed by contamination the ratio of positive links to modularity was higher in the prokaryotic community than in the fungal community in ck fig s6 and s7 which results in poor stability under stress a high ratio of positive links refers to a high ratio of niche overlap and or positive interactions among the taxonomic groups barberan et al 2012 according to the stress gradient hypothesis which was firstly put forward by piccardi et al 2019 that the microbes in the community tended to facilitate each other rather than to compete when under stressed environment bacteria could cooperate during detoxification or cross feeding processes such as the symbiotic relationship between acidiphilium and ferrovum in surface water hammarlund and harcombe 2019 piccardi et al 2019 however such positive relationship may also bring damage to the community stability for the reason that the positive feedback loop between the positively associated microbes would accelerate the collapse within the network coyte et al 2015 stone 2020 additionally due to the high inter module connectivity the low modularity in the prokaryotic community aggravates the instability coyte et al 2015 grilli et al 2016 hernandez et al 2021 differences in the network structure between prokaryotes and fungi have also been reported in microbial communities under drought conditions under arid stress the bacterial network was reportedly destabilized while the fungal community remained stable de vries et al 2018 bacteria archaea and fungi vary significantly in size farjalla et al 2012 luan et al 2020 and have varying metabolic characteristics delong et al 2010 dispersal potential and interactions with the host or other microbes cottenie 2005 these differences would then influence the taxonomic composition and community assembly presently contamination due to ree mining promoted inter kingdom negative interactions between prokaryotic and fungal communities fig 3b and c in addition the results also suggest that the complexity of the ecological network and the number of keystone species decline as affected by wastewater pollution from the ree mine for both the prokaryotic and fungal communities figs 3 and 4 previous reports have revealed the importance of network complexity and keystone species in preserving ecological functions de vries et al 2018 ruan et al 2020 changes in the structure of the microbial community network could reflect the hazards imposed by ree mining activities on the surrounding ecosystem interestingly positive links dominate in the intra kingdom co occurrence networks while the inter kingdom interactions in the polluted sites are dominated by negative associations which might be due to the competition for the same substrates between prokaryotes and fungi under the stress of contamination gao et al 2021 4 3 stochastic processes are more important for fungal community than prokaryotic community revealing the microbial community assembly would help understand the ecological mechanisms of the responses to environmental disturbances in depth wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 deterministic and stochastic processes are two controversial mechanisms for microbial community assembly the contributions of these two processes can be employed to estimate when where why and how the assembly process occurs chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 based on the systematic development null model analysis the relative contribution of deterministic processes i e homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection varied in different habitats pollution levels and seasons in the deterministic processes heterogeneous selection dominated in all the samples fig 5 and s9 this might be associated with the significant dissimilarity of community diversity among the two habitat types different pollution levels and seasons fig 2 for instance as sediment is often considered as the most heterogeneous habitat in aquatic ecosystems yao et al 2019 the contributions of heterogeneous selection were observed as higher in the sediment than in the corresponding water with the same pollution level fig 5 for another the heterogeneity in the chemical composition among polluted samples was higher than that in ck samples which would become further heavier due to the seasonal variations in water levels kumar et al 2013 this may also make chance for higher contribution of heterogeneous selection in polluted samples than that in ck fig 5 for stochastic processes i e homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation dispersal limitation showed the higher contribution fig 5 this is consistent with other s reports on the community assembly process in various aquatic ecosystems including river chen et al 2020 lakes jiao et al 2020 and marine environment zhang et al 2018 geographic distance was commonly considered as the main reason of dispersal limitation in previous studies hanson et al 2012 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however the influence of distance in this local study may not be as significant as that in the reported studies on larger spatial scales recently dispersal limitation was also found to contribute higher than homogenizing dispersal in an amd related local study she et al 2021 suggesting local factors may also hinder the microbial dispersal processes which requires more in depth investigations to illustrate the associated mechanisms remarkably we found that the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in the community assembly for prokaryotes and fungi are quite different and the mediating mechanisms vary with the pollution level fig 5 and s8 contrary to the prokaryotic community which is dominated by deterministic processes the fungal community is more strongly mediated by stochastic processes fig 6 in contrast to the prokaryotes filtered by environmental factors the fungal community assembly process may be governed more by the limitation of population dispersal caused by seasonal characteristics such as water quantity water yield temperature and vegetation coverage which is consistent with the observed seasonal secession of the fungal community it has also been found in the south pole logares et al 2018 and lakes in tibet liu et al 2020 that the community assembly processes for prokaryotes and fungi are mediated by different mechanisms the growth pattern of hyphae enhances the water absorption and nutrition assessment of fungi resulting in better resistance to environmental stresses thus limiting the influence of deterministic processes barnard et al 2013 yuste et al 2011 additionally the cell composition of fungi is usually more complicated in structure and function than that of prokaryotes massana and logares 2013 which would promote the adaptation of ecological niches and weaken environmental filtering effects the results of the diversity and co occurrence network analyses support this view figs 1 and 3 furthermore compared with prokaryotes fungi generally have larger body sizes and narrow metabolic plasticity based on the size plasticity hypothesis farjalla et al 2012 this may constrain the fungi dispersion in a relatively short distance wang et al 2020 and significantly hinder fungal migration e g from upstream to downstream or from surface of water body to benthic zone thus generate larger dispersal limitation than prokaryotic communities fig 5 and s9 due to the strong dispersal limitation the fungal community also showed more co exclusion links in the network which is consistent with other reports fukami et al 2010 powell et al 2015 in previous research and practical applications microbial communities have been used as an indication of environmental disturbances xu et al 2020 community diversity has also been employed to reveal the pollution situation and ecological recovery in mine remediation chao et al 2016 however it was found in this study that the declined contamination could promote the stochastic processes for either the prokaryotic or fungal communities suggesting that the microbial diversity would be difficult to predict during ecological succession nevertheless the results of this study would help to deepen the understanding of the impact of stochastic processes on microbial communities in mining areas and would also help to determine the favored conditions i e succession stages seasons or remediation strategies for stochastic processes 5 conclusions mining activities of ion adsorption ree mines bring environmental stress to aqueous microbes the long term application of the heap leaching technique has released a large volume of wastewater to the surrounding river streams acidified water and sediment and caused severe contamination by rees nh4 and so4 2 the ree mining wastewater featured distinguishing characteristics from typical amd caused by heavy metals in the present study the microbial community diversity and composition in a river polluted by ree mining wastewater was explored for the first time and the different responses of the two different kingdoms of prokaryotes and fungi to environmental disturbances were emphasized revealing the major network characteristics and assembly mechanisms the main conclusions are as follows 1 with regard to community diversity prokaryotic and fungal communities respond differently to ree mining pollution the prokaryotic community is significantly altered by contamination while the fungal community is less influenced by contamination but is more sensitive to seasonal changes in ree mining areas rees ph and nh4 are the most important environmental factors that mediate the prokaryotic community in the water but the influence of rees on the fungal community is limited 2 the co occurrence network of prokaryotes is characterized by high connectivity and centralization but low modularity and thus is less stable under environmental disturbances the fungal community exhibited a more stable network structure in the polluted sites the complexity of the networks and number of keystone species decreased while the ratio of inter kingdom negative links was promoted 3 contrary to the prokaryotic community which is dominated by deterministic processes the fungal community is more strongly mediated by stochastic processes the dispersal limitation is the key mechanism that controls fungal diversity stochastic processes are promoted when pollution is alleviated implying that the microbial community diversity would become harder to predict during ecological succession in mining areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15458,uv chlor am ine are efficient for achieving multiple barrier disinfection and maintaining residuals while bromide br has notable impacts on the formation and toxicity of halonitromethanes hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection this study investigated the effects of br on hnms formation and toxicity alteration during uv chlor am ine disinfection of nitrate containing humic acid ha water results reveal that the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was 12 03 μg l 1 with 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 22 5 higher than that without br and the predominant species of hnms were converted from trichloronitromethane tcnm to dibromonitromethane dbnm and tribromonitromethane tbnm however the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection was 3 69 μg l 1 with 0 2 mg l 1 br which was increased by 26 0 than that without br and the predominant species of hnms were converted from dichloronitromethane dcnm to bromochloronitromethane bcnm and dbnm notably the hnms species and yields during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection primarily due to the higher concentrations of ho and reactive chlorine bromine species in uv chlorine also in the ranges of the br cl2 molar ratio from 0 to 0 32 and ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 16 and acidic ph contributed to the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection and a high br cl2 molar ratio and neutral ph contributed to the hnms formation during uv chloramine disinfection note that the incorporation of br significantly improved the calculated cytotoxicity cti and genotoxicity gti of hnms formed and the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were 28 19 and 48 90 of those during uv chlorine disinfection based on the diversity of nitrogen sources the possible formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water were proposed during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br results of this study indicated that uv chloramine can reduce the formation and toxicity of hnms efficiently graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords halonitromethanes bromide uv chlor am

disinfection by products dbps and bacteria meet the requirements of water quality safety song et al 2021 e g ultraviolet uv uv chlor am ine ozone and chlorine dioxide previous studies found that the use of alternative disinfectants reduced regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids formation in some cases these processes however increased the formation of other dbps that were more geno and cytotoxic than the regulated dbps guo et al 2016 hua et al 2022 uv irradiation is being increasingly used as an alternative treatment for drinking water since it is very effective at inactivating chlorine resistant pathogens such as cryptosporidium tian et al 2020 pre chlor am ination have been used as common oxidation methods in many drinking water treatment plants for controlling algae growth enhancing coagulation flocculation and degradation of pollutants etc and about 30 of utilities apply these disinfectants upstream of uv reactors zhang et al 2019 the uv chlor am ine co exposure derives from the uv photolysis of free chlorine and or chloramine and it s easy to retrofit the uv chlor am ine process into the existing treatment train by adding a compact uv system after chlorine or chloramine dosing which can provide residual chlorine for the distribution systems fang et al 2014 the uv chlorine can produce ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl cl2 and clo through the photolysis of free chlorine wang et al 2021 rcs play an important role in the degradation of some pollutants due to their relatively high oxidation capacities wang et al 2021 compared with free

nitrifying compounds through hydroxylation nitrosation and nitrification ge et al 2019 humic acid ha is the main component of natural organic matter nom in water and tremendous efforts have been made to remove ha from aqueous solutions before disinfection process including coagulation flocculation and filtration ates et al 2007 however these traditional processes have limited removal capacity of ha approximately 35 and may lead to spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution systems to raise customer complaints previous study also noted that the interaction between free radicals and nitrogen containing compounds in ha may induce the formation of nitrogen containing dbps n dbps during uv chlor am ine disinfection gao et al 2020 shah et al 2011 proposed that uv photolysis of nitrate produced nitrite no2 and onooh which all could enhance trichloronitromethane tcnm formation in filter water effluents thus it is a possibility that nitrate competes with chlor am ine for photons by a series of free radical chain reactions during uv chlor am ine disinfection of water containing nitrate which results in the changes in hnms formation and the calculated toxicity to date the potential risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection have not been widely recognized in water containing nitrate and corresponding mechanisms need to be further explored at

oliveras 1998 and thus the participation of br induces a series of free radical chain reactions during uv chlor am ine disinfection which makes the hnms formation more complicated impressively no and no2 are produced during uv chloramine disinfection which can react with unsaturated organic substances or organic free radicals free radicals centered on carbon and oxygen to form nitro compounds via addition while cl and ho attack unsaturated compounds to produce chlorinated products through hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and radical addition wu et al 2019b therefore free radical chemistry and hnms formation mechanism during uv chloramine disinfection are different from those during uv chlorine disinfection however fewer studies focused on the effects of br on the diversities of free radical chemistry and hnms formation between uv chlorine and uv chloramine toxicity alteration during water treatment is linked to water matrices and their transformation products many indicators such as the genotoxicity gti to genetically modified strains s typhimurium determined by the in vitro sos umu test and chronic cytotoxicity cti and acute gti to chinese hamster ovary cho cells can represent the toxicity of water samples plewa et al 2004 reifferscheid and heil 1996 the gti and cti to cho cells were observed to decrease significantly when uv photolysis combined with chlorine or chloramine was applied to drinking water lv et al 2017 the cti of water samples increased after uv chlor am ine treatment and was higher than that after chlor am ination alone wang et al 2017 hence toxicity alteration during the uv chlor am ine disinfection needs to be investigated further especially when br concentration of water is relatively higher the strong substitution capability of rbs may result in the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms and they are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than cl hnms hua et al 2021 also the metabolomics method proved that the cti of bnm is the highest among all hnms du et al 2017 however limited studies are concentrated on the effects of br on the toxicity and associated mechanisms of specific hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water therefore the influence of br on the water quality toxicity caused by the hnms formation is worthy of attention especially during uv chlor am ine disinfection to address these research gaps ha was mainly chosen for providing carbon source and sodium nitrate was selected as a precursor to investigating the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection and in depth knowledge of hnms formation and toxicity alteration in the presence of br the main objectives of this study included 1 explore the formation of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection 2 compare the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection with the incorporation of br 3 discuss the effects of cl2 br and ph on the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br 4 evaluate the cti and gti of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br and 5 investigate the hnms formation in natural water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br this study will help us to make effective control countermeasures when uv chlor am ine are adopted as disinfection of nitrate containing ha water in the presence of br 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and the details of chemical reagents are presented in the supplementary material table s2 all aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water the preparations and calibrations of ha stock solution and chloramine solution were provided in text s1 two natural water samples were collected between filtration and disinfection from the sewage treatment plant stp and the water supply plant wsp in nanjing city china and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the water quality parameters of natural water samples were shown in table s3 2 2 experimental procedures the photochemical reactor was set up according to our previous study deng et al 2021 a low pressure uv mercury lamp 254 nm was placed in the center of the cylinder for the photochemical experiment and a magnetic stirrer was arranged at the bottom of the reactor to ensure a uniform mixture of the reaction solution the photon flux i 0 entering the solution was determined to be 1 42 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 by iodide iodate chemical actinometry text s2 bolton james and linden karl 2003 the effective optical path length l was determined to be 4 67 cm by measuring the h2o2 photolysis kinetics text s2 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate e p 0 was 3 13 mw cm 2 in experimental work the reaction solution 1000 ml was buffered with 20 0 mm phosphate for adjusting ph ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 and measured with ph meter mettler toledo fe20 then 2 0 mg c l 1 ha 8 0 mg l 1 nitrate calculated as n 0 2 mg l 1 br and 5 0 mg l 1 chlor am ine calculated as cl2 were added to the reaction solution to observe the hnms formation under different uv fluence 20 0 ml samples were withdrawn from the reactor into a 25 0 ml brown glass and the samples were extracted with 2 0 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe subsequently a 1 0 ml mtbe layer was used for analyzing the concentration of hnms through gas chromatography gc all the experiments in this work were conducted in duplicate and the error bars represented the standard deviation of duplicate measurements 2 3 analytical methods the determination of hnms concentration is based on an improving us epa method 551 1 deng et al 2014 text s3 toc was measured by a vario toc analyzer elementar germany a comprehensive assessment of toxicity for forming hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection was investigated in text s4 bromine utilization factor buf and bromine incorporation factor bif were calculated to quantify the utilization and incorporation degree of bromine in hnms text s5 the intermediate products were analyzed by gc ms agilent 7890b 5977a usa according to our previous study deng et al 2022 2 4 kinetic model simulation the steady state concentrations of the reactive species during uv chlor am ine disinfection were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus 4 55 according to previous studies ge et al 2019 wu et al 2019b chlorine chloramine nitrate and bromine related reactions were considered when modeling the concentrations of radicals in ha water details of the reactions employed in the kinetic model have been listed in table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection the formation of hnms from ha water with uv fluence during uv chlorine disinfection without and with additional 8 0 mg l 1 nitrate was shown in fig 1 a the results showed that the yields of cnm dcnm and tcnm increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence whether nitrate was present or not which was consistent with our previous study deng et al 2021 the dynamic change of hnms yields was caused collectively by its simultaneous formation and degradation during uv chlorine disinfection and various free radicals and uv irradiation also contributed to the formation and degradation of hnms fang et al 2013 the steady state concentrations of ho cl clo and cl2 determined by the kinetic model were 2 45 10 10 2 75 10 14 5 55 10 18 and 7 47 10 14 m respectively in uv chlorine disinfection without additional nitrate table 1 as a typical dbps precursor ha is very sensitive to ho and rcs li et al 2016 among those free radicals the rate constants of cl clo and cl2 with ha ranged between 200 and 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 so rcs played a vital role in the degradation of ha during uv chlorine disinfection in the absence of nitrate ha provided a nitrogen source for the formation of hnms total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 1 11 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 1502 mj cm 2 and tcnm was the predominant species of hnms with the addition of 8 mg l 1 nitrate the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 9 82 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 2254 mj cm 2 which was 7 8 times higher than that without additional nitrate it indicated that the addition of nitrate significantly promoted the formation of hnms while ha mainly provided carbon source nitrate as nitrogen source absorbed photons to produce rns e g no2 and no eqs 10 15 goldstein and rabani 2007 yang et al 2019 the steady state concentrations of no2 and no determined by the kinetic model were 5 65 10 11 and 1 14 10 11 m table 1 respectively and the conversion of rns to don enhanced the hnms production also the involvement of no2 promoted the rapid degradation of organic matter in ha into nitrified compounds via hydroxylation chlorination and nitration which contributed to the formation of hnms hua et al 2021 note that the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 in the presence of nitrate determined by the kinetic model were 2 07 530 5 and 2 07 times higher than those in the absence of nitrate table 1 the results suggested that the involvement of rcs and rns facilitated the formation of hnms besides tcnm reached a maximum of 8 5 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 2254 mj cm 2 in the presence of nitrate which was 9 15 and 9 05 times higher than that of cnm and dcnm respectively fig s2 a therefore it is prone to form tcnm during uv chlorine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 10 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 11 n o 3 hv o n o o 12 n o 3 hv n o 2 1 2 o 2 13 n o 2 hv n o o 14 2 n o o 2 2 n o 2 15 n o 2 h o hv n o 2 o h the effect of nitrate on the hnms formation from ha water with uv fluence during uv chloramine disinfection was also studied fig 1 b showed that the yields of hnms first increased and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence whether nitrate was present or not which was similar to that during uv chlorine disinfection with the addition of 8 mg l 1 nitrate the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 1 63 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 751 mj cm 2 during uv chloramine disinfection which was 3 01 times higher than that without additional nitrate also the maxima of cnm dcnm and tcnm were 0 29 0 76 and 0 58 μg l 1 respectively and dcnm was the predominant species of hnms fig s2 b these phenomena were related to the increased yields of free radicals induced by nitrate photolysis in the absence of nitrate chloramine could produce nh2 under uv irradiation and the steady state concentration of nh2 determined by the kinetic model was 3 28 10 8 m table 1 and it provided a nitrogen source for forming hnms while in the presence of nitrate the increase of no2 and no production was beneficial to the nitration and nitrosylation of organic matter thus the participation of nh2 no2 and no together promoted the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection notably it could be found from the hnms formation that tcnm was the predominant species of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while dcnm was the predominant species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection whether nitrate was present or not also the maxima of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection with and without additional nitrate were 16 62 and 36 58 of those during uv chlorine disinfection respectively the results indicated that the formation of hnms was reduced during uv chloramine disinfection and the differences in the yields and predominant species of hnms between uv chloramine disinfection and uv chlorine disinfection were attributed to the diversities of oxidation kinetics and free radical chemistry according to the results simulated by the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of no2 no cl clo and cl2 during uv chloramine disinfection with nitrate were 1 60 10 12 4 21 10 9 1 54 10 17 5 09 10 16 and 5 29 10 17 m respectively table 1 although the production of rns during uv chloramine disinfection was higher than that during uv chlorine disinfection the low redox potential of rns limited the conversion of rns to don during uv chloramine disinfection li and blatchley iii 2009 soltermann et al 2013 meanwhile rcs was the predominant contributor to the degradation of ha and the oxidation capacity of uv chloramine was weakened due to its lower rcs concentration resulting in most organic compounds which could not be effectively degraded and producing fewer precursors of hnms that could be nitrified wu et al 2019a therefore the formation potential of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection was lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection and it is more inclined to produce dcnm during uv chloramine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 3 2 impacts of br on the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection as an important factor for forming br hnms and br cl hnms br cannot be ignored in water by measuring the uv absorbance of ha at 254nm the results presented in fig 2 showed the decline in uv absorbance of ha at 254nm during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br was faster than that in the absence of br also the total organic carbon toc analysis results suggested that the mineralization rate of ha in the presence of br was higher than that in the absence of br fig s3 and thus the existence of br effectively promoted the degradation of ha the incorporation of br resulted in changes in the reactive species and quantum yields during uv chlorine disinfection westerhoff et al 2004 with the additional 0 20 mg l 1 br the concentrations of rbs br br2 bro and brcl in the range of 1 26 10 12 1 68 10 11 m owing to the photolysis of hobr and the strong scavenging abilities of br on ho and cl eqs 16 20 cheng et al 2018 heeb et al 2014 von gunten and oliveras 1998 while the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 decreased by 24 5 55 7 and the concentration of clo increased by 6 32 times table 1 generally speaking organic matter is degraded by chlorine via breaking carbon bonds and rbs is more inclined to attack organic matter via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction with rate constants in the range of 105 1010 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2020 therefore bromine plays a significant role during uv chlorine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 16 h o b r b r

s 1 the effects of br on the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection were further investigated fig 3 a revealed the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 12 03 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 751 mj cm 2 with the incorporation of 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 22 5 higher than that in the absence of br it could be inferred that the formation mechanism of hnms was changed with the incorporation of br a previous study noted that about 40 of rbs reacted with don produced from ha or nitrate to form br hnms through electrophilic substitution during chlorine disinfection of water containing br langsa et al 2017 and the br released by rbs after the reaction was oxidized by the chlorine to cyclically produce rbs which promoted the formation of hnms also the results presented in fig 3 b showed that tbnm dbnm dbcnm bdcnm bcnm tcnm dcnm and cnm were detected during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br nevertheless the maxima of cnm dcnm and tcnm were much lower than those of br hnms and br cl hnms and uv fluence at the maximum concentration of cl hnms was higher than that of br hnms and br cl hnms the results demonstrated that the incorporation of br led to br hnms and br cl hnms being the dominant species of formed hnms especially tbnm and dbcnm besides the dissociation energy of carbon halogen c x bond decreases as the halogen shifts from chlorine to bromine and the dissociation energy of c br bond 280 kj mol 1 is lower than c cl bond 328 kj mol 1 this trend indicates that br hnms and br cl hnms are more easily decomposed by uv photolysis or radical oxidation than cl hnms table s6 huang et al 2019 which resulted in br hnms and br cl hnms to reach the maxima earlier than cl hnms moreover the effects of br on the hnms formation during uv chloramine disinfection were also studied fig 3 c showed that the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 3 69 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 1127 mj cm 2 in the presence of 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 1 26 times higher than that in the absence of br also the formation of dbnm bcnm tcnm dcnm and cnm was detected during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br fig 3 d the concentrations of dbnm and bcnm reached maxima of 1 64 and 1 28 μg l 1 at uv fluences of 1127 and 751 mj cm 2 respectively the maxima of tcnm dcnm and cnm were 13 3 33 9 and 12 1 of that dbnm and 17 2 43 8 and 15 6 of that bcnm the results demonstrated that the predominant species was converted from dcnm to dbnm and bcnm during uv chloramine disinfection with additional br while the yields and species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection according to the simulated results table 1 the steady state concentrations of ho rcs cl and cl2 and rbs br br2 and brcl during uv chloramine disinfection were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those during uv chlorine disinfection which revealed that the lower rcs and rbs production caused by the weak hydrolysis of chloramine reduced the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms during uv chloramine disinfection especially tbnm and dbcnm which contained more bromine compared to uv chlorine disinfection uv chloramine disinfection can be considered a more effective disinfection technique for reducing the formation of hnms especially poly hnms in the presence of br 3 2 1 effects of the br cl2 molar ratio the effects of the br cl2 molar ratio on the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection were shown in fig 4 a the results suggested that the maximum concentration of hnms increased from 9 90 to 17 96 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 16 and then declined to 11 15 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio continuously increased to 0 32 the results were different from those in previous studies indicating that the total amount of hnms formation was always increasing or not changed during chlorination or uv chlorine disinfection hong et al 2013 hu et al 2010 it was ascribed to the fact that in our study the antagonism caused by the increase of br over a wide range of br concentration affected both the formation and degradation of hnms the proportion of chlorine and bromine incorporated into hnms reached equivalent at a low br cl2 molar ratio the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio directly led to the increase of rbs due to the accelerated production of hobr obr which promoted the hnms formation quickly to achieve saturation relative to nitrate and ha however the excess hobr obr induced by a high br cl2 molar ratio not only resulted in the formation of bromate but also promoted the degradation of formed hnms therefore although the incorporation of br is beneficial to the formation of hnms the opposite effects brought by the formation and degradation of hnms resulted in the decline of hnms concentration when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 16 to 0 32 during uv chlorine disinfection in addition fig 5 a showed that the maxima of cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbcnm during uv chlorine disinfection decreased from 0 59 1 59 0 43 2 21 and 2 80 μg l 1 to 0 06 0 06 0 02 0 27 and 0 24 μg l 1 respectively with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio from 0 04 to 0 32 bdcnm was formed only when the br cl2 molar ratio was not exceeded 0 08 and reached a maximum of 1 31 μg l 1 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 04 the maximum concentration of dbnm increased from 1 81 to 9 00 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 and the maximum concentration of tbnm reached 11 81 μg l 1 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 16 with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio the formation of cl hnms and br cl hnms decreased while the formation of dbnm increased and the formation of tbnm increased first and then decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio the formed hobr and rbs reacted with ha and nitrate to form preferentially br hnms while the competition mechanism caused by the increase of hobr and rbs production may lead to the decline of cl hnms and br cl hnms moreover the substitution role dominated by rbs enhanced the conversion of c cl bond into c br bond at a high br cl2 molar ratio which was conducive to the formation of br hnms containing more bromine while br hnms was also more susceptible to being degraded than cl hnms huang et al 2019 eventually as shown by this study that tbnm was the dominant species of formed hnms when the br cl2 molar ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 16 while dbnm was dominant at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 32 during uv chlorine disinfection unlike uv chlorine disinfection the formation of hnms was positively correlated with the br cl2 molar ratio during uv chloramine disinfection fig 4 b the maximum concentration of hnms increased from 3 69 to 6 84 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 a high br cl2 molar ratio promoted the formation of hnms especially br hnms the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum at uv fluence of 1127 mj cm 2 when the br cl2 molar ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 16 and the uv fluence at the maximum concentration of hnms was 751 mj cm 2 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 32 the results illustrated that the hnms yields increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and the uv fluence at the maximum concentration of hnms declined which were different from the effects of the br cl2 molar ratio on the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection it was inferred that a high br cl2 molar ratio accelerated the hydrolysis of chloramine to yield hocl and the contributions of hocl hobr and reactive species involved in hnms formation had not reached saturation during uv chloramine disinfection besides the maxima of cnm dcnm tcnm and bcnm decreased from 0 20 0 56 0 22 and 1 28 μg l 1 to 0 09 0 0 01 and 0 45 μg l 1 with the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 and the maximum concentration of dbnm increased from 1 64 to 6 29 μg l 1 fig 5 b it indicated that the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio promoted the incorporation of bromine into hnms and dbnm gradually became the dominant species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection while the proportions of cl hnms and br cl hnms in hnms gradually decreased in general a low br cl2 molar ratio can effectively reduce the hnms production during uv chloramine disinfection which is essential for improving water quality security bsf and buf are used to quantify the degree of substitution and utilization of bromine in hnms respectively fig 6 revealed that bsf increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio during uv chlor am ine disinfection as mentioned earlier the br cl2 molar ratio had an important impact on the formation of br hnms and the maxima of br hnms were 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of cl hnms at a high br cl2 molar ratio a high br cl2 molar ratio contributed to the conversion from cl hnms and br cl hnms to br hnms as well the bsf increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence which can be explained by the stability of hnms decreasing as the halogen shifted from chlorine to bromine br hnms and br cl hnms were easily attacked by rbs rcs and ho to produce hnms containing fewer halogen atoms at high uv fluence which weakened the incorporation degree of bromine into hnms different from bsf buf decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio a fixed chlorine concentration limited the production of rbs as br in excess which resulted in the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms reaching saturation earlier at a high br cl2 molar ratio while the proportion of br participating in the formation of hnms decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio in addition the contribution of bromine effectively to the formation of hnms was reduced by the weak oxidizing property of chloramine wu et al 2019a and thus buf during uv chloramine disinfection was lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection 3 2 2 effects of ph effects of ph on the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection were investigated in the range from 6 0 to 8 0 fig 7 a showed that the maximum concentration of hnms was 15 27 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and the maxima of hnms at ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 accounted for 78 8 and 64 2 of that at ph 6 0 respectively the effects of ph on the hnms formation were attributed to the changes of various reactive species at ph 6 0 hocl and hobr are the absolute dominant species while ocl and obr are the main forms of chlorine and bromine respectively at ph 8 0 liu et al 2012 also the deprotonation process caused by a high ph weakened the reactivity of hocl and hobr to nitrate the apparent quantum yield φ and molar absorption coefficient ε of obr φobr 0 43 m einstein 1 ε obr 28 m 1 cm 1 are lower than those of hobr φhobr 0 75 m einstein 1 ε hobr 77 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm at an ambient temperature zhang et al 2020 this rule is also applicable to hocl and ocl yeom et al 2021 thereby the deprotonation also reduced the production of rcs and rbs at a high ph which weakened the formation potential of hnms besides acidic conditions enhanced the formation of tcnm and tbnm while the effects of ph on the formation of cnm dcnm bcnm dbnm bdcnm and dbcnm were not obvious fig s4 in general a higher ph conduces to decrease the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br in addition fig 7 b showed the effects of ph on the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection the results suggested that the maximum concentration of hnms was 3 69 μg l 1 at ph 7 0 and the maxima of hnms at ph 6 0 and ph 8 0 decreased by 20 3 and 34 7 respectively compared with that at ph 7 0 it revealed that the formation of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph during uv chloramine disinfection which was different from that during uv chlorine disinfection on the one hand acidic ph accelerated the conversion from chloramine to nhcl2 and hocl eqs 21 22 li et al 2018 patton et al 2018 nhcl2 0 82 mol es 1 and hocl 1 0 mol es 1 had higher quantum yields than chloramine 0 50 mol es 1 which enhanced the formation potential of hnms li and blatchley iii 2009 on the other hand the onoo produced from the photolysis of nitrate rapidly isomerized to no3 under acidic conditions and lost its oxidizing ability eq 23 loegager and sehested 1993 which resulted in a weakened degradation of don nitrate had a greater impact on hnms formation than chloramine primarily due to higher productions of no2 and no from nitrate ge et al 2019 the opposite effects caused by acidic ph reduced the hnms formation as shown by this study similar to uv chlorine disinfection the deprotonation process caused by alkaline ph reduced the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection besides the concentrations of cnm tcnm and dbnm reached the maximum of 0 28 0 21 and 1 64 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 6 0 and 7 0 respectively while the formation of dcnm and bcnm were slightly independent with the ph fig s5 it indicated that the effects of ph on the formation of hnms were related to the hnms species moreover alkaline conditions significantly inhibit the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br 21 2 n h 2 c l h n h 4 n h c l 2 22 n h c l 2 h 2 o h o c l n h 2 c l 23 h o n o o o n o o h h n o 3 2 h 3 3 effect of br on the toxicity alteration of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection the assessment of the potential toxicity of the water body is vital to judge the quality of disinfection methods and determine the influence of br on the toxicity effect after disinfection as shown in fig 8 the calculated cti and gti of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence during uv chlor am ine disinfection which was consistent with the changes in hnms yields it was worth noting that the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection owing to a lower hnms concentration during uv chloramine disinfection besides the nitrosated and nitrated products are considered to have higher cti and gti during disinfection of nitrate containing ha water chen et al 2020 wu et al 2019b thus the toxicity assessments of water body during uv chlor am ine disinfection need to be further explored in addition the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br were about 40 and 1 26 times those in the absence of br respectively fig 8 besides the increase of hnms yields with the incorporation of br correspondingly improved the potential toxicity of water body the ctis of dbcnm dbnm and tbnm were 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of tcnm and so the calculated cti of hnms formed was strengthened owing to br hnms and br cl hnms with higher cti du et al 2017 it is also shown in fig 8 that the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the absence of br in general tbnm and bdcnm were the most genotoxic of hnms manasfi et al 2017 while the fact that tbnm and bdcnm were not detected resulted in the less calculated gti during uv chloramine disinfection with additional br the cti of dbnm was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of cl hnms manasfi et al 2017 and the gti of bcnm was higher than that of cnm and dcnm thus the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed were dominated by dbnm and bcnm contributions during uv chloramine disinfection also the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were 28 19 and 48 90 of those during uv chlorine disinfection respectively the results demonstrated that the incorporation of br increased the potential risks of water quality during uv chlor am ine disinfection and uv chloramine can decrease the calculated cti and gti of the water body efficiently therefore the reasonable selection and optimization of the disinfection process are effective measures for reducing the potential toxicity of the water body 3 4 proposed the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br according to gc ms analysis data presented in fig s6 ha can be divided into aromatic ring structures containing hydroxyl groups ha i and aldehyde groups ha ii and aliphatic alkane structures containing carboxyl groups ha iii and amine groups ha iv table s7 based on the diversity of functional groups in general the decrease of electron withdrawing groups cooh and cho and the increase of electron donating groups oh and nh2 endow ha with a prominent fluorophore character traina et al 1990 besides the aliphatic organics containing amine groups ha iv ha i ha ii and ha iii mainly provide carbon sources for the formation of hnms while nitrate and chloramine provide nitrogen sources 3 4 1 nitrogen source in hnms from nitrate the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water were proposed by gc ms spectra fig s7 for measuring intermediate products during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br fig 9 a showed that nitrate could provide nitrogen source for the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection nitrate induced the production of no2 no onoo and n2o4 under uv irradiation no2 no onoo and n2o4 are all nitrating agents which can nitrify organic compounds to form nitro compounds important precursors of hnms shah et al 2011 nitration nitrosation oxidation and hydroxylation were the main ways of the formation of hnms from aromatic compounds while aromatic compounds were more likely to be attacked by the nitrating agents because of their high electron density hong et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 a scheme i ha i underwent nitration and nitrosation of no and no2 to form nitrosobenzene tp 1 refer to table s8 and nitrobenzene chen et al 2021 and the nitrated and nitrosated intermediates involved ring cleavage oxidation and substitution and were ultimately converted to hnms fig 9 a schemes ii and iii showed that ha ii and ha iii were first nitrated by rns to yield rch oh no2 or rc oh 2no2 via the aldehyde and decarboxylation pathways and then formed rccl2no2 rcbr2no2 and rcclbrno2 tp 2 refer to table s8 under the roles of rcs rbs and finally transformed into hnms owing to the substitution and oxidation of rcs rbs and ho however in ha isolates less than 10 of hnms was formed via the aldehyde and decarboxylation pathways li et al 2016 and the proportion of organics with phenolic hydroxyl groups i e ha i in ha reached up to 60 chin et al 1994 traina et al 1990 thus the nitration of ha i considered the dominant pathway for forming hnms overall the involvement of rns provided a reliable nitrogen source for the formation of hnms also the participation of rcs rbs and ho greatly guarantees the oxidation capacity of the disinfection processes and facilitates the formation of hnms while the concentrations of rcs rbs and ho during uv chloramine disinfection were lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection resulting in the less production of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection 3 4 2 nitrogen source in hnms from chloramine note that the pathways for the formation of hnms from precursors between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection were somewhat different although the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection had the same pathways as that during uv chlorine disinfection owing to the co involvement of hocl chloramine could be regarded as a nitrogen source for forming hnms while chlorine could not as shown in fig 9 b scheme iv the photolysis of chloramine induced to yield of nh2 and ha i reacted with nh2 to produce aromatic amine tp 3 refer to table s9 moreover the chloramination of ha ii and ha iii was beneficial to forming rch oh nhcl tp 4 refer to table s9 with the c n bond fig 9 b schemes v and vi and then the dehydration of rch oh nhcl yielded ch chncloh tp 5 refer to table s9 similarly the chloraminated and aminated intermediates involved ring cleavage oxidation and substitution under the oxidation and substitution roles of rcs rbs and ho and ultimately were converted to hnms also nh2 could be transformed into no2 and no owing to the role of dissolved oxygen and its contributions to the formation of hnms were similar to nitrate however a previous study reported that most of the nitrogen sources for the formation of hnms during chloramine or uv chloramine disinfection came from nom rather than 15nh2cl with 15n labeled yang et al 2012 therefore the contribution of chloramine is positive but not significant for the formation of hnms which is also one of the reasons for less production of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection 3 4 3 nitrogen source in hnms from ha in addition amine organics in ha can also as a precursor provide a nitrogen source for forming few productions of hnms the reactivity of amine organics depends on the side chain group attached to the α carbon the amino nitrogen is the nitrogen source for forming hnms and the formation of hnms requires the dissociation of the alkyl functional group hu et al 2010 as shown in fig s8 the pathway for the formation of hnms from ha iv during uv chlor am ine disinfection first underwent the chlorination and bromination of amino groups and then nh2 was oxidized by rcs rbs and ho which changed the n valence from 3 reduced state to 3 oxidation state afterward the formed nitrated intermediates participated in the formation of hnms 3 5 formation of hnms in natural water during uv chlor am ine disinfection natural water is more complicated as it contains various inorganic ions and organic substances to explore the formation of hnms in natural water two water samples from stp and wsp were investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection as shown in fig 10 a1 and a2 in the absence of br cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbnm were detected in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection while only cnm dcnm tcnm and bcnm were detected in stp and wsp during uv chloramine disinfection the maxima of hnms in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection were 2 29 and 1 87 μg l 1 and those during uv chloramine disinfection were 1 97 and 1 09 μg l 1 respectively the results revealed that the concentration of hnms precursor in stp was higher than that in wsp which enhanced the formation of hnms in stp also the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection while the ascent and descent rate of hnms yield during uv chloramine disinfection were faster than those during uv chlorine disinfection the existence of nom or effluent organic matter efom is inevitable in natural water and the nitrogen containing organic matter of nom or efom can promote the formation of hnms besides nitrate in natural water can also provide a reliable nitrogen source for forming hnms certainly nitrate may compete with nom or efom for reactive species and chlor am ine as well as uv photons during uv chlor am ine disinfection hua et al 2021 as mentioned before the total productions of reactive species eg rcs ho and rns during uv chloramine disinfection were lower than those during uv chlorine disinfection which may be one of the reasons for the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection similarly the formation of hnms in natural water was investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br results presented in fig 10 b1 b2 c1 and c2 showed that cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbnm were detected during uv chlor am ine disinfection with additional br or both br and nitrate compared with adding only br and both br and nitrate the maxima of hnms in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection increased from 2 81 and 2 09 μg l 1 to 3 54 and 2 87 μg l 1 respectively and those during uv chloramine disinfection increased from 2 48 and 1 90 μg l 1 to 2 74 and 2 52 μg l 1 respectively whether only additional br or both additional br and nitrate the hnms concentration during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection dcnm and bcnm were the dominant species of formed hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while dbnm and bcnm were those during uv chloramine disinfection the above mentioned results suggested that the incorporation of nitrate provided a nitrogen source resulting in an increased formation of hnms in natural water while nitrate did not alter the distribution of hnms formed during uv chlor am ine disinfection also the concentration of br hnms in natural water increased significantly during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br while the concentration of cl hnms decreased especially tcnm this trend demonstrated that the incorporation of br promoted the conversion from cl hnms into br cl hnms and br hnms in natural water which was consistent with that in the simulated water refer to fig 4 in summary the addition of nitrate enhanced the potential of hnms formation in natural waters and verified further the hnms formation in natural water containing both br and nitrate had a similar trend to that in the simulated water as shown in fig 10 d1 and d2 the formation of hnms in natural water was also investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br nitrate and ha the results showed a similar trend that the concentration of hnms in stp and wsp rapidly reached a peak value and then decreased gradually with the increase of uv fluence this trend verified the results presented in fig 3 in the simulated water owing to the addition of ha the hnms yields in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection increased by 3 44 and 2 15 times and those during uv chloramine disinfection increased by 2 80 and 1 86 times respectively which were much higher than those in natural water with additional br and nitrate this phenomenon revealed that the incorporation of ha provided an adequate carbon source for forming hnms in natural water dbnm bnm and bdcnm were found to become the dominant species owing to the incorporation of br during uv chlor am ine disinfection the hnms concentration in stp was higher than that in wsp because the concentration of doc in stp was higher than that in wsp refer to table s3 however the hnms species in natural water were less than those in the simulated water refer to fig 3 which may be due to inorganic ions such as co3 2 and hco3 in natural water acting as scavengers for ho cl and cl2 during uv chlor am ine disinfection as well the results presented in fig 10 d1 and d2 showed that the production of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection bnm was the dominant species of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while bdcnm was that during uv chloramine disinfection and the descent rate of hnms concentration during uv chloramine disinfection was faster than that during uv chlorine disinfection the above results suggested that the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection of natural water with additional br nitrate and ha was different from that during uv chloramine disinfection meanwhile it also verified further that the effects of br on the hnms formation in natural water containing nitrate and ha were similar to that in the simulated water during uv chlor am ine disinfection the composition of natural water is relatively complex and thus the formation mechanism and potential risks of hnms should be taken seriously especially in water bodies containing br and nitrate 4 conclusions the current research suggested that cl hnms br cl hnms and br hnms could be formed simultaneously during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br dbnm and tbnm were the dominant species of formed hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while bcnm and dbnm were those during uv chloramine disinfection the incorporation of br promoted the formation of hnms especially br hnms and br cl hnms while the species and yields of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection owing to the diversity of free radical chemistry additionally the formation of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and decreased with the increase of ph during uv chlorine disinfection while the formation of hnms increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph during uv chloramine disinfection the incorporation of br increased the calculated cti and gti of hnms and the calculated cti and gti during uv chlorine disinfection were higher than those during uv chloramine disinfection according to these findings the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br were proposed as shown by this study the risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection can potentially be enhanced by constituents such as br or inorganic nitrogen in real water matrices and due to the difference in the species and yields of hnms formed during uv chlor am ine uv chloramine could be considered a better disinfection process than uv chlorine for ensuring the safety of water quality in natural water containing br and nitrate in brief avoiding the existence of br and extending uv fluence will reduce the risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection meanwhile it is advised to remove hnms precursors such as nitrate as much as possible before the disinfection step to decrease hnms formation risks during such disinfection techniques

15458,uv chlor am ine are efficient for achieving multiple barrier disinfection and maintaining residuals while bromide br has notable impacts on the formation and toxicity of halonitromethanes hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection this study investigated the effects of br on hnms formation and toxicity alteration during uv chlor am ine disinfection of nitrate containing humic acid ha water results reveal that the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was 12 03 μg l 1 with 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 22 5 higher than that without br and the predominant species of hnms were converted from trichloronitromethane tcnm to dibromonitromethane dbnm and tribromonitromethane tbnm however the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection was 3 69 μg l 1 with 0 2 mg l 1 br which was increased by 26 0 than that without br and the predominant species of hnms were converted from dichloronitromethane dcnm to bromochloronitromethane bcnm and dbnm notably the hnms species and yields during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection primarily due to the higher concentrations of ho and reactive chlorine bromine species in uv chlorine also in the ranges of the br cl2 molar ratio from 0 to 0 32 and ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 16 and acidic ph contributed to the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection and a high br cl2 molar ratio and neutral ph contributed to the hnms formation during uv chloramine disinfection note that the incorporation of br significantly improved the calculated cytotoxicity cti and genotoxicity gti of hnms formed and the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were 28 19 and 48 90 of those during uv chlorine disinfection based on the diversity of nitrogen sources the possible formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water were proposed during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br results of this study indicated that uv chloramine can reduce the formation and toxicity of hnms efficiently graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords halonitromethanes bromide uv chlor am

disinfection by products dbps and bacteria meet the requirements of water quality safety song et al 2021 e g ultraviolet uv uv chlor am ine ozone and chlorine dioxide previous studies found that the use of alternative disinfectants reduced regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids formation in some cases these processes however increased the formation of other dbps that were more geno and cytotoxic than the regulated dbps guo et al 2016 hua et al 2022 uv irradiation is being increasingly used as an alternative treatment for drinking water since it is very effective at inactivating chlorine resistant pathogens such as cryptosporidium tian et al 2020 pre chlor am ination have been used as common oxidation methods in many drinking water treatment plants for controlling algae growth enhancing coagulation flocculation and degradation of pollutants etc and about 30 of utilities apply these disinfectants upstream of uv reactors zhang et al 2019 the uv chlor am ine co exposure derives from the uv photolysis of free chlorine and or chloramine and it s easy to retrofit the uv chlor am ine process into the existing treatment train by adding a compact uv system after chlorine or chloramine dosing which can provide residual chlorine for the distribution systems fang et al 2014 the uv chlorine can produce ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl cl2 and clo through the photolysis of free chlorine wang et al 2021 rcs play an important role in the degradation of some pollutants due to their relatively high oxidation capacities wang et al 2021 compared with free chlorine chloramine is more stable and beneficial in controlling the formation potential of dbps zhang et al 2022 besides the productions of ho and rcs chloramine is also induced to yield nh2 under uv

dbps and has been frequently detected in drinking water wastewater and swimming pool water hu et al 2021 in addition to amino acids azo compounds and algae organics reported in the previous studies nitrate as inorganic nitrogen maybe also the precursor of hnms during disinfection process bu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 sewage leakage agricultural runoff and rainwater may be the sources of nitrate range between 5 6 and 19 6 mg n l 1 xu et al 2019 a previous study revealed that the photolysis of nitrate induced the formation of reactive free radicals which reacted with organic matter to form nitrifying compounds through hydroxylation nitrosation and nitrification ge et al 2019 humic acid ha is the main component of natural organic matter nom in water and tremendous efforts have been made to remove ha from aqueous solutions before disinfection process including coagulation flocculation and filtration ates et al 2007 however these traditional processes have limited removal capacity of ha approximately 35 and may lead to spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution systems to raise customer complaints previous study also noted that the interaction between free radicals and nitrogen containing compounds in ha may induce the formation of nitrogen containing dbps n dbps during uv chlor am ine disinfection gao et al 2020 shah et al 2011 proposed that uv photolysis of nitrate produced nitrite no2 and onooh which all could enhance trichloronitromethane tcnm formation in filter water effluents thus it is a possibility that nitrate competes with chlor am ine for photons by a series of free radical chain reactions during uv chlor am ine disinfection of water containing nitrate which results in the changes in hnms formation and the calculated toxicity to date the potential risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection have not been widely recognized in water containing nitrate and corresponding mechanisms need to be further explored at present the detected hnms include chlorinated hnms cl hnms i e chloronitromethane cnm dichloronitromethane dcnm and tcnm brominated chlorinated hnms br cl hnms i e bromochloronitromethane bcnm bromodichloro nitromethane bdcnm and dibromochloronitromethane dbcnm and brominated hnms br hnms i e bromonitromethane bnm dibromonitromethane dbnm and tribromonitromethane tbnm table s1 marsà et al 2017 magazinovic et al 2004 noted that as an important factor for the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms the bromide br concentration in natural water is high reaching up to 4 1 mg l 1 br is rapidly oxidized to hobr obr by chlorine and the photolysis of hobr obr induces the production of reactive bromine species rbs e g br br2 bro during uv chlor am ine disinfection eqs 6 9 von gunten and oliveras 1998 and thus the participation of br induces a series of free radical chain reactions during uv chlor am ine disinfection which makes the hnms formation more complicated impressively no and no2 are produced during uv chloramine disinfection which can react with unsaturated organic substances or organic free radicals free radicals centered on carbon and oxygen to form nitro compounds via addition while cl and ho attack unsaturated compounds to produce chlorinated products through hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and radical addition wu et al 2019b therefore free radical chemistry and hnms formation mechanism during uv chloramine disinfection are different from those during uv chlorine disinfection however fewer studies focused on the effects of br on the diversities of free radical chemistry and hnms formation between uv chlorine and uv chloramine toxicity alteration during water treatment is linked to water matrices and their transformation products many indicators such as the genotoxicity gti to genetically modified strains s typhimurium determined by the in vitro sos umu test and chronic cytotoxicity cti and acute gti to chinese hamster ovary cho cells can represent the toxicity of water samples plewa et al 2004 reifferscheid and heil 1996 the gti and cti to cho cells were observed to decrease significantly when uv photolysis combined with chlorine or chloramine was applied to drinking water lv et al 2017 the cti of water samples increased after uv chlor am ine treatment and was higher than that after chlor am ination alone wang et al 2017 hence toxicity alteration during the uv chlor am ine disinfection needs to be investigated further especially when br concentration of water is relatively higher the strong substitution capability of rbs may result in the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms and they are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than cl hnms hua et al 2021 also the metabolomics method proved that the cti of bnm is the highest among all hnms du et al 2017 however limited studies are concentrated on the effects of br on the toxicity and associated mechanisms of specific hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water therefore the influence of br on the water quality toxicity caused by the hnms formation is worthy of attention especially during uv chlor am ine disinfection to address these research gaps ha was mainly chosen for providing carbon source and sodium nitrate was selected as a precursor to investigating the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection and in depth knowledge of hnms formation and toxicity alteration in the presence of br the main objectives of this study included 1 explore the formation of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection 2 compare the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection with the incorporation of br 3 discuss the effects of cl2 br and ph on the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br 4 evaluate the cti and gti of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br and 5 investigate the hnms formation in natural water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br this study will help us to make effective control countermeasures when uv chlor am ine are adopted as disinfection of nitrate containing ha water in the presence of br 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and the details of chemical reagents are presented in the supplementary material table s2 all aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water the preparations and calibrations of ha stock solution and chloramine solution were provided in text s1 two natural water samples were collected between filtration and disinfection from the sewage treatment plant stp and the water supply plant wsp in nanjing city china and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the water quality parameters of natural water samples were shown in table s3 2 2 experimental procedures the photochemical reactor was set up according to our previous study deng et al 2021 a low pressure uv mercury lamp 254 nm was placed in the center of the cylinder for the photochemical experiment and a magnetic stirrer was arranged at the bottom of the reactor to ensure a uniform mixture of the reaction solution the photon flux i 0 entering the solution was determined to be 1 42 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 by iodide iodate chemical actinometry text s2 bolton james and linden karl 2003 the effective optical path length l was determined to be 4 67 cm by measuring the h2o2 photolysis kinetics text s2 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate e p 0 was 3 13 mw cm 2 in experimental work the reaction solution 1000 ml was buffered with 20 0 mm phosphate for adjusting ph ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 and measured with ph meter mettler toledo fe20 then 2 0 mg c l 1 ha 8 0 mg l 1 nitrate calculated as n 0 2 mg l 1 br and 5 0 mg l 1 chlor am ine calculated as cl2 were added to the reaction solution to observe the hnms formation under different uv fluence 20 0 ml samples were withdrawn from the reactor into a 25 0 ml brown glass and the samples were extracted with 2 0 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe subsequently a 1 0 ml mtbe layer was used for analyzing the concentration of hnms through gas chromatography gc all the experiments in this work were conducted in duplicate and the error bars represented the standard deviation of duplicate measurements 2 3 analytical methods the determination of hnms concentration is based on an improving us epa method 551 1 deng et al 2014 text s3 toc was measured by a vario toc analyzer elementar germany a comprehensive assessment of toxicity for forming hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection was investigated in text s4 bromine utilization factor buf and bromine incorporation factor bif were calculated to quantify the utilization and incorporation degree of bromine in hnms text s5 the intermediate products were analyzed by gc ms agilent 7890b 5977a usa according to our previous study deng et al 2022 2 4 kinetic model simulation the steady state concentrations of the reactive species during uv chlor am ine disinfection were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus 4 55 according to previous studies ge et al 2019 wu et al 2019b chlorine chloramine nitrate and bromine related reactions were considered when modeling the concentrations of radicals in ha water details of the reactions employed in the kinetic model have been listed in table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection the formation of hnms from ha water with uv fluence during uv chlorine disinfection without and with additional 8 0 mg l 1 nitrate was shown in fig 1 a the results showed that the yields of cnm dcnm and tcnm increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence whether nitrate was present or not which was consistent with our previous study deng et al 2021 the dynamic change of hnms yields was caused collectively by its simultaneous formation and degradation during uv chlorine disinfection and various free radicals and uv irradiation also contributed to the formation and degradation of hnms fang et al 2013 the steady state concentrations of ho cl clo and cl2 determined by the kinetic model were 2 45 10 10 2 75 10 14 5 55 10 18 and 7 47 10 14 m respectively in uv chlorine disinfection without additional nitrate table 1 as a typical dbps precursor ha is very sensitive to ho and rcs li et al 2016 among those free radicals the rate constants of cl clo and cl2 with ha ranged between 200 and 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 so rcs played a vital role in the degradation of ha during uv chlorine disinfection in the absence of nitrate ha provided a nitrogen source for the formation of hnms total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 1 11 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 1502 mj cm 2 and tcnm was the predominant species of hnms with the addition of 8 mg l 1 nitrate the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 9 82 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 2254 mj cm 2 which was 7 8 times higher than that without additional nitrate it indicated that the addition of nitrate significantly promoted the formation of hnms while ha mainly provided carbon source nitrate as nitrogen source absorbed photons to produce rns e g no2 and no eqs 10 15 goldstein and rabani 2007 yang et al 2019 the steady state concentrations of no2 and no determined by the kinetic model were 5 65 10 11 and 1 14 10 11 m table 1 respectively and the conversion of rns to don enhanced the hnms production also the involvement of no2 promoted the rapid degradation of organic matter in ha into nitrified compounds via hydroxylation chlorination and nitration which contributed to the formation of hnms hua et al 2021 note that the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 in the presence of nitrate determined by the kinetic model were 2 07 530 5 and 2 07 times higher than those in the absence of nitrate table 1 the results suggested that the involvement of rcs and rns facilitated the formation of hnms besides tcnm reached a maximum of 8 5 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 2254 mj cm 2 in the presence of nitrate which was 9 15 and 9 05 times higher than that of cnm and dcnm respectively fig s2 a therefore it is prone to form tcnm during uv chlorine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 10 n o 3 hv n o 2 o 11 n o 3 hv o n o o 12 n o 3 hv n o 2 1 2 o 2 13 n o 2 hv n o o 14 2 n o o 2 2 n o 2 15 n o 2 h o hv n o 2 o h the effect of nitrate on the hnms formation from ha water with uv fluence during uv chloramine disinfection was also studied fig 1 b showed that the yields of hnms first increased and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence whether nitrate was present or not which was similar to that during uv chlorine disinfection with the addition of 8 mg l 1 nitrate the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 1 63 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 751 mj cm 2 during uv chloramine disinfection which was 3 01 times higher than that without additional nitrate also the maxima of cnm dcnm and tcnm were 0 29 0 76 and 0 58 μg l 1 respectively and dcnm was the predominant species of hnms fig s2 b these phenomena were related to the increased yields of free radicals induced by nitrate photolysis in the absence of nitrate chloramine could produce nh2 under uv irradiation and the steady state concentration of nh2 determined by the kinetic model was 3 28 10 8 m table 1 and it provided a nitrogen source for forming hnms while in the presence of nitrate the increase of no2 and no production was beneficial to the nitration and nitrosylation of organic matter thus the participation of nh2 no2 and no together promoted the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection notably it could be found from the hnms formation that tcnm was the predominant species of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while dcnm was the predominant species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection whether nitrate was present or not also the maxima of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection with and without additional nitrate were 16 62 and 36 58 of those during uv chlorine disinfection respectively the results indicated that the formation of hnms was reduced during uv chloramine disinfection and the differences in the yields and predominant species of hnms between uv chloramine disinfection and uv chlorine disinfection were attributed to the diversities of oxidation kinetics and free radical chemistry according to the results simulated by the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of no2 no cl clo and cl2 during uv chloramine disinfection with nitrate were 1 60 10 12 4 21 10 9 1 54 10 17 5 09 10 16 and 5 29 10 17 m respectively table 1 although the production of rns during uv chloramine disinfection was higher than that during uv chlorine disinfection the low redox potential of rns limited the conversion of rns to don during uv chloramine disinfection li and blatchley iii 2009 soltermann et al 2013 meanwhile rcs was the predominant contributor to the degradation of ha and the oxidation capacity of uv chloramine was weakened due to its lower rcs concentration resulting in most organic compounds which could not be effectively degraded and producing fewer precursors of hnms that could be nitrified wu et al 2019a therefore the formation potential of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection was lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection and it is more inclined to produce dcnm during uv chloramine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 3 2 impacts of br on the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection as an important factor for forming br hnms and br cl hnms br cannot be ignored in water by measuring the uv absorbance of ha at 254nm the results presented in fig 2 showed the decline in uv absorbance of ha at 254nm during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br was faster than that in the absence of br also the total organic carbon toc analysis results suggested that the mineralization rate of ha in the presence of br was higher than that in the absence of br fig s3 and thus the existence of br effectively promoted the degradation of ha the incorporation of br resulted in changes in the reactive species and quantum yields during uv chlorine disinfection westerhoff et al 2004 with the additional 0 20 mg l 1 br the concentrations of rbs br br2 bro and brcl in the range of 1 26 10 12 1 68 10 11 m owing to the photolysis of hobr and the strong scavenging abilities of br on ho and cl eqs 16 20 cheng et al 2018 heeb et al 2014 von gunten and oliveras 1998 while the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 decreased by 24 5 55 7 and the concentration of clo increased by 6 32 times table 1 generally speaking organic matter is degraded by chlorine via breaking carbon bonds and rbs is more inclined to attack organic matter via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction with rate constants in the range of 105 1010 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2020 therefore bromine plays a significant role during uv chlorine disinfection of nitrate containing ha water 16 h o b r b r

s 1 the effects of br on the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection were further investigated fig 3 a revealed the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 12 03 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 751 mj cm 2 with the incorporation of 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 22 5 higher than that in the absence of br it could be inferred that the formation mechanism of hnms was changed with the incorporation of br a previous study noted that about 40 of rbs reacted with don produced from ha or nitrate to form br hnms through electrophilic substitution during chlorine disinfection of water containing br langsa et al 2017 and the br released by rbs after the reaction was oxidized by the chlorine to cyclically produce rbs which promoted the formation of hnms also the results presented in fig 3 b showed that tbnm dbnm dbcnm bdcnm bcnm tcnm dcnm and cnm were detected during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br nevertheless the maxima of cnm dcnm and tcnm were much lower than those of br hnms and br cl hnms and uv fluence at the maximum concentration of cl hnms was higher than that of br hnms and br cl hnms the results demonstrated that the incorporation of br led to br hnms and br cl hnms being the dominant species of formed hnms especially tbnm and dbcnm besides the dissociation energy of carbon halogen c x bond decreases as the halogen shifts from chlorine to bromine and the dissociation energy of c br bond 280 kj mol 1 is lower than c cl bond 328 kj mol 1 this trend indicates that br hnms and br cl hnms are more easily decomposed by uv photolysis or radical oxidation than cl hnms table s6 huang et al 2019 which resulted in br hnms and br cl hnms to reach the maxima earlier than cl hnms moreover the effects of br on the hnms formation during uv chloramine disinfection were also studied fig 3 c showed that the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum of 3 69 μg l 1 at uv fluence of 1127 mj cm 2 in the presence of 0 2 mg l 1 br which was 1 26 times higher than that in the absence of br also the formation of dbnm bcnm tcnm dcnm and cnm was detected during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br fig 3 d the concentrations of dbnm and bcnm reached maxima of 1 64 and 1 28 μg l 1 at uv fluences of 1127 and 751 mj cm 2 respectively the maxima of tcnm dcnm and cnm were 13 3 33 9 and 12 1 of that dbnm and 17 2 43 8 and 15 6 of that bcnm the results demonstrated that the predominant species was converted from dcnm to dbnm and bcnm during uv chloramine disinfection with additional br while the yields and species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection according to the simulated results table 1 the steady state concentrations of ho rcs cl and cl2 and rbs br br2 and brcl during uv chloramine disinfection were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those during uv chlorine disinfection which revealed that the lower rcs and rbs production caused by the weak hydrolysis of chloramine reduced the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms during uv chloramine disinfection especially tbnm and dbcnm which contained more bromine compared to uv chlorine disinfection uv chloramine disinfection can be considered a more effective disinfection technique for reducing the formation of hnms especially poly hnms in the presence of br 3 2 1 effects of the br cl2 molar ratio the effects of the br cl2 molar ratio on the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection were shown in fig 4 a the results suggested that the maximum concentration of hnms increased from 9 90 to 17 96 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 16 and then declined to 11 15 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio continuously increased to 0 32 the results were different from those in previous studies indicating that the total amount of hnms formation was always increasing or not changed during chlorination or uv chlorine disinfection hong et al 2013 hu et al 2010 it was ascribed to the fact that in our study the antagonism caused by the increase of br over a wide range of br concentration affected both the formation and degradation of hnms the proportion of chlorine and bromine incorporated into hnms reached equivalent at a low br cl2 molar ratio the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio directly led to the increase of rbs due to the accelerated production of hobr obr which promoted the hnms formation quickly to achieve saturation relative to nitrate and ha however the excess hobr obr induced by a high br cl2 molar ratio not only resulted in the formation of bromate but also promoted the degradation of formed hnms therefore although the incorporation of br is beneficial to the formation of hnms the opposite effects brought by the formation and degradation of hnms resulted in the decline of hnms concentration when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 16 to 0 32 during uv chlorine disinfection in addition fig 5 a showed that the maxima of cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbcnm during uv chlorine disinfection decreased from 0 59 1 59 0 43 2 21 and 2 80 μg l 1 to 0 06 0 06 0 02 0 27 and 0 24 μg l 1 respectively with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio from 0 04 to 0 32 bdcnm was formed only when the br cl2 molar ratio was not exceeded 0 08 and reached a maximum of 1 31 μg l 1 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 04 the maximum concentration of dbnm increased from 1 81 to 9 00 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 and the maximum concentration of tbnm reached 11 81 μg l 1 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 16 with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio the formation of cl hnms and br cl hnms decreased while the formation of dbnm increased and the formation of tbnm increased first and then decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio the formed hobr and rbs reacted with ha and nitrate to form preferentially br hnms while the competition mechanism caused by the increase of hobr and rbs production may lead to the decline of cl hnms and br cl hnms moreover the substitution role dominated by rbs enhanced the conversion of c cl bond into c br bond at a high br cl2 molar ratio which was conducive to the formation of br hnms containing more bromine while br hnms was also more susceptible to being degraded than cl hnms huang et al 2019 eventually as shown by this study that tbnm was the dominant species of formed hnms when the br cl2 molar ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 16 while dbnm was dominant at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 32 during uv chlorine disinfection unlike uv chlorine disinfection the formation of hnms was positively correlated with the br cl2 molar ratio during uv chloramine disinfection fig 4 b the maximum concentration of hnms increased from 3 69 to 6 84 μg l 1 when the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 a high br cl2 molar ratio promoted the formation of hnms especially br hnms the total concentration of hnms reached a maximum at uv fluence of 1127 mj cm 2 when the br cl2 molar ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 16 and the uv fluence at the maximum concentration of hnms was 751 mj cm 2 at the br cl2 molar ratio of 0 32 the results illustrated that the hnms yields increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and the uv fluence at the maximum concentration of hnms declined which were different from the effects of the br cl2 molar ratio on the hnms formation during uv chlorine disinfection it was inferred that a high br cl2 molar ratio accelerated the hydrolysis of chloramine to yield hocl and the contributions of hocl hobr and reactive species involved in hnms formation had not reached saturation during uv chloramine disinfection besides the maxima of cnm dcnm tcnm and bcnm decreased from 0 20 0 56 0 22 and 1 28 μg l 1 to 0 09 0 0 01 and 0 45 μg l 1 with the br cl2 molar ratio increased from 0 04 to 0 32 and the maximum concentration of dbnm increased from 1 64 to 6 29 μg l 1 fig 5 b it indicated that the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio promoted the incorporation of bromine into hnms and dbnm gradually became the dominant species of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection while the proportions of cl hnms and br cl hnms in hnms gradually decreased in general a low br cl2 molar ratio can effectively reduce the hnms production during uv chloramine disinfection which is essential for improving water quality security bsf and buf are used to quantify the degree of substitution and utilization of bromine in hnms respectively fig 6 revealed that bsf increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio during uv chlor am ine disinfection as mentioned earlier the br cl2 molar ratio had an important impact on the formation of br hnms and the maxima of br hnms were 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of cl hnms at a high br cl2 molar ratio a high br cl2 molar ratio contributed to the conversion from cl hnms and br cl hnms to br hnms as well the bsf increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence which can be explained by the stability of hnms decreasing as the halogen shifted from chlorine to bromine br hnms and br cl hnms were easily attacked by rbs rcs and ho to produce hnms containing fewer halogen atoms at high uv fluence which weakened the incorporation degree of bromine into hnms different from bsf buf decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio a fixed chlorine concentration limited the production of rbs as br in excess which resulted in the formation of br hnms and br cl hnms reaching saturation earlier at a high br cl2 molar ratio while the proportion of br participating in the formation of hnms decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio in addition the contribution of bromine effectively to the formation of hnms was reduced by the weak oxidizing property of chloramine wu et al 2019a and thus buf during uv chloramine disinfection was lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection 3 2 2 effects of ph effects of ph on the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection were investigated in the range from 6 0 to 8 0 fig 7 a showed that the maximum concentration of hnms was 15 27 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and the maxima of hnms at ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 accounted for 78 8 and 64 2 of that at ph 6 0 respectively the effects of ph on the hnms formation were attributed to the changes of various reactive species at ph 6 0 hocl and hobr are the absolute dominant species while ocl and obr are the main forms of chlorine and bromine respectively at ph 8 0 liu et al 2012 also the deprotonation process caused by a high ph weakened the reactivity of hocl and hobr to nitrate the apparent quantum yield φ and molar absorption coefficient ε of obr φobr 0 43 m einstein 1 ε obr 28 m 1 cm 1 are lower than those of hobr φhobr 0 75 m einstein 1 ε hobr 77 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm at an ambient temperature zhang et al 2020 this rule is also applicable to hocl and ocl yeom et al 2021 thereby the deprotonation also reduced the production of rcs and rbs at a high ph which weakened the formation potential of hnms besides acidic conditions enhanced the formation of tcnm and tbnm while the effects of ph on the formation of cnm dcnm bcnm dbnm bdcnm and dbcnm were not obvious fig s4 in general a higher ph conduces to decrease the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br in addition fig 7 b showed the effects of ph on the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection the results suggested that the maximum concentration of hnms was 3 69 μg l 1 at ph 7 0 and the maxima of hnms at ph 6 0 and ph 8 0 decreased by 20 3 and 34 7 respectively compared with that at ph 7 0 it revealed that the formation of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph during uv chloramine disinfection which was different from that during uv chlorine disinfection on the one hand acidic ph accelerated the conversion from chloramine to nhcl2 and hocl eqs 21 22 li et al 2018 patton et al 2018 nhcl2 0 82 mol es 1 and hocl 1 0 mol es 1 had higher quantum yields than chloramine 0 50 mol es 1 which enhanced the formation potential of hnms li and blatchley iii 2009 on the other hand the onoo produced from the photolysis of nitrate rapidly isomerized to no3 under acidic conditions and lost its oxidizing ability eq 23 loegager and sehested 1993 which resulted in a weakened degradation of don nitrate had a greater impact on hnms formation than chloramine primarily due to higher productions of no2 and no from nitrate ge et al 2019 the opposite effects caused by acidic ph reduced the hnms formation as shown by this study similar to uv chlorine disinfection the deprotonation process caused by alkaline ph reduced the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection besides the concentrations of cnm tcnm and dbnm reached the maximum of 0 28 0 21 and 1 64 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 6 0 and 7 0 respectively while the formation of dcnm and bcnm were slightly independent with the ph fig s5 it indicated that the effects of ph on the formation of hnms were related to the hnms species moreover alkaline conditions significantly inhibit the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br 21 2 n h 2 c l h n h 4 n h c l 2 22 n h c l 2 h 2 o h o c l n h 2 c l 23 h o n o o o n o o h h n o 3 2 h 3 3 effect of br on the toxicity alteration of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection the assessment of the potential toxicity of the water body is vital to judge the quality of disinfection methods and determine the influence of br on the toxicity effect after disinfection as shown in fig 8 the calculated cti and gti of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of uv fluence during uv chlor am ine disinfection which was consistent with the changes in hnms yields it was worth noting that the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection owing to a lower hnms concentration during uv chloramine disinfection besides the nitrosated and nitrated products are considered to have higher cti and gti during disinfection of nitrate containing ha water chen et al 2020 wu et al 2019b thus the toxicity assessments of water body during uv chlor am ine disinfection need to be further explored in addition the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chlorine disinfection in the presence of br were about 40 and 1 26 times those in the absence of br respectively fig 8 besides the increase of hnms yields with the incorporation of br correspondingly improved the potential toxicity of water body the ctis of dbcnm dbnm and tbnm were 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of tcnm and so the calculated cti of hnms formed was strengthened owing to br hnms and br cl hnms with higher cti du et al 2017 it is also shown in fig 8 that the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection in the presence of br were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the absence of br in general tbnm and bdcnm were the most genotoxic of hnms manasfi et al 2017 while the fact that tbnm and bdcnm were not detected resulted in the less calculated gti during uv chloramine disinfection with additional br the cti of dbnm was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of cl hnms manasfi et al 2017 and the gti of bcnm was higher than that of cnm and dcnm thus the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed were dominated by dbnm and bcnm contributions during uv chloramine disinfection also the calculated cti and gti of hnms formed during uv chloramine disinfection were 28 19 and 48 90 of those during uv chlorine disinfection respectively the results demonstrated that the incorporation of br increased the potential risks of water quality during uv chlor am ine disinfection and uv chloramine can decrease the calculated cti and gti of the water body efficiently therefore the reasonable selection and optimization of the disinfection process are effective measures for reducing the potential toxicity of the water body 3 4 proposed the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br according to gc ms analysis data presented in fig s6 ha can be divided into aromatic ring structures containing hydroxyl groups ha i and aldehyde groups ha ii and aliphatic alkane structures containing carboxyl groups ha iii and amine groups ha iv table s7 based on the diversity of functional groups in general the decrease of electron withdrawing groups cooh and cho and the increase of electron donating groups oh and nh2 endow ha with a prominent fluorophore character traina et al 1990 besides the aliphatic organics containing amine groups ha iv ha i ha ii and ha iii mainly provide carbon sources for the formation of hnms while nitrate and chloramine provide nitrogen sources 3 4 1 nitrogen source in hnms from nitrate the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water were proposed by gc ms spectra fig s7 for measuring intermediate products during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br fig 9 a showed that nitrate could provide nitrogen source for the formation of hnms during uv chlor am ine disinfection nitrate induced the production of no2 no onoo and n2o4 under uv irradiation no2 no onoo and n2o4 are all nitrating agents which can nitrify organic compounds to form nitro compounds important precursors of hnms shah et al 2011 nitration nitrosation oxidation and hydroxylation were the main ways of the formation of hnms from aromatic compounds while aromatic compounds were more likely to be attacked by the nitrating agents because of their high electron density hong et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 a scheme i ha i underwent nitration and nitrosation of no and no2 to form nitrosobenzene tp 1 refer to table s8 and nitrobenzene chen et al 2021 and the nitrated and nitrosated intermediates involved ring cleavage oxidation and substitution and were ultimately converted to hnms fig 9 a schemes ii and iii showed that ha ii and ha iii were first nitrated by rns to yield rch oh no2 or rc oh 2no2 via the aldehyde and decarboxylation pathways and then formed rccl2no2 rcbr2no2 and rcclbrno2 tp 2 refer to table s8 under the roles of rcs rbs and finally transformed into hnms owing to the substitution and oxidation of rcs rbs and ho however in ha isolates less than 10 of hnms was formed via the aldehyde and decarboxylation pathways li et al 2016 and the proportion of organics with phenolic hydroxyl groups i e ha i in ha reached up to 60 chin et al 1994 traina et al 1990 thus the nitration of ha i considered the dominant pathway for forming hnms overall the involvement of rns provided a reliable nitrogen source for the formation of hnms also the participation of rcs rbs and ho greatly guarantees the oxidation capacity of the disinfection processes and facilitates the formation of hnms while the concentrations of rcs rbs and ho during uv chloramine disinfection were lower than that during uv chlorine disinfection resulting in the less production of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection 3 4 2 nitrogen source in hnms from chloramine note that the pathways for the formation of hnms from precursors between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection were somewhat different although the formation of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection had the same pathways as that during uv chlorine disinfection owing to the co involvement of hocl chloramine could be regarded as a nitrogen source for forming hnms while chlorine could not as shown in fig 9 b scheme iv the photolysis of chloramine induced to yield of nh2 and ha i reacted with nh2 to produce aromatic amine tp 3 refer to table s9 moreover the chloramination of ha ii and ha iii was beneficial to forming rch oh nhcl tp 4 refer to table s9 with the c n bond fig 9 b schemes v and vi and then the dehydration of rch oh nhcl yielded ch chncloh tp 5 refer to table s9 similarly the chloraminated and aminated intermediates involved ring cleavage oxidation and substitution under the oxidation and substitution roles of rcs rbs and ho and ultimately were converted to hnms also nh2 could be transformed into no2 and no owing to the role of dissolved oxygen and its contributions to the formation of hnms were similar to nitrate however a previous study reported that most of the nitrogen sources for the formation of hnms during chloramine or uv chloramine disinfection came from nom rather than 15nh2cl with 15n labeled yang et al 2012 therefore the contribution of chloramine is positive but not significant for the formation of hnms which is also one of the reasons for less production of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection 3 4 3 nitrogen source in hnms from ha in addition amine organics in ha can also as a precursor provide a nitrogen source for forming few productions of hnms the reactivity of amine organics depends on the side chain group attached to the α carbon the amino nitrogen is the nitrogen source for forming hnms and the formation of hnms requires the dissociation of the alkyl functional group hu et al 2010 as shown in fig s8 the pathway for the formation of hnms from ha iv during uv chlor am ine disinfection first underwent the chlorination and bromination of amino groups and then nh2 was oxidized by rcs rbs and ho which changed the n valence from 3 reduced state to 3 oxidation state afterward the formed nitrated intermediates participated in the formation of hnms 3 5 formation of hnms in natural water during uv chlor am ine disinfection natural water is more complicated as it contains various inorganic ions and organic substances to explore the formation of hnms in natural water two water samples from stp and wsp were investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection as shown in fig 10 a1 and a2 in the absence of br cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbnm were detected in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection while only cnm dcnm tcnm and bcnm were detected in stp and wsp during uv chloramine disinfection the maxima of hnms in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection were 2 29 and 1 87 μg l 1 and those during uv chloramine disinfection were 1 97 and 1 09 μg l 1 respectively the results revealed that the concentration of hnms precursor in stp was higher than that in wsp which enhanced the formation of hnms in stp also the maximum concentration of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection while the ascent and descent rate of hnms yield during uv chloramine disinfection were faster than those during uv chlorine disinfection the existence of nom or effluent organic matter efom is inevitable in natural water and the nitrogen containing organic matter of nom or efom can promote the formation of hnms besides nitrate in natural water can also provide a reliable nitrogen source for forming hnms certainly nitrate may compete with nom or efom for reactive species and chlor am ine as well as uv photons during uv chlor am ine disinfection hua et al 2021 as mentioned before the total productions of reactive species eg rcs ho and rns during uv chloramine disinfection were lower than those during uv chlorine disinfection which may be one of the reasons for the difference in hnms formation between uv chlorine disinfection and uv chloramine disinfection similarly the formation of hnms in natural water was investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br results presented in fig 10 b1 b2 c1 and c2 showed that cnm dcnm tcnm bcnm and dbnm were detected during uv chlor am ine disinfection with additional br or both br and nitrate compared with adding only br and both br and nitrate the maxima of hnms in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection increased from 2 81 and 2 09 μg l 1 to 3 54 and 2 87 μg l 1 respectively and those during uv chloramine disinfection increased from 2 48 and 1 90 μg l 1 to 2 74 and 2 52 μg l 1 respectively whether only additional br or both additional br and nitrate the hnms concentration during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection dcnm and bcnm were the dominant species of formed hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while dbnm and bcnm were those during uv chloramine disinfection the above mentioned results suggested that the incorporation of nitrate provided a nitrogen source resulting in an increased formation of hnms in natural water while nitrate did not alter the distribution of hnms formed during uv chlor am ine disinfection also the concentration of br hnms in natural water increased significantly during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br while the concentration of cl hnms decreased especially tcnm this trend demonstrated that the incorporation of br promoted the conversion from cl hnms into br cl hnms and br hnms in natural water which was consistent with that in the simulated water refer to fig 4 in summary the addition of nitrate enhanced the potential of hnms formation in natural waters and verified further the hnms formation in natural water containing both br and nitrate had a similar trend to that in the simulated water as shown in fig 10 d1 and d2 the formation of hnms in natural water was also investigated during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br nitrate and ha the results showed a similar trend that the concentration of hnms in stp and wsp rapidly reached a peak value and then decreased gradually with the increase of uv fluence this trend verified the results presented in fig 3 in the simulated water owing to the addition of ha the hnms yields in stp and wsp during uv chlorine disinfection increased by 3 44 and 2 15 times and those during uv chloramine disinfection increased by 2 80 and 1 86 times respectively which were much higher than those in natural water with additional br and nitrate this phenomenon revealed that the incorporation of ha provided an adequate carbon source for forming hnms in natural water dbnm bnm and bdcnm were found to become the dominant species owing to the incorporation of br during uv chlor am ine disinfection the hnms concentration in stp was higher than that in wsp because the concentration of doc in stp was higher than that in wsp refer to table s3 however the hnms species in natural water were less than those in the simulated water refer to fig 3 which may be due to inorganic ions such as co3 2 and hco3 in natural water acting as scavengers for ho cl and cl2 during uv chlor am ine disinfection as well the results presented in fig 10 d1 and d2 showed that the production of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection was higher than that during uv chloramine disinfection bnm was the dominant species of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while bdcnm was that during uv chloramine disinfection and the descent rate of hnms concentration during uv chloramine disinfection was faster than that during uv chlorine disinfection the above results suggested that the formation of hnms during uv chlorine disinfection of natural water with additional br nitrate and ha was different from that during uv chloramine disinfection meanwhile it also verified further that the effects of br on the hnms formation in natural water containing nitrate and ha were similar to that in the simulated water during uv chlor am ine disinfection the composition of natural water is relatively complex and thus the formation mechanism and potential risks of hnms should be taken seriously especially in water bodies containing br and nitrate 4 conclusions the current research suggested that cl hnms br cl hnms and br hnms could be formed simultaneously during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br dbnm and tbnm were the dominant species of formed hnms during uv chlorine disinfection while bcnm and dbnm were those during uv chloramine disinfection the incorporation of br promoted the formation of hnms especially br hnms and br cl hnms while the species and yields of hnms during uv chloramine disinfection were less than those during uv chlorine disinfection owing to the diversity of free radical chemistry additionally the formation of hnms increased first and then decreased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and decreased with the increase of ph during uv chlorine disinfection while the formation of hnms increased with the increase of the br cl2 molar ratio and increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph during uv chloramine disinfection the incorporation of br increased the calculated cti and gti of hnms and the calculated cti and gti during uv chlorine disinfection were higher than those during uv chloramine disinfection according to these findings the formation pathways of hnms from nitrate containing ha water during uv chlor am ine disinfection in the presence of br were proposed as shown by this study the risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection can potentially be enhanced by constituents such as br or inorganic nitrogen in real water matrices and due to the difference in the species and yields of hnms formed during uv chlor am ine uv chloramine could be considered a better disinfection process than uv chlorine for ensuring the safety of water quality in natural water containing br and nitrate in brief avoiding the existence of br and extending uv fluence will reduce the risks of hnms formation during uv chlor am ine disinfection meanwhile it is advised to remove hnms precursors such as nitrate as much as possible before the disinfection step to decrease hnms formation risks during such disinfection techniques

valent iron zvi owning to its high reactivity has been used for remediation of contaminated groundwater and soil fu et al 2014 however its application is limited to the surface passivation and

with different substances e g o2 h2o and no3 hou et al 2022 wu et al 2020 2019 2021 it was concluded that the improved performance of s zvi was caused by the formation of fes which has good conductivity and hydrophobicity fan et al 2017 the process of sulfidation usually used chemical or mechanochemical methods where dissolved or solid phase sulfur precursors were introduced to zvi

culture derived from freshwater sediments showing that biogenic or synthesized fes particles on the surface of zvi could enhance zvi reactivity biochar loading mb is a common modified method to reduce the aggregation degree of zvi mandal et al 2020 pang et al 2019 zvi was also characterized by magnetic biochar for pollutants removal owing to its easy recovery and separation qu et al 2022b qu et al 2022d meanwhile biochar is a kind of porous material which could provide more sites for microorganisms i e srb to attach it was also found that biochar played an important role in electron transfer including as electron shuttles and mediated by conductive mechanism sun et al 2017 saquing et al 2016 studied that biochar mediated acetic acid oxidation and nitrate reduction with the same electron transfer efficiency by gebacter metallireducens gs 15 indicating that biochar not only had electron mediating ability but also could support microbial extracellular electron transfer process therefore the method that combined mb with biogenetic sulfidation to modify zvi is green and economic friendly the effect of extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microbes on the characteristic of bs zvi was ignored hans curt and jost 2010 more et al 2014 tourney and ngwenya 2014 yu and fein 2016 most microbial cells in nature are surrounded by eps which hampers contact of cells with the external environment directly zhu et al 2012 it is easy for eps to form complexation with fe ⅱ ⅲ due to its organic composition guibaud et al 2009 hans curt and jost 2010 tourney and ngwenya 2014 chongdar et al 2005 reported that these complexes between eps and fe ⅲ reduced the removal efficiency of heavy metal by forming protective films to block the contact of pollutant additionally diaz et al 2013 found that eps could quench reactive oxygen species ros these findings illustrated that eps could exert inhibition effect on contaminants removal it remained unknown whether eps can exert important effect on the physicochemical properties and reactivity of bs zvi supported on mb bs zvi mb towards pollutant tetracycline tc has been widely applied in human animal husbandry and aquaculture as a therapeutic drug liu et al 2019 however it cannot be completely metabolized in the living body and will be released into the environment again liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 therefore tc a common representative of organic compounds was chosen in the present study we hypothesized that bs zvi mb could greatly improve the reactivity and electron selectivity of zvi towards pollutant the specific purposes of this research were to ⅰ study the kinetics and products of tc degradation by bs zvi mb ⅱ investigate the mechanism of the tc degradation by bs zvi mb and ⅲ explore the effect and mechanism of eps on the degradation of tc by bs zvi mb this study is expected to provide new ideas for improving the reactivity of zvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the mb was prepared by corn stalk at 600 c under n2 of 1 2 l min 1 flow tc fecl3 6h2o and fe nh4so4 2 6h2o were obtained from shanghai mcacklin biochemical technology co ltd china the srb desulfovibrio vulgaris atcc 7757 was purchased from china general microbiological culture collection center cgmcc details of other used chemicals are provided in the supplementary materials sm 2 2 preparation of bs zvi mb zvi mb was prepared by mixing 0 25 m nabh4 0 07 m feso4 and different quality mb according to wu et al 2019 then the prepared zvi was washed twice with 30 methanol solution the samples in anoxic bottles were centrifuged at 5 c and then freeze dried the srb was cultivated with suggested medium components provided in sm firstly the medium was purged with high purity n2 99 for 40 min and the ph was adjusted to approximately 7 8 with 1m hcl or naoh then 200 ml of the prepared medium was dispensed in 250 ml bottles sealed with caps and sterilized via autoclave 121 c for 20 min bs zvi mb was prepared by injecting 0 1 ml of the bacteria liquid of srb od600 1 23 and 1 g zvi mb into the sterilized medium simultaneously cultures were incubated statically at 37 c optimum temperature for srb growth the different s fe of bs zvi mb i e 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 was regulated according to srb cultivation time fig s1 and the details are shown in sm then bs zvi mb with different s fe was obtained after centrifuge at 5 c and freeze dried 2 3 batch experiments for tc degradation tc degradation was performed in 100 ml bottles containing 3 mg l tc 50 mm h2o2 was used as reagent of fenton reaction the optimum conditions were obtained in the preliminary experiments bs zvi mb 1 2 g l zvi mb 0 5 and s fe 0 1 fig s2 thus unless otherwise stated the optimal conditions of bs zvi mb dosage ratios of zvi mb and s fe the optimal conditions were used as above in the following experiments the initial ph was adjusted to 7 2 during the experiments bs zvi and mb were set up as control groups at periodic time intervals the aqueous suspensions 1 ml for spectroscopic analysis were withdrawn from bottles and filtered by 0 22 μm filter to measure the concentration of tc and its intermediate the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to investigate the degradation kinetics of tc and the k represents the rate constant of the reaction the detailed description about pseudo first order model is shown in sm all the experiments were carried out in triplicates 2 4 chemical analysis and instrumental characterization the intermediate products of tc were tested by liquid chromatographic mass

extraction hou et al 2016 wang et al 2018 you et al 2017 detailed procedures are shown in sm the spectroscopic analyses of eps i e uv vis absorption spectra three dimensional excitation emission fluorescence 3d eem and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy were performed using an uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu japan luminescent spectrometer f 7000 fl hitachi japan and

edc electron accepting capacities eac and electrochemical impedance analysis eis were conducted with a chi760e workstation chenhua instrument china each group was analyzed with ito plate 3 1 cm2 working electrode a platinum electrode counter electrode and ag agcl reference electrode the electrochemical analysis was conducted after purging with high purity n2 99 for 40 min the phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 2 and kcl 0 1 m were selected as the supporting electrolyte the electric potential for the measurements of edc and eac were set as 0 61 v and 0 49 v respectively he et al 2014 2019 the values of edc and eac were calculated using the following expression 1 eac ired f dt m 2 edc iox f dt m where ired and iox represent the reduction and oxidation current respectively f is the faraday constant and m is the sum of mb and eps loaded in the bs zvi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bs zvi mb bs zvi mb showed more stabilized particles compared with pure zvi fig 1 a and s3 indicating that biogenetic sulfidation and mb could reduce the aggregation degree of zvi zvi accumulated on the surface of mb fig 1a which resulted in the increased specific surface area and the active sites of zvi the specific areas of mb bs zvi and bs zvi mb were 112 25 m2 g 34 33 m2 g and 88 34 m2 g fig s4 it could be found that the specific surface area of bs zvi mb was slightly less than mb but much higher than zvi which was contributed to the removal of pollutants it could probably that the introduction of mb to bs zvi i e bs zvi mb led to higher specific surface area than pristine bs zvi while the coverage of bs zvi on the surface of mb resulted in the decrease of specific surface area compared with pure mb qu et al 2022a the pores of mb was also favorable for the growth of srb fig s5 xrd spectra of bs zvi mb showed fe0 peaks at 2θ 43 86 fig 1b the other dominant peak was at 2θ 38 74 which was sio2 from mb lyu et al 2017 the peak positions of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 depend on the ionic states of fe the possible existing forms of fe ii s fe ii o and fe iii s species was distributed in 696 711 ev thus fe 2p3 2 ranged from 696 to 711 ev was selected as parameters for binding energy of fe 2p qu et al 2022f the 2p3 2 xps spectra of fe and s in bs zvi mb were fitted fig 1c and d fe was mainly in the form of fe ii s species centered at 707 7 ev table s1 81 2 and little of it was in the form of fe ii o and fe iii s species 93 9 of the s was assigned to s ii s2 ii and sn ii table s1 the content of fe0 and s in the bs zvi mb were 76 19 and 3 97 indicating the s fe was about 0 1 table s2 3 2 degradation kinetics and pathways of tc by bs zvi mb 100 of tc was degraded by bs zvi mb which was higher than that of mb 4 94 zvi 61 10 and bs zvi 93 93 fig 2 a the degradation rate of tc by bs zvi mb k 0 015 min 1 was faster than that of mb k 0 0008 min 1 zvi k 0 010 min 1 and bs zvi k 0 012 min 1 fig 2a indicating the higher reactivity of bs zvi mb than mb zvi and bs zvi fenton worked well in tc removal in zvi bs zvi and bs zvi mb system and for mb hydrogen bonding force pore filling complexation and π π stacking were the primary pathways to eliminate tc qu et al 2022e the appearance of iron oxides e g fe3o4 on the xrd pattern after the reaction due to the oxidation of bs zvi mb by tc fig 1b which was probably contributed to electron transfer capacity joseph et al 2010 found that quinone groups abundant in mb could promote electron transport therefore the analysis of cv was performed to compare the redox performance of bs zvi and bs zvi mb fig 2b the conductivity of bs zvi mb was obviously better than that of bs zvi indicating that the existence of mb enhanced the conductivity of materials additionally the mediated potential method was used to test the conductivity of bs zvi mb with different zvi mb fig 2c and d edc and eac increased with the decrease of zvi mb demonstrating that mb had a promotion effect on electrons transfer the amount of edc was lower than eac indicating that most of the electroactive groups in mb were in the oxidized state which was contributed to the tc removal yu et al 2015 lc ms detected the products with different m z and part of molecular formula to infer the intermediates produced in the degradation fig s6 the substance with m z 445 was tc and the product with m z 416 could be attributed to the breaking of amide bond on the structure of tc khan et al 2010 two n methyl groups and double bond broke to form m z 388 and m z 349 substance respectively based on the m z 349 substance the ring in which the methyl and aldehyde groups resided opened and formed m z 242 products wang et al 2011 it was further observed that the formation of m z 106 and m z 60 which was caused by the breaking of the chemical bond of m z 242 yi et al 2021 in addition product with m z 497 was detected which might be caused by the fracture of the double bond on tc ring and hydroxylation by hydroxyl radical attack huang et al 2017 the substance with m z of 384 had 59 mass units less than tc probably due to the low c n bond energy at c3 and c4 which was easy to be attacked and led to fracture wang et al 2011 the products with m z 267 and 293 had lost the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups from m z 384 khan et al 2010 according to the above analysis the ring structure of tc could be opened and tc could be degraded into smaller molecules until the generation of co2 and h2o the toxicity values of the intermediates degraded by tetracycline were calculated by qsar among which m z 497 had the highest toxicity values table s3 the overall environmental toxicities alleviation implied that bs zvi mb could effectively mineralize tc without generation of more hazardous intermediates qu et al 2022c additionally the substances with m z 60 is also hazardous however majority of the intermediates showed no obvious toxicity generally the toxicity of the solution is decreasing during the degradation the specific degradation pathway of tc by bs zvi mb was proposed fig s7 3 3 degradation mechanism of tc degradation by bs zvi mb commonly fe ⅱ ⅲ could be produced during the removal of contaminant by zvi du et al 2016 it was unknown what the role fe ⅱ ⅲ played in the degradation of tc by bs zvi mb therefore the concentration of fe ⅱ ⅲ in the reaction were measured to explore the mechanism of the tc degradation further fe ⅱ ⅲ reached to the peak of 4 01 mm and 8 35 mm at 45 min and then remained stable fig 3 a tc had a strong tendency to complex with metals due to the multiple o and n containing moieties which may greatly impact the behavior of tc in the aquatic environment including interactions with mineral surfaces and redox reactions figueroa et al 2004 werner et al 2006 previous study reported that fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ could easily complex with tc to form fe ⅱ ⅲ tc lye et al 2020 the specific role of fe ⅱ ⅲ in tc degradation is still unclear hence further study were performed the following experiment was carried out in brown bottles with sealed caps to explore the complexation behavior between fe ⅱ ⅲ and tc h2o2 was not added to avoid the influence of fenton on the reaction different concentrations of fe ⅱ ⅲ were added to explore the mechanism and the possible location of complexation between fe ⅱ ⅲ and tc and δ absorbance δ abs was recorded fig 3b and c the calculation method on δabs was provided in sm δabs fluctuated greatly in the wavelength of 270 320 nm and increased with the concentration of fe ⅲ fig 3b there was no obvious change at 340 370 nm the a ring of tc marked in fig s7 mainly contributed to the absorbance at 270 300 nm while the absorbance of bcd ring was mainly reflected at 250 300 nm and 340 370 nm chen and huang 2009 therefore it was reasonable to speculate that the complexation of fe ⅲ and tc mainly occurred in the a ring of tc similarly δabs showed obvious fluctuation in the wavelength of 270 320 nm and rose with the increase of fe ⅱ concentration fig 3c the change was not obvious in the range of 340 370 nm the complexation position of fe ⅱ and tc was in the a ring based on fluctuation of δabs in the wavelength of 270 320 nm previous study also reported that fe ⅱ could complex with amide group of a ring and o at the c3 of tc huang et al 2017 tc will undergo molecular isomerism change at the position of dimethylamino in a ring to form 4 epi tc under acidic condition chen and huang 2009 huang et al 2017 therefore the 4 epi tc was prepared by inducing isomerization of tc under acidic condition to verify the complexation position of fe ⅲ and tc fig 3d it was obvious that the degradation rate of tc was 6 33 times than that of 4 epi tc which supported the hypothesis above chen and huang 2009 found that cu ⅱ could be reduced to cu ⅰ by promoting the oxidative degradation of tc the redox potential of fe ⅲ was 0 77 v which was more negative than that of cu 0 34 v deng et al 2006 therefore it was theoretically possible that fe ⅲ had the ability to catalytic degradation of tc by oxidation 4 mm fe ⅲ and 3 mg l tc was added to the sealed bottles to explore the redox reaction between fe ⅲ and tc the concentration of fe ⅱ in the reaction was determined it was observed that fe ⅱ sharply increased to 0 18 mm and then slightly decreased fig s8 the presence of fe ⅱ demonstrated that tc could be degraded by fe iii figs s8 and 3d and fe ⅲ itself was reduced to fe ⅱ generally tc was oxidized by fe ⅲ in the complexation state to produce the oxidation product e g tcs fenton reaction occurred due to the coexistence of fe ⅱ and h2o2 and ros was generated accordingly wang and huang 2017 zhang et al 2018 therefore ros scavengers benzoquinone bq n butanol and sodium oxalate na oa were added to explore the effect of o2 oh and h respectively on tc degradation wang et al 2016 2022 tc was completely degraded by bs zvi mb within 2 h while the degradation efficiency decreased to 62 4 13 1 and 93 9 in the presence of bq n butanol and na oa respectively fig 4 a indicating that oh and o2 exerted the more influence on the tc degradation by bs zvi mb esr spectra of dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were conducted to investigate the formation of ros during the reaction fig 4b and c the signal of oh gradually increased when the reaction began indicating that oh was formed in the tc degradation by bs zvi mb fig 4b the signal of o2 shared the same trend with oh but its change was not obvious as oh fig 4c it was illustrated that o2 and oh played major role in the tc degradation particularly oh meanwhile the result showed that the conversion between free radical could be ignored based on the above analysis the following equations for possible reactions were given 3 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 4 f e 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 5 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 2 h 2 o 6 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h oh 7 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 o 2 2 h 8 f e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 3 4 effect of eps on tc degradation eps secreted by srb may affect the degradation of tc as well ft ir analysis was conducted to explore the organic functional groups of bs zvi mb fig s9 the functional groups could be assigned to hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharide and nucleic acids and the fingerprint region fan et al 2017 yin et al 2015 the peak detected in 3440 cm 1 was a dominant peak and could be ascribed to the hydrogen bond stretching rinaudo 2006 the position and the number of peaks of eps and bs zvi mb were almost similar indicating that eps affected on the characteristic of bs zvi mb therefore the effect of eps on the reactivity of bs zvi mb was explored eps was extracted and added in the system of fe ⅱ fe ⅲ and bs zvi mb fig 5 a tc degradation by fe ⅱ fe ⅲ and bs zvi mb decreased by 9 22 13 42 and 54 29 respectively indicating that eps showed inhibition effect on the degradation of tc as an organic matter secreted by microorganisms eps could complex with fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ to form eps fe ⅱ and eps fe ⅲ complexes to load on the surface of zvi and affect the release of fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ guibaud et al 2009 additionally eps might quench ros during the reaction diaz et al 2013 esr spectrum was conducted to explore the effect of eps on ros production during the tc degradation at first fig 5b and c in the first 15 min esr showed no obvious changes in o2 and oh but o2 and oh increased gradually in the study above fig 4b and c especially oh therefore it was indicated that eps could have an inhibition effect on o2 and oh slightly the complexation effect of eps on fe ⅱ ⅲ was studied in the following experiments in order to explore the effect of eps on reaction potential and current of bs zvi mb eis and tafel tests of bs zvi mb were performed fig 5d and e the ito coated with s zvi mb was placed in eps extracted from srb for 4 h the corrosion potential decreased gradually from 0 49 v to 0 50 v at first and then rose to 0 36 v at 4 h while the corrosion current density showed an opposite trend and it increased from 0 35 μa cm2 to 5 32 μa cm2 within an hour then dropped to 0 26 μa cm2 at 4 h thus the presence of eps could inhibit the reactivity of bs zvi mb after 1 h fig 5d and table s4 tafel curve was obtained by circuit simulation of eis diagram fig 5e and table s5 charge transfer resistance rct was often used to characterize the reactivity of zvi meylheuc et al 2006 the rct of s zvi mb showed a downward trend in the first 1 h and then increased indicating that the reaction was difficult to proceed after 1 h the solution resistance rs was less than 30 ω cm2 and far less than rct suggesting that the resistance mainly came from charge transfer li et al 2021 the base resistance rb increased from 603 ω cm2 to 448 ω cm2 in s zvi mb while the layer capacitance cf and rb showed a completely opposite trend showing that the reaction trend decreased with the increase of thickness of eps therefore it was hypothesized that eps could be adsorbed to the surface of bs zvi mb and formed a protective layer thus inhibiting the electron transfer between bs zvi mb and tc the restriction of fe ii would have a negative effect on fenton reaction generally the inhibition effect of eps on the tc degradation could be mainly ascribed to the complexation with fe ⅱ ⅲ which affected the interaction between bs zvi mb and tc besides the negative effect on the tc degradation eps could absorb tc to form eps tc complex and tc could had an effect on the properties of eps as well which may affect the removal of pollutants 3d eem spectroscopy was used to further analyze eps fig 5f the positions of characteristic peaks indicated that the eps in bs zvi mb contained three fluorophores with the ex em at 220 nm 365 nm 280 nm 375 380 nm and 320 nm 390 nm respectively it was reported that these three endogenous fluorophores were ascribed to the tyrosine tryptophan amino acid tyrosine tryptophan type proteins and humic acid respectively wang et al 2018 wang and zhang 2010 after addition of tc the change of the fluorophores in eps were observed at ex 220 nm 280 nm and 320 nm respectively fig 6 the fluorescence intensities of three fluorophores all decreased with the increase of tc concentration indicating the strong interactions between tc and eps the maximum em of tryptophan was associated closely with the environment which tended to red shift as the change of hydrophobicity quagraine et al 2001 the em of tryptophan red shifted by nearly 30 40 nm from 360 nm fig 6a indicating the addition of tc decreased the hydrophobicity of system the tryptophan residues in tryptophan type proteins also red shifted slightly fig 6b which was possibly caused by the change of protein structure due to the presence of tc hu et al 2004 found that the extensional degree of peptide chain in proteins increased when the environment became more hydrophilic or less hydrophobic as the tc concentration increased to over 5 mg l the fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically suggesting that the binding sites were occupied completely and the structure of the peptide chains was severely disrupted fig 6 obviously the fluorescence of tryptophan tryptophan type proteins and humic acids in eps all decreased after the addition of tc which was probably attributed to the formation of some complexes the formation of these complexes between eps and tc would promote the tc degradation and have a negative effect on the structure of eps 4 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the kinetics pathways and mechanism of tc degradation by bs zvi mb the main conclusions of our study are 1 biochar and biogenetic sulfidation were employed to enhance the reactivity of zvi biochar provided more attachment for zvi and srb due to its loose structure additionally biochar could enhance the electrons transfer during reaction 2 fe ⅱ ⅲ could complex with tc at the a ring tc was oxidized by complexing fe ⅲ to generate oxidation products while fe ⅲ was reduced to fe ⅱ oh and o2 radical which were produced during the oxidation of fe ⅱ played important roles in tc degradation by bs zvi mb especially oh 3 eps attached on the bs zvi mb had a slight quenching effect on ros meanwhile eps formed a protective layer with fe ⅱ ⅲ on bs zvi mb reducing its reactivity with tc complexation between tc and eps occurred to form eps tc complex and tc could had negative effect on the properties of eps

15459,the application of zero valent iron zvi is limited due to passivation and agglomeration therefore biochar loading mb and biogenetic sulfidation via sulfate reducing bacteria srb were used to improve the reactivity of zvi bs zvi mb towards tetracycline tc degradation biochar provided more attachment sites for zvi and srb thus alleviating the agglomeration additionally quinone groups on biochar enhanced the electrons transfer through the measurement of electron donating accepting capacities and biogenetic sulfidation could inhibit the surface passivation of zvi fe ⅱ ⅲ produced after the addition of bs zvi mb could complex with the a ring in tc to form fe ⅱ ⅲ tc which brought the oxidation of tc by complexed fe ⅲ reactive oxygen species ros primarily oh were generated during the oxidation of fe ⅱ so as to promote the tc degradation extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted from srb had a slight quenching effect on ros meanwhile eps formed a protective layer with fe ⅱ ⅲ

image graphical abstract keywords biogenetic sulfidation zero valent iron biochar tetracycline reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction zero valent iron zvi owning to its high reactivity has been used for remediation of contaminated groundwater and soil fu et al 2014 however its application is limited to the surface passivation and agglomeration recently therefore it had been reported that sulfidation of zvi s zvi could enhance its selectivity and reaction rate for target pollutants due to the inhibition of the side reaction with different substances e g o2 h2o and no3 hou et al 2022 wu et al 2020 2019 2021 it was concluded that the improved performance of s zvi was caused by the formation of fes which has good conductivity and hydrophobicity fan et al 2017 the process of sulfidation usually used chemical or mechanochemical methods where dissolved or solid phase sulfur precursors were introduced to zvi during the sulfidation fan et al 2017 gu et al 2017 vogel et al 2019 for example fan et al summarized that s zvi could be prepared by mixing na2s or na2s2o4 and zvi by one step or two steps liquid phase processes fan et al 2017 gu et al 2017 prepared s zvi through ball milling zvi with elemental sulfur by solid phase process actually sulfidation is not invented but a widespread biogeochemical process in the groundwater sulfate reducing bacteria srb can reduce sulfate to sulfide and generate h2s which plays an important role on the corrosion of iron based minerals barton and fauque 2009 muyzer and stams 2008 plugge et al 2011 however there are few studies on biogenetic sulfidation of zvi bs zvi islam et al 2021 treated zvi in d desulfuricans i e a type of srb and an enrichment culture derived from freshwater sediments showing that biogenic or synthesized fes particles on the surface of zvi could enhance zvi reactivity biochar loading mb is a common modified method to reduce the aggregation degree of zvi mandal et al 2020 pang et al 2019 zvi was also characterized by magnetic biochar for pollutants removal owing to its easy recovery and separation qu et al 2022b qu et al 2022d meanwhile biochar is a kind of porous material which could provide more sites for microorganisms i e srb to attach it was also found that biochar played an important role in electron transfer including as electron shuttles and mediated by conductive mechanism sun et al 2017 saquing et al 2016 studied that biochar mediated acetic acid oxidation and nitrate reduction with the same electron transfer efficiency by gebacter metallireducens gs 15 indicating that biochar not only had electron mediating ability but also could support microbial extracellular electron transfer process therefore the method that combined mb with biogenetic sulfidation to modify zvi is green and economic friendly the effect of extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microbes on the characteristic of

centrifuge at 5 c and freeze dried 2 3 batch experiments for tc degradation tc degradation was performed in 100 ml bottles containing 3 mg l tc 50 mm h2o2 was used as reagent of fenton reaction the optimum conditions were obtained in the preliminary experiments bs zvi mb 1 2 g l zvi mb 0 5 and s fe 0 1 fig s2 thus unless otherwise stated the optimal conditions of bs zvi mb dosage ratios of zvi mb and s fe the optimal conditions were used as above in the following experiments the initial ph was adjusted to 7 2 during the experiments bs zvi and mb were set up as control groups at periodic time intervals the aqueous suspensions 1 ml for spectroscopic analysis were withdrawn from bottles and filtered by 0 22 μm filter to measure the concentration of tc and its intermediate the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to investigate the degradation kinetics of tc and the k represents the rate constant of the reaction the detailed description about pseudo first order model is shown in sm all the experiments were carried out in triplicates 2 4 chemical analysis and instrumental characterization the intermediate products of tc were tested by liquid chromatographic mass

extraction hou et al 2016 wang et al 2018 you et al 2017 detailed procedures are shown in sm the spectroscopic analyses of eps i e uv vis absorption spectra three dimensional excitation emission fluorescence 3d eem and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy were performed using an uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu japan luminescent spectrometer f 7000 fl hitachi japan and

edc electron accepting capacities eac and electrochemical impedance analysis eis were conducted with a chi760e workstation chenhua instrument china each group was analyzed with ito plate 3 1 cm2 working electrode a platinum electrode counter electrode and ag agcl reference electrode the electrochemical analysis was conducted after purging with high purity n2 99 for 40 min the phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 2 and kcl 0 1 m were selected as the supporting electrolyte the electric potential for the measurements of edc and eac were set as 0 61 v and 0 49 v respectively he et al 2014 2019 the values of edc and eac were calculated using the following expression 1 eac ired f dt m 2 edc iox f dt m where ired and iox represent the reduction and oxidation current respectively f is the faraday constant and m is the sum of mb and eps loaded in the bs zvi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bs zvi mb bs zvi mb showed more stabilized particles compared with pure zvi fig 1 a and s3 indicating that biogenetic sulfidation and mb could reduce the aggregation degree of zvi zvi accumulated on the surface of mb fig 1a which resulted in the increased specific surface area and the active sites of zvi the specific areas of mb bs zvi and bs zvi mb were 112 25 m2 g 34 33 m2 g and 88 34 m2 g fig s4 it could be found that the specific surface area of bs zvi mb was slightly less than mb but much higher than zvi which was contributed to the removal of pollutants it could probably that the introduction of mb to bs zvi i e bs zvi mb led to higher specific surface area than pristine bs zvi while the coverage of bs zvi on the surface of mb resulted in the decrease of specific surface area compared with pure mb qu et al 2022a the pores of mb was also favorable for the growth of srb fig s5 xrd spectra of bs zvi mb showed fe0 peaks at 2θ 43 86 fig 1b the other dominant peak was at 2θ 38 74 which was sio2 from mb lyu et al 2017 the peak positions of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 depend on the ionic states of fe the possible existing forms of fe ii s fe ii o and fe iii s species was distributed in 696 711 ev thus fe 2p3 2 ranged from 696 to 711 ev was selected as parameters for binding energy of fe 2p qu et al 2022f the 2p3 2 xps spectra of fe and s in bs zvi mb were fitted fig 1c and d fe was mainly in the form of fe ii s species centered at 707 7 ev table s1 81 2 and little of it was in the form of fe ii o and fe iii s species 93 9 of the s was assigned to s ii s2 ii and sn ii table s1 the content of fe0 and s in the bs zvi mb were 76 19 and 3 97 indicating the s fe was about 0 1 table s2 3 2 degradation kinetics and pathways of tc by bs zvi mb 100 of tc was degraded by bs zvi mb which was higher than that of mb 4 94 zvi 61 10 and bs zvi 93 93 fig 2 a the degradation rate of tc by bs zvi mb k 0 015 min 1 was faster than that of mb k 0 0008 min 1 zvi k 0 010 min 1 and bs zvi k 0 012 min 1 fig 2a indicating the higher reactivity of bs zvi mb than mb zvi and bs zvi fenton worked well in tc removal in zvi bs zvi and bs zvi mb system and for mb hydrogen bonding force pore filling complexation and π π stacking were the primary pathways to eliminate tc qu et al 2022e the appearance of iron oxides e g fe3o4 on the xrd pattern after the reaction due to the oxidation of bs zvi mb by tc fig 1b which was probably contributed to electron transfer capacity joseph et al 2010 found that quinone groups abundant in mb could promote electron transport therefore the analysis of cv was performed to compare the redox performance of bs zvi and bs zvi mb fig 2b the conductivity of bs zvi mb was obviously better than that of bs zvi indicating that the existence of mb enhanced the conductivity of materials additionally the mediated potential method was used to test the conductivity of bs zvi mb with different zvi mb fig 2c and d edc and eac increased with the decrease of zvi mb demonstrating that mb had a promotion effect on electrons transfer the amount of edc was lower than eac indicating that most of the electroactive groups in mb were in the oxidized state which was contributed to the tc removal yu et al 2015 lc ms detected the products with different m z and part of molecular formula to infer the intermediates produced in the degradation fig s6 the substance with m z 445 was tc and the product with m z 416 could be attributed to the breaking of amide bond on the structure of tc khan et al 2010 two n methyl groups and double bond broke to form m z 388 and m z 349 substance respectively based on the m z 349 substance the ring in which the methyl and aldehyde groups resided opened and formed m z 242 products wang et al 2011 it was further observed that the formation of m z 106 and m z 60 which was caused by the breaking of the chemical bond of m z 242 yi et al 2021 in addition product with m z 497 was detected which might be caused by the fracture of the double bond on tc ring and hydroxylation by hydroxyl radical attack huang et al 2017 the substance with m z of 384 had 59 mass units less than tc probably due to the low c n bond energy at c3 and c4 which was easy to be attacked and led to fracture wang et al 2011 the products with m z 267 and 293 had lost the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups from m z 384 khan et al 2010 according to the above analysis the ring structure of tc could be opened and tc could be degraded into smaller molecules until the generation of co2 and h2o the toxicity values of the intermediates degraded by tetracycline were calculated by qsar among which m z 497 had the highest toxicity values table s3 the overall environmental toxicities alleviation implied that bs zvi mb could effectively mineralize tc without generation of more hazardous intermediates qu et al 2022c additionally the substances with m z 60 is also hazardous however majority of the intermediates showed no obvious toxicity generally the toxicity of the solution is decreasing during the degradation the specific degradation pathway of tc by bs zvi mb was proposed fig s7 3 3 degradation mechanism of tc degradation by bs zvi mb commonly fe ⅱ ⅲ could be produced during the removal of contaminant by zvi du et al 2016 it was unknown what the role fe ⅱ ⅲ played in the degradation of tc by bs zvi mb therefore the concentration of fe ⅱ ⅲ in the reaction were measured to explore the mechanism of the tc degradation further fe ⅱ ⅲ reached to the peak of 4 01 mm and 8 35 mm at 45 min and then remained stable fig 3 a tc had a strong tendency to complex with metals due to the multiple o and n containing moieties which may greatly impact the behavior of tc in the aquatic environment including interactions with mineral surfaces and redox reactions figueroa et al 2004 werner et al 2006 previous study reported that fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ could easily complex with tc to form fe ⅱ ⅲ tc lye et al 2020 the specific role of fe ⅱ ⅲ in tc degradation is still unclear hence further study were performed the following experiment was carried out in brown bottles with sealed caps to explore the complexation behavior between fe ⅱ ⅲ and tc h2o2 was not added to avoid the influence of fenton on the reaction different concentrations of fe ⅱ ⅲ were added to explore the mechanism and the possible location of complexation between fe ⅱ ⅲ and tc and δ absorbance δ abs was recorded fig 3b and c the calculation method on δabs was provided in sm δabs fluctuated greatly in the wavelength of 270 320 nm and increased with the concentration of fe ⅲ fig 3b there was no obvious change at 340 370 nm the a ring of tc marked in fig s7 mainly contributed to the absorbance at 270 300 nm while the absorbance of bcd ring was mainly reflected at 250 300 nm and 340 370 nm chen and huang 2009 therefore it was reasonable to speculate that the complexation of fe ⅲ and tc mainly occurred in the a ring of tc similarly δabs showed obvious fluctuation in the wavelength of 270 320 nm and rose with the increase of fe ⅱ concentration fig 3c the change was not obvious in the range of 340 370 nm the complexation position of fe ⅱ and tc was in the a ring based on fluctuation of δabs in the wavelength of 270 320 nm previous study also reported that fe ⅱ could complex with amide group of a ring and o at the c3 of tc huang et al 2017 tc will undergo molecular isomerism change at the position of dimethylamino in a ring to form 4 epi tc under acidic condition chen and huang 2009 huang et al 2017 therefore the 4 epi tc was prepared by inducing isomerization of tc under acidic condition to verify the complexation position of fe ⅲ and tc fig 3d it was obvious that the degradation rate of tc was 6 33 times than that of 4 epi tc which supported the hypothesis above chen and huang 2009 found that cu ⅱ could be reduced to cu ⅰ by promoting the oxidative degradation of tc the redox potential of fe ⅲ was 0 77 v which was more negative than that of cu 0 34 v deng et al 2006 therefore it was theoretically possible that fe ⅲ had the ability to catalytic degradation of tc by oxidation 4 mm fe ⅲ and 3 mg l tc was added to the sealed bottles to explore the redox reaction between fe ⅲ and tc the concentration of fe ⅱ in the reaction was determined it was observed that fe ⅱ sharply increased to 0 18 mm and then slightly decreased fig s8 the presence of fe ⅱ demonstrated that tc could be degraded by fe iii figs s8 and 3d and fe ⅲ itself was reduced to fe ⅱ generally tc was oxidized by fe ⅲ in the complexation state to produce the oxidation product e g tcs fenton reaction occurred due to the coexistence of fe ⅱ and h2o2 and ros was generated accordingly wang and huang 2017 zhang et al 2018 therefore ros scavengers benzoquinone bq n butanol and sodium oxalate na oa were added to explore the effect of o2 oh and h respectively on tc degradation wang et al 2016 2022 tc was completely degraded by bs zvi mb within 2 h while the degradation efficiency decreased to 62 4 13 1 and 93 9 in the presence of bq n butanol and na oa respectively fig 4 a indicating that oh and o2 exerted the more influence on the tc degradation by bs zvi mb esr spectra of dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were conducted to investigate the formation of ros during the reaction fig 4b and c the signal of oh gradually increased when the reaction began indicating that oh was formed in the tc degradation by bs zvi mb fig 4b the signal of o2 shared the same trend with oh but its change was not obvious as oh fig 4c it was illustrated that o2 and oh played major role in the tc degradation particularly oh meanwhile the result showed that the conversion between free radical could be ignored based on the above analysis the following equations for possible reactions were given 3 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 4 f e 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 5 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 2 h 2 o 6 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h oh 7 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 o 2 2 h 8 f e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 3 4 effect of eps on tc degradation eps secreted by srb may affect the degradation of tc as well ft ir analysis was conducted to explore the organic functional groups of bs zvi mb fig s9 the functional groups could be assigned to hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharide and nucleic acids and the fingerprint region fan et al 2017 yin et al 2015 the peak detected in 3440 cm 1 was a dominant peak and could be ascribed to the hydrogen bond stretching rinaudo 2006 the position and the number of peaks of eps and bs zvi mb were almost similar indicating that eps affected on the characteristic of bs zvi mb therefore the effect of eps on the reactivity of bs zvi mb was explored eps was extracted and added in the system of fe ⅱ fe ⅲ and bs zvi mb fig 5 a tc degradation by fe ⅱ fe ⅲ and bs zvi mb decreased by 9 22 13 42 and 54 29 respectively indicating that eps showed inhibition effect on the degradation of tc as an organic matter secreted by microorganisms eps could complex with fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ to form eps fe ⅱ and eps fe ⅲ complexes to load on the surface of zvi and affect the release of fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ guibaud et al 2009 additionally eps might quench ros during the reaction diaz et al 2013 esr spectrum was conducted to explore the effect of eps on ros production during the tc degradation at first fig 5b and c in the first 15 min esr showed no obvious changes in o2 and oh but o2 and oh increased gradually in the study above fig 4b and c especially oh therefore it was indicated that eps could have an inhibition effect on o2 and oh slightly the complexation effect of eps on fe ⅱ ⅲ was studied in the following experiments in order to explore the effect of eps on reaction potential and current of bs zvi mb eis and tafel tests of bs zvi mb were performed fig 5d and e the ito coated with s zvi mb was placed in eps extracted from srb for 4 h the corrosion potential decreased gradually from 0 49 v to 0 50 v at first and then rose to 0 36 v at 4 h while the corrosion current density showed an opposite trend and it increased from 0 35 μa cm2 to 5 32 μa cm2 within an hour then dropped to 0 26 μa cm2 at 4 h thus the presence of eps could inhibit the reactivity of bs zvi mb after 1 h fig 5d and table s4 tafel curve was obtained by circuit simulation of eis diagram fig 5e and table s5 charge transfer resistance rct was often used to characterize the reactivity of zvi meylheuc et al 2006 the rct of s zvi mb showed a downward trend in the first 1 h and then increased indicating that the reaction was difficult to proceed after 1 h the solution resistance rs was less than 30 ω cm2 and far less than rct suggesting that the resistance mainly came from charge transfer li et al 2021 the base resistance rb increased from 603 ω cm2 to 448 ω cm2 in s zvi mb while the layer capacitance cf and rb showed a completely opposite trend showing that the reaction trend decreased with the increase of thickness of eps therefore it was hypothesized that eps could be adsorbed to the surface of bs zvi mb and formed a protective layer thus inhibiting the electron transfer between bs zvi mb and tc the restriction of fe ii would have a negative effect on fenton reaction generally the inhibition effect of eps on the tc degradation could be mainly ascribed to the complexation with fe ⅱ ⅲ which affected the interaction between bs zvi mb and tc besides the negative effect on the tc degradation eps could absorb tc to form eps tc complex and tc could had an effect on the properties of eps as well which may affect the removal of pollutants 3d eem spectroscopy was used to further analyze eps fig 5f the positions of characteristic peaks indicated that the eps in bs zvi mb contained three fluorophores with the ex em at 220 nm 365 nm 280 nm 375 380 nm and 320 nm 390 nm respectively it was reported that these three endogenous fluorophores were ascribed to the tyrosine tryptophan amino acid tyrosine tryptophan type proteins and humic acid respectively wang et al 2018 wang and zhang 2010 after addition of tc the change of the fluorophores in eps were observed at ex 220 nm 280 nm and 320 nm respectively fig 6 the fluorescence intensities of three fluorophores all decreased with the increase of tc concentration indicating the strong interactions between tc and eps the maximum em of tryptophan was associated closely with the environment which tended to red shift as the change of hydrophobicity quagraine et al 2001 the em of tryptophan red shifted by nearly 30 40 nm from 360 nm fig 6a indicating the addition of tc decreased the hydrophobicity of system the tryptophan residues in tryptophan type proteins also red shifted slightly fig 6b which was possibly caused by the change of protein structure due to the presence of tc hu et al 2004 found that the extensional degree of peptide chain in proteins increased when the environment became more hydrophilic or less hydrophobic as the tc concentration increased to over 5 mg l the fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically suggesting that the binding sites were occupied completely and the structure of the peptide chains was severely disrupted fig 6 obviously the fluorescence of tryptophan tryptophan type proteins and humic acids in eps all decreased after the addition of tc which was probably attributed to the formation of some complexes the formation of these complexes between eps and tc would promote the tc degradation and have a negative effect on the structure of eps 4 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the kinetics pathways and mechanism of tc degradation by bs zvi mb the main conclusions of our study are 1 biochar and biogenetic sulfidation were employed to enhance the reactivity of zvi biochar provided more attachment for zvi and srb due to its loose structure additionally biochar could enhance the electrons transfer during reaction 2 fe ⅱ ⅲ could complex with tc at the a ring tc was oxidized by complexing fe ⅲ to generate oxidation products while fe ⅲ was reduced to fe ⅱ oh and o2 radical which were produced during the oxidation of fe ⅱ played important roles in tc degradation by bs zvi mb especially oh 3 eps attached on the bs zvi mb had a slight quenching effect on ros meanwhile eps formed a protective layer with fe ⅱ ⅲ on bs zvi mb reducing its reactivity with tc complexation between tc and eps occurred to form eps tc complex and tc could had negative effect on the properties of eps
