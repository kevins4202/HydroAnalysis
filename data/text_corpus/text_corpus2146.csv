either an observed market price in the immediately preceding period or an average of past crop prices as a proxy for current crop price expectation these price expectation specifications are based on an adaptive expectations model proposed by nerlove 1958 other studies including gardner 1976 mckenzie 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 and haile et al 2016 exploit the hypothesis that the price of a futures contract for next year s crop is an unbiased predictor of the harvest time crop price and use the harvest time futures price as a proxy for farmers price expectations nevertheless despite the vast literature on crop price expectations there is not a universal agreement on the appropriate specification to use for empirical estimation of crop production decisions shideed and white 1989 nerlove and bessler 2001 vitale et al 2009 within this study various proxies for crop price expectations are employed to test whether crop price expectations have a positive effect on the quantity of groundwater pumped in particular following nerlove s 1958 adaptive expectations approach we consider six alternative specifications of farmers crop price expectations the first specification assumes that the expected crop price is an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year the second specification uses an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding three years as a proxy for crop price expectations the third and fourth proxies for crop price expectations are a three month average of previous year pre and post harvest prices respectively the fifth and sixth specifications use a three year average of pre and post harvest prices respectively as a proxy for farmers crop price expectations 3 data and preliminary analysis the data used in this study were from a 10 county region within northwest kansas groundwater management district 4 gmd4 overlying the ogallala aquifer cheyenne decatur gove graham logan rawlins sheridan sherman thomas and wallace fig 1 the 10 counties were selected mainly due to the availability of field level groundwater use data for this analysis we constructed an unbalanced panel data set of annual data for over 2700 points of diversion pdiv within the district from 2001 to 2017 1 1 note that while groundwater pumping data were available since the 1940s natural gas industrial price data used for calculating pumping cost were only available beginning in january 2001 we only consider the fields planted entirely to one crop this is because data on how groundwater was allocated to specific crops when multiple crops were planted were not available for each pdiv typically a single water well the data set contained annual groundwater pumped acre inches per acre area irrigated acres crop planted precipitation inches pumping cost dollars per acre inch and expected crop prices 2 2 due to lack of location specific input prices besides the pumping cost other input prices were highly correlated across observations and could not be included in the estimation data on annual groundwater pumped area irrigated and crops planted were obtained from the water information management and analysis system wimas which was created and is maintained by the kansas department of agriculture division of water resources kda dwr monthly precipitation data were retrieved from the prism climate group and spatially matched to each pdiv using the longitude and latitude of each pdiv the total quantity of rainfall at each pdiv during october through december of the previous year and january through may of the current year was used to represent precipitation faced by a crop producer when he or she made a groundwater pumping decision following rogers and alam 2006 producers pumping cost per acre inch of groundwater was computed as 7 q 0 00186 p g d where 0 00186 is the quantity of natural gas thousand cubic feet or mcf needed to pump one acre inch of groundwater one foot p g the natural gas price dollars per mcf and d is depth to water feet similar to hendricks and peterson 2012 p g was calculated as the average of the june and july natural gas industrial prices data for kansas natural gas industrial price were obtained from the energy information administration eia county level water depth data were retrieved from the kansas geological survey s water information storage and retrieval database wizard 3 3 county level water depth data were used because field level water depth data were only available for a small number of fields our analysis concentrated on the five most commonly irrigated crops in northwest kansas alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat expected crop prices were constructed using kansas monthly cash price data from 1997 to 2016 data on price received for the five crops were taken from the united states department of agriculture usda economic research service for alfalfa the price received was measured in dollars per ton february march and april prices were used to compute the pre harvest price while may june and july prices were used to calculate the post harvest price for corn and soybeans the price received was measured in dollars per bushel for grain sorghum the price received was measured in dollars per hundredweight for these three crops corn soybeans and grain sorghum the pre harvest price was calculated using june july and august prices and the post harvest price was computed using september october and november prices for wheat the price received was measured in dollars per bushel march april and may prices were used to calculate the pre harvest price while june july and august prices were used to compute the post harvest price all price data used in the empirical analysis were normalized and the cost of pumping groundwater served as the numeraire descriptive statistics of per acre groundwater pumped area irrigated precipitation depth to water and pumping cost for the study area are presented in table 1 at each pdiv the average annual quantities of groundwater pumped per acre for alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat were 12 69 14 57 9 06 12 67 and 6 67 acre inches respectively these average figures were calculated using only those fields that are planted entirely to one of the five crops the quantity of per acre groundwater pumped for alfalfa was found to be more volatile than for the other four crops depending on the crop choice each water right owner irrigated an average of 69 09 112 75 acres each pdiv received an average of 10 38 in of precipitation per year average depth to water is 102 13 feet and average pumping cost is 99 cents per acre inch descriptive statistics of six alternative proxies for farmers crop price expectations are reported in table 2 with the exception of alfalfa the three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 gave the lowest mean non normalized and normalized expected crop prices while the three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 yielded the highest mean non normalized and normalized expected crop prices for the average expected alfalfa prices the three year average of pre harvest prices proxy 5 yielded the lowest non normalized as well as normalized expected prices on the other hand the average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 gave the highest non normalized expected alfalfa price whereas the three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 yielded the highest normalized expected alfalfa price as expected non normalized expected crop prices are more volatile than normalized expected crop prices note that when the non normalized expected crop price increases the normalized expected crop price increases less in areas with a greater depth to water due to the higher pumping cost it is this source of variation in the normalized expected crop price that helps identify the impact of crop price expectations the degree of dependence between the quantity of groundwater pumped and the six alternative proxies of farmers crop price expectations is reported in table 3 this study considered three different measures of the degree of dependence pearson s correlation coefficient spearman s rho and kendall s tau the pearson s correlation coefficient or simply the linear correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables of interest whereas spearman s rho i e spearman s rank correlation coefficient and kendall s tau are measures of nonlinear association between two variables for all crops the degrees of linear and nonlinear dependence between the quantity of irrigation water pumped and the expected crop price were negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level the negative dependence coefficients indicated that both variables tend to move in the opposite direction in other words the quantity of groundwater pumped and crop price expectations were inversely related to each other nevertheless the degrees of association were quite weak for alfalfa and soybeans regardless of the dependence measures considered the strongest association was found when the three year average of pre harvest crop prices proxy 5 was used as a proxy for expected crop price for corn and grain sorghum the strongest linear correlation was also observed when the three year average of pre harvest crop prices proxy 5 was used as a proxy for expected corn and grain sorghum prices however when considering measures of nonlinear dependence the degree of dependence was strongest for the case of corn when the three month average of previous year post harvest prices proxy 4 was used as a proxy and for the case of grain sorghum when the average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 was used as a proxy for wheat the highest pearson s correlation coefficient and spearman s rho were found when the average of wheat prices in the preceding three years proxy was used as a proxy kendall s tau on the other hand suggested that the degree of association between the two variables was strongest when the expected wheat price was proxied by the average of monthly wheat prices in the preceding year proxy 1 overall the results from the correlation analysis indicated a weak negative relationship between crop price expectations and the quantity of groundwater applied per acre these findings are consistent with adusumilli et al 2011 who found that expected crop price had a non positive impact on groundwater demand for the cases of grain sorghum wheat and cotton these preliminary findings suggest that producers irrigation decisions may not be consistent with the profit maximization framework which asserts that crop price expectations have a positive effect on the quantity of groundwater used to produce the crop 4 empirical results parameter estimates from fixed effects regressions under various specifications of crop price expectations for alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat are reported in tables 4 8 respectively note that the fixed effects regressions control for both field heterogeneity and time fixed effects for each respective crop the results are quite consistent across the six alternative proxies for normalized expected crop prices depending on crop type and proxy employed the fixed effects regression helps explain about 14 9 34 4 percent of the variation of quantity of groundwater pumped per acre the estimation results for alfalfa are shown in table 4 regardless of the proxy employed the coefficient on expected alfalfa price is negative but quite small and not statistically different from zero this indicates that the expected alfalfa price has no statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre of alfalfa the fixed effects regression results also indicate that there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and alfalfa producers groundwater use decisions as expected the coefficients on precipitation are negative for all cases ranging between 0 346 and 0 321 all of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent level this implies that alfalfa producers reduce the quantity of groundwater pumped as rainfall increases these findings also suggest that only a small portion of total rainfall is effective i e can be used directly for crop production as the magnitude of all rainfall coefficients is much smaller than one in addition we observe a significant inverse relationship between the number of irrigated acres and the quantity of groundwater pumped this indicates that alfalfa producers with more irrigated acres use less water per acre than those with less irrigated acres specifically we find that the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre is reduced by about 0 056 0 057 acre inches as the number of irrigated acres increases by one acre estimates from the fixed effects regressions for corn are reported in table 5 the estimation results for corn do not give a clear answer concerning the role of expected corn price we find no significant relationship between expected corn price and the quantity of irrigation water pumped when an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 a three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 or a three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 is used as a proxy for crop price expectations when an average of crop prices in the preceding three years proxy 2 or a three year average of pre harvest prices proxy 5 is considered the coefficient on expected corn price is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level implying that corn producers respond to higher expected corn price by reducing the quantity of groundwater applied to corn acreage however for the case where a three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 is used as a proxy for expected crop price we observe a significant positive relationship between expected corn price and the quantity of water pumped depending on the proxy selected the fixed effects regression results suggest that expected prices of other crops significantly affect corn producers groundwater pumping decisions similar to the case of alfalfa the precipitation variable is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level specifically the estimation results indicate that corn producers reduce the quantity of groundwater applied per acre by approximately 0 087 to 0 110 acre inches for each additional inch of rainfall confirming that only a small portion of rainfall is effective we also find that the marginal effect of the number of irrigated acres is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level each additional acre of irrigated land planted to corn results in a reduction in the quantity of groundwater extracted per acre by about 0 044 acre inches the estimation results for grain sorghum are presented in table 6 except when a three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 is used as a proxy for expected crop prices our results indicate that expected sorghum price does not significantly affect the quantity of groundwater pumped when proxy 6 is considered we find a significant positive relationship between expected sorghum price and the quantity of irrigation water use similar to the case of alfalfa there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and sorghum producers irrigation decisions interestingly the precipitation level does not significantly affect groundwater use decisions similar to the case of alfalfa and corn the empirical results tells us that sorghum producers with more irrigated acres apply less groundwater per acre than those with less irrigated acres specifically each additional acre of irrigated sorghum acreage results in a reduction in the per acre quantity of groundwater pumped by approximately 0 033 0 035 acre inches estimates from the fixed effects regressions for soybeans are shown in table 7 regardless of the proxy used the marginal effect of expected soybean price is not statistically significant depending on the proxy employed expected prices of alfalfa and or corn significantly affect soybeans producers groundwater pumping decisions similar to the case of grain sorghum our estimation results suggest that there is no significant relationship between inches of precipitation and the quantity of irrigation applied per acre as expected the marginal effect of irrigated acres is negative and statistically significant in particular we find that the quantity of groundwater applied per acre is reduced by about 0 080 0 081 acre inches as the number of irrigated acres planted to soybeans increases by one acre the estimation results for wheat are reported in table 8 considering the role of expected wheat price we find that the marginal effect of expected wheat price on the per acre quantity of groundwater pumped is not statistically significant these findings are consistent across the six proxies employed we also find that for most cases there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and wheat producers irrigation decisions focusing on the role of precipitation our empirical results indicate that an increase in precipitation leads to reduced groundwater extraction specifically wheat producers reduce the quantity of irrigation water applied per acre by about 0 225 to 0 300 acre inches for each additional inch of rainfall unlike the other four crops wheat producers groundwater pumping decisions are not significantly affected by the number of irrigated acre planted to wheat overall based on the marginal effect of expected price of own crop we find that producers groundwater pumping decisions are not consistent with the profit maximization framework in other words the empirical results do not support the hypothesis that crop price expectations have a positive effect on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre in general our results indicate that crop producers do not vary the quantity of groundwater applied per acre in response to higher expected own crop price at first glance this finding may seem counterintuitive however due to limited availability of groundwater in the area it is possible that irrigated producers treat groundwater as a fixed input and do not react to a change in expected own crop price because they do not have capacity to pump more these results suggest that the use of profit maximization framework may not be appropriate for explaining groundwater extraction decisions and that we need to look for an alternative way to model groundwater use in addition we find that only a small portion of total rainfall can be used directly for crop production and considered effective the estimation results show that except for grain sorghum and soybeans precipitation has a negative and statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre this suggests that irrigated producers of alfalfa corn and wheat vary the quantity of groundwater pumped as rainfall varies however the magnitude of all rainfall coefficients is statistically different from 1 indeed all precipitation coefficients are smaller than 0 35 acre inches in absolute value implying that only a small portion of rainfall is effective for these producers for grain sorghum and soybeans we find no significant relationship between inches of precipitation and the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre this implies that sorghum and soybeans producers are not sensitive to changes in the amount of rainfall 5 conclusions using field level panel data on groundwater pumped for irrigation in northwest kansas this paper examines whether producers irrigation decisions are consistent with the profit maximization framework by empirically testing whether crop price expectations have a positive impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped to accomplish this we assume that the quantity of groundwater pumped for a particular crop is a function of expected price of own crops expected prices of other crops precipitation and the number of irrigated acres planted to that particular crop all expected price data were normalized using the cost of pumping groundwater the marginal effect of crop price expectations on groundwater pumping decisions is estimated using fixed effects methods the fixed effects regressions control for both field and time fixed effects except for the case of corn the estimation results are generally robust across the six alternative proxies for producers crop price expectations considered while the analysis focuses specifically on western kansas due to data availability the results should be applicable to other regions overlying the ogallala aquifer based on the sign and the significance of the estimated marginal effects of crop price expectations on groundwater use it can be concluded that producers groundwater extraction decisions are not consistent with the profit maximization framework overall our empirical results indicate that crop price expectations have no statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre these findings seem to suggest that irrigated producers consider groundwater as a fixed input and do not vary the per acre quantity of groundwater use in response to a change in expected price of own crop this is possibly because given limited availability of groundwater in the area producers do not have capacity to pump more water even if they would like to this implies that the profit maximization framework may not be appropriate for modeling groundwater use the implications of these findings could help improve the accuracy of the intertemporal dynamic allocation model a commonly used tool for water policy design our estimation results also suggest that irrigated alfalfa corn and wheat producers in northwest kansas adjust the quantity of groundwater pumped in response to changes in precipitation however given the magnitude of the precipitation coefficients producers can only use a small portion of rainfall directly for crop production in other words only a small portion of rainfall is effective irrigated sorghum and soybeans producers on the other hand do not vary the quantity of groundwater extracted in response to changes in the amount of rainfall in the face of a declining water table in the ogallala aquifer these findings suggest that a more effective rainfall management is needed in irrigated agriculture possibly through the use of soil moisture probes or the availability of better weather predictions several limitations of the analysis are noted first in order to focus on identifying the direct marginal effect of crop price expectations on the quantity of groundwater pumped our econometric model assumes that groundwater applied per acre for a given crop is a function of expected crop prices relative to the cost of pumping precipitation and the number of irrigated acres this simple model implicitly ignores the indirect marginal effect of price expectations on groundwater use through changes in land use second due to data limitations the model does not control for changes in farm programs input prices irrigation technology and soil characteristics over the sample period more robust results could be obtained by controlling for these variables third while various proxies of price expectations are considered in the analysis all proxies are constructed based on nerlove s 1958 adaptive price expectations approach and the results may be sensitive to the specification of crop price expectations other price expectation models should be considered additional research questions include do the producers in northwest kansas vary crop acreage in response to a change in expected crop price if irrigated producers actually consider groundwater as a fixed input how are profit maximization predictions impacted how might spatial econometric techniques be used to improve the results in addition the actual irrigation efficiency and precipitation effectiveness remain to be quantified these issues should be addressed in future research acknowledgements this research was supported in part by the ogallala aquifer program a consortium of the usda

groundwater pumped in particular following nerlove s 1958 adaptive expectations approach we consider six alternative specifications of farmers crop price expectations the first specification assumes that the expected crop price is an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year the second specification uses an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding three years as a proxy for crop price expectations the third and fourth proxies for crop price expectations are a three month average of previous year pre and post harvest prices respectively the fifth and sixth specifications use a three year average of pre and post harvest prices respectively as a proxy for farmers crop price expectations 3 data and preliminary analysis the data used in this study were from a 10 county region within northwest kansas groundwater management district 4 gmd4 overlying the ogallala aquifer cheyenne decatur gove graham logan rawlins sheridan sherman thomas and wallace fig 1 the 10 counties were selected mainly due to the availability of field level groundwater use data for this analysis we constructed an unbalanced panel data set of annual data for over 2700 points of diversion pdiv within the district from 2001 to 2017 1 1 note that while groundwater pumping data were available since the 1940s natural gas industrial price data used for calculating pumping cost were only available beginning in january 2001 we only consider the fields planted entirely to one crop this is because data on how groundwater was allocated to specific crops when multiple crops were planted were not available for each pdiv typically a single water well the data set contained annual groundwater pumped acre inches per acre area irrigated acres crop planted precipitation inches pumping cost dollars per acre inch and expected crop prices 2 2 due to lack of location specific input prices besides the pumping cost other input prices were highly correlated across observations and could not be included in the estimation data on annual groundwater pumped area irrigated and crops planted were obtained from the water information management and analysis system wimas which was created and is maintained by the kansas department of agriculture division of water resources kda dwr monthly precipitation data were retrieved from the prism climate group and spatially matched to each pdiv using the longitude and latitude of each pdiv the total quantity of rainfall at each pdiv during october through december of the previous year and january through may of the current year was used to represent precipitation faced by a crop producer when he or she made a groundwater pumping decision following rogers and alam 2006 producers pumping cost per acre inch of groundwater was computed as 7 q 0 00186 p g d where 0 00186 is the quantity of natural gas thousand cubic feet or mcf needed to pump one acre inch of groundwater one foot p g the natural gas price dollars per mcf and d is depth to water feet similar to hendricks and peterson 2012 p g was calculated as the average of the june and july natural gas industrial prices data for kansas natural gas industrial price were obtained from the energy information administration eia county level water depth data were retrieved from the kansas geological survey s water information storage and retrieval database wizard 3 3 county level water depth data were used because field level water depth data were only available for a small number of fields our analysis concentrated on the five most commonly irrigated crops in northwest kansas alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat expected crop prices were constructed using kansas monthly cash price data from 1997 to 2016 data on price received for the five crops were taken from the united states department of agriculture usda economic research service for alfalfa the price received was measured in dollars per ton february march and april prices were used to compute the pre harvest price while may june and july prices were used to calculate the post harvest price for corn and soybeans the price received was measured in dollars per bushel for grain sorghum the price received was measured in dollars per hundredweight for these three crops corn soybeans and grain sorghum the pre harvest price was calculated using june july and august prices and the post harvest price was computed using september october and november prices for wheat the price received was measured in dollars per bushel march april and may prices were used to calculate the pre harvest price while june july and august prices were used to compute the post harvest price all price data used in the empirical analysis were normalized and the cost of pumping groundwater served as the numeraire descriptive statistics of per acre groundwater pumped area irrigated precipitation depth to water and pumping cost for the study area are presented in table 1 at each pdiv the average annual quantities of groundwater pumped per acre for alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat were 12 69 14 57 9 06 12 67 and 6 67 acre inches respectively these average figures were calculated using only those fields that are planted entirely to one of the five crops the quantity of per acre groundwater pumped for alfalfa was found to be more volatile than for the other four crops depending on the crop choice each water right owner irrigated an average of 69 09 112 75 acres each pdiv received an average of 10 38 in of precipitation per year average depth to water is 102 13 feet and average pumping cost is 99 cents per acre inch descriptive statistics of six alternative proxies for farmers crop price expectations are reported in table 2 with the exception of alfalfa the three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 gave the lowest mean non normalized and normalized expected crop prices while the three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 yielded the highest mean non normalized and normalized expected crop prices for the average expected alfalfa prices the three year average of pre harvest prices proxy 5 yielded the lowest non normalized as well as normalized expected prices on the other hand the average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 gave the highest non normalized expected alfalfa price whereas the three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 yielded the highest normalized expected alfalfa price as expected non normalized expected crop prices are more volatile than normalized expected crop prices note that when the non normalized expected crop price increases the normalized expected crop price increases less in areas with a greater depth to water due to the higher pumping cost it is this source of variation in the normalized expected crop price that helps identify the impact of crop price expectations the degree of dependence between the quantity of groundwater pumped and the six alternative proxies of farmers crop price expectations is reported in table 3 this study considered three different measures of the degree of dependence pearson s correlation coefficient spearman s rho and kendall s tau the pearson s correlation coefficient or simply the linear correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables of interest whereas spearman s rho i e spearman s rank correlation coefficient and kendall s tau are measures of nonlinear association between two variables for all crops the degrees of linear and nonlinear dependence between the quantity of irrigation water pumped and the expected crop price were negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level the negative dependence coefficients indicated that both variables tend to move in the opposite direction in other words the quantity of groundwater pumped and crop price expectations were inversely related to each other nevertheless the degrees of association were quite weak for alfalfa and soybeans regardless of the dependence measures considered the strongest association was found when the three year average of pre harvest crop prices proxy 5 was used as a proxy for expected crop price for corn and grain sorghum the strongest linear correlation was also observed when the three year average of pre harvest crop prices proxy 5 was used as a proxy for expected corn and grain sorghum prices however when considering measures of nonlinear dependence the degree of dependence was strongest for the case of corn when the three month average of previous year post harvest prices proxy 4 was used as a proxy and for the case of grain sorghum when the average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 was used as a proxy for wheat the highest pearson s correlation coefficient and spearman s rho were found when the average of wheat prices in the preceding three years proxy was used as a proxy kendall s tau on the other hand suggested that the degree of association between the two variables was strongest when the expected wheat price was proxied by the average of monthly wheat prices in the preceding year proxy 1 overall the results from the correlation analysis indicated a weak negative relationship between crop price expectations and the quantity of groundwater applied per acre these findings are consistent with adusumilli et al 2011 who found that expected crop price had a non positive impact on groundwater demand for the cases of grain sorghum wheat and cotton these preliminary findings suggest that producers irrigation decisions may not be consistent with the profit maximization framework which asserts that crop price expectations have a positive effect on the quantity of groundwater used to produce the crop 4 empirical results parameter estimates from fixed effects regressions under various specifications of crop price expectations for alfalfa corn grain sorghum soybeans and wheat are reported in tables 4 8 respectively note that the fixed effects regressions control for both field heterogeneity and time fixed effects for each respective crop the results are quite consistent across the six alternative proxies for normalized expected crop prices depending on crop type and proxy employed the fixed effects regression helps explain about 14 9 34 4 percent of the variation of quantity of groundwater pumped per acre the estimation results for alfalfa are shown in table 4 regardless of the proxy employed the coefficient on expected alfalfa price is negative but quite small and not statistically different from zero this indicates that the expected alfalfa price has no statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre of alfalfa the fixed effects regression results also indicate that there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and alfalfa producers groundwater use decisions as expected the coefficients on precipitation are negative for all cases ranging between 0 346 and 0 321 all of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent level this implies that alfalfa producers reduce the quantity of groundwater pumped as rainfall increases these findings also suggest that only a small portion of total rainfall is effective i e can be used directly for crop production as the magnitude of all rainfall coefficients is much smaller than one in addition we observe a significant inverse relationship between the number of irrigated acres and the quantity of groundwater pumped this indicates that alfalfa producers with more irrigated acres use less water per acre than those with less irrigated acres specifically we find that the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre is reduced by about 0 056 0 057 acre inches as the number of irrigated acres increases by one acre estimates from the fixed effects regressions for corn are reported in table 5 the estimation results for corn do not give a clear answer concerning the role of expected corn price we find no significant relationship between expected corn price and the quantity of irrigation water pumped when an average of monthly crop prices in the preceding year proxy 1 a three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 or a three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 is used as a proxy for crop price expectations when an average of crop prices in the preceding three years proxy 2 or a three year average of pre harvest prices proxy 5 is considered the coefficient on expected corn price is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level implying that corn producers respond to higher expected corn price by reducing the quantity of groundwater applied to corn acreage however for the case where a three month average of previous year pre harvest prices proxy 3 is used as a proxy for expected crop price we observe a significant positive relationship between expected corn price and the quantity of water pumped depending on the proxy selected the fixed effects regression results suggest that expected prices of other crops significantly affect corn producers groundwater pumping decisions similar to the case of alfalfa the precipitation variable is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level specifically the estimation results indicate that corn producers reduce the quantity of groundwater applied per acre by approximately 0 087 to 0 110 acre inches for each additional inch of rainfall confirming that only a small portion of rainfall is effective we also find that the marginal effect of the number of irrigated acres is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level each additional acre of irrigated land planted to corn results in a reduction in the quantity of groundwater extracted per acre by about 0 044 acre inches the estimation results for grain sorghum are presented in table 6 except when a three year average of post harvest prices proxy 6 is used as a proxy for expected crop prices our results indicate that expected sorghum price does not significantly affect the quantity of groundwater pumped when proxy 6 is considered we find a significant positive relationship between expected sorghum price and the quantity of irrigation water use similar to the case of alfalfa there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and sorghum producers irrigation decisions interestingly the precipitation level does not significantly affect groundwater use decisions similar to the case of alfalfa and corn the empirical results tells us that sorghum producers with more irrigated acres apply less groundwater per acre than those with less irrigated acres specifically each additional acre of irrigated sorghum acreage results in a reduction in the per acre quantity of groundwater pumped by approximately 0 033 0 035 acre inches estimates from the fixed effects regressions for soybeans are shown in table 7 regardless of the proxy used the marginal effect of expected soybean price is not statistically significant depending on the proxy employed expected prices of alfalfa and or corn significantly affect soybeans producers groundwater pumping decisions similar to the case of grain sorghum our estimation results suggest that there is no significant relationship between inches of precipitation and the quantity of irrigation applied per acre as expected the marginal effect of irrigated acres is negative and statistically significant in particular we find that the quantity of groundwater applied per acre is reduced by about 0 080 0 081 acre inches as the number of irrigated acres planted to soybeans increases by one acre the estimation results for wheat are reported in table 8 considering the role of expected wheat price we find that the marginal effect of expected wheat price on the per acre quantity of groundwater pumped is not statistically significant these findings are consistent across the six proxies employed we also find that for most cases there is no significant relationship between expected prices of the other four crops and wheat producers irrigation decisions focusing on the role of precipitation our empirical results indicate that an increase in precipitation leads to reduced groundwater extraction specifically wheat producers reduce the quantity of irrigation water applied per acre by about 0 225 to 0 300 acre inches for each additional inch of rainfall unlike the other four crops wheat producers groundwater pumping decisions are not significantly affected by the number of irrigated acre planted to wheat overall based on the marginal effect of expected price of own crop we find that producers groundwater pumping decisions are not consistent with the profit maximization framework in other words the empirical results do not support the hypothesis that crop price expectations have a positive effect on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre in general our results indicate that crop producers do not vary the quantity of groundwater applied per acre in response to higher expected own crop price at first glance this finding may seem counterintuitive however due to limited availability of groundwater in the area it is possible that irrigated producers treat groundwater as a fixed input and do not react to a change in expected own crop price because they do not have capacity to pump more these results suggest that the use of profit maximization framework may not be appropriate for explaining groundwater extraction decisions and that we need to look for an alternative way to model groundwater use in addition we find that only a small portion of total rainfall can be used directly for crop production and considered effective the estimation results show that except for grain sorghum and soybeans precipitation has a negative and statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre this suggests that irrigated producers of alfalfa corn and wheat vary the quantity of groundwater pumped as rainfall varies however the magnitude of all rainfall coefficients is statistically different from 1 indeed all precipitation coefficients are smaller than 0 35 acre inches in absolute value implying that only a small portion of rainfall is effective for these producers for grain sorghum and soybeans we find no significant relationship between inches of precipitation and the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre this implies that sorghum and soybeans producers are not sensitive to changes in the amount of rainfall 5 conclusions using field level panel data on groundwater pumped for irrigation in northwest kansas this paper examines whether producers irrigation decisions are consistent with the profit maximization framework by empirically testing whether crop price expectations have a positive impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped to accomplish this we assume that the quantity of groundwater pumped for a particular crop is a function of expected price of own crops expected prices of other crops precipitation and the number of irrigated acres planted to that particular crop all expected price data were normalized using the cost of pumping groundwater the marginal effect of crop price expectations on groundwater pumping decisions is estimated using fixed effects methods the fixed effects regressions control for both field and time fixed effects except for the case of corn the estimation results are generally robust across the six alternative proxies for producers crop price expectations considered while the analysis focuses specifically on western kansas due to data availability the results should be applicable to other regions overlying the ogallala aquifer based on the sign and the significance of the estimated marginal effects of crop price expectations on groundwater use it can be concluded that producers groundwater extraction decisions are not consistent with the profit maximization framework overall our empirical results indicate that crop price expectations have no statistically significant impact on the quantity of groundwater pumped per acre these findings seem to suggest that irrigated producers consider groundwater as a fixed input and do not vary the per acre quantity of groundwater use in response to a change in expected price of own crop this is possibly because given limited availability of groundwater in the area producers do not have capacity to pump more water even if they would like to this implies that the profit maximization framework may not be appropriate for modeling groundwater use the implications of these findings could help improve the accuracy of the intertemporal dynamic allocation model a commonly used tool for water policy design our estimation results also suggest that irrigated alfalfa corn and wheat producers in northwest kansas adjust the quantity of groundwater pumped in response to changes in precipitation however given the magnitude of the precipitation coefficients producers can only use a small portion of rainfall directly for crop production in other words only a small portion of rainfall is effective irrigated sorghum and soybeans producers on the other hand do not vary the quantity of groundwater extracted in response to changes in the amount of rainfall in the face of a declining water table in the ogallala aquifer these findings suggest that a more effective rainfall management is needed in irrigated agriculture possibly through the use of soil moisture probes or the availability of better weather predictions several limitations of the analysis are noted first in order to focus on identifying the direct marginal effect of crop price expectations on the quantity of groundwater pumped our econometric model assumes that groundwater applied per acre for a given crop is a function of expected crop prices relative to the cost of pumping precipitation and the number of irrigated acres this simple model implicitly ignores the indirect marginal effect of price expectations on groundwater use through changes in land use second due to data limitations the model does not control for changes in farm programs input prices irrigation technology and soil characteristics over the sample period more robust results could be obtained by controlling for these variables third while various proxies of price expectations are considered in the analysis all proxies are constructed based on nerlove s 1958 adaptive price expectations approach and the results may be sensitive to the specification of crop price expectations other price expectation models should be considered additional research questions include do the producers in northwest kansas vary crop acreage in response to a change in expected crop price if irrigated producers actually consider groundwater as a fixed input how are profit maximization predictions impacted how might spatial econometric techniques be used to improve the results in addition the actual irrigation efficiency and precipitation effectiveness remain to be quantified these issues should be addressed in future research acknowledgements this research was supported in part by the ogallala aquifer program a consortium of the usda

10731,the complex and dense irrigation and drainage networks and diverse irrigation scheduling result in uncertainties and complexities in the simulation of drainage water and salinity at different regional scales we propose a semi distributed model to simulate monthly drainage water and salinity considering both the surface return flow and groundwater drainage to drainage ditches the model uses sub drainage command areas sdcas controlled by main irrigation canals and drainage ditches as simulation units and uses a conceptual model to estimate monthly drainage water and salinity from each sdca the proposed model is applied in the hetao irrigation district hid in north china with 19 sdcas and calibrated and validated using monitoring data during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 respectively the results reveal better model performance in estimating the drainage water and salinity at sdca sub irrigation district and irrigation district scales the average annual drainage is 47 021 104m3 in hid accounting for 10 5 of the annual irrigation water amount the surface return flow and groundwater drainage account for 32 7 and 67 3 of total drainage respectively the ratio of surface return flow to groundwater drainage is higher in the upstream area and lower in the downstream area higher surface return flow ratio 5 is observed in the western wulanbuhe middle and southern jiefangzha and northern wulate sub irrigation areas indicating the necessity to improve irrigation water management in these areas lower groundwater drainage capability is observed in western and southern hid while enhanced groundwater drainage capability is observed in northern hid average annual salt leaching through the drainage system is 126 5 104 t which is only 43 of the total salt introduced from irrigation the wulate sub irrigation district performs best on salt leaching while other sub irrigation district should improve the drainage system and irrigation water use efficiency to control the salt accumulation keywords drainage semi distributed model surface return flow groundwater drainage irrigation district 1 introduction irrigation districts are the hub of food production and agricultural water consumption in many parts of the world food and agriculture organization fao 2008 indicated that agricultural water use is about 70 of the total freshwater uses agricultural drainage is defined as the amount of water flowing over ground surface or through sub surface and finally enter into the drainage system oosterbaan 1994 needelman et al 2007 agricultural drainage is a critical process in irrigation districts the agricultural drainage is area dependent and studies have reported that it can account for 20 40 of irrigation water in some areas with poor irrigation water management oosterveld et al 1978 keys 1981 poor drainage system usually causes waterlogging and salinity problems singh 2015 2019a wichelns and qadir 2015 huang et al 2018 therefore efficient evaluation of drainage system is essential for sustainable agricultural water management crop production soil salinization prevention and salinized land reclamation blann et al 2009 khand et al 2017 singh 2019b especially in arid regions with severe water scarcity and intense evapotranspiration agricultural drainage is affected by both natural and artificial factors the natural factors include precipitation soil texture and groundwater table while the dominant artificial factors are amount of irrigation applied irrigation scheduling and crop planting structure garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 chien and fang 2012 poch massegú et al 2014 xing et al 2017 the relationship between drainage and its influencing factors is associated with the spatial scale effect cui et al 2007 wu et al 2019 some studies focused on drainage evaluation at the field and small regional scale zulu et al 1996 samani et al 2004 singh 2010 valipour 2012 jouni et al 2018 their simulation results based on field experiments are usually more credible and accurate than simulations on a large scale however the methods used in these studies generally require extensive field experiment data and have associated discrepancies that restrict their direct application in a large scale irrigation system such as at irrigation or sub irrigation districts levels wu et al 2019 complex irrigation canal system drainage system spatial heterogeneity of soil and crop add to the uncertainties and complexities for drainage estimation on regional scales wu et al 2019 drainage at the irrigation district scale is gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the requirement of increasing water use efficiency and reducing non point source contaminants which is significant in improving the economic and environmental benefits blann et al 2009 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 currently empirical or statistical conceptual and physically based numerical models are the available methods for simulating drainage at irrigation district scale xing et al 2017 table 1 shows the most extensively used drainage models in recent years empirical or statistical models such as drainage coefficient model dewandel et al 2008 jafari et al 2012 regression model lei et al 2002 and machine learning algorithms based model zhao et al 2006 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 are commonly used because of their simplicity and applicability however these models are generally suitable for annual drainage estimation due to their low accuracy and lack of physical basis xing et al 2017 conceptual drainage models are usually developed on the basis of water balance method chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 hydraulic method xue et al 2017 and isotope ratios method kattan 2008 seraphin et al 2016 these conceptual models showed good performances in daily and monthly drainage estimation but considered less on the distribution of irrigation and drainage system compared to models mentioned above researchers are more likely to use physically based numerical models for hydrologic process simulation in irrigated agricultural areas recently such as drainmod youssef et al 2018 swat soil and water assessment tool wu et al 2019 modflow mirlas 2013 wepp water erosion prediction project maalim and melesse 2013 flush nousiainen et al 2015 hydrus ebrahimian and noory 2015 swap soil water plant atmosphere xue and ren 2017 adapt agricultural drainage and pesticide transport gowda et al 2012 qual2k stream water quality model jafari talukolaee et al 2015 rzwqm2 root zone water quality model xian et al 2017 femgwst finite element model for groundwater flow and solute transport chandio et al 2013 saltmod chang et al 2019 and sahysmod singh and panda 2012a 2012b major characteristics and limitations of each model are listed in table 1 for example drainmod is a process based distributed model for daily drainage simulation that have validated and used extensively across the world skaggs 1981 singh 2019c hydrus focuses on water flow and solute transport in soil and groundwater simunek et al 1999 modflow deals with groundwater flow in three dimensions harbaugh et al 2000 swat is widely used for water flow and nonpoint source pollution simulation arnold et al 1998 and swap aims at crop production water flow and solute transport van dam et al 1997 table 1 generally these physically based numerical models have physical basis and predictive potentials and can consider the major hydrological processes they are used most widely in simulating large scale and short time step agro hydrologic processes in a distributed manner however most of these models require enormous input data and associated parameters that are not easily available such as soil water retention curve hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity in the regional scale they also usually run in short time steps and need at least a daily database except for saltmod and sahysmod although saltmod and sahysmod are applicable to simulate on seasonal scale they require parameters about soil properties and water balance components and considers less on the distribution of canal and ditch systems furthermore several other factors limit their use such as availability of data and support software and or reliability and capability for long term simulation and prediction singh and panda 2012a 2012b it is concluded that the existing models have discrepancies when applied for different purposes singh 2019c hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in arid region of northwest china suffered from waterlogging and salinity problems for years due to a large amount of water diversion from the yellow river and poor drainage system scholars applied different drainage models to explore the dynamic processes of drainage and salinity in hid sun 2014 xue and ren 2017 chang et al 2019 however these models are usually applied to only small sub areas of hid due to the requirement of large input data in the whole hid such as drainmod and saltmod sun 2014 chang et al 2019 although xue and ren 2017 simulated drainage in the whole hid by swap wofost model they focused more on other hydrological processes and oversimplified the distributed drainage system as a virtual drainage canal in hid that resulted in poor performance in drainage simulation therefore it is important to develop a drainage model with less data requirement middle time step simple and reliable in a distributed manner in large irrigation districts as hid the main objective of the current study is to develop a simple and robust semi distributed model for monthly drainage water and salinity simulation in an arid region which is calibrated and validated by observed data in 19 ditches of hid to test its applicability and reliability 2 materials and methods fig 1 shows procedures for drainage simulation and analysis including data collection data processing model calibration and validation and drainage analysis the irrigation amount irrigation and drainage systems groundwater table depth groundwater salinity and crop distribution are considered in the model precipitation is not considered in drainage water estimation due to less precipitation in the study region and its negligible contribution to drainage moreover the effects of soil texture distribution on drainage are considered in parameters for different simulation units 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid 40 1 41 4 n 106 1 109 4 e lies in a typical arid region of the inner mongolia autonomous region of northwest china fig 2 the hid is the largest irrigation district in the arid region of china and covers an area of 1 2 million ha with 47 being irrigated land it is composed of five sub irrigation districts including wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt sub irrigation districts the elevation of hid declines gently from 1091m in the southwest to 1000m in the northeast which determines the flow direction of water diversion and drainage the soil texture in hid consists of loam sandy loam and silt sand xue et al 2013 xue and ren 2017 yu and shang 2017 the study area has a continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 160 mm and pan evaporation 20 cm evaporation pan of approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature ranges from 7 5 9 1 c during 2012 2016 summer maize sunflower and wheat are three dominant crops in hid covering over 80 of cropland in recent years wen et al 2019 the hid has a very dense and complex irrigation canal and drainage network seven levels of irrigation canals and drainage ditches are designed to supply irrigation water to agriculture land and drain excess surface water and groundwater to drainage receiver respectively xue and ren 2017 according to the statistics from general administration of hetao irrigation district gahid the irrigation system contains about 85 900 irrigation canals with a total length of about 50 400 km and the drainage system includes 17 700 drainage ditches with the total length of about 14 000 km irrigation water of about 4 0 billion m3 per year is diverted from yellow river at the sanshenggong canal head to cropland through irrigation system with a hydraulic gradient of 1 4000 to 1 10000 this well developed irrigation system accounted for about 97 of agricultural water use in hid before 2000 ruan et al 2008 xu et al 2010 xue and ren 2017 ditches collect the drainage water from surface return flow and groundwater drainage and transport most of the drainage water through a general drainage ditch into wuliangsuhai lake the drainage water flowing into the wuliangsuhai lake accounts for 5 15 of irrigation water during 2005 2015 excessive irrigation and unmatched drainage system lead to shallow groundwater table depth ranging between 0 5 3 0 m ren et al 2018a and soil salinization problem is increasing rapidly under high evapotranspiration potential in hid guo et al 2018 huang et al 2018 consequently estimating drainage distribution in hid is essential for sustainable agricultural water management and soil salinization prevention 2 2 semi distributed monthly drainage model 2 2 1 canal and drainage command units the canal command areas ccas are defined as the basic units of irrigation application ccas of main canals can be divided based on the irrigation canal system the distribution of main secondary and tertiary canals in the study area is provided by gahid in this study ccas are divided based on the following principles a lower level canals of the corresponding main canal should be included in corresponding command areas b the boundaries of command areas are composed of irrigation canals and drainage ditches of the tertiary or higher levels and boundaries of sub irrigation districts around the main canal c when the boundaries mentioned above are not closed digital elevation model dem land use map and administrative boundaries are considered dem and land use map are used to identify the surface return flow and cropland boundaries respectively the hid is divided into 18 ccas c1 to c18 based on 21 main and secondary canals fig 3 a following the above mentioned principles due to the mixed boundary situation three main and secondary canals are merged in the vicinity of command areas of other canals similarly the sub drainage command areas sdcas are basic units of drainage concentration and are divided based on the distribution of drainage ditch system the distribution of general main secondary and tertiary ditches is obtained from gahid general drainage ditch lies from west to east in the north of hid fig 2 which receives drainage water from most of the main drainage ditches and flows into the wuliangsuhai lake fig 3 b shows 12 main drainage ditches in south north direction that drains into the general drainage ditch and 4 secondary drainage ditches in the south that drain directly into the yellow river principles to divide sdcas are described in details as follows a low level ditches secondary and tertiary ditches of the corresponding main ditch should be divided into same sdca b groundwater flow direction raster layer fig 3 b is used to acquire the boundary of sdca groundwater flow direction layer is obtained by utilizing groundwater level observations using the arcgis 10 2 pixels with groundwater flowing into the same ditch are classified into one sdca c it is ensured that the main canals and sub irrigation boundaries follow the conditions mentioned in step b d intersection of the extended secondary and tertiary ditches of different main ditches should be considered as a boundary if the boundaries mentioned above are not closed the sdcas are classified into three types with different drainage ditches a main drainage command areas consists of twelve sdcas m1 to m12 associated with twelve main drainage ditches that drain into the general drainage ditch b drainage command areas flowing into the yellow river constitutes four sdcas y1 to y4 that are in the south of general main canal and drain into the yellow river c general drainage ditch command areas consists of three sdcas g1 to g3 that are distributed around the general drainage ditch in northern hid they are obtained by excluding m1 to m12 and y1 to y4 from jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts respectively table 2 shows the matchup of sdcas ccas and 5 sub irrigation districts 2 2 2 drainage calculation of each sdcas the proposed monthly drainage model is simulated using the 19 sdcas as the simulation units irrigation depth groundwater table depth groundwater salinity and cropland distribution required in the corresponding simulation units are acquired by overlaying the above mentioned data layers groundwater table depth and salinity are calculated by taking the average of pixels in the sdcas for each sdca the drainage is composed of surface return flow and groundwater drainage to ditches i e 1 d t i max d g i d s i 0 where d g i d s i and d t i are groundwater drainage surface return flow and total drainage in the ith sdca 104m3 respectively the amount of surface return flow is mainly related to irrigation and excess irrigation will cause irrigation return flow to ditches for a well managed ideal irrigation scheme appropriate amount of irrigation water diversion should not result in much canal return flow however if the amount of diverted water is more than the amount required excess water diversion can flow directly to the drainage ditches through return flow canals therefore there should exist a threshold irrigation value above which canal return flow may occur the surface return flow is estimated from a proportion of irrigation exceeding the threshold for each sdca as 2 d s i max a i j 1 n i i j i c i a i j 10 3 0 where iij and aij are irrigation depth of the jth cca mm and its corresponding cropland areas hm2 in the ith sdca i c i is the threshold above which surface return flow occurs mm and ai is the ratio of surface return flow to excess irrigation ai and i c i in eq 2 are the parameters to be calibrated for each sdca according to darcy s law for groundwater flow groundwater drainage is related to the difference in water levels between groundwater and ditches therefore the groundwater drainage can be estimated as 3 d g i k gd i h d i h w i h g i where h d i is the equivalent depth of ditches from average land surface to the average ditch bed in the ith sdca m h w i is the equivalent water depth of ditches h g i is average groundwater table depth from average land surface k gd i is the parameter of drainage efficiency 104 m2 in the ith sdca and higher value of k gd indicates better discharge capacity between groundwater and ditches the parameters k gd i and h d i need to be calibrated for each sdca in the model the equivalent water depth of a ditch h w varies with drainage rate in ditches the relationship between h w and drainage can be simplified with a power function 4 based on the chézy formula braca 2008 4 h w i bi d t i ci where bi and ci are the parameters of stage discharge curve for equivalent drainage ditch of the ith sdca considering that h w i is determined by d t i the model runs iteratively with an initial value of d t i equal to d s i and stops until the absolute change of d t i in two successive iterations is less than 0 1 104m3 further the monthly drainage water salinity is calculated as 5 m t i d g i m g i d s i m s i d t i where m g i m s i and m t i are the salinities of groundwater irrigation water and drainage water g l 1 in the i th sdca respectively 2 3 data 2 3 1 irrigation water and salinity the general canal diverts water from the yellow river through sanshenggong canal head and conveys water to 21 main and secondary canals monthly water diversion data of these main and secondary canals from 2008 to 2013 is acquired from gahid the irrigation period usually starts from april and end in november in hid the average irrigation depth in each cca is determined from the amount of water diverted to the cca the monthly average irrigation depth is calculated from 6 ii 1000wi ai where ii is the average irrigation depth of the ith cca mm month wi is monthly water diversion of main canals corresponding to the ith cca 104m3 month and ai is cropland area in the ith cca hm2 table 3 shows the 6 year average values of monthly irrigation depth from april to november in 18 ccas the monthly amounts of irrigation water are mainly determined by available runoff of the yellow river crop irrigation requirements and agricultural practice for three major crops that account for over 80 of the cropping area wheat grows from april to july while summer maize and sunflower grow from may to september therefore irrigation is usually concentrated from may to july because less irrigation is required in the late growing stage of crops furthermore autumn irrigation in october to early november after harvesting is a special irrigation practice in hid to leach salt out of the root zone and store water in the soil layer so as to provide appropriate soil water and salinity conditions for crop sowing in the next year total amount of autumn irrigation water is about 1 3 of the annual irrigation water diversion in the study region therefore irrigation in october is generally the maximum in a year due to the decrease of river runoff and freezing of the river water since middle november irrigation in november is usually the minimum in irrigation months furthermore the annual average irrigation water salinity is obtained from bayannur water resources bulletin which changes slightly in different years and ranges between 0 58 0 74 g l from 2005 to 2015 zhang and pan 2006 also indicated that the salinity of surface water in hid is about 0 31 1 01 g l therefore the monthly irrigation salinity is set as a fixed value of the annual average water salinity due to its low variance 2 3 2 drainage water and salinity drainage water monitoring usually starts in april or may due to a very small drainage amount in the freezing and frozen periods from mid november to mid april the observed monthly drainage is available for m1 to m12 and y1 to y4 during 2008 2013 and the 6 year average monthly drainage amount from april to november for 19 sdcas is shown in table 4 drainage data in april is unavailable for m3 to m9 and y1 to y2 in table 4 due to the extended freezing period and late application of irrigation drainage process is closely related with and slightly lags behind the irrigation process the drainage is relatively low in april august and september due to the relative low irrigation amount intense evapotranspiration and deep groundwater table meanwhile drainage usually reaches its peak in october and november as a result of a large amount of autumn irrigation higher drainage salinity in november shows the effect of autumn irrigation on salt leaching besides drainage is monitored for jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts in the general drainage command area therefore the monthly drainage of g1 to g3 is calculated as below 7 d g i d o b s i j 1 n d i j where d g i is the monthly drainage of g i i 1 2 3 104 m3 d obs i is the observed monthly drainage of the i th sub irrigation district 104 m3 dij is the monthly drainage of the j th main drainage ditch in the i th sub irrigation district 104 m3 and n is the number of main drainage ditches in i th sub irrigation district table 4 also shows that the drainage water salinity varies significantly i e ranging between 0 53 19 66 g l in main drainage command areas m1 to m12 however the salinity data is unavailable for sdcas y1 to y4 and g1 to g3 2 3 3 groundwater table depth and salinity fig 4 a and b shows the distributions of groundwater observation wells where groundwater table depth and salinity are measured depth to groundwater table is measured every 5 days in 224 wells during 2008 2013 whereas the data is missing for the year 2011 groundwater salinity is measured in the mid of january march may july september october and november in 115 wells from 2008 to 2013 the ordinary kriging method cressie 1988 an effective method for interpolating the groundwater level and salinity ibrakhimov et al 2007 is used to interpolate the groundwater table depth and salinity with 250m spatial resolution 2 3 4 land use map the land use map of hid fig 4 c is obtained from the department of earth system science tsinghua university china http data ess tsinghua edu cn the cropland extent is derived through multi source remote sensing data from a land use map of the year 2010 having 30 m spatial resolution yu et al 2013 2 4 calibration and validation of the monthly drainage model drainage in the frost period from mid november to mid april is less and not monitored therefore the drainage from december to march is not considered for the model the model is calibrated and validated using observation data in the non frozen period from april to november during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 respectively the calibration parameters in 19 sdcas are adjusted by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated and observed monthly drainage which is 8 min rmse 1 n i 1 n d obs i d sim i 2 where d obs i and d sim i are observed and simulated values of drainage for the i th observation 104 m3 and n is the number of monthly drainage observations rmse is optimized using the genetic algorithm holland 1973 the genetic algorithm is an effective random searching method which has the capability to overcome deficiencies of local convergence for most traditional optimization algorithms and search the optimal solution globally wen et al 2017 to further examine the applicability of drainage model and calibrated parameters normalized rmse nrmse shcherbakov et al 2013 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 are used as indicators to assess the model performance the nrmse nse and r 2 are defined as 9 nrmse rmse max d o b s min d o b s 10 nse 1 i 1 n d obs i d sim i 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs 2 11 r 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs d sim i d sim 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs 2 i 1 n d sim i d sim 2 where d obs and d sim are average values of observed and simulated drainage generally nse and r 2 close to 1 indicate better performance between simulation results and observations moreover nrmse facilitates the comparisons between results of sdcas with different scales nrmse nse and r 2 are also used to evaluate the performance of salinity simulation results 2 5 evaluation of drainage characteristics the following three indexes are used to evaluate the characteristics of drainage in 19 sdcas 12 rsg i d s i d g i 13 rfr i d s i wi 14 gdc i d g i a t i d ta where rsg i is the ratio of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the ith sdca rfr i denotes return flow ratio defined as the ratio between surface return flow and water diversion amount wi in the i th sdca gdc i is groundwater drainage capability defined as the ratio between groundwater drainage modulus in the i th sdca with that of the whole hid a t i is area of the ith sdca and d and ta are the total groundwater drainage and drainage areas of hid 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 drainage water fig 5 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed monthly drainage water in 19 sdcas rmse nrmse nse and r 2 in calibration period are 174 2 104m3 7 7 0 84 and 0 92 respectively and change slightly to 226 4 104m3 9 1 0 76 and 0 88 in validation period respectively the model precision indexes for each sdca are given in table 5 results indicate that rmses for different sdcas range from 6 5 to 381 1 104m3 and 9 0 660 1 104m3 during the calibration and validation periods for different sdcas respectively the maximum and minimum rmse is observed in g3 and y2 respectively however maximum nrmse 23 1 35 9 is observed in y2 and y3 while the minimum is observed in y1 3 7 4 9 when monthly drainage of each sdca is taken into consideration the nse and r 2 for 12 main sdcas are more than 0 57 and 0 77 in the calibration period and greater than 0 33 and 0 60 in the validation period respectively the nse and r 2 indicate good performance in these regions these indexes are similar to the previous studies in which different models are used to simulate the drainage gosain et al 2005 kim et al 2009 kannan et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the sdcas draining into the yellow river y1 to y4 have the nse and r 2 higher than 0 17 and 0 56 in the calibration period but lower values are observed during the validation period because of insufficient observed drainage data only 3 6 observations per year the nse and r 2 values for the general ditch sdcas g1 to g3 are more than 0 13 and 0 37 during both calibration and validation periods the relatively lower nse and r 2 of general ditch scdas compared to m1 to m12 are due to the large variance of observed drainage the observed drainage for g1 to g3 is obtained indirectly through eq 7 in which the observation errors are accumulated overall the calculated indexes are generally within acceptable ranges which indicates better model performance in drainage simulation the calibrated parameters for 19 sdcas are given in table 6 k gd ranges between 49 9 2154 5 104m2 for different sdcas k gd is affected by soil hydraulic conductivity drainage ditch density and size of sdcas for instance although m1 and m2 have a similar area and both are located between wlbh and jfz sub irrigation districts the ditches are sparse in m1 due to less cropland therefore the k gd of m1 297 3 104m2 is significantly lower than m2 526 4 104m2 h d is related to the average depth of ditches in the sdca and shows contrasting characteristics in different sdcas it can be seen that h d is generally about 2 4 m and agrees with the field survey conducted by ue et al 2017 which revealed that the average depth of main and secondary ditches ranged between 2 4 m in hid however h d in the general ditch sdcas is relatively higher more specifically h d for g3 is 4 01 m due to the significantly deep ditches of general drainage about 6 m parameters a and i c are mainly affected by the cropland distribution and irrigation practices the calibrated values of a and i c are in the range of 0 01 0 30 and 3 166 mm for different sdcas respectively in sdcas y1 to y4 located between the yellow river and general main canal smaller i c 3 26 mm can be observed due to the higher soil moisture as a result of recharge from the yellow river and general main canal the sdcas with better irrigation conditions such as m1 m4 also have smaller i c while those with poor irrigation conditions such as g1 g3 have greater i c the differences of i c in different sdcas agree with the field survey results the parameters b and c for ditch water level h w are in the ranges of 0 17 1 00 and 0 13 0 76 respectively these two parameters represent the characteristics of hydraulic elements of ditches in different sdcas such as roughness hydraulic radius and hydraulic gradient shi 1988 collected the hydraulic parameters in hid and found that b and c are in the range of 0 08 0 95 and 0 22 0 81 for general main and secondary drainage ditches respectively the values of b and c in the current study are generally in acceptable ranges 3 1 2 drainage water salinity drainage water salinity for 12 main sdcas is calculated using eq 7 from the simulated monthly drainage water the salinity in g1 to g3 and y1 to y4 is not simulated due to unavailability of observed data fig 6 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed drainage water salinity from 2008 to 2013 the overall rmse nrmse nse and r 2 are 1 37 g l 1 7 0 0 74 and 0 87 respectively the model performance in salinity simulation is similar to or better than previous studies cavero et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xue 2018 the highest error during 2008 2013 is observed in m12 with the nrmse of 21 1 where the average salinity of groundwater and drainage water are 11 74 and 9 77 g l 1 respectively reasons for the relatively higher error in m12 are higher variation in groundwater salinity distribution and uncertainties in observed data in general salinity simulation results are in the acceptable range which depicts the reliability of simulated monthly drainage water and salinity 3 2 analysis of surface return flow and groundwater drainage 3 2 1 processes of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the whole hid the surface return flow d s and groundwater drainage d g processes are derived from monthly drainage simulation model fig 7 shows the processes of monthly surface return flow groundwater drainage irrigation amount and average groundwater table depth in hid from 2008 to 2013 excluding the year 2011 due to data unavailability results indicate that the monthly d s and d g change from 258 5 to 5861 1 104m3 and 343 2 11 907 3 104m3 in five years respectively the average annual drainage is 47 020 6 104m3 from april to november in hid accounting for 10 5 of annual irrigation amount yu et al 2016 found the ratio of drainage to irrigation was 11 4 in hid from 2006 to 2012 which agrees with our results d s and d g account for 32 7 and 67 3 of total drainage respectively the processes of d s and d g are consistent with the irrigation amount and average groundwater table depth peak values of d s are usually observed in may and october every year which is synchronistic with the spring irrigation in may and autumn irrigation in october with great irrigation amount however d g and groundwater table depth show delayed response to irrigation and peak values are observed in may june and november most of the return flow ratios rfrs range from 0 01 to 0 10 rfrs show strong dependency on the irrigation amount i e the maximum and minimum rfrs are observed in the months with high and low irrigation amount respectively 3 2 2 distribution of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in command areas fig 8 a represents the distribution of the ratio of surface return flow to groundwater drainage rsg in 19 sdcas the rsg ranges from 1 22 to 1 92 across different areas the maximum and minimum rsg are observed in m3 and y2 respectively the deeper groundwater table in y2 fig 4 a causes groundwater recharge from drainage ditches and consequently results in negative rsg it is observed that rsg is higher than 1 in the west of hid which means that d s dominate d g in those areas the relative low d s may be attributed to insufficient irrigation supply in east and north of hid in the mid and downstream of hid ren et al 2018b analyzed the water consumption in a typical region of m3 and obtained the rsg of 1 95 which is consistent with our results the distribution of rfr shows no significant spatial trend fig 8 b because rfr is mainly determined by the local irrigation systems and practices rfr ranges between 0 6 m5 to 22 8 y1 in different sdcas ren et al 2018b determined that the rfr in m3 is about 7 8 which is comparable to our results 7 3 higher rfr 5 is observed in the western wulanbuhe middle and southern jiefangzha and northern wulate sub irrigation areas indicating the necessity to improve irrigation water management in these areas the distribution of groundwater drainage capability gdc is shown in fig 8 c the results demonstrate that gdc ranges from 0 29 to 3 08 the higher gdc shows better groundwater drainage capability compared with other areas in hid the maximum and minimum gdc are acquired in g2 and y2 respectively y2 has a negative rsg and gdc due to the deep groundwater table depth furthermore sdcas in north and east of hid show good groundwater drainage capability where gdc values are more than 1 other sdcas perform poorly in terms of groundwater drainage due to sparse ditches deep groundwater table depth and or poor soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 analysis of salt balance 3 3 1 process of salt introduction leaching and accumulation in the whole hid considering that the groundwater inflow and outflow in hid are usually negligible due to the small hydraulic gradient of about 0 02 xu et al 2010 we define the salt accumulation approximately equal to the difference of salt introduced by irrigation and salt leaching through drainage the dynamic processes of salt balance in hid including salt introduced by irrigation salt leaching through drainage and salt accumulation are shown in fig 9 results show that the monthly salt introduction leaching and accumulation ranges between 6 5 to 105 5 104 t 0 5 51 3 104 t and 44 8 91 7 104 t during 2008 to 2013 excluding the year 2011 due to data unavailability respectively peak values of salt introduction and accumulation are observed in may july and october while the salt leaching reaches its peaks in june and november negative salt accumulation or desalinization is mainly observed in november 2 4 44 8 104 t which shows the salt leaching effect of autumn irrigation in october to early november the average annual salt introduction leaching and accumulation are 294 3 104 t 126 5 104 t and 167 8 104 from april to november in hid therefore only 43 0 of annual salt introduced by irrigation is leached by drainage while 57 0 of salt is accumulated in the soil and groundwater layers in hid yu et al 2016 studied the salt transport between agricultural and non agricultural land in hid and found that the average annual accumulated salt was 164 4 104 t wu et al 2009 focused on the soil salinity problem in hid from 1973 to 2006 and found about 70 of the introduced salt was accumulated in the irrigation district each year compared to result of wu et al 2009 the smaller salt accumulation percentage 57 0 in current study from 2008 to 2013 shows the improvement of drainage system and water saving effect of the hetao rehabilitation program since 1998 most of the salt flowing into agricultural land will transport and accumulate in the soil profile of non agricultural land resulting from the groundwater flow and intense evaporation wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 which will trigger soil salinization in part areas of the irrigation districts especially non irrigated land to conclude it is urgent and significant to control salinity problems by improving the drainage system and irrigation water use efficiency 3 3 2 salt accumulation fig 10 shows the average annual salt accumulation in 19 sdcas results indicate that the accumulated salt ranges from 111 1 312 0 t km 2 y1 m10 and m11 occupying 6 8 of hid are the only three regions without salt accumulation while the rest 93 2 tend to accumulate salt from 2008 to 2013 the most serious problem of salt accumulation is observed in m6 and m9 with over 300 t km 2 of salt accumulated every year ren et al 2018b found that the accumulated salt in m3 accounted for 76 2 about 295 13 t km 2 of the total salt introduced to m3 without considering the groundwater pumping which is consistent with the results in ig 10 a 282 7 t km 2 it is noted that the salt accumulation problem is more likely observed in the middle and west of hid due to a large amount of water diversion in these upstream regions the wulate sub irrigation district in the downstream performs well on salt leaching and salt balance control with the accumulated salt under 14 1 t km 2 each year therefore the present drainage system should be further improved to achieve salt balance in hid especially in middle and west of hid 3 4 model applications at different scales the developed model is further applied in sub irrigation districts and in the whole hid to validate its applicability at different scales fig 11 a and b shows the comparison of simulated and observed drainage water in five sub irrigation districts and hid results indicate that the overall rmse is 381 6 104 and 491 0 104m3 in calibration and validation periods when the model is applied at sub irrigation district level rmse is increased to 1486 7 104 and 1974 7 104m3 when applied over the entire hid the model application at sub irrigation district level resulted in lower rmse in wlbh district during calibration 131 4 104m3 and validation 245 1 104m3 periods table 7 the maximum rmse during calibration 828 5 104m3 and validation 1117 1 104m3 periods is observed in yc nrmse ranges from 8 5 17 4 and 7 2 23 5 in calibration and validation periods when drainage water of different sub irrigation districts are conerned nse and r 2 are more than 0 15 and 0 46 in calibration and validation periods for 5 sub irrigation districts the relatively higher rmse and lower nse in yj and yc during the validation period are caused by relatively significant variation of groundwater table distributions fig 4 nse and r 2 are more than 0 65 and 0 81 during both calibration and validation periods when the model is simulated at the irrigation district scale results demonstrated that the model performed efficiently on a monthly scale at both sub irrigation district and irrigation district levels with acceptable accuracy parameters and characteristic indexes of d s and d g for sub irrigation districts and the entire hid are shown in table 8 k gd changes from 716 4 2453 2 104m2 in five sub irrigation districts while its value in the whole hid is 8714 4 104m2 relatively low k gd in wlbh is mainly because of the sparse distribution of drainage ditches and poor soil hydraulic conductivity h d changes from 2 23 to 3 38 m for sub irrigation districts h d in wlbh 2 40 m and wlt 2 23 m are significantly lower than the other three sub irrigation districts and the whole hid 2 83 m due to no general drainage ditch about 6 m deep in these areas the deepest h d is observed in yc because of the relative sparse drainage system and more than 50 length of general drainage ditch flowing in yc the parameters a and i c are ranging between 0 05 0 12 and 27 83 mm for 5 sub irrigation districts the parameters a and i c are maximum in wlt and yj and minimum in yc and wlbh respectively however a and i c in the whole hid are 0 06 and 45 mm which shows the synthetical and equivalent d s production pattern furthermore parameters b and c are in the ranges of 0 16 0 82 and 0 13 0 66 for 5 sub irrigation districts and 0 05 and 0 67 for the whole hid the highest h w is observed in yc 1 26 m due to the large amount of drainage accumulated in the general drainage ditch in yc the ratios of surface return flow to groundwater drainage rsgs in wlbh 1 28 and jfz 1 14 are higher than the values in the other three regions 0 30 0 55 and the whole hid 0 46 it decreases significantly in the middle and downstream areas through the general irrigation canal in fig 2 the return flow ratios rfrs for five sub irrigation districts are in the range of 3 1 6 1 and close to the average value in hid 4 2 xu et al 2010 determined that the ratio of groundwater drainage into ditches and irrigation is about 4 2 in jfz which is close to our results of 4 7 rfr rsg 5 4 1 14 4 7 the analysis represents that irrigation water is used more effectively in yj and yc with the lower rfr 3 1 meanwhile the results demonstrate that agricultural water management needs further improvement in wlt due to their rfr value of 6 1 furthermore the yj and wlt sub irrigation districts presented better performance in groundwater drainage with gdc of about 1 68 and 1 13 the lowest gdc is observed in wlbh which may be attributed to the sparse distribution of drainage ditches 3 5 evaluation and comparison with other models the current model is developed to simulate monthly drainage and salinity in hid the largest irrigation district in arid and semi arid regions of china with an irrigated area of 0 68 million ha the model was applied at different spatial scales to test its applicability including sub drainage command units sub irrigation districts and the whole irrigation district the sub drainage command units and sub irrigation districts have different land use and crop planting patterns e g dominated land use types in the wlbh sub irrigation district are desert grassland and cropland mainly maize and sunflower while those in yc sub irrigation district are cropland mainly sunflower and maize and grassland wen et al 2019 results show that the model performed well and was applicable to different land use conditions and different spatial scales in hid previous studies applied and validated several models to simulate drainage at different irrigation districts and obtained acceptable and satisfactory results zhao et al 2006 chien and fang 2012 gowda et al 2012 rashed and el sayed 2014 mao et al 2017 negm et al 2017 ha et al 2017 wu et al 2019 some studies also focused on the drainage and salinity problems in hid using different drainage models sun 2014 used drainmod to study non point source pollution in m11 regions in fig 3 b and obtained the nse and r 2 of 0 76 and 0 82 for drainage simulation respectively for the same sub drainage command area m11 performance of our model is relatively better with nse and r 2 of 0 93 and 0 96 in the calibration period and 0 86 and 0 93 in the validation period table 5 chang et al 2019 applied saltmod at jfz sub irrigation district to explore the seasonal drainage and salinity dynamics and obtained the nrmse and r 2 of 11 and 0 90 for drainage water and 9 and 0 14 for drainage salinity in the calibration period respectively our present results of drainage water in jfz are 11 5 nrmse and 0 90 r 2 table 7 which are closed to those of chang et al 2019 however the drainage water salinity simulation results are much better than those of chang et al 2019 with nrmse and r 2 of 7 0 and 0 87 in the whole hid respectively xue and ren 2017 used a distributed model swap wofost to simulate the crop production and agro hydrological processes and the nrmse and nse were 18 95 and 0 43 for drainage in the whole hid respectively our present results for the nrmse and nse of drainage simulation are 12 1 and 0 79 in the calibration period and 14 9 and 0 65 in the validation period table 7 which are all better than those of xue and ren 2017 especially the nse from these comparisons the present model performs similarly or better than available models in drainage simulation in hid in these applications drainmod sun 2014 and saltmod chang et al 2019 were applied to only small sub areas of hid due to the requirement of large input data in the whole hid while swap wofost xue and ren 2017 focused on other agro hydrological processes and oversimplified the distributed drainage system as a virtual drainage canal in hid thus resulted in the poor nse therefore the present model performs better in large scale application in hid moreover compared with the models used in other regions the simple semi distributed model proposed in the present study requires only basic and easily available input data in monthly drainage water and salt simulations which can be more easily applicable to irrigation districts with fewer observations in addition parameters optimization and module coupling can be carried out more easily by the present model compared to others due to its fewer parameters simple calculation and flexible structure finally the present model is a conceptual model rather than a hydrodynamic model with detailed description of water flow and salt transport therefore we use an equation similar to the darcy s law to describe the groundwater drainage in each unit and an empirical equation to describe the canal return flow which sum up to the total drainage in the unit then drainage simulations in all the divided canal and drainage command units are integrated to obtain the drainage simulation in the whole irrigation district although the present drainage model is relative simpler it requires less data as input has fewer parameters and can be calibrated easily is applicable on monthly scale and has similar or higher precision for drainage simulations in the study irrigation district and sub districts compared with more complicated models 4 conclusions in the current study we proposed a semi distributed model for monthly drainage estimation and applied it in 19 sdcas in the hetao irrigation district hid the proposed model considers the irrigation amount irrigation canal and drainage systems distribution groundwater table depth and cropland distribution to simulate irrigation surface return flow and groundwater drainage the model was calibrated with observed drainage data from 2008 to 2010 and validated during 2012 2013 the drainage water salinity data available during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 is used to further validate the results of simulated drainage water validation results and comparisons with other models applied in hid indicated that the model performed well in simulating monthly drainage water and salinity in the study area different sdcas show different characteristics in terms of surface return flow and groundwater drainage patterns the ratio of return flow and groundwater drainage is high in west of hid and low in the east and north ranging between 1 22 1 92 the return flow rate ranges from 0 6 22 8 for different sdcas these results demonstrate that the irrigation water is utilized effectively in the middle of hid having relatively lower surface return flow ratios however irrigation practices in y1 need significant improvements to decrease the higher surface return flow ratios several sdcas in west and south of hid performed relatively poor when groundwater drainage capability is concerned the poor performance may be attributed to the sparse distribution of ditches high depth to groundwater table and poor soil hydraulic conductivity only 43 0 of salt introduced by irrigation is leached out through drainage while the rest 57 0 is accumulated in the soil and groundwater layers the best salt leaching period is in november due to the autumn irrigation effect the salt accumulation problem is more likely observed in the middle and west of hid due to a large amount of water diversion in these upstream regions wlt shows the best performance on slat leaching compared to other 4 sub irrigation districts furthermore the model also showed good simulation performance at sub irrigation and irrigation district scales the surface return flow was lower than groundwater drainage at hid scale with a ratio of about 0 46 the average return flow rate was 4 2 for the whole hid there is a need to improve the irrigation management practices in wlbh jfz and wlt sub irrigation districts with relatively high return flow rate in addition a significantly better groundwater drainage capability is observed in yj and wlt sub irrigation districts as compared to the other three sub irrigation districts in further studies more applications of the present model at different hydro climatic and land use conditions need to be carried out to test the model performance

10731,the complex and dense irrigation and drainage networks and diverse irrigation scheduling result in uncertainties and complexities in the simulation of drainage water and salinity at different regional scales we propose a semi distributed model to simulate monthly drainage water and salinity considering both the surface return flow and groundwater drainage to drainage ditches the model uses sub drainage command areas sdcas controlled by main irrigation canals and drainage ditches as simulation units and uses a conceptual model to estimate monthly drainage water and salinity from each sdca the proposed model is applied in the hetao irrigation district hid in north china with 19 sdcas and calibrated and validated using monitoring data during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 respectively the results reveal better model performance in estimating the drainage water and salinity at sdca sub irrigation district and irrigation district scales the average annual drainage is 47 021 104m3 in hid accounting for 10 5 of the annual irrigation water amount the surface return flow and groundwater drainage account for 32 7 and 67 3 of total drainage respectively the ratio of surface return flow to groundwater drainage is higher in the upstream area and lower in the downstream area higher surface return flow ratio 5 is observed in the western wulanbuhe middle and southern jiefangzha and northern wulate sub irrigation areas indicating the necessity to improve irrigation water management in these areas lower groundwater drainage capability is observed in western and southern hid while enhanced groundwater drainage capability is observed in northern hid average annual salt leaching through the drainage system is 126 5 104 t which is only 43 of the total salt introduced from irrigation the wulate sub irrigation district performs best on salt leaching while other sub irrigation district should improve the drainage system and irrigation water use efficiency to control the salt accumulation keywords drainage semi distributed model surface return flow groundwater drainage irrigation district 1 introduction irrigation districts are the hub of food production and agricultural water consumption in many parts of the world food and agriculture organization fao 2008 indicated that agricultural water use is about 70 of the total freshwater uses agricultural drainage is defined as the amount of water flowing over ground surface or through sub surface and finally enter into the drainage system oosterbaan 1994 needelman et al 2007 agricultural drainage is a critical process in irrigation districts the agricultural drainage is area dependent and studies have reported that it can account for 20 40 of irrigation water in some areas with poor irrigation water management oosterveld et al 1978 keys 1981 poor drainage system usually causes waterlogging and salinity problems singh 2015 2019a wichelns and qadir 2015 huang et al 2018 therefore efficient evaluation of drainage system is essential for sustainable agricultural water management crop production soil salinization prevention and salinized land reclamation blann et al 2009 khand et al 2017 singh 2019b especially in arid regions with severe water scarcity and intense evapotranspiration agricultural drainage is affected by both natural and artificial factors the natural factors include precipitation soil texture and groundwater table while the dominant artificial factors are amount of irrigation applied irrigation scheduling and crop planting structure garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 chien and fang 2012 poch massegú et al 2014 xing et al 2017 the relationship between drainage and its influencing factors is associated with the spatial scale effect cui et al 2007 wu et al 2019 some studies focused on drainage evaluation at the field and small regional scale zulu et al 1996 samani et al 2004 singh 2010 valipour 2012 jouni et al 2018 their simulation results based on field experiments are usually more credible and accurate than simulations on a large scale however the methods used in these studies generally require extensive field experiment data and have associated discrepancies that restrict their direct application in a large scale irrigation system such as at irrigation or sub irrigation districts levels wu et al 2019 complex irrigation canal system drainage system spatial heterogeneity of soil and crop add to the uncertainties and complexities for drainage estimation on regional scales wu et al 2019 drainage at the irrigation district scale is gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the requirement of increasing water use efficiency and reducing non point source contaminants which is significant in improving the economic and environmental benefits blann et al 2009 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 currently empirical or statistical conceptual and physically based numerical models are the available methods for simulating drainage at irrigation district scale xing et al 2017 table 1 shows the most extensively used drainage models in recent years empirical or statistical models such as drainage coefficient model dewandel et al 2008 jafari et al 2012 regression model lei et al 2002 and machine learning algorithms based model zhao et al 2006 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 are commonly used because of their simplicity and applicability however these models are generally suitable for annual drainage estimation due to their low accuracy and lack of physical basis xing et al 2017 conceptual drainage models are usually developed on the basis of water balance method chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 hydraulic method xue et al 2017 and isotope ratios method kattan 2008 seraphin et al 2016 these conceptual models showed good performances in daily and monthly drainage estimation but considered less on the distribution of irrigation and drainage system compared to models mentioned above researchers are more likely to use physically based numerical models for hydrologic process simulation in irrigated agricultural areas recently such as drainmod youssef et al 2018 swat soil and water assessment tool wu et al 2019 modflow mirlas 2013 wepp water erosion prediction project maalim and melesse 2013 flush nousiainen et al 2015 hydrus ebrahimian and noory 2015 swap soil water plant atmosphere xue and ren 2017 adapt agricultural drainage and pesticide transport gowda et al 2012 qual2k stream water quality model jafari talukolaee et al 2015 rzwqm2 root zone water quality model xian et al 2017 femgwst finite element model for groundwater flow and solute transport chandio et al 2013 saltmod chang et al 2019 and sahysmod singh and panda 2012a 2012b major characteristics and limitations of each model are listed in table 1 for example drainmod is a process based distributed model for daily drainage simulation that have validated and used extensively across the world skaggs 1981 singh 2019c hydrus focuses on water flow and solute transport in soil and groundwater simunek et al 1999 modflow deals with groundwater flow in three dimensions harbaugh et al 2000 swat is widely used for water flow and nonpoint source pollution simulation arnold et al 1998 and swap aims at crop production water flow and solute transport van dam et al 1997 table 1 generally these physically based numerical models have physical basis and predictive potentials and can consider the major hydrological processes they are used most widely in simulating large scale and short time step agro hydrologic processes in a distributed manner however most of these models require enormous input data and associated parameters that are not easily available such as soil water retention curve hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity in the regional scale they also usually run in short time steps and need at least a daily database except for saltmod and sahysmod although saltmod and sahysmod are applicable to simulate on seasonal scale they require parameters about soil properties and water balance components and considers less on the distribution of canal and ditch systems furthermore several other factors limit their use such as availability of data and support software and or reliability and capability for long term simulation and prediction singh and panda 2012a 2012b it is concluded that the existing models have discrepancies when applied for different purposes singh 2019c hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in arid region of northwest china suffered from waterlogging and salinity problems for years due to a large amount of water diversion from the yellow river and poor drainage system scholars applied different drainage models to explore the dynamic processes of drainage and salinity in hid sun 2014 xue and ren 2017 chang et al 2019 however these models are usually applied to only small sub areas of hid due to the requirement of large input data in the whole hid such as drainmod and saltmod sun 2014 chang et al 2019 although xue and ren 2017 simulated drainage in the whole hid by swap wofost model they focused more on other hydrological processes and oversimplified the distributed drainage system as a virtual drainage canal in hid that resulted in poor performance in drainage simulation therefore it is important to develop a drainage model with less data requirement middle time step simple and reliable in a distributed manner in large irrigation districts as hid the main objective of the current study is to develop a simple and robust semi distributed model for monthly drainage water and salinity simulation in an arid region which is calibrated and validated by observed data in 19 ditches of hid to test its applicability and reliability 2 materials and methods fig 1 shows procedures for drainage simulation and analysis including data collection data processing model calibration and validation and drainage analysis the irrigation amount irrigation and drainage systems groundwater table depth groundwater salinity and crop distribution are considered in the model precipitation is not considered in drainage water estimation due to less precipitation in the study region and its negligible contribution to drainage moreover the effects of soil texture distribution on drainage are considered in parameters for different simulation units 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid 40 1 41 4 n 106 1 109 4 e lies in a typical arid region of the inner mongolia autonomous region of northwest china fig 2 the hid is the largest irrigation district in the arid region of china and covers an area of 1 2 million ha with 47 being irrigated land it is composed of five sub irrigation districts including wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt sub irrigation districts the elevation of hid declines gently from 1091m in the southwest to 1000m in the northeast which determines the flow direction of water diversion and drainage the soil texture in hid consists of loam sandy loam and silt sand xue et al 2013 xue and ren 2017 yu and shang 2017 the study area has a continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 160 mm and pan evaporation 20 cm evaporation pan of approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature ranges from 7 5 9 1 c during 2012 2016 summer maize sunflower and wheat are three dominant crops in hid covering over 80 of cropland in recent years wen et al 2019 the hid has a very dense and complex irrigation canal and drainage network seven levels of irrigation canals and drainage ditches are designed to supply irrigation water to agriculture land and drain excess surface water and groundwater to drainage receiver respectively xue and ren 2017 according to the statistics from general administration of hetao irrigation district gahid the irrigation system contains about 85 900 irrigation canals with a total length of about 50 400 km and the drainage system includes 17 700 drainage ditches with the total length of about 14 000 km irrigation water of about 4 0 billion m3 per year is diverted from yellow river at the sanshenggong canal head to cropland through irrigation system with a hydraulic gradient of 1 4000 to 1 10000 this well developed irrigation system accounted for about 97 of agricultural water use in hid before 2000 ruan et al 2008 xu et al 2010 xue and ren 2017 ditches collect the drainage water from surface return flow and groundwater drainage and transport most of the drainage water through a general drainage ditch into wuliangsuhai lake the drainage water flowing into the wuliangsuhai lake accounts for 5 15 of irrigation water during 2005 2015 excessive irrigation and unmatched drainage system lead to shallow groundwater table depth ranging between 0 5 3 0 m ren et al 2018a and soil salinization problem is increasing rapidly under high evapotranspiration potential in hid guo et al 2018 huang et al 2018 consequently estimating drainage distribution in hid is essential for sustainable agricultural water management and soil salinization prevention 2 2 semi distributed monthly drainage model 2 2 1 canal and drainage command units the canal command areas ccas are defined as the basic units of irrigation application ccas of main canals can be divided based on the irrigation canal system the distribution of main secondary and tertiary canals in the study area is provided by gahid in this study ccas are divided based on the following principles a lower level canals of the corresponding main canal should be included in corresponding command areas b the boundaries of command areas are composed of irrigation canals and drainage ditches of the tertiary or higher levels and boundaries of sub irrigation districts around the main canal c when the boundaries mentioned above are not closed digital elevation model dem land use map and administrative boundaries are considered dem and land use map are used to identify the surface return flow and cropland boundaries respectively the hid is divided into 18 ccas c1 to c18 based on 21 main and secondary canals fig 3 a following the above mentioned principles due to the mixed boundary situation three main and secondary canals are merged in the vicinity of command areas of other canals similarly the sub drainage command areas sdcas are basic units of drainage concentration and are divided based on the distribution of drainage ditch system the distribution of general main secondary and tertiary ditches is obtained from gahid general drainage ditch lies from west to east in the north of hid fig 2 which receives drainage water from most of the main drainage ditches and flows into the wuliangsuhai lake fig 3 b shows 12 main drainage ditches in south north direction that drains into the general drainage ditch and 4 secondary drainage ditches in the south that drain directly into the yellow river principles to divide sdcas are described in details as follows a low level ditches secondary and tertiary ditches of the corresponding main ditch should be divided into same sdca b groundwater flow direction raster layer fig 3 b is used to acquire the boundary of sdca groundwater flow direction layer is obtained by utilizing groundwater level observations using the arcgis 10 2 pixels with groundwater flowing into the same ditch are classified into one sdca c it is ensured that the main canals and sub irrigation boundaries follow the conditions mentioned in step b d intersection of the extended secondary and tertiary ditches of different main ditches should be considered as a boundary if the boundaries mentioned above are not closed the sdcas are classified into three types with different drainage ditches a main drainage command areas consists of twelve sdcas m1 to m12 associated with twelve main drainage ditches that drain into the general drainage ditch b drainage command areas flowing into the yellow river constitutes four sdcas y1 to y4 that are in the south of general main canal and drain into the yellow river c general drainage ditch command areas consists of three sdcas g1 to g3 that are distributed around the general drainage ditch in northern hid they are obtained by excluding m1 to m12 and y1 to y4 from jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts respectively table 2 shows the matchup of sdcas ccas and 5 sub irrigation districts 2 2 2 drainage calculation of each sdcas the proposed monthly drainage model is simulated using the 19 sdcas as the simulation units irrigation depth groundwater table depth groundwater salinity and cropland distribution required in the corresponding simulation units are acquired by overlaying the above mentioned data layers groundwater table depth and salinity are calculated by taking the average of pixels in the sdcas for each sdca the drainage is composed of surface return flow and groundwater drainage to ditches i e 1 d t i max d g i d s i 0 where d g i d s i and d t i are groundwater drainage surface return flow and total drainage in the ith sdca 104m3 respectively the amount of surface return flow is mainly related to irrigation and excess irrigation will cause irrigation return flow to ditches for a well managed ideal irrigation scheme appropriate amount of irrigation water diversion should not result in much canal return flow however if the amount of diverted water is more than the amount required excess water diversion can flow directly to the drainage ditches through return flow canals therefore there should exist a threshold irrigation value above which canal return flow may occur the surface return flow is estimated from a proportion of irrigation exceeding the threshold for each sdca as 2 d s i max a i j 1 n i i j i c i a i j 10 3 0 where iij and aij are irrigation depth of the jth cca mm and its corresponding cropland areas hm2 in the ith sdca i c i is the threshold above which surface return flow occurs mm and ai is the ratio of surface return flow to excess irrigation ai and i c i in eq 2 are the parameters to be calibrated for each sdca according to darcy s law for groundwater flow groundwater drainage is related to the difference in water levels between groundwater and ditches therefore the groundwater drainage can be estimated as 3 d g i k gd i h d i h w i h g i where h d i is the equivalent depth of ditches from average land surface to the average ditch bed in the ith sdca m h w i is the equivalent water depth of ditches h g i is average groundwater table depth from average land surface k gd i is the parameter of drainage efficiency 104 m2 in the ith sdca and higher value of k gd indicates better discharge capacity between groundwater and ditches the parameters k gd i and h d i need to be calibrated for each sdca in the model the equivalent water depth of a ditch h w varies with drainage rate in ditches the relationship between h w and drainage can be simplified with a power function 4 based on the chézy formula braca 2008 4 h w i bi d t i ci where bi and ci are the parameters of stage discharge curve for equivalent drainage ditch of the ith sdca considering that h w i is determined by d t i the model runs iteratively with an initial value of d t i equal to d s i and stops until the absolute change of d t i in two successive iterations is less than 0 1 104m3 further the monthly drainage water salinity is calculated as 5 m t i d g i m g i d s i m s i d t i where m g i m s i and m t i are the salinities of groundwater irrigation water and drainage water g l 1 in the i th sdca respectively 2 3 data 2 3 1 irrigation water and salinity the general canal diverts water from the yellow river through sanshenggong canal head and conveys water to 21 main and secondary canals monthly water diversion data of these main and secondary canals from 2008 to 2013 is acquired from gahid the irrigation period usually starts from april and end in november in hid the average irrigation depth in each cca is determined from the amount of water diverted to the cca the monthly average irrigation depth is calculated from 6 ii 1000wi ai where ii is the average irrigation depth of the ith cca mm month wi is monthly water diversion of main canals corresponding to the ith cca 104m3 month and ai is cropland area in the ith cca hm2 table 3 shows the 6 year average values of monthly irrigation depth from april to november in 18 ccas the monthly amounts of irrigation water are mainly determined by available runoff of the yellow river crop irrigation requirements and agricultural practice for three major crops that account for over 80 of the cropping area wheat grows from april to july while summer maize and sunflower grow from may to september therefore irrigation is usually concentrated from may to july because less irrigation is required in the late growing stage of crops furthermore autumn irrigation in october to early november after harvesting is a special irrigation practice in hid to leach salt out of the root zone and store water in the soil layer so as to provide appropriate soil water and salinity conditions for crop sowing in the next year total amount of autumn irrigation water is about 1 3 of the annual irrigation water diversion in the study region therefore irrigation in october is generally the maximum in a year due to the decrease of river runoff and freezing of the river water since middle november irrigation in november is usually the minimum in irrigation months furthermore the annual average irrigation water salinity is obtained from bayannur water resources bulletin which changes slightly in different years and ranges between 0 58 0 74 g l from 2005 to 2015 zhang and pan 2006 also indicated that the salinity of surface water in hid is about 0 31 1 01 g l therefore the monthly irrigation salinity is set as a fixed value of the annual average water salinity due to its low variance 2 3 2 drainage water and salinity drainage water monitoring usually starts in april or may due to a very small drainage amount in the freezing and frozen periods from mid november to mid april the observed monthly drainage is available for m1 to m12 and y1 to y4 during 2008 2013 and the 6 year average monthly drainage amount from april to november for 19 sdcas is shown in table 4 drainage data in april is unavailable for m3 to m9 and y1 to y2 in table 4 due to the extended freezing period and late application of irrigation drainage process is closely related with and slightly lags behind the irrigation process the drainage is relatively low in april august and september due to the relative low irrigation amount intense evapotranspiration and deep groundwater table meanwhile drainage usually reaches its peak in october and november as a result of a large amount of autumn irrigation higher drainage salinity in november shows the effect of autumn irrigation on salt leaching besides drainage is monitored for jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts in the general drainage command area therefore the monthly drainage of g1 to g3 is calculated as below 7 d g i d o b s i j 1 n d i j where d g i is the monthly drainage of g i i 1 2 3 104 m3 d obs i is the observed monthly drainage of the i th sub irrigation district 104 m3 dij is the monthly drainage of the j th main drainage ditch in the i th sub irrigation district 104 m3 and n is the number of main drainage ditches in i th sub irrigation district table 4 also shows that the drainage water salinity varies significantly i e ranging between 0 53 19 66 g l in main drainage command areas m1 to m12 however the salinity data is unavailable for sdcas y1 to y4 and g1 to g3 2 3 3 groundwater table depth and salinity fig 4 a and b shows the distributions of groundwater observation wells where groundwater table depth and salinity are measured depth to groundwater table is measured every 5 days in 224 wells during 2008 2013 whereas the data is missing for the year 2011 groundwater salinity is measured in the mid of january march may july september october and november in 115 wells from 2008 to 2013 the ordinary kriging method cressie 1988 an effective method for interpolating the groundwater level and salinity ibrakhimov et al 2007 is used to interpolate the groundwater table depth and salinity with 250m spatial resolution 2 3 4 land use map the land use map of hid fig 4 c is obtained from the department of earth system science tsinghua university china http data ess tsinghua edu cn the cropland extent is derived through multi source remote sensing data from a land use map of the year 2010 having 30 m spatial resolution yu et al 2013 2 4 calibration and validation of the monthly drainage model drainage in the frost period from mid november to mid april is less and not monitored therefore the drainage from december to march is not considered for the model the model is calibrated and validated using observation data in the non frozen period from april to november during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 respectively the calibration parameters in 19 sdcas are adjusted by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated and observed monthly drainage which is 8 min rmse 1 n i 1 n d obs i d sim i 2 where d obs i and d sim i are observed and simulated values of drainage for the i th observation 104 m3 and n is the number of monthly drainage observations rmse is optimized using the genetic algorithm holland 1973 the genetic algorithm is an effective random searching method which has the capability to overcome deficiencies of local convergence for most traditional optimization algorithms and search the optimal solution globally wen et al 2017 to further examine the applicability of drainage model and calibrated parameters normalized rmse nrmse shcherbakov et al 2013 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 are used as indicators to assess the model performance the nrmse nse and r 2 are defined as 9 nrmse rmse max d o b s min d o b s 10 nse 1 i 1 n d obs i d sim i 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs 2 11 r 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs d sim i d sim 2 i 1 n d obs i d obs 2 i 1 n d sim i d sim 2 where d obs and d sim are average values of observed and simulated drainage generally nse and r 2 close to 1 indicate better performance between simulation results and observations moreover nrmse facilitates the comparisons between results of sdcas with different scales nrmse nse and r 2 are also used to evaluate the performance of salinity simulation results 2 5 evaluation of drainage characteristics the following three indexes are used to evaluate the characteristics of drainage in 19 sdcas 12 rsg i d s i d g i 13 rfr i d s i wi 14 gdc i d g i a t i d ta where rsg i is the ratio of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the ith sdca rfr i denotes return flow ratio defined as the ratio between surface return flow and water diversion amount wi in the i th sdca gdc i is groundwater drainage capability defined as the ratio between groundwater drainage modulus in the i th sdca with that of the whole hid a t i is area of the ith sdca and d and ta are the total groundwater drainage and drainage areas of hid 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 drainage water fig 5 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed monthly drainage water in 19 sdcas rmse nrmse nse and r 2 in calibration period are 174 2 104m3 7 7 0 84 and 0 92 respectively and change slightly to 226 4 104m3 9 1 0 76 and 0 88 in validation period respectively the model precision indexes for each sdca are given in table 5 results indicate that rmses for different sdcas range from 6 5 to 381 1 104m3 and 9 0 660 1 104m3 during the calibration and validation periods for different sdcas respectively the maximum and minimum rmse is observed in g3 and y2 respectively however maximum nrmse 23 1 35 9 is observed in y2 and y3 while the minimum is observed in y1 3 7 4 9 when monthly drainage of each sdca is taken into consideration the nse and r 2 for 12 main sdcas are more than 0 57 and 0 77 in the calibration period and greater than 0 33 and 0 60 in the validation period respectively the nse and r 2 indicate good performance in these regions these indexes are similar to the previous studies in which different models are used to simulate the drainage gosain et al 2005 kim et al 2009 kannan et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the sdcas draining into the yellow river y1 to y4 have the nse and r 2 higher than 0 17 and 0 56 in the calibration period but lower values are observed during the validation period because of insufficient observed drainage data only 3 6 observations per year the nse and r 2 values for the general ditch sdcas g1 to g3 are more than 0 13 and 0 37 during both calibration and validation periods the relatively lower nse and r 2 of general ditch scdas compared to m1 to m12 are due to the large variance of observed drainage the observed drainage for g1 to g3 is obtained indirectly through eq 7 in which the observation errors are accumulated overall the calculated indexes are generally within acceptable ranges which indicates better model performance in drainage simulation the calibrated parameters for 19 sdcas are given in table 6 k gd ranges between 49 9 2154 5 104m2 for different sdcas k gd is affected by soil hydraulic conductivity drainage ditch density and size of sdcas for instance although m1 and m2 have a similar area and both are located between wlbh and jfz sub irrigation districts the ditches are sparse in m1 due to less cropland therefore the k gd of m1 297 3 104m2 is significantly lower than m2 526 4 104m2 h d is related to the average depth of ditches in the sdca and shows contrasting characteristics in different sdcas it can be seen that h d is generally about 2 4 m and agrees with the field survey conducted by ue et al 2017 which revealed that the average depth of main and secondary ditches ranged between 2 4 m in hid however h d in the general ditch sdcas is relatively higher more specifically h d for g3 is 4 01 m due to the significantly deep ditches of general drainage about 6 m parameters a and i c are mainly affected by the cropland distribution and irrigation practices the calibrated values of a and i c are in the range of 0 01 0 30 and 3 166 mm for different sdcas respectively in sdcas y1 to y4 located between the yellow river and general main canal smaller i c 3 26 mm can be observed due to the higher soil moisture as a result of recharge from the yellow river and general main canal the sdcas with better irrigation conditions such as m1 m4 also have smaller i c while those with poor irrigation conditions such as g1 g3 have greater i c the differences of i c in different sdcas agree with the field survey results the parameters b and c for ditch water level h w are in the ranges of 0 17 1 00 and 0 13 0 76 respectively these two parameters represent the characteristics of hydraulic elements of ditches in different sdcas such as roughness hydraulic radius and hydraulic gradient shi 1988 collected the hydraulic parameters in hid and found that b and c are in the range of 0 08 0 95 and 0 22 0 81 for general main and secondary drainage ditches respectively the values of b and c in the current study are generally in acceptable ranges 3 1 2 drainage water salinity drainage water salinity for 12 main sdcas is calculated using eq 7 from the simulated monthly drainage water the salinity in g1 to g3 and y1 to y4 is not simulated due to unavailability of observed data fig 6 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed drainage water salinity from 2008 to 2013 the overall rmse nrmse nse and r 2 are 1 37 g l 1 7 0 0 74 and 0 87 respectively the model performance in salinity simulation is similar to or better than previous studies cavero et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xue 2018 the highest error during 2008 2013 is observed in m12 with the nrmse of 21 1 where the average salinity of groundwater and drainage water are 11 74 and 9 77 g l 1 respectively reasons for the relatively higher error in m12 are higher variation in groundwater salinity distribution and uncertainties in observed data in general salinity simulation results are in the acceptable range which depicts the reliability of simulated monthly drainage water and salinity 3 2 analysis of surface return flow and groundwater drainage 3 2 1 processes of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the whole hid the surface return flow d s and groundwater drainage d g processes are derived from monthly drainage simulation model fig 7 shows the processes of monthly surface return flow groundwater drainage irrigation amount and average groundwater table depth in hid from 2008 to 2013 excluding the year 2011 due to data unavailability results indicate that the monthly d s and d g change from 258 5 to 5861 1 104m3 and 343 2 11 907 3 104m3 in five years respectively the average annual drainage is 47 020 6 104m3 from april to november in hid accounting for 10 5 of annual irrigation amount yu et al 2016 found the ratio of drainage to irrigation was 11 4 in hid from 2006 to 2012 which agrees with our results d s and d g account for 32 7 and 67 3 of total drainage respectively the processes of d s and d g are consistent with the irrigation amount and average groundwater table depth peak values of d s are usually observed in may and october every year which is synchronistic with the spring irrigation in may and autumn irrigation in october with great irrigation amount however d g and groundwater table depth show delayed response to irrigation and peak values are observed in may june and november most of the return flow ratios rfrs range from 0 01 to 0 10 rfrs show strong dependency on the irrigation amount i e the maximum and minimum rfrs are observed in the months with high and low irrigation amount respectively 3 2 2 distribution of surface return flow and groundwater drainage in command areas fig 8 a represents the distribution of the ratio of surface return flow to groundwater drainage rsg in 19 sdcas the rsg ranges from 1 22 to 1 92 across different areas the maximum and minimum rsg are observed in m3 and y2 respectively the deeper groundwater table in y2 fig 4 a causes groundwater recharge from drainage ditches and consequently results in negative rsg it is observed that rsg is higher than 1 in the west of hid which means that d s dominate d g in those areas the relative low d s may be attributed to insufficient irrigation supply in east and north of hid in the mid and downstream of hid ren et al 2018b analyzed the water consumption in a typical region of m3 and obtained the rsg of 1 95 which is consistent with our results the distribution of rfr shows no significant spatial trend fig 8 b because rfr is mainly determined by the local irrigation systems and practices rfr ranges between 0 6 m5 to 22 8 y1 in different sdcas ren et al 2018b determined that the rfr in m3 is about 7 8 which is comparable to our results 7 3 higher rfr 5 is observed in the western wulanbuhe middle and southern jiefangzha and northern wulate sub irrigation areas indicating the necessity to improve irrigation water management in these areas the distribution of groundwater drainage capability gdc is shown in fig 8 c the results demonstrate that gdc ranges from 0 29 to 3 08 the higher gdc shows better groundwater drainage capability compared with other areas in hid the maximum and minimum gdc are acquired in g2 and y2 respectively y2 has a negative rsg and gdc due to the deep groundwater table depth furthermore sdcas in north and east of hid show good groundwater drainage capability where gdc values are more than 1 other sdcas perform poorly in terms of groundwater drainage due to sparse ditches deep groundwater table depth and or poor soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 analysis of salt balance 3 3 1 process of salt introduction leaching and accumulation in the whole hid considering that the groundwater inflow and outflow in hid are usually negligible due to the small hydraulic gradient of about 0 02 xu et al 2010 we define the salt accumulation approximately equal to the difference of salt introduced by irrigation and salt leaching through drainage the dynamic processes of salt balance in hid including salt introduced by irrigation salt leaching through drainage and salt accumulation are shown in fig 9 results show that the monthly salt introduction leaching and accumulation ranges between 6 5 to 105 5 104 t 0 5 51 3 104 t and 44 8 91 7 104 t during 2008 to 2013 excluding the year 2011 due to data unavailability respectively peak values of salt introduction and accumulation are observed in may july and october while the salt leaching reaches its peaks in june and november negative salt accumulation or desalinization is mainly observed in november 2 4 44 8 104 t which shows the salt leaching effect of autumn irrigation in october to early november the average annual salt introduction leaching and accumulation are 294 3 104 t 126 5 104 t and 167 8 104 from april to november in hid therefore only 43 0 of annual salt introduced by irrigation is leached by drainage while 57 0 of salt is accumulated in the soil and groundwater layers in hid yu et al 2016 studied the salt transport between agricultural and non agricultural land in hid and found that the average annual accumulated salt was 164 4 104 t wu et al 2009 focused on the soil salinity problem in hid from 1973 to 2006 and found about 70 of the introduced salt was accumulated in the irrigation district each year compared to result of wu et al 2009 the smaller salt accumulation percentage 57 0 in current study from 2008 to 2013 shows the improvement of drainage system and water saving effect of the hetao rehabilitation program since 1998 most of the salt flowing into agricultural land will transport and accumulate in the soil profile of non agricultural land resulting from the groundwater flow and intense evaporation wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 which will trigger soil salinization in part areas of the irrigation districts especially non irrigated land to conclude it is urgent and significant to control salinity problems by improving the drainage system and irrigation water use efficiency 3 3 2 salt accumulation fig 10 shows the average annual salt accumulation in 19 sdcas results indicate that the accumulated salt ranges from 111 1 312 0 t km 2 y1 m10 and m11 occupying 6 8 of hid are the only three regions without salt accumulation while the rest 93 2 tend to accumulate salt from 2008 to 2013 the most serious problem of salt accumulation is observed in m6 and m9 with over 300 t km 2 of salt accumulated every year ren et al 2018b found that the accumulated salt in m3 accounted for 76 2 about 295 13 t km 2 of the total salt introduced to m3 without considering the groundwater pumping which is consistent with the results in ig 10 a 282 7 t km 2 it is noted that the salt accumulation problem is more likely observed in the middle and west of hid due to a large amount of water diversion in these upstream regions the wulate sub irrigation district in the downstream performs well on salt leaching and salt balance control with the accumulated salt under 14 1 t km 2 each year therefore the present drainage system should be further improved to achieve salt balance in hid especially in middle and west of hid 3 4 model applications at different scales the developed model is further applied in sub irrigation districts and in the whole hid to validate its applicability at different scales fig 11 a and b shows the comparison of simulated and observed drainage water in five sub irrigation districts and hid results indicate that the overall rmse is 381 6 104 and 491 0 104m3 in calibration and validation periods when the model is applied at sub irrigation district level rmse is increased to 1486 7 104 and 1974 7 104m3 when applied over the entire hid the model application at sub irrigation district level resulted in lower rmse in wlbh district during calibration 131 4 104m3 and validation 245 1 104m3 periods table 7 the maximum rmse during calibration 828 5 104m3 and validation 1117 1 104m3 periods is observed in yc nrmse ranges from 8 5 17 4 and 7 2 23 5 in calibration and validation periods when drainage water of different sub irrigation districts are conerned nse and r 2 are more than 0 15 and 0 46 in calibration and validation periods for 5 sub irrigation districts the relatively higher rmse and lower nse in yj and yc during the validation period are caused by relatively significant variation of groundwater table distributions fig 4 nse and r 2 are more than 0 65 and 0 81 during both calibration and validation periods when the model is simulated at the irrigation district scale results demonstrated that the model performed efficiently on a monthly scale at both sub irrigation district and irrigation district levels with acceptable accuracy parameters and characteristic indexes of d s and d g for sub irrigation districts and the entire hid are shown in table 8 k gd changes from 716 4 2453 2 104m2 in five sub irrigation districts while its value in the whole hid is 8714 4 104m2 relatively low k gd in wlbh is mainly because of the sparse distribution of drainage ditches and poor soil hydraulic conductivity h d changes from 2 23 to 3 38 m for sub irrigation districts h d in wlbh 2 40 m and wlt 2 23 m are significantly lower than the other three sub irrigation districts and the whole hid 2 83 m due to no general drainage ditch about 6 m deep in these areas the deepest h d is observed in yc because of the relative sparse drainage system and more than 50 length of general drainage ditch flowing in yc the parameters a and i c are ranging between 0 05 0 12 and 27 83 mm for 5 sub irrigation districts the parameters a and i c are maximum in wlt and yj and minimum in yc and wlbh respectively however a and i c in the whole hid are 0 06 and 45 mm which shows the synthetical and equivalent d s production pattern furthermore parameters b and c are in the ranges of 0 16 0 82 and 0 13 0 66 for 5 sub irrigation districts and 0 05 and 0 67 for the whole hid the highest h w is observed in yc 1 26 m due to the large amount of drainage accumulated in the general drainage ditch in yc the ratios of surface return flow to groundwater drainage rsgs in wlbh 1 28 and jfz 1 14 are higher than the values in the other three regions 0 30 0 55 and the whole hid 0 46 it decreases significantly in the middle and downstream areas through the general irrigation canal in fig 2 the return flow ratios rfrs for five sub irrigation districts are in the range of 3 1 6 1 and close to the average value in hid 4 2 xu et al 2010 determined that the ratio of groundwater drainage into ditches and irrigation is about 4 2 in jfz which is close to our results of 4 7 rfr rsg 5 4 1 14 4 7 the analysis represents that irrigation water is used more effectively in yj and yc with the lower rfr 3 1 meanwhile the results demonstrate that agricultural water management needs further improvement in wlt due to their rfr value of 6 1 furthermore the yj and wlt sub irrigation districts presented better performance in groundwater drainage with gdc of about 1 68 and 1 13 the lowest gdc is observed in wlbh which may be attributed to the sparse distribution of drainage ditches 3 5 evaluation and comparison with other models the current model is developed to simulate monthly drainage and salinity in hid the largest irrigation district in arid and semi arid regions of china with an irrigated area of 0 68 million ha the model was applied at different spatial scales to test its applicability including sub drainage command units sub irrigation districts and the whole irrigation district the sub drainage command units and sub irrigation districts have different land use and crop planting patterns e g dominated land use types in the wlbh sub irrigation district are desert grassland and cropland mainly maize and sunflower while those in yc sub irrigation district are cropland mainly sunflower and maize and grassland wen et al 2019 results show that the model performed well and was applicable to different land use conditions and different spatial scales in hid previous studies applied and validated several models to simulate drainage at different irrigation districts and obtained acceptable and satisfactory results zhao et al 2006 chien and fang 2012 gowda et al 2012 rashed and el sayed 2014 mao et al 2017 negm et al 2017 ha et al 2017 wu et al 2019 some studies also focused on the drainage and salinity problems in hid using different drainage models sun 2014 used drainmod to study non point source pollution in m11 regions in fig 3 b and obtained the nse and r 2 of 0 76 and 0 82 for drainage simulation respectively for the same sub drainage command area m11 performance of our model is relatively better with nse and r 2 of 0 93 and 0 96 in the calibration period and 0 86 and 0 93 in the validation period table 5 chang et al 2019 applied saltmod at jfz sub irrigation district to explore the seasonal drainage and salinity dynamics and obtained the nrmse and r 2 of 11 and 0 90 for drainage water and 9 and 0 14 for drainage salinity in the calibration period respectively our present results of drainage water in jfz are 11 5 nrmse and 0 90 r 2 table 7 which are closed to those of chang et al 2019 however the drainage water salinity simulation results are much better than those of chang et al 2019 with nrmse and r 2 of 7 0 and 0 87 in the whole hid respectively xue and ren 2017 used a distributed model swap wofost to simulate the crop production and agro hydrological processes and the nrmse and nse were 18 95 and 0 43 for drainage in the whole hid respectively our present results for the nrmse and nse of drainage simulation are 12 1 and 0 79 in the calibration period and 14 9 and 0 65 in the validation period table 7 which are all better than those of xue and ren 2017 especially the nse from these comparisons the present model performs similarly or better than available models in drainage simulation in hid in these applications drainmod sun 2014 and saltmod chang et al 2019 were applied to only small sub areas of hid due to the requirement of large input data in the whole hid while swap wofost xue and ren 2017 focused on other agro hydrological processes and oversimplified the distributed drainage system as a virtual drainage canal in hid thus resulted in the poor nse therefore the present model performs better in large scale application in hid moreover compared with the models used in other regions the simple semi distributed model proposed in the present study requires only basic and easily available input data in monthly drainage water and salt simulations which can be more easily applicable to irrigation districts with fewer observations in addition parameters optimization and module coupling can be carried out more easily by the present model compared to others due to its fewer parameters simple calculation and flexible structure finally the present model is a conceptual model rather than a hydrodynamic model with detailed description of water flow and salt transport therefore we use an equation similar to the darcy s law to describe the groundwater drainage in each unit and an empirical equation to describe the canal return flow which sum up to the total drainage in the unit then drainage simulations in all the divided canal and drainage command units are integrated to obtain the drainage simulation in the whole irrigation district although the present drainage model is relative simpler it requires less data as input has fewer parameters and can be calibrated easily is applicable on monthly scale and has similar or higher precision for drainage simulations in the study irrigation district and sub districts compared with more complicated models 4 conclusions in the current study we proposed a semi distributed model for monthly drainage estimation and applied it in 19 sdcas in the hetao irrigation district hid the proposed model considers the irrigation amount irrigation canal and drainage systems distribution groundwater table depth and cropland distribution to simulate irrigation surface return flow and groundwater drainage the model was calibrated with observed drainage data from 2008 to 2010 and validated during 2012 2013 the drainage water salinity data available during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 is used to further validate the results of simulated drainage water validation results and comparisons with other models applied in hid indicated that the model performed well in simulating monthly drainage water and salinity in the study area different sdcas show different characteristics in terms of surface return flow and groundwater drainage patterns the ratio of return flow and groundwater drainage is high in west of hid and low in the east and north ranging between 1 22 1 92 the return flow rate ranges from 0 6 22 8 for different sdcas these results demonstrate that the irrigation water is utilized effectively in the middle of hid having relatively lower surface return flow ratios however irrigation practices in y1 need significant improvements to decrease the higher surface return flow ratios several sdcas in west and south of hid performed relatively poor when groundwater drainage capability is concerned the poor performance may be attributed to the sparse distribution of ditches high depth to groundwater table and poor soil hydraulic conductivity only 43 0 of salt introduced by irrigation is leached out through drainage while the rest 57 0 is accumulated in the soil and groundwater layers the best salt leaching period is in november due to the autumn irrigation effect the salt accumulation problem is more likely observed in the middle and west of hid due to a large amount of water diversion in these upstream regions wlt shows the best performance on slat leaching compared to other 4 sub irrigation districts furthermore the model also showed good simulation performance at sub irrigation and irrigation district scales the surface return flow was lower than groundwater drainage at hid scale with a ratio of about 0 46 the average return flow rate was 4 2 for the whole hid there is a need to improve the irrigation management practices in wlbh jfz and wlt sub irrigation districts with relatively high return flow rate in addition a significantly better groundwater drainage capability is observed in yj and wlt sub irrigation districts as compared to the other three sub irrigation districts in further studies more applications of the present model at different hydro climatic and land use conditions need to be carried out to test the model performance

zhang et al 2011 found that st with surface residue cover was superior in increasing water productivity and grain yield of rice compared with ct however previous studies of these tillage system effects neglected the differences in soil water and nutrient dynamics that occur after tillage intensity and surface residue cover were changed due to limitations in conducting detailed field experiments to observe these dynamics determining which conservation tillage treatment is best when changing from ct is an urgent problem in henan province the rzwqm2 cropping systems model can simulate water and nitrogen processes in agricultural systems kumar et al 1999 first evaluated the tillage effects on the movement of water and nitrate nitrogen using the rzwqm model hu et al 2006 calibrated and tested rzwqm2 to assess n management in a double cropping system comprised of winter wheat and corn at luancheng in the north china plain their results showed that rzwqm2 has potential for assessing n and water management practices and crop rotation in other regions and climates of the world rzwqm2 was also used by ma et al 2007a to evaluate year to year corn and soybean yield water and n balance in a tile drained field under different cultivation management using 26 years of data from nashua iowa usa their results indicated that rzwqm2 correctly simulated year to year variations in tile flow and n loading in tile flow but the crop yield simulation needed improvement improvements have now been made to the crop models available in rzwqm2 the current version of the rzwqm2 is a promising tool for studying effects on water and nitrogen management under different tillage treatments however using rzwqm2 to simulate the impacts of tillage system changes in water and nitrogen

treatment had the same tillage method of ct but wheat stubbles 5 cm were retained on the soil surface along with corn zea mays l residues 4500 kg ha 1 obtained from the previous autumn wheat stubbles 5 cm were also retained in the nt treatment but there was no other tillage measures in addition to using pesticide after returning green stage of winter wheat st treatment involved chisel plowing with a shovel and the tillage depth was 25 cm the winter wheat cultivar was aikang 58 before winter wheat sowing fertilizers of urea potassium sulfate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate were applied at the rate of 225 kg n ha 1 75 kg k ha 1 and 105 kg p ha 1 wheat was sown at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 with row spacing of 23 cm in order to ensure good germination and adequate plant stands 60 mm irrigation

the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons experimental data including soil water content winter wheat biomass and grain yield were collected from 2011 to 2016 soil volumetric water contents at the depths of 0

pesticide movement soil chemical processes plant growth and management practices jaynes and miller 1999 tillage is one of the most important management practices that is simulated in rzwqm2 tillage is assumed to destroy all the macropores in the tillage zone both primary tillage with a moldboard plow and secondary tillage using cultivators planters and other implements are provided ahuja et al 2000 rzwqm2 can simulate soil porosity saturated soil water content soil water content suction relationships and hydraulic conductivity through tillage induced bulk density changes ahuja et al 2000 the presence of a surface residue layer the simulated potential soil evaporation process which is modeled with the extended shuttleworth wallace et model ahuja et al 2000 2 4 model calibration and validation inputs used by rzwqm2 include meteorological data soil hydraulic properties initial volumetric soil water contents temperature nitrate and ammonium concentrations and crop data field management activities including fertilization irrigation and tillage can be specified by the user weather data including solar radiation and daily rainfall were collected from an on site weather station the initial soil hydraulic properties data used in the rzwqm2 simulations including bulk density saturated water content permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity were collected from a field near the experimental field with conventional tillage on october 2014 and measured using the methodology of jury and horton 2004 besides the initial soil water content and no3 n content were measured before planting in the experimental field in 2014 table 1 the initial soil organic and soil microbial pools in the simulation were set according to the default values provided with rzwqm2 rzwqm2 was calibrated using the data under all field experiment treatments ct cs nt and st from october 2014 to june 2015 because of the available measured data that included soil water and no3 n in the 0 100 cm soil depth and winter wheat biomass and yield we adjusted the model parameters such as the soil hydraulic parameters soil organic and soil microbial pools and winter wheat cultivar parameters using the automatic parameter optimization program pest model independent parameter estimation linked with rzwqm2 final adjustment of the parameters was conducted by trial and error ma et al 2007a the calibrated plant cultivar parameter values are shown in table 2 the calibrated parameters resulting from simulation with 2014 2015 growing season data were subsequently used for the model validation simulations for ct cs nt and st in other years 2011 2014 and 2015 2016 these validation simulations with different tillage treatments used the same plant cultivar parameters and soil hydraulic property parameters as used for model calibration 2 5 tillage simulation scenarios rzwqm was used to set up scenarios due to the limited tillage treatments of field experiments ct cs nt and st according to our study objective tillage simulation scenarios were designed namely ct was changed to nt ns nt with 6000 kg ha 1 of straw st and ss st with 6000 kg ha 1 of straw respectively using daily meteorological data from five years 2011 2016 components of the soil water balance and nitrogen balance above ground biomass and grain yield under ct were simulated by the validated rzwqm2 the simulated ct results were used as control values to compare with simulation results from the four conservation tillage systems finally we simulated the changes that occur in the water balance nitrogen balance biomass and grain yield when conventional tillage is replaced with the four conservation tillage treatments every year from 2011 to 2016 2 6 model performance criteria

model calibration and validation table 3 shows the comparison statistics between measured and simulated values of soil water contents nitrate concentrations above ground biomass and grain yield under different tillage treatments for the calibration and validation data sets the rmse values of soil water content and nitrate concentration under different treatments in the 100 cm soil profile ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 and from 5 50 to 6 41 respectively for the calibration data set the comparison results of simulated and measured values for soil water are presented only for ct and nt fig 1 the simulated soil water contents in the five 20 cm soil layers for ct and nt were close to the measured values under both ct and nt tillage treatments fig 1 the two other treatments cs and st had similar trends the rmse for soil water content for the ct cs nt and st treatments ranged from 0 021 0 033 0 026 0 037 0 024 0 036 and 0 022 0 036 cm3 cm 3 respectively simulated nitrate concentrations over time generally followed the measured values at different soil depths for the calibration data set fig 2 rmse of ct cs nt and st treatments varied from 1 55 mg kg 1 to 6 41 mg kg 1 with d 0 7 the accuracy of the nitrate concentration simulations was lower than that of the soil water simulations due to the complexity of nitrogen cycle nangia et al 2008 the simulated above ground biomass at harvest was close to observed values for ct cs nt and st as shown in table 3 with rmse values ranging from 608 to 1066 kg ha 1 for the calibration data set furthermore the simulated winter wheat grain yields under different tillage treatments were in good agreement with measured values for ct cs and nt treatments with rmse ranging from 144 to 365 kg ha 1 however the st treatment had an rmse of 1577 kg ha 1 and d of 0 78 table 3 the statistical indices comparing simulated to measured values for soil water contents and nitrate concentrations in the 100 cm soil profile above ground biomass and grain yield under different tillage treatments for the validation data set are shown in table 3 the rmse values of soil water ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 the mre values of soil water contents were in the range of 16 19 although simulated nitrogen concentrations under different tillage treatments were less satisfactory with rmse ranging from 6 6 to 10 3 mg kg 1 the values were acceptable simulated biomass under ct cs nt and st treatments was similar to measured values for the validation data set with rmse of 432 911 kg ha 1 mre of 9 14 and d of 0 87 0 93 table 3 the rmse mre and d values for winter wheat grain yield ranged from 427 to 809 kg ha 1 5 10 and 0 84 to 0 90 respectively table 3 fig 3 showed that the correlation coefficient for grain yield was 0 84 with r2 of 0 64 and p 0 05 indicating that rzwqm2 can reasonably predict winter wheat grain yield several under predicted values were shown in fig 3 due to dry weather consistent with results from timsina et al 2008 who demonstrated how rzwqm model failed to simulate the practical drought resistance of winter wheat in a dry year 3 2 analyses of model simulation results 3 2 1 water balance in soil profile after calibration and validation of rzwqm2 evapotranspiration et water drainage and runoff were simulated in the 100 cm soil profile from 2011 to 2016 table 4 the main water inputs were from precipitation which averaged 224 mm during the winter wheat growing season from 2011 to 2016 table 4 the main water consumption was through soil evaporation and plant transpiration et compared with ct the simulated average et under nt and ns slightly increased while average et under st and ss decreased by 9 8 and 10 1 respectively compared with ct more water runoff was simulated under st and ss because no surface roughness detention storage was considered in rzwqm2 and all rainfall exceeding saturated hydraulic conductivity and macropore flow was considered runoff although runoff was likely over simulated in rzwqm2 for st and ss the simulated result was acceptable because runoff only accounted for small percentage of the overall soil water budget ma et al 2007a in the present study average water runoff under st and ss only account for 3 9 of water consumption the results also indicated that there was no difference between st and ss in simulated runoff amount however further improvements to rzwqm2 may be needed for better simulation of water runoff when ct was changed to nt and ns an 8 4 and 3 9 reduction in average water drainage was simulated respectively also the simulated water loss the sum of water drainage and runoff decreased by 9 1 and 4 7 respectively 3 2 2 nitrogen balance the validated model was used to simulate the nitrogen balance from 2011 to 2016 when ct was changed to nt ns st and ss table 4 on average the simulated soil n mineralization under nt and ns increased by 15 2 and 4 3 respectively compared with ct however the simulated soil n mineralization amounts under st and ss were lower than observed with ct the reasons for these differences may be partially attributed to the differences in soil water and temperature when ct was changed to conservation tillage treatments zaman and chang 2004 the main n outputs were plant uptake gaseous n emission and n leaching in this study crop n uptake was in the range of 160 201 kg ha 1 for all treatments before and after tillage change n denitrification was very small 0 8 7 5 kg ha 1 before and after the tillage system change while the nh3 volatilization loss was in the range 12 1 28 6 kg ha 1 table 4 ammonia volatilization one pathway of n loss was influenced by tillage practices and by the crop residues alkanani and mackenzie 1992 due to different soil temperature and soil water content mcgarry et al 1987 tillage affects soil bulk density and porosity hamza and anderson 2005 soil hydraulic conductivities chang and lindwall 1992 and soil water content and temperature in our study the simulated nh3 volatilization was approximately doubled when ct was changed to nt and ns this may be due to higher urease activity under nt and that surface crop residues under a nt tillage system likely resulted in decreased contact of urea granules with the soil rochette et al 2009 alkanani and mackenzie 1992 observed that reduced nh3 loss with ct was attributed in part to reduce crop residues compared with nt rochette et al 2009 reported that mean cumulative nh3 losses were greater in nt than in other treatments due to greater soil surface urease activity and reduced adsorption of nh4 on soil particulars under nt dong et al 2013 also found that nt was able to accelerate the urea hydrolysis reaction and increase nh3 volatilization another pathways of n loss in henan province are nitrate leaching cai et al 2002 in this study simulated n leaching decreased by 55 6 44 6 28 8 and 13 0 when ct was changed to nt ns st and ss respectively ma et al 2007b reported that n leaching increased with the increasing tillage intensity furthermore n leaching was greater when ct was changed to ns and ss treatments than when ct was changed to nt and st treatments greater n leaching in treatments with residue cover was resulted from the increasing of no3 n concentration in the drainage water zhang et al 2014 and also greater water drainage in these systems table 4 n leaching was the lowest under nt in our simulations which was similar to results presented by ma et al 2007b who reported increased flow weighted n concentration the nitrate n concentration in drain flow with increasing tillage intensity randall and iragavarapu 1995 used data from an 11 year corn experiment to assess nitrate nitrogen losses under ct and nt treatment and found that no3 n losses were 5 greater with ct compared with nt 3 2 3 crop yield wp and nue when ct was changed to nt and ns the simulated above ground biomass increased while it decreased when ct was changed to st and ss table 4 average aboveground biomass under nt increased by 7 2 compared with ct the model simulated a 4 6 and 3 4 increase in grain yields under nt and ns respectively compared with ct for both above ground biomass and grain yield tillage treatments followed the order of nt ns ct st ss in general winter wheat yield increased when ct was changed to nt and ns while yield decreased when ct was changed to st and ss the reason for lower yield under st and ss may be due to the simulated greater water loss resulting in lower et and to greater n leaching table 4 subsoiling tillage can reduce soil bulk density below the plow layer and increase infiltration sang et al 2016 resulting in increased water loss and n leaching below the active root zone although crop residues on the soil surface can reduce evaporation fan et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 long term effects of surface crop residues can include increased earthworm populations resulting in increased soil macro porosity and decreased soil bulk density causing greater water loss below the active root zone the result is lower simulated grain yield under ss compared with ct when ct was changed to nt grain yield increased 4 5 due to the greater soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil profile fig 4 and lower drainage under nt table 4 similar results were reported by noellemeyer et al 2013 in argentina in colorado usa nielsen et al 2002 reported a nine years average dryland wheat grain yield that was 37 greater when grown under nt than when grown under ct due to increased soil water at planting with nt which was a result of 15 greater precipitation storage efficiency for nt than for ct during the non crop period prior to planting wheat nielsen and vigil 2010 de vita et al 2007 also reported that nt performed better than ct under limited rainfall during the durum wheat growing season in italy because of lower water evaporation combined with enhanced soil water availability the wp decreased in the order of nt ns ct st and ss table 4 even though grain yields with st and ss were less than with ct wp was greater for st and ss than for ct because the reduction in et with st and ss compared with ct were relatively greater than the reduction in yield the highest wp was obtained with nt this result agrees with mao et al 2010 who reported that the average wheat grain yield in two years under nt and st was increased by 7 1 and 4 3 and wp was increased by 11 8 and 4 9 compared with ct respectively however zhang et al 2011 reported that rice grain yield net earnings and wp with st were all greater than observed with ct and nt the reason may be related to different soil type climate and tillage time the nue values ranged from 26 8 to 30 1 kg n kg 1 when ct was changed to nt ns st and ss the nues increased 8 7 6 5 12 1 and 3 9 respectively table 4 although the simulated yields under st and ss were lower than with ct their nues were higher than seen with the ct treatment due to lower total n loss compared with ct nue changes due to tillage changes are a result of changes to both crop yield and total nitrogen consumption nt and ns significantly increased nh3 volatilization compared with ct simulated n loss the sum of nh3 volatilization n denitrification and n leaching was greatest when ct was changed to ns compared with ct all four conservation tillage treatments improved nue possibly due to the crop residue on the soil surface huo et al 2005 mansour et al 2019a b kong et al 2017 although the highest yields in this study were obtained under nt nue under nt was lower than under st because of the greater simulated nitrogen consumption under nt in general when ct was changed to nt above ground biomass grain yields wp and nue all increased while the n leaching loss decreased 4 conclusions rzwqm2 can be used to simulate water and n balance as well as winter wheat growth and grain yield when ct was changed to conservation tillage methods in henan province when ct was changed to nt water loss and n leaching decreased while the above ground biomass grain yield wp and nue all increased therefore we recommend no tillage as the optimal tillage system to use if the traditional ct system

conventional tillage is still used by some small landholders in henan province using traditional farming experiences although conservation tillage practices have been extensively used in general in

nitrogen under different tillage treatments and choosing the optimal tillage treatment in henan province will be important for improving water productivity wp nue and crop yield a large number of studies have been conducted on the effect of the conservation tillage on soil water nutrient content and crop yield dalal 1992 zibilske et al 2002 de vita et al 2007 wang et al 2015a b zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 found that st with surface residue cover was superior in increasing water productivity and grain yield of rice compared with ct however previous studies of these tillage system effects neglected the differences in soil water and nutrient dynamics that occur after tillage intensity and surface residue cover were changed due to limitations in conducting detailed field experiments to observe these dynamics determining which conservation tillage treatment is best when changing from ct is an urgent problem in henan province the rzwqm2 cropping systems model can simulate water and nitrogen processes in agricultural systems kumar et al 1999 first evaluated the tillage effects on the movement of water and nitrate nitrogen using the rzwqm model hu et al 2006 calibrated and tested rzwqm2 to assess n management in a double cropping system comprised of winter wheat and corn at luancheng in the north china plain their results showed that rzwqm2 has potential for assessing n and water management practices and crop rotation in other regions and climates of the world rzwqm2 was also used by ma et al 2007a to evaluate year to year corn and soybean yield water and n balance in a tile drained field under different cultivation management using 26 years of data from nashua iowa usa their results indicated that rzwqm2 correctly simulated year to year variations in tile flow and n loading in tile flow but the crop yield simulation needed improvement improvements have now been made to the crop models available in rzwqm2 the current version of the rzwqm2 is a promising tool for studying effects on water and nitrogen management under different tillage treatments however using rzwqm2 to simulate the impacts of tillage system changes in water and nitrogen dynamics and finding the optimal tillage system for local farmers in term of improvements in soil water content crop yield wp and nue needs further work the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify

pesticide movement soil chemical processes plant growth and management practices jaynes and miller 1999 tillage is one of the most important management practices that is simulated in rzwqm2 tillage is assumed to destroy all the macropores in the tillage zone both primary tillage with a moldboard plow and secondary tillage using cultivators planters and other implements are provided ahuja et al 2000 rzwqm2 can simulate soil porosity saturated soil water content soil water content suction relationships and hydraulic conductivity through tillage induced bulk density changes ahuja et al 2000 the presence of a surface residue layer the simulated potential soil evaporation process which is modeled with the extended shuttleworth wallace et model ahuja et al 2000 2 4 model calibration and validation inputs used by rzwqm2 include meteorological data soil hydraulic properties initial volumetric soil water contents temperature nitrate and ammonium concentrations and crop data field management activities including fertilization irrigation and tillage can be specified by the user weather data including solar radiation and daily rainfall were collected from an on site weather station the initial soil hydraulic properties data used in the rzwqm2 simulations including bulk density saturated water content permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity were collected from a field near the experimental field with conventional tillage on october 2014 and measured using the methodology of jury and horton 2004 besides the initial soil water content and no3 n content were measured before planting in the experimental field in 2014 table 1 the initial soil organic and soil microbial pools in the simulation were set according to the default values provided with rzwqm2 rzwqm2 was calibrated using the data under all field experiment treatments ct cs nt and st from october 2014 to june 2015 because of the available measured data that included soil water and no3 n in the 0 100 cm soil depth and winter wheat biomass and yield we adjusted the model parameters such as the soil hydraulic parameters soil organic and soil microbial pools and winter wheat cultivar parameters using the automatic parameter optimization program pest model independent parameter estimation linked with rzwqm2 final adjustment of the parameters was conducted by trial and error ma et al 2007a the calibrated plant cultivar parameter values are shown in table 2 the calibrated parameters resulting from simulation with 2014 2015 growing season data were subsequently used for the model validation simulations for ct cs nt and st in other years 2011 2014 and 2015 2016 these validation simulations with different tillage treatments used the same plant cultivar parameters and soil hydraulic property parameters as used for model calibration 2 5 tillage simulation scenarios rzwqm was used to set up scenarios due to the limited tillage treatments of field experiments ct cs nt and st according to our study objective tillage simulation scenarios were designed namely ct was changed to nt ns nt with 6000 kg ha 1 of straw st and ss st with 6000 kg ha 1 of straw respectively using daily meteorological data from five years 2011 2016 components of the soil water balance and nitrogen balance above ground biomass and grain yield under ct were simulated by the validated rzwqm2 the simulated ct results were used as control values to compare with simulation results from the four conservation tillage systems finally we simulated the changes that occur in the water balance nitrogen balance biomass and grain yield when conventional tillage is replaced with the four conservation tillage treatments every year from 2011 to 2016 2 6 model performance criteria

model calibration and validation table 3 shows the comparison statistics between measured and simulated values of soil water contents nitrate concentrations above ground biomass and grain yield under different tillage treatments for the calibration and validation data sets the rmse values of soil water content and nitrate concentration under different treatments in the 100 cm soil profile ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 and from 5 50 to 6 41 respectively for the calibration data set the comparison results of simulated and measured values for soil water are presented only for ct and nt fig 1 the simulated soil water contents in the five 20 cm soil layers for ct and nt were close to the measured values under both ct and nt tillage treatments fig 1 the two other treatments cs and st had similar trends the rmse for soil water content for the ct cs nt and st treatments ranged from 0 021 0 033 0 026 0 037 0 024 0 036 and 0 022 0 036 cm3 cm 3 respectively simulated nitrate concentrations over time generally followed the measured values at different soil depths for the calibration data set fig 2 rmse of ct cs nt and st treatments varied from 1 55 mg kg 1 to 6 41 mg kg 1 with d 0 7 the accuracy of the nitrate concentration simulations was lower than that of the soil water simulations due to the complexity of nitrogen cycle nangia et al 2008 the simulated above ground biomass at harvest was close to observed values for ct cs nt and st as shown in table 3 with rmse values ranging from 608 to 1066 kg ha 1 for the calibration data set furthermore the simulated winter wheat grain yields under different tillage treatments were in good agreement with measured values for ct cs and nt treatments with rmse ranging from 144 to 365 kg ha 1 however the st treatment had an rmse of 1577 kg ha 1 and d of 0 78 table 3 the statistical indices comparing simulated to measured values for soil water contents and nitrate concentrations in the 100 cm soil profile above ground biomass and grain yield under different tillage treatments for the validation data set are shown in table 3 the rmse values of soil water ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 the mre values of soil water contents were in the range of 16 19 although simulated nitrogen concentrations under different tillage treatments were less satisfactory with rmse ranging from 6 6 to 10 3 mg kg 1 the values were acceptable simulated biomass under ct cs nt and st treatments was similar to measured values for the validation data set with rmse of 432 911 kg ha 1 mre of 9 14 and d of 0 87 0 93 table 3 the rmse mre and d values for winter wheat grain yield ranged from 427 to 809 kg ha 1 5 10 and 0 84 to 0 90 respectively table 3 fig 3 showed that the correlation coefficient for grain yield was 0 84 with r2 of 0 64 and p 0 05 indicating that rzwqm2 can reasonably predict winter wheat grain yield several under predicted values were shown in fig 3 due to dry weather consistent with results from timsina et al 2008 who demonstrated how rzwqm model failed to simulate the practical drought resistance of winter wheat in a dry year 3 2 analyses of model simulation results 3 2 1 water balance in soil profile after

average et under nt and ns slightly increased while average et under st and ss decreased by 9 8 and 10 1 respectively compared with ct more water runoff was simulated under st and ss because no

and ss the reason for lower yield under st and ss may be due to the simulated greater water loss resulting in lower et and to greater n leaching table 4 subsoiling tillage can reduce soil bulk density below the plow layer and increase infiltration sang et al 2016 resulting in increased water loss and n leaching below the active root zone although crop residues on the soil surface can reduce evaporation fan et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 long term effects of surface crop residues can include increased earthworm populations resulting in increased soil macro porosity and decreased soil bulk

and nt the reason may be related to different soil type climate and tillage time the nue values ranged from 26 8 to 30 1 kg n kg 1 when ct was changed to nt ns st and ss the nues increased 8 7 6 5 12 1 and 3 9 respectively table 4 although the simulated yields under st and ss were lower than with ct their nues were higher than seen with the ct treatment due to lower total n loss compared with ct nue changes due to tillage changes are a result of changes to both crop yield and total nitrogen consumption nt and ns significantly increased nh3 volatilization compared with ct simulated n loss the sum of nh3 volatilization n denitrification and n leaching was greatest when ct was changed to ns compared with ct all four conservation tillage treatments improved nue possibly due to the crop residue on the soil surface huo et al 2005 mansour et al 2019a b kong et al 2017 although the highest yields in this study were obtained under nt nue under nt was lower than under st because of the greater simulated nitrogen consumption under nt in general when ct was changed to nt above ground biomass grain yields wp and nue all increased while the n leaching loss decreased 4 conclusions rzwqm2 can be used to simulate water and n balance as well as winter wheat growth and grain yield when ct was changed to conservation tillage methods in henan province when ct was changed to nt water loss and n leaching decreased while the above ground biomass grain yield wp and nue all increased therefore we recommend no tillage as the optimal tillage system to use if the traditional ct system

eddy covariance et datasets were downloaded from the official data portal of the fluxnet community available at https fluxnet fluxdata org other required factors for sebali implementation including

coarse temporal resolution found in landsat 8 only few months showed more than one image in the case of two images per month a priority was given to the image occurring at the middle of that month 2 3 method sebali was proposed with several improvements over sebal and metric mhawej et al 2020 these enhancements particularly concern the estimation of et and water productivity values without the need of soil related datasets this could be done using the water stress ws factor described in yuan et al 2007 furthermore bottom of atmosphere satellite data were used to assess the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo the top of atmosphere datasets were used for the estimation of land surface temperature lst as discussed in faour et al 2015 another improvement includes an automatic calibration of hot cold pixels values using the existent water bodies within the selected study area more precisely water bodies were treated as cold pixels with a hypothesis that over water the sensible heat is maximum and the evapotranspiration is minimum furthermore transpiration is null and the evapotranspiration is equal to evaporation the applied formula is as follows e k x e p where e denotes evaporation ep is the pan evaporation and k is the pan coefficient two step calibrations were produced the first concerns the sensible heat of water where the latter is calculated and then compared to the generated value from sebali the highest sensible heat is selected and satellite image values will be adjusted accordingly the second investigates the evaporation rates over water bodies and compare them to the generated sebali values the lowest evaporation rate is selected and values will be adjusted accordingly it is important to note that these calibrations are produced in a fully automated manner sebali showed a calibration value k of 1 4 mhawej et al 2020 still as climatic conditions vary between each satellite image a new dynamic calibration technique was proposed based on fao irrigation and drainage paper no 24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 this latter showed a changing pan coefficient k with varying wind speed and relative humidity conditions over short green cropped area fig 2 the new calibration value is then based on an updated formula as follows e k x c x e p where e denotes evaporation ep is the pan evaporation k is the pan coefficient from doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and c is the new calibration value thus belgium and germany eleven monthly et datasets were used for calibrations italy and united states fifty monthly et datasets were used for validations monthly root mean square error rmse absolute mean error ame and the r squared correlation between sebali outputs and flux towers datasets were performed datasets showing biases beyond one standard deviation were eliminated such error could be related to a sudden change in the vegetation cover not captured by satellite images mainly due to their coarse spatial resolution i e one image per month thus 8 datasets were used for calibrations and 42 data for validations furthermore buffered zones from the central location of each eddy covariance flux tower were produced corresponding to buffered areas of 250 m 500 m 1 km and 2 km the calculation of sebali et in these buffered regions will determine the validity of extrapolating flux et values outside parcels boundary a simplified flowchart is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 calibrations the most adequate calibration value c was noted at 0 2 with a rmse of 30 36 mm and an ame of 28 26 mm in comparison to flux towers data located in belgium and germany table 2 average error increased below and above the calibration value of 0 2 with a maximum rmse shown on 0 5 3 2 validations as the calibration value c was set to 0 2 a validation for the remaining set of monthly et flux towers datasets in italy and united states was performed table 3 results showed a rmse value of 25 25 mm with an ame of 20 13 mm these errors were reduced further by incorporating the standard deviation std of each sebali datasets the new values for both rmse and ame were 21 32 mm and 15 4 mm respectively the relationship between sebali and flux towers et datasets is plotted through pearson regression fig 4 while including std values the r squared showed a value of 88 4 at the calibration value of 0 2 3 3 buffered areas when comparing parcel level rmse and ame sebali et outputs with buffered zones of 250 m 500 m 1 km and 2 km from the flux towers an increase in errors was noticed table 4 more specifically high rmse and ame values were shown in the buffer zone of 250 m with 46 46 mm and 36 41 mm respectively the smallest rmse and ame values were shown at 1 km and 2 km with values 40 mm month for the rmse and 30 mm month for the ame pearson linear correlations were produced between flux towers et values and each buffered zone fig 5 results showed an acceptable correlation r squared value of 64 in the one kilometer buffered zone the other buffered areas performed poorly with r squared values lower than 60 4 discussion calibrations were performed on different c values in belgium and germany as the c was added to the automatic dynamic pan coefficient k this latter could be retrieved from doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and is related to the actual conditions of relative humidity and wind speed the most adequate value was noticed at 0 2 monthly rmse ame and r squared values were produced with the new calibration c value i e 0 2 at parcel level showing good agreements with flux towers datasets furthermore when considering sebali std values rmse showed a promising value of 21 32 mm month or 0 7 mm day with and ame of 0 5 mm day the correlation between these two datasets was high i e an r squared value of 88 4 thus the new dynamic calibration method was validated and could be portable to other agricultural regions particularly because the validation sites exhibit different climatic conditions when trying to check the validity of extrapolating flux et values outside parcels boundary both rmse and ame showed very high values exceeding 45 mm month in some cases i e at a buffered zone of 250 m r squared values for the most buffered zones were below 60 this could be related to the diverse land use land cover classes seen at the proximity of the selected parcels fig 6 including for instance olive plantations and riparian vegetations these latter classes generate different evapotranspiration values due a change in structure physiology and metabolism thus designing weather station networks including one or two eddy covariance or other flux towers type would not be beneficial to collect more et data from a large study area the best option would be then to extrapolate et values using a surface energy balance model based on airborne techniques the importance of this study lies in proposing a novel calibration approach based on a dynamic assessment of pan evaporation in relation to actual climatic conditions the changing calibration value k x c will answer more to the actual condition of each satellite image rendering sebali et values more accurate as the calibration proposed is already embedded within the improved sebali fully automated system professional and lay person could implement it without any assistance the proposed new calibration method was validated in different countries showing an r squared value of 88 and a daily ame of 0 5 mm thus sebali could be portable to different climatic regions with diverse crop types particularly when soil related datasets are missing 5 conclusion in this paper a novel dynamic approach was proposed to calibrate internally and automatically sebali et values it is based on doorenbos and pruitt 1977 fao irrigation and drainage paper no 24 pan coefficient k as well as on the calibration factor c retrieved from calibrations performed in belgium and germany the proposed calibration approach will better characterize the diverse climatic conditions found at each sensing period rmse and ame values showed good agreements with et flux tower datasets based on our findings it was difficult to extrapolate flux tower et data outside the boundary of parcels the usage of an airborne based surface energy balance model is then highly recommended future studies could focus on processing multiple images per month to decrease biases in months showing a sudden shift in the crop s development stage also incorporating other satellite sensors datasets such as the 10 m sentinel 2 images might increase accuracies particularly when data fusion technique is performed retrieving et values as well as producing et trends per crop type would largely help policy makers and farmers to better manage their crops while conserving water

fruit yield and quality in the first three years of the experiment trees under full irrigation grew faster which led to larger trunks than trees under deficit irrigation at the end of the study tree canopy size showed no difference among different methods of irrigation or between full and deficit irrigation deficit irrigation of up to 40 water savings did not lead to significant yield losses for 8 9 years deficit irrigation also did not cause a significant reduction in fruit quality except for an increase in percentage of double fruits but the worst year case was still less than 1 5 fruit color showed lower lightness in furrow full irrigation than in furrow deficit treatment but no difference was found in deficit drip or micro sprinkler treatment also no difference was found for fruit firmness total soluble solids ph malic acid or total phenolics between the respective full and deficit irrigation treatments the study demonstrated the feasibility of applying continued postharvest deficit irrigation for up to10 years for peach production which resulted in significant water savings during the summer peak water use period keywords fruit yield fruit quality evapotranspiration soil water content stem water potential water stress water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture irrigation is a major user of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas of the world in california usa irrigated agricultural land area increased from 3 1 million ha in 1992 to 3 3 million ha in 2010 and the increase was mainly attributed to expansion of high cash value orchard crops such as fruit and nut trees klonsky 2012 among the significant land areas for orchard crops about 23 000 ha are peaches which are primarily grown in the central valley of california like in other orchard crops growing peaches in the region depends on irrigation to meet crop water demand by the peach trees and increasing irrigation efficiency is a core interest farm irrigation methods can generally be grouped into three categories surface gravity flow sprinkler and micro irrigation systems irrigation efficiency for most surface irrigation systems can range widely with furrow and gravity systems having a reported 65 75 efficiency rating in california despite ongoing investment in more efficient on farm irrigation systems flood and furrow irrigation still accounted for 43 of all irrigated land areas vaux et al 1990 for orchard crops such as fruit trees there has been a major conversion effort in the past two decades to micro irrigation systems such as drip and micro sprinklers furrow and gravity systems currently still used in orchard crops account for about 20 of the irrigated orchards the remaining majority of 80 has been converted to either drip or micro sprinkler systems this shift to more efficient irrigation methods is attributable in part to a reduction in irrigation water supplies in response to periodic drought conditions and other water supply constraints as well as reduced costs and available government assistance to farmers for adopting improved irrigation technologies depending on the type of systems drip and micro sprinkler irrigation systems are reported to have the highest irrigation efficiency rating of 85 90 the type of irrigation system adopted can depend on financing available to update a farm s irrigation system but may also depend on site specific conditions at the farm such as crop type soil type and field topography many stone fruit crops grown in the central valley of california bloom in february to march ripen early and get harvested near end of may to early june for these types of fruit trees deficit irrigation may be used to reduce water use during the postharvest non fruit bearing period the amount of crop evapotranspiration or etc after harvest june december accounts for approximately 80 of the annual total etc january december therefore reduced water application or deficit irrigation during this period can result in significant water savings deficit irrigation is a potential means of reducing total crop water consumption by irrigating at less than the full amount required by crop evapotranspiration needs for fruiting trees such as peaches because fruit yield and quality at harvest may not be sensitive to water stress at certain developmental stages such as during non fruit bearing postharvest season there has been a lot of interest in applying deficit irrigation strategies costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 abrisqueta et al 2010 conejero et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 ruiz sanchez et al 2018 also many early season fruiting trees including peaches possess rigorous canopy growth rate reduced irrigation or deficit irrigation can be used as a strategy for controlling excessive vegetative growth thus saving the labor cost of meeting the pruning requirement chalmers et al 1981 boland et al 2000a additionally perennial crops such as fruit trees are suitable candidates for applying deficit irrigation strategies because of deeper and more extensive root systems for water uptake than most annual crops goldhamer et al 1999 girona et al 2005 deficit irrigation can potentially lead to physiological and yield responses in peach trees although in nearly all cases substantial water savings were achieved there were mixed findings on the impact of deficit irrigation on fruit yield quality and tree health johnson et al 1992 reported that postharvest deficit irrigation with furrow irrigation method in early maturing peach trees resulted in no difference in fruit yield and size over a four year period no significant difference was found in most other parameters studied such as fruit density or tree vigor however the occurrence of double fruit was greatly increased in the driest deficit irrigation treatment in a three year field study boland et al 2000b found that combinations of restricted soil volume smaller plant spacing and deficit irrigation led to reduced fruit size up to 30 smaller than the control treatment in a two year study abrisqueta et al 2008 found reduced root growth in a four year old early season peach when subjected deficit irrigation postharvest deficit irrigation had less effect on tree water use and fruit yield than pre harvest deficit irrigation the effects of different deficit irrigation strategies on peach tree water status and yield were studied by vera et al 2013 in a five year field experiment using drip irrigation the authors concluded that fruit yield was more affected by postharvest deficit irrigation than pre harvest deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation reduced the number of fruits per tree more than the fruit size was reduced in a different deficit irrigation study in spain on peaches falagan et al 2015 found that postharvest deficit irrigation guided by pre determined maximum daily trunk shrinkage values as indicators of water stress led to variable differences in fruit vitamin and phenolic contents as compared to the full irrigation treatment wang and gartung 2010 and zhang et al 2017 reported consistently higher canopy temperature when postharvest deficit irrigation was applied and differences between midday canopy and air temperature were used as benchmarks for irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation is also used in other tree crops in a five year study on citrus trees gasque et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation when stem water potential was maintained above 2 0 mpa had no significant effect on yield and fruit quality with up to 27 water savings they also found that trees under deficit irrigation showed a fast recovery and reached full hydration one week after restarting irrigation egea et al 2013 in a six year field study reported that almond kernel yield was proportionally reduced after imposing moderate to severe deficit irrigation up to 30 of the full irrigation amount intrigliolo et al 2013 in a seven year study reported reduced fruit set and yield in a japanese plum under prolonged deficit irrigation despite of the large number of studies reported on deficit irrigation there is a lack of knowledge on the cumulative effect of prolonged deficit irrigation on tree health and productivity the objective of this 10 year study was to determine the feasibility of long term postharvest deficit irrigation in an early ripening peach variety and the effects on marketable fruit yield fruit quality and tree health 2 material and methods 2 1 study site experimental design and irrigation scheduling the study was carried out from june 2005 to june 2015 in a 1 6 ha mature peach orchard located near parlier california usa the soil at the study site is a hanford fine sandy loam classified as coarse loamy mixed thermic typic xerorthents with low organic matter content the trees were early ripening crimson lady prunus persica l batsch peach on nemaguard rootstock planted in april 1999 with a tree spacing of 1 8 m within the row and 4 9 m between tree rows because of the close within row spacing the trees were maintained with two primary branches in a v shaped configuration perpendicular to the tree row direction and to maximize light interception dejong et al 1994 this peach variety blooms in february march fruit sets were commercially thinned each spring and marketable fruits were harvested at the end of may tree canopy was pruned annually during winter dormancy by commercial contractors the orchard was divided into replicated irrigation blocks which were subjected to drip furrow or jet microsprinkler irrigation methods with or without deficit treatment the experimental design was a randomized block with six replications within each main block or replication six sub treatment blocks were randomly assigned and designated as drip full irrigation df drip deficit irrigation dd furrow full irrigation ff furrow deficit irrigation fd sprinkler full irrigation sf and sprinkler deficit irrigation sd therefore a total of 36 sub treatment blocks were used in this study each sub treatment block consisted of three rows with eight trees per row and the middle six trees in the center row were used for data collection drip deficit irrigation was carried out from 2005 to 2015 except for the harvest year of 2010 and 2012 when no deficit was applied in any irrigation treatment table 1 furrow deficit treatment was applied in harvest year 2008 2009 2013 2015 and sprinkler deficit applied in harvest year 2013 2015 as previously described in zhang et al 2017 furrow treatments were irrigated in 1 m wide 0 2 m deep and 9 8 m long v shaped furrows on both sides of the tree rows running parallel to the row and located 1 m furrow center from the tree trunks drip treatments were irrigated with drip tubing containing 0 002 m3 h 1 integral turbulent flow embedded emitters spaced 0 91 m apart geoflow charlotte nc two tubing laterals were used for each tree row one on each side at a distance of 1 m from the tree trunks jet microsprinkler treatments were applied with 40 l h 1 fanjet emitters with a 4 m diameter 230 spray pattern bowsmith inc exeter ca and located near the base of each tree irrigation amount was measured using turbine water meters model srii and w 120 invensys metering systems uniontown pa the study area has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool winters each year irrigation was initiated around mid march and continued through november all trees received uniform irrigation matching the full crop evapotranspiration or etc requirement during early growing season up to harvest irrigation scheduling timing and amount was based primarily on estimated etc using the fao crop coefficient method e g multiplying theoretical potential or reference evapotranspiration with a plant dependent crop coefficient value to determine etc for a particular crop at a particular growth stage doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 abrisqueta et al 2013 irrigation scheduling was adjusted based on methods of irrigation e g furrow vs drip vs jet microsprinkler and respective plant stem water potential and soil water content readings 2 2 soil and tree water status soil water content was measured weekly during the summer postharvest season with a neutron probe model 503dr hydroprobe cpn international inc 2830 howe road martinez ca for the furrow and micro sprinkler plots galvanized steel access tubes were installed in the tree row for the drip irrigation plots access tubes were installed in the tree row and also at 1 m away from the tree rows the reason was to capture spatial differences in water distribution because the drip lines were at 1 m from tree rows readings were made at 15 45 75 105 135 cm depths the neutron probe was calibrated with volumetric soil samples taken from 15 135 cm depths in the study field in 2012 the neutron probe readings were transferred to volumetric soil water content with the calibration equation n 30 r2 0 98 for each measurement set average soil water content was computed for the top 1 5 m soil profile for each irrigation plot during the postharvest season mid day stem water potential was measured weekly or bi weekly from both the full and deficit irrigation blocks using a pressure chamber model 3000 1412 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca stem water potential is considered a useful indicator for plant water status in peaches abrisqueta et al 2015 measurements were made between 1200 and 1400 h local time following the procedures described in mccutchan and shackel 1992 briefly total hermetic aluminum foil bags were placed on each leaf at least 2 h before taking stem water potential measurements six measurements per plot were taken from the middle three trees two leaves per tree of the center row 2 3 tree trunk canopy size and photosynthesis to evaluate tree response to irrigation treatments tree trunk diameter was measured with a caliper from 2006 to 2008 during winter dormancy december january six trees from the center row of each irrigation plot for a total of 216 trees were measured each year leaf area index was measured in june 2015 with a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor 4647 superior street lincoln ne usa readings were made using the ¼ circle aperture cover looking west taken at 15 30 cm above the ground surface from the harvest row to the border row a set of five above canopy readings were made outside the orchard followed by within orchard readings of each set of irrigation treatment the process was repeated 15 times photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor 4647 superior street lincoln ne usa in april 2015 when tree canopy had been fully established for each irrigation plot readings were made from 1000 to 1500 h local time using three sunlit and three shaded leaves respectively three replications were used for each irrigation treatment therefore nine readings were obtained for each irrigation treatment for sunlit and shaded leaves respectively 2 4 yield yield metrics and water use efficiency fruit yield was measured each year from 2006 to 2015 from each irrigation plot marketable sized fruits were picked by a local commercial harvesting crew following typical farming procedures the timing of harvest was also determined by the commercial contractor for ripeness a total of two to three picks were used during each season with each pick about three to seven days apart for each experimental plot the middle six trees of the center row were used for yield determination measured yield parameters were fruit weight and number of fruit per tree water use efficiency wue was computed as the ratio of marketable fruit yield y divided by the total amount of irrigation and rain ir for the entire 12 months from the previous year s harvest to the current year s harvest or irrigation and rain received for the 3 months in the current season leading to harvest march 1 to may 31 1 w u e y i r 3 12 2 5 fruit quality fruit physical quality was determined by counting the number of peaches with doubles deep sutures external splits dimples deformations and split pits every year the measurements were made by randomly selecting 50 fruits from each pick each year from each of the six replications for each irrigation treatment two to three picks were used for each year s harvest therefore 600 900 fruits were used from each plot for physical quality assessment data from 2012 to 2015 were presented to show the long term impact of deficit irrigation and methods of irrigation on fruit physical quality fruit chemical quality was determined for the 2015 harvest by randomly selecting 10 fruits per plot for assessment of skin color flesh firmness soluble solids ph and titratable acidity of fruit juice within two weeks of storage at 1 c as described in zhang et al 2017 fruit skin color was measured by a handheld chroma meter cr 400 konica minolta japan a slice of skin of each fruit was removed and flesh firmness was measured with a penetrometer and recorded as pounds force and converted to newtons n two pieces of each fruit were removed and juiced using a juice processer to form a composite juice sample for each treatment a few drops of peach juice were tested for soluble solids concentration with a handheld brix refractometer atago inc wa usa titratable acidity and ph were measured by titrating a 5 g sample of juice diluted with 50 ml of deionized water using 0 1 n naoh to an endpoint of 8 1 ph using tim 850 titration radiometer analytical workstation radiometer analytical sas france two picks were made in 2015 with the second pick at seven days later and fruit quality were analyzed seperately for each pick total phenolics concentrations in the peach fruit were measured using the folin ciocalteu reagent assay stushnoff et al 2008 briefly 5 ml of 80 acetone were added to 0 5 g of dried sample in triplicate samples were vortexed in the dark for 1 h at 4 c to allow complete extraction the supernatant was used to measure concentration of total phenolics on microplates at 756 nm total phenols concentration was standardized against gallic acid and expressed as mg gallic acid per 100 g fresh fruit 2 6 statistical analysis statistical comparisons were made between different irrigation methods and deficit irrigation treatments for each year data were analyzed by analysis of variance anova test using glm model sas institute 2003 means were separated at the 0 05 level using the tukey s studentized range test hsd 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation evapotranspiration and water balance the long term average annual precipitation in the study area is about 300 mm during the study period only 3 out of the 11 years received a total annual precipitation that reached the long term average the remaining 8 years were all below or drastically below the annual average precipitation fig 1 except a wet year in 2010 440 mm from 2007 to 2015 there was an 8 year drought with an average annual rainfall of 181 mm or 40 below average because of the mediterranean climate all precipitation in the central valley of california is in the form of rainfall and the monthly rainfall distribution shows that nearly all the annual precipitation is received from november to april when all deciduous trees including peaches are mostly in dormancy for the growing season april to october there is virtually no precipitation daily water loss by evapotranspiration or crop evapotranspiration etc was determined by multiplying the daily crop coefficient kc value with the reference or potential evapotranspiration value eto 2 e t c k c e t o the kc values for the peach growing season used in this study were based on the piece wise linear function developed from a lysimeter study by johnson et al 2005 the daily eto values were obtained from a nearby weather station cimis 2015 as shown in fig 2 during the growing season kc increased linearly from day of year doy 60 to doy 187 then remained constant at 1 20 until doy 305 a constant small value of 0 1 was used for kc from doy 305 to doy 60 of following year when trees had no leaves to account for baseline direct evaporation water loss from the soil surface 3 k c t 0 1 60 t 1 0 1 0 00866 t 60 187 t 60 1 2 305 t 187 0 1 365 t 305 where t day of year monthly and annual etc was determined by integrating the daily etc values over each month or each year for the 11 year study period fig 3 4 e t c t 1 30 365 k c t e t o t d t whereas the annual etc ranged from 1045 mm in 2006 to 1253 in 2008 the monthly etc distribution patterns are very similar from year to year with a maximum monthly etc of about 250 mm always occurred in july the highest three month etc values were found in june july august and the cumulative etc from june to december accounted for 80 of the annual etc this type of monthly plant water use pattern demonstrates the greatest potential for achieving the most water savings using postharvest deficit irrigation field water balance was computed for each irrigation treatment as the difference between the sum of irrigation and rain water received minus etc for the period a january 1 may 31 and b june 1 december 31 for each year fig 4 as shown clearly in the figure all irrigation treatments in period a showed positive values for nearly all 11 years of the experiment while period b for the deficit irrigation treatments exhibited mostly negative values the maximum deficit based on the water balance assessment reached 400 to 600 mm of water in 7 seasons in the drip 2 seasons in the furrow and 4 seasons in the jet microsprinkler treatment plots the water balance values during period b of the deficit treatments were based on trees transpiring at their maximum potential however the actual etc was most likely smaller than the calculated etc because of reduced transpiration rate created by water stress induced stomatal control an option to account for reduced etc derived from water stress under deficit irrigation was to use a crop coefficient stress factor as proposed in allen 2000 however the determination of such stress factor requires real time on site etc measurements when plants are under water stress other method of irrigation scheduling for early season peaches include trunk diameter shrinkage conejero et al 2007 2010 2011 soil water content ruiz sanchez et al 2018 or capacitance probes abrisqueta et al 2010 3 2 cumulative irrigation and irrigation effect on soil water content and stem water potential seasonal cumulative irrigation for 2012 2014 can be seen in fig 5 each year irrigation started around mid march and continued through november the amount of water applied up to harvest by end of may was 384 325 and 265 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively and the three irrigation methods received virtually the same amount of water during each year up to harvest deficit irrigation was initiated after harvest and the final amount of water applied by mid october including water applied from march to harvest time was in general approximately 50 for the deficit treatments relative to the full irrigation treatments specifically in 2012 the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit treatments received 56 39 and 51 of that received by the respective full irrigation treatments in 2013 the deficit drip furrow and jet microsprinkler treatments received 55 70 and 68 of the respective full irrigation treatments because of a failed electronic control device an unintended large irrigation event for the jet microsprinkler system occurred over a weekend in mid july in 2014 the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit treatments received 53 56 and 54 of that received by the respective full irrigation treatments the amount of applied water for the full irrigation treatment was different between irrigation methods i e drip vs furrow vs jet microsprinkler this was caused by irrigation scheduling decisions being made by not only the estimated etc but also site specific plant and soil water status measurements such as stem water potential and soil water content readings consistent with the cumulative irrigation received average volumetric soil water content in the plant root zone showed overall higher readings in the full than in the deficit irrigation plots fig 6 in 2012 average soil water content in the full irrigation plots decreased slightly from 18 in early june to approximately 12 in september october whereas in the deficit plots there was a steep decrease to approximately 5 occurring from june to august in 2013 and 2014 similar overall trends were observed where initial soil water content was approximately 18 in june and decreased overtime to 5 10 in the deficit plots by august or september however the deficit jet microsprinkler plot in 2013 showed a sharp increase in mid july due to the one time unintended large irrigation event and the furrow deficit plot in 2014 exhibited relative high soil water content 15 until after august when it started to decrease to about 7 by late september the high irrigation amount in furrow and jet microsprinkler full irrigation plots in 2013 and full furrow treatment in 2014 fig 5 was able to maintain the soil water content unchanged or even slightly higher up to 20 than that at harvest throughout the postharvest season the temporal soil water distribution patterns clearly indicated the enhanced root water uptake for making up the shortfalls in applied water in the deficit irrigation treatments when the soil water content reached as low as 5 by volume the corresponding matric potential would be at approximately 250 kpa based on the in situ soil water retention data from wang et al 2011 at this potential range plant roots would still be able to extract soil water but would require significantly higher energy in the full irrigation treatment where soil water content was at 18 the corresponding matric potential would be at approximately 20 kpa or no water stress would be expected the ability of peach trees for mining water from the soil profile under deficit irrigation has also been shown in previous studies by johnson et al 1992 and girona et al 1993 and in almond trees by goldhamer et al 2006 and lópez lópez et al 2018 stem water potential swp in the postharvest season showed similar trends as in the soil water content measurements where consistently higher values were observed in the full irrigation than in the deficit irrigation treatments fig 7 swp values in the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler full irrigation treatments remained reasonably close in all three years a slight decreasing trend was found in 2012 from 0 7 mpa in early june to 1 1 mpa in mid september and in 2014 from 0 7 mpa in early june to 1 0 mpa in mid september swp in the full irrigation treatments remained nearly unchanged in 2013 at 0 75 mpa during the postharvest season as expected swp values in the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit irrigation treatments showed lower values than in the full irrigation plots in 2012 swp in the deficit jet microsprinkler plot reached the lowest value of 2 33 mpa on september 21 in 2013 the drip deficit plot showed consistently lower swp readings than the deficit furrow and jet microsprinkler plots this trend is consistent with the soil water content measurements fig 6 because of the lowest amount of water applied in this treatment as shown in fig 5 in 2014 lowest swp values were found in the deficit jet microsprinkler plot i e 2 17 mpa on september 12 the relatively smaller variations in swp than in soil water content shows the ability of trees functioning as an integrator of external effects such as sustained water stress during the deficit irrigation experiment reponses of swp to any short term perturbations such as individual irrigation event or diurnal variations in water stress would not be as sensitive as the direct soil water measurements goldhamer et al 1999 remorini and massai 2003 3 3 fruit yield quality and water use efficiency total amount of water received leading up to harvest in the previous 12 and 3 months marketable peach fruit yield yield metrics and water use efficiency under different irrigation regimes are shown for each year for the 11 year field study table 1 for the first two seasons of the study there was no significant difference in fruit yield number of fruit per tree or fruit weight among the different irrigation treatments despite a 59 in 2006 and 65 in 2007 reduction in total water received in 12 mo between the deficit drip and full drip irrigation treatments there was no significant difference in yield or yield parameters in the 2005 2006 season despite a 75 reduction in total water received between the deficit drip irrigation and the furrow full irrigation treatment yield and all other yield parameters still remained not significantly different lower marketable fruit yield at p 0 05 was found in deficit than in the full drip irrigation plots in 2008 2014 and 2015 for furrow lower yields were found in 2011 2014 and 2015 for the jet microsprinkler treatment significantly lower yield was only found in 2014 the results on fruit yield appear to indicate that for the same irrigation method up to 60 deficit irrigation did not cause significant yield reduction for 8 9 years regardless of the methods of irrigation fig 8 until significant yield differences were found in 2014 and 2015 harvests no information can be found in the literature for deficit irrigation of peach trees for more than 5 years for cyclic drought events in the region that last 3 5 years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the practice of deficit irrigation would appear to be a plausible strategy to mitigate the lack of available fresh water for irrigation purposes without causing drastic yield losses in the early season peach varieties fruit yield under full drip irrigation was lower than that under furrow full irrigation in 2014 and 2015 table 1 this effect was likely attributed to the lower amount of postharvest irrigation received in the drip than in the furrow the finding also indicates that over time up to about 10 years differences in soil wetting patterns as related to methods of irrigation might have led to a cumulative effect on tree productivity drip irrigated plots would have the least wetting volume in the soil which over time would limit root growth because of the smaller wetting zones compared to furrow irrigation jet microsprinkler irrigation on the other hand creates a wetting pattern that has relatively more uniform coverage over the orchard floor root distribution under jet microsprinklers would also be more diffuse thus less likely to limit water uptake from a limited soil volume however the depth of wetting from micro sprinkler irrigation would not be as deep as in the drip or furrow irrigation effect of irrigation on tree root distribution has been reported for peaches abrisqueta et al 2008 almonds koumanov et al 2006 and citrus bevington and castle 1985 however the overall marketable fruit yield from the experimental period of 2006 2015 did not cause significant differences between the three different irrigation methods number of fruit per tree was found lower for the deficit than for the full irrigation treatments for all three irrigation methods in 2014 and only for drip in 2015 table 1 reduction in fruit set and final yield were reported in a japanese plum after seven seasons of continuous deficit irrigation intrigliolo et al 2013 fruit size or weight per fruit was also found lower for the deficit than for the full irrigation treatments for drip in 2008 and 2009 and for furrow in 2009 2014 and 2015 the fruit weight reduction in drip deficit treatment in 2008 and 2009 was attributed to the severe irrigation reduction i e 41 in 2005 2006 35 in 2006 2007 and 36 in 2007 2008 of the full irrigation treatment reduced fruit size would have a tangible impact on the market value of the fruit as they are sold for fresh eating the timing of harvest often has more impact on the market value because higher prices may be attained when other peaches are not available in addition to the irrigation effect there were year to year changes in yield fruit number and size this was partially attributed to year to year variations in weather conditions lopez et al 2007 and orchard management practices such as fruit thinning and off season pruning as reported in other studies such as vera et al 2013 wue was in general in the range of 2 4 kg m3 of water received in 12 mo from harvest to harvest table 1 also lower wue values were generally found for full irrigation and higher values for deficit irrigation treatments the value increased to 4 10 kg m3 when only considering the total water received in 3 mo in the same year leading up to harvest however there was virtually no difference in wue between full and deficit irrigation treatments because the amount of water received was nearly the same in the same year prior to harvest this effect or lack of effect on yield responses can also be depicted when yield or relative yield is plotted against the total water received irrigation plus rain for the 3 months prior to harvest results not shown also there is no clear trend on yield response to total water received in the 12 mo period from previous year harvest to current year harvest however the relative yield normalized to the maximum yield for each year appears to show reduced variability when higher amounts of water are received physical quality of peach fruit showed no significant difference in amounts of deep sutures external splits dimples or split pits among treatments table 2 similar to findings by johnson et al 1992 there was higher occurrence of doubles in the deficit than in the full irrigation plots however the total percentage of doubles was less than 1 5 less deformed fruits were found in the drip full irrigation treatment than in the deficit drip treatment the shape of the fruit also possesses aesthetics values for marketing purposes except for external splits in general there were significant differences in these physical properties between harvest years from 2012 to 2015 for example regardless of the methods of irrigation or amounts of irrigation 9 10 fruits were found deformed in 2012 and 2015 which were much higher than the 0 6 1 6 value found in 2013 2014 the annual variations in these physical properties were likely attributable to weather orchard management disease and pest factors fruit color measurements showed lower lightness in furrow full irrigation than in furrow deficit treatment table 3 differences in lightness between and full and deficit treatment for drip and jet microsprinkler irrigation were not significant higher chrome value was found for the jet microsprinkler deficit treatment than the drip and furrow treatments higher hue angle was found in the drip and furrow full irrigation than in the jet microsprinkler deficit treatment these color metrics were similar to values reported for a late season peach montero prado et al 2011 no difference was found for fruit firmness between the respective full and deficit irrigation treatments however fruits under drip irrigation either full or deficit were firmer than fruits under furrow irrigation the total soluble solids was 12 ph was 3 6 malic acid 0 5 these values are comparable to those reported in the literature for peach fernandez et al 2009 but there was no difference among different irrigation methods or amounts of irrigation total phenolics in peach fruit averaged 20 mg gallic acid 100 g fruit and there was no difference among different irrigation treatments harvest timing had a significant effect on fruit color chrome and hue angle firmness and solids content the second pick at 7 days after the first pick showed lower values for these parameters table 3 which indicates a consequence of ripening of the fruit as a similar effect was observed for peach fruit in postharvest storage montero prado et al 2011 3 4 tree growth and physiological function methods of irrigation and amounts of irrigation both had an effect on tree growth as shown in trunk diameter table 4 in general trees under full irrigation grew faster or had larger trunks than trees under deficit irrigation the difference in trunk diameter between full and deficit irrigation became significant in 2007 and 2008 for drip and only in 2008 for furrow for jet microsprinkler treatments the difference in trunk diameter between full and deficit irrigation was significant in all three years when measurements were made i e 2006 2008 furthermore it appears that drip and furrow irrigation favors trunk growth more than jet microsprinkler irrigation because the trunk diameter was greater later in the years 2015 however the effect of methods and amounts of irrigation on tree canopy size measured as leaf area index or lai showed no clear trend it should be noted that lai is a measure of the entire canopy size branches and leaves whereas trunk diameter is simply the size of the trunk the two parameters are related but not necessarily strongly correlated because of canopy management through pruning pruning likely would have a stronger effect on lai then on truck size nonetheless it is possible that tree growth in the woody tissue would cease or significantly slowed down so that the cumulative effect of deficit irrigation or methods of irrigation diminished over time tree function depicted herein as photosynthetic rate and leaf stomatal conductance did not indicate a cumulative treatment effect from the 10 year long experiment on methods of irrigation and deficit irrigation data not shown as expected in general sunlit leaves showed much higher activities in the photosynthetic process than the shaded leaves demonstrated as higher photosynthetic rates and leaf stomatal conductance values 4 conclusions the 10 year long field study compared furrow drip and jet microsprinkler irrigation under either full or deficit irrigation treatments on peach tree health soil and plant water dynamics and fruit yield and quality in general fruit yield and quality did not show significant differences between the three methods of irrigation used in the study however there were some differences in fruit color and firmness among irrigation methods deficit irrigation of up to 40 water reduction did not lead to significant yield losses for 8 9 years this finding highlights the unrealized potential of the long recognized concept of deficit irrigation as an on farm management strategy in greatly increasing water use efficiency the amount of water saved from the postharvest deficit irrigation can be a significant source for other crops or for non agriculture uses during the critical peak water use season june september the verifiable negative impact of deficit irrigation was an increase on number of fruit doubles which would reduce its value however the total percentage of doubles in the worst case was less than 1 5 the year to year variability of fruit yield and quality was greater than those between the irrigation treatments for the same year future research could investigate the interactive effect of irrigation management orchard management and weather declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10734,deficit irrigation can be used as a potential means of dealing with lack of irrigation water however the long term impact of deficit irrigation on productivity is not fully understood a 10 year long field study was carried out to compare effects of furrow drip and micro sprinkler irrigation under either full irrigation or postharvest deficit irrigation treatments on peach tree health and fruit yield and quality in the first three years of the experiment trees under full irrigation grew faster which led to larger trunks than trees under deficit irrigation at the end of the study tree canopy size showed no difference among different methods of irrigation or between full and deficit irrigation deficit irrigation of up to 40 water savings did not lead to significant yield losses for 8 9 years deficit irrigation also did not cause a significant reduction in fruit quality except for an increase in percentage of double fruits but the worst year case was still less than 1 5 fruit color showed lower lightness in furrow full irrigation than in furrow deficit treatment but no difference was found in deficit drip or micro sprinkler treatment also no difference was found for fruit firmness total soluble solids ph malic acid or total phenolics between the respective full and deficit irrigation treatments the study demonstrated the feasibility of applying continued postharvest deficit irrigation for up to10 years for peach production which resulted in significant water savings during the summer peak water use period keywords fruit yield fruit quality evapotranspiration soil water content stem water potential water stress water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture irrigation is a major user of fresh water in arid and semi arid areas of the world in california usa irrigated agricultural land area increased from 3 1 million ha in 1992 to 3 3 million ha in 2010 and the increase was mainly attributed to expansion of high cash value orchard crops such as fruit and nut trees klonsky 2012 among the significant land areas for orchard crops about 23 000 ha are peaches which are primarily grown in the central valley of california like in other orchard crops growing peaches in the region depends on irrigation to meet crop water demand by the peach trees and increasing irrigation efficiency is a core interest farm irrigation methods can generally be grouped into three categories surface gravity flow sprinkler and micro irrigation systems irrigation efficiency for most surface irrigation systems can range widely with furrow and gravity systems having a reported 65 75 efficiency rating in california despite ongoing investment in more efficient on farm irrigation systems flood and furrow irrigation still accounted for 43 of all irrigated land areas vaux et al 1990 for orchard crops such as fruit trees there has been a major conversion effort in the past two decades to micro irrigation systems such as drip and micro sprinklers furrow and gravity systems currently still used in orchard crops account for about 20 of the irrigated orchards the remaining majority of 80 has been converted to either drip or micro sprinkler systems this shift to more efficient irrigation methods is attributable in part to a reduction in irrigation water supplies in response to periodic drought conditions and other water supply constraints as well as reduced costs and available government assistance to farmers for adopting improved irrigation technologies depending on the type of systems drip and micro sprinkler irrigation systems are reported to have the highest irrigation efficiency rating of 85 90 the type of irrigation system adopted can depend on financing available to update a farm s irrigation system but may also depend on site specific conditions at the farm such as crop type soil type and field topography many stone fruit crops grown in the central valley of california bloom in february to march ripen early and get harvested near end of may to early june for these types of fruit trees deficit irrigation may be used to reduce water use during the postharvest non fruit bearing period the amount of crop evapotranspiration or etc after harvest june december accounts for approximately 80 of the annual total etc january december therefore reduced water application or deficit irrigation during this period can result in significant water savings deficit irrigation is a potential means of reducing total crop water consumption by irrigating at less than the full amount required by crop evapotranspiration needs for fruiting trees such as peaches because fruit yield and quality at harvest may not be sensitive to water stress at certain developmental stages such as during non fruit bearing postharvest season there has been a lot of interest in applying deficit irrigation strategies costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 abrisqueta et al 2010 conejero et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 ruiz sanchez et al 2018 also many early season fruiting trees including peaches possess rigorous canopy growth rate reduced irrigation or deficit irrigation can be used as a strategy for controlling excessive vegetative growth thus saving the labor cost of meeting the pruning requirement chalmers et al 1981 boland et al 2000a additionally perennial crops such as fruit trees are suitable candidates for applying deficit irrigation strategies because of deeper and more extensive root systems for water uptake than most annual crops goldhamer et al 1999 girona et al 2005 deficit irrigation can potentially lead to physiological and yield responses in peach trees although in nearly all cases substantial water savings were achieved there were mixed findings on the impact of deficit irrigation on fruit yield quality and tree health johnson et al 1992 reported that postharvest deficit irrigation with furrow irrigation method in early maturing peach trees resulted in no difference in fruit yield and size over a four year period no significant difference was found in most other parameters studied such as fruit density or tree vigor however the occurrence of double fruit was greatly increased in the driest deficit irrigation treatment in a three year field study boland et al 2000b found that combinations of restricted soil volume smaller plant spacing and deficit irrigation led to reduced fruit size up to 30 smaller than the control treatment in a two year study abrisqueta et al 2008 found reduced root growth in a four year old early season peach when subjected deficit irrigation postharvest deficit irrigation had less effect on tree water use and fruit yield than pre harvest deficit irrigation the effects of different deficit irrigation strategies on peach tree water status and yield were studied by vera et al 2013 in a five year field experiment using drip irrigation the authors concluded that fruit yield was more affected by postharvest deficit irrigation than pre harvest deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation reduced the number of fruits per tree more than the fruit size was reduced in a different deficit irrigation study in spain on peaches falagan et al 2015 found that postharvest deficit irrigation guided by pre determined maximum daily trunk shrinkage values as indicators of water stress led to variable differences in fruit vitamin and phenolic contents as compared to the full irrigation treatment wang and gartung 2010 and zhang et al 2017 reported consistently higher canopy temperature when postharvest deficit irrigation was applied and differences between midday canopy and air temperature were used as benchmarks for irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation is also used in other tree crops in a five year study on citrus trees gasque et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation when stem water potential was maintained above 2 0 mpa had no significant effect on yield and fruit quality with up to 27 water savings they also found that trees under deficit irrigation showed a fast recovery and reached full hydration one week after restarting irrigation egea et al 2013 in a six year field study reported that almond kernel yield was proportionally reduced after imposing moderate to severe deficit irrigation up to 30 of the full irrigation amount intrigliolo et al 2013 in a seven year study reported reduced fruit set and yield in a japanese plum under prolonged deficit irrigation despite of the large number of studies reported on deficit irrigation there is a lack of knowledge on the cumulative effect of prolonged deficit irrigation on tree health and productivity the objective of this 10 year study was to determine the feasibility of long term postharvest deficit irrigation in an early ripening peach variety and the effects on marketable fruit yield fruit quality and tree health 2 material and methods 2 1 study site experimental design and irrigation scheduling the study was carried out from june 2005 to june 2015 in a 1 6 ha mature peach orchard located near parlier california usa the soil at the study site is a hanford fine sandy loam classified as coarse loamy mixed thermic typic xerorthents with low organic matter content the trees were early ripening crimson lady prunus persica l batsch peach on nemaguard rootstock planted in april 1999 with a tree spacing of 1 8 m within the row and 4 9 m between tree rows because of the close within row spacing the trees were maintained with two primary branches in a v shaped configuration perpendicular to the tree row direction and to maximize light interception dejong et al 1994 this peach variety blooms in february march fruit sets were commercially thinned each spring and marketable fruits were harvested at the end of may tree canopy was pruned annually during winter dormancy by commercial contractors the orchard was divided into replicated irrigation blocks which were subjected to drip furrow or jet microsprinkler irrigation methods with or without deficit treatment the experimental design was a randomized block with six replications within each main block or replication six sub treatment blocks were randomly assigned and designated as drip full irrigation df drip deficit irrigation dd furrow full irrigation ff furrow deficit irrigation fd sprinkler full irrigation sf and sprinkler deficit irrigation sd therefore a total of 36 sub treatment blocks were used in this study each sub treatment block consisted of three rows with eight trees per row and the middle six trees in the center row were used for data collection drip deficit irrigation was carried out from 2005 to 2015 except for the harvest year of 2010 and 2012 when no deficit was applied in any irrigation treatment table 1 furrow deficit treatment was applied in harvest year 2008 2009 2013 2015 and sprinkler deficit applied in harvest year 2013 2015 as previously described in zhang et al 2017 furrow treatments were irrigated in 1 m wide 0 2 m deep and 9 8 m long v shaped furrows on both sides of the tree rows running parallel to the row and located 1 m furrow center from the tree trunks drip treatments were irrigated with drip tubing containing 0 002 m3 h 1 integral turbulent flow embedded emitters spaced 0 91 m apart geoflow charlotte nc two tubing laterals were used for each tree row one on each side at a distance of 1 m from the tree trunks jet microsprinkler treatments were applied with 40 l h 1 fanjet emitters with a 4 m diameter 230 spray pattern bowsmith inc exeter ca and located near the base of each tree irrigation amount was measured using turbine water meters model srii and w 120 invensys metering systems uniontown pa the study area has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool winters each year irrigation was initiated around mid march and continued through november all trees received uniform irrigation matching the full crop evapotranspiration or etc requirement during early growing season up to harvest irrigation scheduling timing and amount was based primarily on estimated etc using the fao crop coefficient method e g multiplying theoretical potential or reference evapotranspiration with a plant dependent crop coefficient value to determine etc for a particular crop at a particular growth stage doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 abrisqueta et al 2013 irrigation scheduling was adjusted based on methods of irrigation e g furrow vs drip vs jet microsprinkler and respective plant stem water potential and soil water content readings 2 2 soil and tree water status soil water content was measured weekly during the summer postharvest season with a neutron probe model 503dr hydroprobe cpn international inc 2830 howe road martinez ca for the furrow and micro sprinkler plots galvanized steel access tubes were installed in the tree row for the drip irrigation plots access tubes were installed in the tree row and also at 1 m away from the tree rows the reason was to capture spatial differences in water distribution because the drip lines were at 1 m from tree rows readings were made at 15 45 75 105 135 cm depths the neutron probe was calibrated with volumetric soil samples taken from 15 135 cm depths in the study field in 2012 the neutron probe readings were transferred to volumetric soil water content with the calibration equation n 30 r2 0 98 for each measurement set average soil water content was computed for the top 1 5 m soil profile for each irrigation plot during the postharvest season mid day stem water potential was measured weekly or bi weekly from both the full and deficit irrigation blocks using a pressure chamber model 3000 1412 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca stem water potential is considered a useful indicator for plant water status in peaches abrisqueta et al 2015 measurements were made between 1200 and 1400 h local time following the procedures described in mccutchan and shackel 1992 briefly total hermetic aluminum foil bags were placed on each leaf at least 2 h before taking stem water potential measurements six measurements per plot were taken from the middle three trees two leaves per tree of the center row 2 3 tree trunk canopy size and photosynthesis to evaluate tree response to irrigation treatments tree trunk diameter was measured with a caliper from 2006 to 2008 during winter dormancy december january six trees from the center row of each irrigation plot for a total of 216 trees were measured each year leaf area index was measured in june 2015 with a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor 4647 superior street lincoln ne usa readings were made using the ¼ circle aperture cover looking west taken at 15 30 cm above the ground surface from the harvest row to the border row a set of five above canopy readings were made outside the orchard followed by within orchard readings of each set of irrigation treatment the process was repeated 15 times photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor 4647 superior street lincoln ne usa in april 2015 when tree canopy had been fully established for each irrigation plot readings were made from 1000 to 1500 h local time using three sunlit and three shaded leaves respectively three replications were used for each irrigation treatment therefore nine readings were obtained for each irrigation treatment for sunlit and shaded leaves respectively 2 4 yield yield metrics and water use efficiency fruit yield was measured each year from 2006 to 2015 from each irrigation plot marketable sized fruits were picked by a local commercial harvesting crew following typical farming procedures the timing of harvest was also determined by the commercial contractor for ripeness a total of two to three picks were used during each season with each pick about three to seven days apart for each experimental plot the middle six trees of the center row were used for yield determination measured yield parameters were fruit weight and number of fruit per tree water use efficiency wue was computed as the ratio of marketable fruit yield y divided by the total amount of irrigation and rain ir for the entire 12 months from the previous year s harvest to the current year s harvest or irrigation and rain received for the 3 months in the current season leading to harvest march 1 to may 31 1 w u e y i r 3 12 2 5 fruit quality fruit physical quality was determined by counting the number of peaches with doubles deep sutures external splits dimples deformations and split pits every year the measurements were made by randomly selecting 50 fruits from each pick each year from each of the six replications for each irrigation treatment two to three picks were used for each year s harvest therefore 600 900 fruits were used from each plot for physical quality assessment data from 2012 to 2015 were presented to show the long term impact of deficit irrigation and methods of irrigation on fruit physical quality fruit chemical quality was determined for the 2015 harvest by randomly selecting 10 fruits per plot for assessment of skin color flesh firmness soluble solids ph and titratable acidity of fruit juice within two weeks of storage at 1 c as described in zhang et al 2017 fruit skin color was measured by a handheld chroma meter cr 400 konica minolta japan a slice of skin of each fruit was removed and flesh firmness was measured with a penetrometer and recorded as pounds force and converted to newtons n two pieces of each fruit were removed and juiced using a juice processer to form a composite juice sample for each treatment a few drops of peach juice were tested for soluble solids concentration with a handheld brix refractometer atago inc wa usa titratable acidity and ph were measured by titrating a 5 g sample of juice diluted with 50 ml of deionized water using 0 1 n naoh to an endpoint of 8 1 ph using tim 850 titration radiometer analytical workstation radiometer analytical sas france two picks were made in 2015 with the second pick at seven days later and fruit quality were analyzed seperately for each pick total phenolics concentrations in the peach fruit were measured using the folin ciocalteu reagent assay stushnoff et al 2008 briefly 5 ml of 80 acetone were added to 0 5 g of dried sample in triplicate samples were vortexed in the dark for 1 h at 4 c to allow complete extraction the supernatant was used to measure concentration of total phenolics on microplates at 756 nm total phenols concentration was standardized against gallic acid and expressed as mg gallic acid per 100 g fresh fruit 2 6 statistical analysis statistical comparisons were made between different irrigation methods and deficit irrigation treatments for each year data were analyzed by analysis of variance anova test using glm model sas institute 2003 means were separated at the 0 05 level using the tukey s studentized range test hsd 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation evapotranspiration and water balance the long term average annual precipitation in the study area is about 300 mm during the study period only 3 out of the 11 years received a total annual precipitation that reached the long term average the remaining 8 years were all below or drastically below the annual average precipitation fig 1 except a wet year in 2010 440 mm from 2007 to 2015 there was an 8 year drought with an average annual rainfall of 181 mm or 40 below average because of the mediterranean climate all precipitation in the central valley of california is in the form of rainfall and the monthly rainfall distribution shows that nearly all the annual precipitation is received from november to april when all deciduous trees including peaches are mostly in dormancy for the growing season april to october there is virtually no precipitation daily water loss by evapotranspiration or crop evapotranspiration etc was determined by multiplying the daily crop coefficient kc value with the reference or potential evapotranspiration value eto 2 e t c k c e t o the kc values for the peach growing season used in this study were based on the piece wise linear function developed from a lysimeter study by johnson et al 2005 the daily eto values were obtained from a nearby weather station cimis 2015 as shown in fig 2 during the growing season kc increased linearly from day of year doy 60 to doy 187 then remained constant at 1 20 until doy 305 a constant small value of 0 1 was used for

e t o t d t whereas the annual etc ranged from 1045 mm in 2006 to 1253 in 2008 the monthly etc distribution patterns are very similar from year to year with a maximum monthly etc of about 250 mm always occurred in july the highest three month etc values were found in june july august and the cumulative etc from june to december accounted for 80 of the annual etc this type of monthly plant water use pattern demonstrates the greatest potential for achieving the most water savings using postharvest deficit irrigation field water balance was computed for each irrigation treatment as the difference between the sum of irrigation and rain water received minus etc for the period a january 1 may 31 and b june 1 december 31 for each year fig 4 as shown clearly in the figure all irrigation treatments in period a showed positive values for nearly all 11 years of the experiment while period b for the deficit irrigation treatments exhibited mostly negative values the maximum deficit based on the water balance assessment reached 400 to 600 mm of water in 7 seasons in the drip 2 seasons in the furrow and 4 seasons in the jet microsprinkler treatment plots the water balance values during period b of the deficit treatments were based on trees transpiring at their maximum potential however the actual etc was most likely smaller than the calculated etc because of reduced transpiration rate created by water stress induced stomatal control an option to account for reduced etc derived from water stress under deficit irrigation was to use a crop coefficient stress factor as proposed in allen 2000 however the determination of such stress factor requires real time on site etc measurements when plants are under water stress other method of irrigation scheduling for early season peaches include trunk diameter shrinkage conejero et al 2007 2010 2011 soil water content ruiz sanchez et al 2018 or capacitance probes abrisqueta et al 2010 3 2 cumulative irrigation and irrigation effect on soil water content and stem water potential seasonal cumulative irrigation for 2012 2014 can be seen in fig 5 each year irrigation started around mid march and continued through november the amount of water applied up to harvest by end of may was 384 325 and 265 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively and the three irrigation methods received virtually the same amount of water during each year up to harvest deficit irrigation was initiated after harvest and the final amount of water applied by mid october including water applied from march to harvest time was in general approximately 50 for the deficit treatments relative to the full irrigation treatments specifically in 2012 the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit treatments received 56 39 and 51 of that received by the respective full irrigation treatments in 2013 the deficit drip furrow and jet microsprinkler treatments received 55 70 and 68 of the respective full irrigation treatments because of a failed electronic control device an unintended large irrigation event for the jet microsprinkler system occurred over a weekend in mid july in 2014 the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit treatments received 53 56 and 54 of that received by the respective full irrigation treatments the amount of applied water for the full irrigation treatment was different between irrigation methods i e drip vs furrow vs jet microsprinkler this was caused by irrigation scheduling decisions being made by not only the estimated etc but also site specific plant and soil water status measurements such as stem water potential and soil water content readings consistent with the cumulative irrigation received average volumetric soil water content in the plant root zone showed overall higher readings in the full than in the deficit irrigation plots fig 6 in 2012 average soil water content in the full irrigation plots decreased slightly from 18 in early june to approximately 12 in september october whereas in the deficit plots there was a steep decrease to approximately 5 occurring from june to august in 2013 and 2014 similar overall trends were observed where initial soil water content was approximately 18 in june and decreased overtime to 5 10 in the deficit plots by august or september however the deficit jet microsprinkler plot in 2013 showed a sharp increase in mid july due to the one time unintended large irrigation event and the furrow deficit plot in 2014 exhibited relative high soil water content 15 until after august when it started to decrease to about 7 by late september the high irrigation amount in furrow and jet microsprinkler full irrigation plots in 2013 and full furrow treatment in 2014 fig 5 was able to maintain the soil water content unchanged or even slightly higher up to 20 than that at harvest throughout the postharvest season the temporal soil water distribution patterns clearly indicated the enhanced root water uptake for making up the shortfalls in applied water in the deficit irrigation treatments when the soil water content reached as low as 5 by volume the corresponding matric potential would be at approximately 250 kpa based on the in situ soil water retention data from wang et al 2011 at this potential range plant roots would still be able to extract soil water but would require significantly higher energy in the full irrigation treatment where soil water content was at 18 the corresponding matric potential would be at approximately 20 kpa or no water stress would be expected the ability of peach trees for mining water from the soil profile under deficit irrigation has also been shown in previous studies by johnson et al 1992 and girona et al 1993 and in almond trees by goldhamer et al 2006 and lópez lópez et al 2018 stem water potential swp in the postharvest season showed similar trends as in the soil water content measurements where consistently higher values were observed in the full irrigation than in the deficit irrigation treatments fig 7 swp values in the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler full irrigation treatments remained reasonably close in all three years a slight decreasing trend was found in 2012 from 0 7 mpa in early june to 1 1 mpa in mid september and in 2014 from 0 7 mpa in early june to 1 0 mpa in mid september swp in the full irrigation treatments remained nearly unchanged in 2013 at 0 75 mpa during the postharvest season as expected swp values in the drip furrow and jet microsprinkler deficit irrigation treatments showed lower values than in the full irrigation plots in 2012 swp in the deficit jet microsprinkler plot reached the lowest value of 2 33 mpa on september 21 in 2013 the drip deficit plot showed consistently lower swp readings than the deficit furrow and jet microsprinkler plots this trend is consistent with the soil water content measurements fig 6 because of the lowest amount of water applied in this treatment as shown in fig 5 in 2014 lowest swp values were found in the deficit jet microsprinkler plot i e 2 17 mpa on september 12 the relatively smaller variations in swp than in soil water content shows the ability of trees functioning as an integrator of external effects such as sustained water stress during the deficit irrigation experiment reponses of swp to any short term perturbations such as individual irrigation event or diurnal variations in water stress would not be as sensitive as the direct soil water measurements goldhamer et al 1999 remorini and massai 2003 3 3 fruit yield quality and water use efficiency total amount of water received leading up to harvest in the previous 12 and 3 months marketable peach fruit yield yield metrics and water use efficiency under different irrigation regimes are shown for each year for the 11 year field study table 1 for the first two seasons of the study there was no significant difference in fruit yield number of fruit per tree or fruit weight among the different irrigation treatments despite a 59 in 2006 and 65 in 2007 reduction in total water received in 12 mo between the deficit drip and full drip irrigation treatments there was no significant difference in yield or yield parameters in the 2005 2006 season despite a 75 reduction in total water received between the deficit drip irrigation and the furrow full irrigation treatment yield and all other yield parameters still remained not significantly different lower marketable fruit yield at p 0 05 was found in deficit than in the full drip irrigation plots in 2008 2014 and 2015 for furrow lower yields were found in 2011 2014 and 2015 for the jet microsprinkler treatment significantly lower yield was only found in 2014 the results on fruit yield appear to indicate that for the same irrigation method up to 60 deficit irrigation did not cause significant yield reduction for 8 9 years regardless of the methods of irrigation fig 8 until significant yield differences were found in 2014 and 2015 harvests no information can be found in the literature for deficit irrigation of peach trees for more than 5 years for cyclic drought events in the region that last 3 5 years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the practice of deficit irrigation would appear to be a plausible strategy to mitigate the lack of available fresh water for irrigation purposes without causing drastic yield losses in the early season peach varieties fruit yield under full drip irrigation was lower than that under furrow full irrigation in 2014 and 2015 table 1 this effect was likely attributed to the lower amount of postharvest irrigation received in the drip than in the furrow the finding also indicates that over time up to about 10 years differences in soil wetting patterns as related to methods of irrigation might have led to a cumulative effect on tree productivity drip irrigated plots would have the least wetting volume in the soil which over time would limit root growth because of the smaller wetting zones compared to furrow irrigation jet microsprinkler irrigation on the other hand creates a wetting pattern that has relatively more uniform coverage over the orchard floor root distribution under jet microsprinklers would also be more diffuse thus less likely to limit water uptake from a limited soil volume however the depth of wetting from micro sprinkler irrigation would not be as deep as in the drip or furrow irrigation effect of irrigation on tree root distribution has been reported for peaches abrisqueta et al 2008 almonds koumanov et al 2006 and citrus bevington and castle 1985 however the overall marketable fruit yield from the experimental period of 2006 2015 did not cause significant differences between the three different irrigation methods number of fruit per tree was found lower for the deficit than for the full irrigation treatments for all three irrigation methods in 2014 and only for drip in 2015 table 1 reduction in fruit set and final yield were reported in a japanese plum after seven seasons of continuous deficit irrigation intrigliolo et al 2013 fruit size or weight per fruit was also found lower for the deficit than for the full irrigation treatments for drip in 2008 and 2009 and for furrow in 2009 2014 and 2015 the fruit weight reduction in drip deficit treatment in 2008 and 2009 was attributed to the severe irrigation reduction i e 41 in 2005 2006 35 in 2006 2007 and 36 in 2007 2008 of the full irrigation treatment reduced fruit size would have a tangible impact on the market value of the fruit as they are sold for fresh eating the timing of harvest often has more impact on the market value because higher prices may be attained when other peaches are not available in addition to the irrigation effect there were year to year changes in yield fruit number and size this was partially attributed to year to year variations in weather conditions lopez et al 2007 and orchard management practices such as fruit thinning and off season pruning as reported in other studies such as vera et al 2013 wue was in general in the range of 2 4 kg m3 of water received in 12 mo from harvest to harvest table 1 also lower wue values were generally found for full irrigation and higher values for deficit irrigation treatments the value increased to 4 10 kg m3 when only considering the total water received in 3 mo in the same year leading up to harvest however there was virtually no difference in wue between full and deficit irrigation treatments because the amount of water received was nearly the same in the same year prior to harvest this effect or lack of effect on yield responses can also be depicted when yield or relative yield is plotted against the total water received irrigation plus rain for the 3 months prior to harvest results not shown also there is no clear trend on yield response to total water received in the 12 mo period from previous year harvest to current year harvest however the relative yield normalized to the maximum yield for each year appears to show reduced variability when higher amounts of water are received physical quality of peach fruit showed no significant difference in amounts of deep sutures external splits dimples or split pits among treatments table 2 similar to findings by johnson et al 1992 there was higher occurrence of doubles in the deficit than in the full irrigation plots however the total percentage of doubles was less than 1 5 less deformed fruits were found in the drip full irrigation treatment than in the deficit drip treatment the shape of the fruit also possesses aesthetics values for marketing purposes except for external splits in general there were significant differences in these physical properties between harvest years from 2012 to 2015 for example regardless of the methods of irrigation or amounts of irrigation 9 10 fruits were found deformed in 2012 and 2015 which were much higher than the 0 6 1 6 value found in 2013 2014 the annual variations in these physical properties were likely attributable to weather orchard management disease and pest factors fruit color measurements showed lower lightness in furrow full irrigation than in furrow deficit treatment table 3 differences in lightness between and full and deficit treatment for drip and jet microsprinkler irrigation were not significant higher chrome value was found for the jet microsprinkler deficit treatment than the drip and furrow treatments higher hue angle was found in the drip and furrow full irrigation than in the jet microsprinkler deficit treatment these color metrics were similar to values reported for a late season peach montero prado et al 2011 no difference was found for fruit firmness between the respective full and deficit irrigation treatments however fruits under drip irrigation either full or deficit were firmer than fruits under furrow irrigation the total soluble solids was 12 ph was 3 6 malic acid 0 5 these values are comparable to those reported in the literature for peach fernandez et al 2009 but there was no difference among different irrigation methods or amounts of irrigation total phenolics in peach fruit averaged 20 mg gallic acid 100 g fruit and there was no difference among different irrigation treatments harvest timing had a significant effect on fruit color chrome and hue angle firmness and solids content the second pick at 7 days after the first pick showed lower values for these parameters table 3 which indicates a consequence of ripening of the fruit as a similar effect was observed for peach fruit in postharvest storage montero prado et al 2011 3 4 tree growth and physiological function methods of irrigation and amounts of irrigation both had an effect on tree growth as shown in trunk diameter table 4 in general trees under full irrigation grew faster or had larger trunks than trees under deficit irrigation the difference in trunk diameter between full and deficit irrigation became significant in 2007 and 2008 for drip and only in 2008 for furrow for jet microsprinkler treatments the difference in trunk diameter between full and deficit irrigation was significant in all three years when measurements were made i e 2006 2008 furthermore it appears that drip and furrow irrigation favors trunk growth more than jet microsprinkler irrigation because the trunk diameter was greater later in the years 2015 however the effect of methods and amounts of irrigation on tree canopy size measured as leaf area index or lai showed no clear trend it should be noted that lai is a measure of the entire canopy size branches and leaves whereas trunk diameter is simply the size of the trunk the two parameters are related but not necessarily strongly correlated because of canopy management through pruning pruning likely would have a stronger effect on lai then on truck size nonetheless it is possible that tree growth in the woody tissue would cease or significantly slowed down so that the cumulative effect of deficit irrigation or methods of irrigation diminished over time tree function depicted herein as photosynthetic rate and leaf stomatal conductance did not indicate a cumulative treatment effect from the 10 year long experiment on methods of irrigation and deficit irrigation data not shown as expected in general sunlit leaves showed much higher activities in the photosynthetic process than the shaded leaves demonstrated as higher photosynthetic rates and leaf stomatal conductance values 4 conclusions the 10 year long field study compared furrow drip and jet microsprinkler irrigation under either full or deficit irrigation treatments on peach tree health soil and plant water dynamics and fruit yield and quality in general fruit yield and quality did not show significant differences between the three methods of irrigation used in the study however there were some differences in fruit color and firmness among irrigation methods deficit irrigation of up to 40 water reduction did not lead to significant yield losses for 8 9 years this finding highlights the unrealized potential of the long recognized concept of deficit irrigation as an on farm management strategy in greatly increasing water use efficiency the amount of water saved from the postharvest deficit irrigation can be a significant source for other crops or for non agriculture uses during the critical peak water use season june september the verifiable negative impact of deficit irrigation was an increase on number of fruit doubles which would reduce its value however the total percentage of doubles in the worst case was less than 1 5 the year to year variability of fruit yield and quality was greater than those between the irrigation treatments for the same year future research could investigate the interactive effect of irrigation management orchard management and weather declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
