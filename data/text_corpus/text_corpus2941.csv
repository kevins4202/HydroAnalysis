target pollutants keywords biochar peroxymonosulfate active sites dissolved organic matters inhibition mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction persulfate advanced oxidation processes ps aops are recently recognized as one of the most attractive strategies for decomposition of refractory organic contaminants in water chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2023 wang et al 2022c ye et al 2020 dissolved organic matters dom a mixture of complex organic compounds exist ubiquitously in aquatic environment such as river water landfill leachate yuan et al 2017 secondary effluents zhang et al 2021b and chemical wastewater zhang et al 2019a their presence in those waters will induce significant effects in ps aops on wastewater treatment and the influence needs to gain intensive attentions especially in practical applications for evaluation of treatment efficiency and environmental impacts in general dom exhibit considerable inhibition effects on other organic contaminant degradation in aops cao et al 2020 ghauch et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 varanasi et al 2018 the inhibitory effects of dom are mainly through adsorption and competition to consume reactive radicals thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of target contaminants cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021c typically the scavenging effect of background dom is based on its reactivity with radical species varanasi et al 2018 additionally dom could be complexed with metals to form organometallic complexes and inhibit redox processes ye et al 2020 notably new pathways for dom to inhibit the degradation of organic pollutants have been identified in recent studies namely dom could reduce the transformation of intermediate radicals of organic pollutants back to their parent compounds canonica and schonenberger 2019 cheng et al 2022 for given dom of concern studies have mainly focused on the inhibition to target organic degradation and the organic degradation mechanisms during ps aops cheng et al 2022 guan et al 2018 guan et al 2013 interestingly dom molecules are simultaneously degraded and transformed into intermediates during the aops zhang et al 2021b while few studies have been reported on dom decomposition and evolution currently electrospray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms with unprecedented ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy is essential to characterize the composition of complicated dom and intermediate molecules phungsai et al 2018 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 however the dom changes in molecular composition and properties and their effects on organic pollutant degradation in a ps aop system remain elusive largely moreover fewer studies have been so far reported on the inhibition degrees of antibiotic degradation in water by dom at the molecular level and the corresponding mechanisms notably clarifying the dom decomposition process might contribute to identifying the types of conversion intermediates at different oxidation time intervals and elucidating the possible decomposition pathways of dom besides various ros have different redox potentials triggering different oxidation pathways of dom du et al 2023 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a the types and concentrations of reactive species existed in different systems lead to different intermediates production after dom conversion the intermediates with varying structures have different abilities to compete with the target pollutant for the oxidative species resulting in different inhibition degrees towards pollutant degradation thus investigation of the roles of dom decomposition and intermediates in contaminant degradation would be essential in this study the effect of dom from a municipal secondary effluent on a peroxymonosulfate pms based aop was comprehensively investigated using dairy manure digestate derived biochar dmdb 800 for pms activation toward antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx degradation the molecular composition and conversion intermediates of dom at different oxidation intervals were inspected and determined in depth by ft icr ms meanwhile the relationship between the dom molecular composition and smx degradation was established the alteration of intermediates from dom transformation and the inhibition degree of pollutant degradation by the different dom intermediates were identified the basic information could provide references for the rational regulation of ros composition and dom conversion process in a pms system this in turn offered theoretical guidance to minimize the interference of dom conversion intermediates on pms activation and target pollutants degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemical reagents used in this work were listed in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 sources of secondary effluent and dmdb 800 preparation a secondary effluent sample was collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china the inorganic ions in the secondary effluent were cl no2 and so4 2 with concentrations of 326 16 and 288 mg l respectively also the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in the secondary effluent was 51 30 mg l before experiments the effluent was filtered with 0 45 µm filter membranes and stored in glass bottles at 4 c solid dairy manure digestate fermented at medium temperature for 35 d was placed in a tube furnace and kept at 800 for 2 h details of dmdb 800 preparation were reported before y wang et al 2022c besides in order to determine the possible dissolved carbon from a carbon based catalyst the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured after adding 1 0 g l of dmdb 800 catalyst and stirring for 60 min in the ion containing solution the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was detected as 0 57 mg l with 1 0 g l of dmdb 800 in the ion containing solution the doc concentration was almost unchanged in secondary effluent with or without dmdb 800 51 3 mg l consequently most dissolved carbon was obtained from the secondary effluent rather than the catalyst besides we further concluded that the weak dissolved carbon from dmdb 800 exerted a negligible effect on the activation of pms in ion containing solutions text s2 2 3 dmdb 800 activity evaluation and characterizations the prepared dmdb 800 was applied for catalytic oxidation of smx with pms and the effect of dom from the secondary effluent on smx degradation efficiency was comprehensively examined in a typical procedure 0 1 g of dmdb 800 was dispersed into 100 ml of secondary effluent water with 15 mg l smx in a 200 ml glass beaker with continuous stirring at 25 afterward a certain volume of pms 0 6 mm was injected into the mixed solution to trigger smx decomposition a sample 1 0 ml was extracted from the system at regular intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane excess na2s2o3 was employed to quench the reaction subsequently the concentration of smx in the mixture was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 2030 c shimadzu with a c18 column and a uv detector at 264 nm the mobile phase and gradient elution procedures were reported in our previous studies wang et al 2022c yu et al 2021 pms concentration was determined by a spectrophotometric method zhu et al 2019 specifically the sample was injected to the mixture containing nahco3 and ki the solution was detected after 20 min by an uv vis spectrophotometer at 352 nm the dmdb 800 was semi quantitatively analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific the reactive oxygen species ros were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr e 500 bruker 2 4 esi ft icr ms measurement and analysis the collected samples were first filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane followed by acidification to ph 2 with hcl then dom solid phase extraction was performed by agilent bond elut ppl cartridges the dom eluate was analyzed by ft icr ms solarix bruker equipped with an esi source at 4 0 kv in a negative ionization mode the molecular formula assignment was performed by matlab algorithm detailed information was presented in text s3 and text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic activity of dmdb 800 in different media the performance of dmdb 800 on pms activation in different media deionized di water ion containing solution and secondary effluent containing dom was firstly evaluated for smx degradation fig 1a an ion containing solution without dom was prepared based on the anion information of the secondary effluent as depicted in fig 1a 44 3 of smx was degraded by pms alone in secondary effluent within 60 min which was slightly higher than that in di water 42 0 the dmdb 800 pms system in the secondary effluent realized smx removal efficiency at 84 8 within 60 min interestingly the smx removal was elevated to 98 1 in the ion containing solution cl no2 and so4 2 without dom comparatively dmdb 800 exhibited a less catalytic activity in di water achieving smx degradation at 77 7 in 60 min clearly the co existing ions in the secondary effluent might facilitate smx degradation it was reported that little inhibition could occur for no2 and so4 2 li et al 2020 wang et al 2022b wang et al 2022c however the presence of cl could induce the production of large amounts of hocl and cl2 with a high oxidation capacity promoting contaminant degradation wang et al 2022b additionally the reaction of cl and pms results in the production of hocl which could degrade contaminant directly as illustrated in fig 1b smx degradation profiles were fitted well by the pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 with high correlation coefficients r2 0 92 specifically the higher k value of smx degradation in ion containing solution might also be related to the reversible reaction between cl and so4 or oh oyekunle et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the cl could react with so4 to yield cl and cl2 eqs 2 and 3 which could be transformed to oh via eqs 4 and 5 besides the existence of hclo in the system could be further decomposed to generate 1o2 eq 6 a similar conclusion has been confirmed by zhang et al who found that increasing the cl concentration from 1 to 50 mm the steady state concentration of dominant 1o2 was raised from 1 15 10 10 m to 4 48 10 10 m further facilitating the degradation of pollutants zhang et al 2021e also hclo has been demonstrated to react with pms to produce 1o2 eq 7 accelerating the degradation process oyekunle et al 2021 thus the available cl could be converted to other ros 1o2 and free radicals instead of only chlorine species eventually affecting pollutant degradation 1 ln c c 0 k t where t is the reaction time k is the first order kinetic rate constant c and c0 are the smx concentrations at different reaction time and beginning respectively 2 cl so4 cl so4 2 3 cl cl cl2 4 cl oh hocl 5 hocl oh cl 6 2hclo 1o2 h cl 7 2hso5 2hclo 1o2 2h2o 2cl 2so4 2 besides fig s1 presented the pms consumption with smx addition in different media without dmdb 800 the concentration of pms was reduced by 9 74 in the ion containing solution without dom the consumption of pms was slightly increased 12 47 in the secondary effluent with dom suggesting that dom might be barely involved in pms activation process the k values of smx degradation by dmdb 800 pms in different media at various periods were also calculated as exhibited in fig s2 the k value in the ion containing solution was 0 0918 0 009 min 1 within 0 5 min with prolonging reaction time the k value declined to 0 0644 0 005 0 0638 0 004 and 0 0499 0 003 min 1 within 5 20 20 40 and 40 60 min of oxidation respectively a similar trend was observed in the secondary effluent and the k values at different reaction time were all lower than those in the ion containing solution clearly the presence of dom inhibited the smx degradation 3 2 variation of active sites and identification and contribution of reactive oxygen species ros the surface properties of dmdb 800 biochar before and after the reaction were investigated all the dmdb 800 samples were composed of c o and n elements fig 2a four peaks were deconvoluted from the xps c1s spectra fig s3a assigning to the cc c c at 284 8 ev coh c n at 285 4 ev co c at 286 2 ev and c o at 288 5 ev ho et al 2019 wang et al 2022c three peaks in n1s spectra fig s3b could be identified as pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n at 398 4 399 9 and 401 2 ev respectively qi et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2022c the o1s spectra fig s3c were divided into three peaks with binding energies of 531 0 532 6 and 533 3 ev corresponding to c o o c o and c o respectively liang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the relative contents of coh c o pyridinic n and graphitic n groups in the used dmdb 800 samples in ion containing solution and secondary effluent dropped markedly compared to those in fresh dmdb 800 fig 2b 2d suggesting they were involved in pms activation for dom degradation detailed information of active sites was presented in text s5 in the dmdb 800 pms system with co existing dom the active sites on catalyst surface might be covered inhibiting smx degradation besides the influence of dom on ros generation was further investigated using different quenching agents typically meoh was considered as an effective scavenger for both so4 k so 4 meoh 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 du et al 2020a whereas tert butanol tba was more sensitive to quench oh k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 k so 4 tba 4 105 m 1 s 1 cai et al 2021 yu et al 2019a in addition l histidine was capable of quenching oh so4 and 1o2 k oh l histidine 5 0 109 m 1s 1 k so 4 l histidine 2 5 106 m 1s 1 and k 1 o 2 l histidine 1 5 108 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 hence meoh tba and l histidine were employed to identify so4 oh and 1o2 species smx degradation efficiency in secondary effluent sample changed slightly after adding tba and meoh fig 3a correspondingly the rate constant of smx degradation declined from 0 0306 min 1 in the blank to 0 0305 and 0 0281 min 1 respectively clearly oh played minor role in dmdb 800 pms systems with dom from fig 3b the k values of smx degradation in ion containing solution in the presence of meoh and tba dropped by 0 38 and 0 23 times in comparison to the blank respectively obviously both so4 and oh participated in smx degradation with the co existence of l histidine the smx removal rates declined remarkably in both secondary effluent and ion containing solution suggesting the crucial role of 1o2 in the smx decomposition noticeably the degradation rate of smx in secondary effluent 15 66 was much lower than that in the ion containing solution 58 05 obviously 1o2 produced in dmdb 800 pms played a more dominant role in the secondary effluent than in the ion containing solution virtually the s n or p atom containing functional groups in dom tend to react with oh dong et al 2010 luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 the so4 prefers to directly attack amino amide and arene groups within dom compounds luo et al 2018 the occurrence of various reactions consumed more oh and so4 in the secondary effluent with dom inhibiting smx degradation subsequently the relative contribution of 1o2 to smx degradation was higher than that in ion containing solutions the k oh k so 4 and k 1 o 2 were calculated via eqs 8 11 the contribution of different ros in the different media was further evaluated via eqs 12 15 yu et al 2022 as shown in fig 3c the contributions of oh so4 and 1o2 in ion containing solution were determined as 23 41 14 31 and 53 17 respectively implying the dominant role of 1o2 in the case comparatively the contributions of oh so4 and other ros were 0 33 7 84 and 1 96 in the secondary effluent respectively showing oh so4 and other ross e g cl and cl2 exhibited weaker roles in the presence of dom noticeably the relative contribution of 1o2 raised to 89 87 implying its primary role in secondary effluent collectively 1o2 dominated in the smx degradation in the two different media by dmdb 800 pms while dom consumed more free radicals 8 k oh k 0 k 1 9 k so 4 k 1 k 2 10 k 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 11 k other ros k 3 12 λ oh k 0 k1 k 0 13 λ so4 k 1 k2 k 0 14 λ 1o2 k 2 k3 k 0 15 λ other ros k 3 k 0 where k 0 was the apparent rate constant of the pristine reaction without any scavenger k 1 k 2 and k 3 represented the apparent rate constants of smx degradation with the introduction of tba methanol and l histidine respectively among them k 0 k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 and k 3 represented apparent rate constants of smx degradation by oh so4 1o2 and other ros respectively 3 3 molecular composition and transformation of dom during catalytic oxidation the van krevelen vk diagram was applied to describe the molecular composition of dom in different samples with the classification criteria described in previous studies fu et al 2020a fu et al 2020b the vk plot can be divided into eight regions corresponding to carbohydrate aminosugars saturated compounds tannins lignins unsaturated hydrocarbons condensed aromatic structures and others fig s4 dom in secondary effluent was mainly composed of cho chos chon chons and p containing compounds such as chop chonp chonps etc which were the major subcategories in dom in general the chos and chon subcategories in secondary effluent were likely to originate from domestic waste excreta and household detergents zhang et al 2021b as presented in fig 4 fig s4 and table s2 the number and relative content of dom components changed obviously after different periods of oxidation in the dmdb 800 pms system the number of cho and chos subcategories exhibited an overall downward trend with prolonged reaction time fig 4a table s2 specifically the number of cho in the raw secondary effluent was 1056 about 1 30 1 33 1 56 and 1 75 times higher than those after 5 20 40 and 60 min of oxidation respectively similarly the number of chos decreased from 1002 to 723 at 5 min 521 at 20 min 556 at 40 min and 438 at 60 min of the catalytic reaction correspondingly the relative content of cho formulas was reduced from 32 94 to 4 52 after reactions for 60 min it can be inferred that cho compounds distributed in the lignins and condensed aromatic structure like regions might be destroyed vulnerably and transformed into other compounds meanwhile the depleted formulas during oxidation processes occupied the region of lower o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 0 5 1 2 values suggesting the compounds with double bonds or aromatic rings in a low oxidation state may be attacked by oxidative species zhang et al 2019b also a similar phenomenon was found for chon and chos formulas with their number decreasing from 546 to 1002 to 169 and 438 and relative percentage declining from 17 72 and 32 18 to 1 16 and 4 68 the removed n and s containing compounds were accumulated in the lignin like region the decreased number and percentage might imply a stronger reactivity of dom molecules containing n or s functional groups e g nh2 nh or s with free radicals zhang et al 2021d the concentration of dom is generally several orders of magnitude higher than that of smx in the actual effluent accordingly the dom could outcompete the smx for ros such as oh and so4 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2022 besides based on the variation of catalyst surface sites in different media in section 3 2 dom could block the active sites on the catalyst surface affecting the pms activation and ros production accordingly fewer oh and so4 radicals were involved in the oxidation process inhibiting the degradation of smx the results were also in good agreement with the reduced contribution of oh and so4 radicals to smx degradation in the secondary effluent however an opposite trend was observed for chons and chosp compounds in comparison with the raw secondary effluent 228 and 7 93 the number and proportion of chons rose to 396 and 65 60 249 and 52 31 369 and 67 22 as well as 433 and 71 05 after 5 20 40 and 60 min of catalytic reaction respectively moreover the number and proportion of chosp were boosted from 52 to 1 45 in raw secondary effluent to 163 and 11 46 at 60 min clearly the elevated number and proportion were assumed to be oxidation or transformation products zhang et al 2019b also the newly formed n and s containing compounds during the oxidation were scattered in the tannins and condensed aromatic structure like regions with higher oxidation states generally hence chos and chon with a low oxidation degree o c 0 4 were more reactive during the oxidation process leading to the formation of highly oxidized molecules o c 0 7 besides no obvious change was observed in terms of the number and abundance of chonp and chonsp compounds in terms of compound classes lignins like compounds were the predominant fractions in all samples accounting for 65 03 78 51 of the total components fig 4b and fig s4 in general lignins like compounds are aromatics consisting of c h and o elements mainly containing phenol oh benzene ring and co luo et al 2022 yuan et al 2017 the oh could realize the addition of unsaturated c c bonds in aromatic compounds varanasi et al 2018 therefore lignins like compounds account for a larger proportion of the recalcitrant dom in secondary effluent the percentage of tannins compounds reached the maximum of 19 10 after reaction of 60 min in dmdb 800 pms system basically the percentage of carbohydrate molecules increased gradually with reaction time and reached a maximum value of 5 32 at 60 min the increased proportion of tannins and carbohydrates might be resistance to oxidation conversely the proportion of saturated compounds in raw secondary effluent was 11 20 higher than those samples treated for 5 1 22 20 3 37 40 3 77 and 60 min 2 02 similarly aminosugar compounds showed a decreasing trend with prolonged oxidation time as reported the saturated and aminosugar compounds are made up of organic substances or monomers containing carboxyl groups luo et al 2022 these compounds might be oxidized by oh to form acids with a lower molecular weight which could be further mineralized into co2 and h2o in the dmdb 800 pms system furthermore condensed aromatics are a group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that contain multiple benzene rings with high unsaturation the relative proportion of aromatic compounds reduced slightly during oxidation notably o c ratio of most molecules in dom was in the range of 0 1 0 8 but increases to 0 2 1 1 after reaction fig s5 suggesting the dom molecules were oxidized in the dmdb 800 pms system in order to better understand the intricate transformation of dom molecules the oxidation pathway of different dom compounds was further elucidated in the dmdb 800 pms system based on mass difference analysis figs 5 and s6 all dom compounds were identified to undergo oxidative decarbonization e g c2h2o c2h6 ch2 and co2 dehydrogenation 2h and dehydration reactions in addition compounds containing n and s elements witnessed deheteroatomisation e g nh no2 h so2 so3 sh2 hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions virtually some ros were more prone to attack some special structures or groups on dom for instance the s n or p atom containing functional groups in dom tends to react with oh via donate more electrons toward the neighboring ch bond and enhance the h atom abstraction dong et al 2010 luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 the so4 prefers to directly attack specific functional groups within dom compounds via an electron transfer pathway such as dom compounds with amino amide and arene groups etc luo et al 2018 the occurrence of various reactions consumed more oh and so4 inhibiting smx degradation 1o2 exhibited little dom scavenging f dom 0 5 because most 1o2 could naturally relax to the ground state triplet oxygen in water wilkinson et al 1995 yang et al 2022 besides the overall reaction rate constant for dom quenching of 1o2 was 0 41 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2022 which is several orders of magnitude lower than that of oh 108 109 m 1s 1 and so4 107 108 m 1s 1 keen et al 2014 lei et al 2022 therefore the degradation of smx by 1o2 was barely influenced by dom typically the total number of reactions followed the order of chos cho chon chons chosp chop chop chonp during the oxidation process all compounds except chonp mainly experienced ch2 2h c2h2o co2 and h2o reactions meanwhile the above reactions occurred more in cho than in other compounds during the four periods of oxidation furthermore nh and no2 h reactions were observed in chon chons and chonsp compounds the number of nh and no2 h reactions was larger in chon than that in chons and chosp compounds it was noticed that numerous desulfonation reactions such as sh2 so2 and so3 appeared primarily in chos rather than in chons chosp and chonsp compounds also hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions were recognized in chons chosp and chonsp in comparison with other compounds chonp participated in less reactions including no2 h c2h6 2h h2o and nh reactions notably the number of detectable precursor product pairs among almost all types of reactions was greater in 0 5 min than in other periods clearly the pre oxidation stage stimulated a considerable number of dom molecular transformation in comparison the number of detectable precursor product pairs was reduced markedly with the oxidation time over 5 min for cho compounds the number of c2h6 reactions occurring at different oxidation periods changed little conversely for chosp containing compounds the number of c2h2o c2h6 ch2 c2o 2h sh2 so2 and so3 reactions at 0 5 min were 10 1 8 4 18 3 6 and 5 separately which were lower compared to those occurred on other compounds the corresponding reaction number increased to 16 8 34 14 28 26 14 and 13 at prolonged oxidation time of 20 40 min as reported p containing heteroatoms were also more vulnerable to be attacked by oh due to the low electronegativity of p wang et al 2022a in terms of elementary composition chosp containing compounds occupied a minor proportion of 1 45 much lower than those containing cho 32 94 chos 32 18 chon 17 72 chons 7 93 etc in original secondary effluent the other compounds might outcompete the chosp containing compounds for ros also other compounds might encapsulate chosp containing compounds in their macromolecular structure thus reducing the sensitivity of chosp to ros during the initial 0 5 min phase of oxidation correspondingly the number of eight reactions was less at 0 5 min period for chosp afterwards more chosp were exposed with prolonged oxidation time triggering the great number of chosp transformations in addition the number of seven types of reactions no2 h nh ch2 2h c2h2o co2 and h2o decreased with the increasing oxidation time for chon compounds it was worth mentioning that the number of reactions occurring in chon declined dramatically within 5 60 min which was also observed in chos and chop compounds in consideration of the overall variation in molecular level properties intensity weighted averages wa were summarized in table 1 the relatively higher double bond equivalent dbewa 8 117 and lower o cwa 0 467 of the raw secondary effluent demonstrated that dom consisted of more unsaturated and less oxidized compounds du et al 2020b varanasi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b moreover the modified aromaticity index aimodwa also dropped slightly after different reaction oxidation time indicating unsaturated and aromatic compounds could be destroyed effectively during the oxidation process furthermore the oxidation degree of dom was elevated which was consistent with the increased o cwa value noticeably the h cwa value of dom in secondary effluent was higher than those after different oxidation time indicating the occurrence of dealkylation reactions e g ch2 and c2h6 occurred zhang et al 2021b the declined mwwa implied large size dom molecules were degraded into lower ones zhang et al 2019a to reflect the transformation of the unsaturated c c double bonds and carbon atom rings in dom during oxidation we calculated the molecular formula dbe the plots of dbe values versus the number of carbon atoms associated with the o c ratios were presented in fig 6 in general a lower number of carbon atoms and dbe value implied smaller molecular weight chain segments and less double bonds in compounds respectively du et al 2020b varanasi et al 2018 wei et al 2021 the amount of the red and orange spots 0 89 o c 1 1 with 0 17 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values was lower in raw secondary effluent compared to the samples after catalytic oxidation fig 6a in addition the number of blue and green spots 0 035 o c 0 73 with 20 30 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values was higher before oxidation it was reasonable to infer that the higher molecular weight compounds with lower oxidation degrees are dominant in the raw secondary effluent as the oxidation time was prolonged the red and orange spots 0 89 o c 1 1 with 0 17 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values increased apparently suggesting the production of components with a higher oxidation degree such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes bai et al 2022 wang et al 2020 as reported the k value for the reaction of oh with aliphatic compounds was approximately 109 m 1 s 1 higher than that of so4 k 109 m 1 s 1 varanasi et al 2018 as a result oh might react preferentially with aminosugars and saturated compounds leading to further oxidation varanasi et al 2018 besides some compounds with more than 20 dbe values and 17 30 carbon atoms were generated after oxidation by dmdb 800 pms revealing the increase of unsaturated compounds and cyclic structures wei et al 2021 interestingly the components with 20 30 carbon atoms and 11 15 dbe values disappeared with the oxidation time indicating the oxidation could reduce medium long chain compounds effectively wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 so4 radicals could induce transformation of aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbon components by single electron transfer destroying the components with 20 30 carbon atoms and 11 15 dbe values varanasi et al 2018 ye et al 2017 also oh could react quickly with some larger molecules of aliphatic chains containing more than 20 carbon atoms ruan et al 2021 in order to further understand the dom molecular transformation in dmdb 800 pms system the removed resistant and produced formulas at different oxidation time were compared as shown in fig 7a the removed compounds were distributed in the region with low o c 0 4 and h c 0 5 2 2 during 0 5 min oxidation corresponding to saturated compounds aminosugars and lignins like compounds with a low oxidation degree the resistant compounds mainly have o c from 0 3 to 0 6 and h c from 1 0 to 1 6 attributing to lignins like compounds besides most produced formulas of carbohydrates tannins condensed aromatics and lignins like compounds were scattered in regions with high o c 0 5 indicating an increase in carboxyl group yu et al 2019b the dmdb 800 pms system might decompose oxygen deficient substances preferentially and generate oxygen rich substances in the initial oxidation stage yuan et al 2017 in addition lignins like compounds were refractory components in dom while aminosugars and saturated compounds were decomposed more easily du et al 2020b after 5 20 min of treatment fig 7b the removed molecules were identified in the region with a higher o c value 0 6 clearly carbohydrates tannins and condensed aromatic structures with a high degree of oxidation could be removed effectively via dmdb 800 pms system also the majority of the produced formulas moved to 0 2 o c 0 4 and 0 7 h c 1 5 regions implying partial decomposition of lignins and possible formation of lignin phenols yu et al 2019b meanwhile lignins could be oxidized via radicals with ring opening ruan et al 2021 this matched well with the reduction of resistant formulas in the lignins like region the downward trend in the number of resistant formulas in lignins like regions was also observed in fig 7c d as the reaction time was further extended the removed and produced molecules span in a wider region notably the number of removed molecules declined significantly compared to those at 0 5 and 5 20 min suggesting that the removed molecules might be further decomposed apparently the variations of removed resistant and produced molecules meant that free radicals facilitated the transformation of dom compounds and the formation of refractory intermediates by dmdb 800 pms as shown in fig 8a within 0 5 min of reaction the removed and produced compounds were primarily located in the mw 300 and 400 mw 500 regions respectively obviously more fractions with a lower mw value 350 were decomposed forming compounds with a higher mw value by dmdb 800 pms preferentially in the subsequent 5 20 min fig 8b most of the removed compounds were in the range of mw 500 whereas the produced compounds were observed with mw 350 suggesting dom degradation oh could trigger criegee type reactions by breaking the aromatic ring in dom forming muconic type and aliphatic compounds with a lower mw wang et al 2017 also oh could induce dom transformation and generate smaller mw fractions such as aldehydes ketones alkenes and carboxylic acids ruan et al 2021 as the reaction time increased to 20 40 min the lower mw fractions 350 produced in the 5 20 min period were removed effectively and the new intermediates with a medium higher mw 350 were produced notably the regions with medium higher mw values 350 were occupied by the produced molecules dominantly during the reaction period of 40 60 min fig 8c comparatively the resistant molecules remained in the medium mw fractions region 350 mw 500 at different reaction time specifically most resistant molecules with lower h c 1 0 were eliminated with the extension of reaction time fig 8d indicating the resistant molecules with a higher aromaticity and or unsaturation degree could be further attacked by oh and so4 radicals zhang et al 2021d 3 4 mechanism of dom inhibition to smx degradation in general dom exhibits a strong scavenging ability towards oh so4 and cl species inhibiting smx degradation chlorine radicals could react with organics through chlorination single electron transfer set and hydrogen capture reactions among them chlorination is considered as the most likely pathway leading to the formation of chlorinated byproducts lei et al 2021 in general the reactions of chlorine addition usually existed in chlorination and uv chlorine based aops zhang et al 2021b in the dmdb 800 pms system the possible chlorine radicals in this system were mainly derived from the partial conversion of co existing cl chlorine radicals could be produced through reactions between oh or so4 and cl in dmdb 800 pms system notably the reversible reactions between oh so4 and cl and the reduction by oxidants might lead to low levels of chlorine radicals yang et al 2022 generally chlorine radicals could convert dom via addition and substitution reactions to generate chlorine containing products with high molecular weight zhang et al 2021b based on fticr ms analysis no chlorine containing molecular products were identified in dom conversion process in the dmdb 800 pms system hence chlorine radicals might play a little role in dom transformation process in this study to gain further insight into the effect of dom composition at a molecular level on smx degradation we established the potential correlations between the dom composition and inhibition of smx degradation in the dmdb 800 pms system the k values in the municipal secondary effluent and the ion containing solution represent the smx degradation rates in the presence and absence of dom respectively a linear fit was performed between the percentage of dom molecular composition and the difference in k values of smx degradation in the presence absence of dom at different oxidation intervals the obtained r2 values were presented in fig 9a another linear fit was performed between the percentage of dom compound composition and the difference in k values of smx degradation in the presence absence of dom at different oxidation intervals the corresponding fitting results were presented in fig s7 and s8 and the obtained r2 values were shown in fig 9b besides raw data on the k values of smx degradation with without dom at different oxidation intervals have been listed in fig s1 raw data on the percentage composition of dom molecules and compounds at different oxidation intervals have been supplemented in table s3 as depicted in fig 9 a positive correlation was shown in the blue area and a negative correlation was presented in the red area clearly cho chon chos chop and chonp presented a moderate positive correlation 0 5 r2 0 8 with the inhibition of smx degradation fig 9a demonstrating an apparent restriction to smx degradation by these molecules in dom also the percentage of cho chon chos chop and chonp declined with prolonged reaction time which resulted in the suppression of smx degradation via competition for free radicals in terms of compound classes fig 9b condensed aromatic and aminosugars compounds exhibited strong and moderate inhibition to smx degradation while n containing or n free saturated compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons showed low and weak inhibition text s6 si the possible mechanism of inhibition to smx degradation by dom was depicted in fig 10 oh could react with dom mostly by abstracting a hydrogen atom from a c h bond or addition to an aromatic ring in dom the h atom abstraction might preferentially target aliphatic compounds cho zhang et al 2021d besides s atoms with lower ionization potential could react with so4 via direct single electron transfer set also oh could interact with molecules containing s n or p atom groups in the aqueous phase forming 2σ 1σ two center three electron 2c 3e adducts minakata et al 2009 functional groups containing s n or p atom could donate more electrons to the neighboring c h bond enhancing the h atom abstraction by oh minakata et al 2009 hence oh also showed higher reactivity with molecules containing s n or p atom groups luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 generally most aromatic ring compounds with electron donating groups could react with not only so4 via set and addition with unsaturated c c double bond but also oh for aromatic ring addition varanasi et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017 notably the set reactions induced by so4 might have a faster rate compared to addition and h atom abstraction due to the lower energy barrier ye et al 2017 thus condensed aromatic structures might tend to capture so4 and oh in the dmdb 800 pms system aminosugars and saturated compounds containing carboxylic acid monomers could be oxidized into low molecular weight acids by oh readily luo et al 2022 thus aminosugars and saturated compounds exhibited less inhibition to smx degradation than condensed aromatic compounds unsaturated hydrocarbons accounting for only 0 10 of total dom in original effluent could be decomposed slightly with prolonged oxidation time more stable and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were produced consuming fewer free radicals potentially luo et al 2022 therefore the inhibition of smx degradation by unsaturated hydrocarbons could be ignored additionally the reduction of active sites such as graphitic n pyridinic n c o and co might be attributed to the presence of dom partially covering the sites on dmdb 800 surface overall dom inhibited the smx degradation in pms aop via blocking the actives sites on catalyst surface restraining ros production or quenching the ros 4 conclusions in the studied biochar activated pms system oh so4 1o2 and other reactive species e g chlorine containing radicals existed for the degradation of sulfonamide contaminants besides oh so4 and chlorine containing radicals were prone to oxidation reactions with dom in a secondary effluent leading to dom decomposition the presence of dom in the secondary effluent played a negative role in the degradation of sulfonamide contaminants in the heterogeneous pms activation system overall dom suppressed the smx degradation in pms aops by blocking the active sites on the catalyst surface inhibiting ros production besides pms systems with different compositions of reactive species at different oxidation intervals affect the dom conversion pathway oxidative decarbonation e g c2h2o c2h6 ch2 and co2 dehydrogenation 2h and dehydration reactions of dom compounds could occur in pms aop also deheteroatomization e g nh no2 h so2 so3 sh2 hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions were observed in compounds containing n and s elements the oxygen deficient o c 0 4 and low molecular weight substances mw 350 in dom were preferentially decomposed with oxygen rich o c 0 5 and high molecular weight substances mw 500 produced which were further degraded dom conversion will produce different intermediates the intermediates with different structures have different abilities to compete with the target pollutant for the oxidative species resulting in different inhibition degrees towards pollutant degradation the cho chon chos chop and chonp molecules inhibited smx degradation also the inhibition effect by condensed aromatic structural compounds was higher than that of aminosugars and saturated compounds this work investigated the roles of nom decomposition and intermediates with the aim of clarifying the types of transformation intermediates at different oxidation time intervals and elucidating the possible decomposition paths of dom also the alteration of dom transformation intermediates and the inhibition degree of pollutant degradation by different dom intermediates were determined various groups in dom can affect the contaminant degradation in pms aops via different routes thus the interactions among dom components active species and target pollutants are more important and need to be focused on notably dom might affect smx degradation both via covering sites and trapping free radicals however the primary inhibiting factor was not determined in our work which will be further investigated in the future work also the development of novel catalysts modulation of active sites on catalyst surface and optimization of active species in a ps system are also essential to reduce the inhibitory effect of dom on removal of target pollutants in

target pollutants keywords biochar peroxymonosulfate active sites dissolved organic matters inhibition mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction persulfate advanced oxidation processes ps aops are recently recognized as one of the most attractive strategies for decomposition of refractory organic contaminants in water chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2023 wang et al 2022c ye et al 2020 dissolved organic matters dom a mixture of complex organic compounds exist ubiquitously in aquatic environment such as river water landfill leachate yuan et al 2017 secondary effluents zhang et al 2021b and chemical wastewater zhang et al 2019a their presence in those waters will induce significant effects in ps aops on wastewater treatment and the influence needs to gain intensive attentions especially in practical applications for evaluation of treatment efficiency and environmental impacts in general dom exhibit considerable inhibition effects on other organic contaminant degradation in aops cao et al 2020 ghauch et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 varanasi et al 2018 the inhibitory effects of dom are mainly through adsorption and competition to consume reactive radicals thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of target contaminants cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021c typically the scavenging effect of background dom is based on its reactivity with radical species varanasi et al 2018 additionally dom could be complexed with metals to form organometallic complexes and inhibit redox processes ye et al 2020 notably new pathways for dom to inhibit the degradation of organic pollutants have been identified in recent studies namely dom could reduce the transformation of intermediate radicals of organic pollutants back to their parent compounds canonica and schonenberger 2019 cheng et al 2022 for given dom of concern studies have mainly focused on the inhibition to target organic degradation and the organic degradation mechanisms during ps aops cheng et al 2022 guan et al 2018 guan et al 2013 interestingly dom molecules are simultaneously degraded and transformed into intermediates during the aops zhang et al 2021b while few studies have been reported on dom decomposition and evolution currently electrospray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms with unprecedented ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy is essential to characterize the composition of complicated dom and intermediate molecules phungsai et al 2018 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 however the dom changes in molecular composition and properties and their effects on organic pollutant degradation in a ps aop system remain elusive largely moreover fewer studies have been so far reported on the inhibition degrees of antibiotic degradation in water by dom at the molecular level and the corresponding mechanisms notably clarifying the dom decomposition process might contribute to identifying the types of conversion intermediates at different oxidation time intervals and elucidating the possible decomposition pathways of dom besides various ros have different redox potentials triggering different oxidation pathways of dom du et al 2023 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a the types and concentrations of reactive species existed in different systems lead to different intermediates production after dom conversion the intermediates with varying structures have different abilities to compete with the target pollutant for the oxidative species resulting in different inhibition degrees towards pollutant degradation thus investigation of the roles of dom decomposition and intermediates in contaminant degradation would be essential in this study the effect of dom from a municipal secondary effluent on a peroxymonosulfate pms based aop was comprehensively investigated using dairy manure digestate derived biochar dmdb 800 for pms activation toward antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx degradation the molecular composition and conversion intermediates of dom at different oxidation intervals were inspected and determined in depth by ft icr ms meanwhile the relationship between the dom molecular composition and smx degradation was established the alteration of intermediates from dom transformation and the inhibition degree of pollutant degradation by the different dom intermediates were identified the basic information could provide references for the rational regulation of ros composition and dom conversion process in a pms system this in turn offered theoretical guidance to minimize the interference of dom conversion intermediates on pms activation and target pollutants degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemical reagents used in this work were listed in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 sources of secondary effluent and dmdb 800 preparation a secondary effluent sample was collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china the inorganic ions in the secondary effluent were cl no2 and so4 2 with concentrations of 326 16 and 288 mg l respectively also the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in the secondary effluent was 51 30 mg l before experiments the effluent was filtered with 0 45 µm filter membranes and stored in glass bottles at 4 c solid dairy manure digestate fermented at medium temperature for 35 d was placed in a tube furnace and kept at 800 for 2 h details of dmdb 800 preparation were reported before y wang et al 2022c besides in order to determine the possible dissolved carbon from a carbon based catalyst the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured after adding 1 0 g l of dmdb 800 catalyst and stirring for 60 min in the ion containing solution the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was detected as 0 57 mg l with 1 0 g l of dmdb 800 in the ion containing solution the doc concentration was almost unchanged in secondary effluent with or without dmdb 800 51 3 mg l consequently most dissolved carbon was obtained from the secondary effluent rather than the catalyst besides we further concluded that the weak dissolved carbon from dmdb 800 exerted a negligible effect on the activation of pms in ion containing solutions text s2 2 3 dmdb 800 activity evaluation and characterizations the prepared dmdb 800 was applied for catalytic oxidation of smx with pms and the effect of dom from the secondary effluent on smx degradation efficiency was comprehensively examined in a typical procedure 0 1 g of dmdb 800 was dispersed into 100 ml of secondary effluent water with 15 mg l smx in a 200 ml glass beaker with continuous stirring at 25 afterward a certain volume of pms 0 6 mm was injected into the mixed solution to trigger smx decomposition a sample 1 0 ml was extracted from the system at regular intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane excess na2s2o3 was employed to quench the reaction subsequently the concentration of smx in the mixture was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 2030 c shimadzu with a c18 column and a uv detector at 264 nm the mobile phase and gradient elution procedures were reported in our previous studies wang et al 2022c yu et al 2021 pms concentration was determined by a spectrophotometric method zhu et al 2019 specifically the sample was injected to the mixture containing nahco3 and ki the solution was detected after 20 min by an uv vis spectrophotometer at 352 nm the dmdb 800 was semi quantitatively analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific the reactive oxygen species ros were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr e 500 bruker 2 4 esi ft icr ms measurement and analysis the collected samples were first filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane followed by acidification to ph 2 with hcl then dom solid phase extraction was performed by agilent bond elut ppl cartridges the dom eluate was analyzed by ft icr ms solarix bruker equipped with an esi source at 4 0 kv in a negative ionization mode the molecular formula assignment was performed by matlab algorithm detailed information was presented in text s3 and text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic activity of dmdb 800 in different media the performance of dmdb 800 on pms activation in different media deionized di water ion containing solution and secondary effluent containing dom was firstly evaluated for smx degradation fig 1a an ion containing solution without dom was prepared based on the anion information of the secondary effluent as depicted in fig 1a 44 3 of smx was degraded by pms alone in secondary effluent within 60 min which was slightly higher than that in di water 42 0 the dmdb 800 pms system in the secondary effluent realized smx removal efficiency at 84 8 within 60 min interestingly the smx removal was elevated to 98 1 in the ion containing solution cl no2 and so4 2 without dom comparatively dmdb 800 exhibited a less catalytic activity in di water achieving smx degradation at 77 7 in 60 min clearly the co existing ions in the secondary effluent might facilitate smx degradation it was reported that little inhibition could occur for no2 and so4 2 li et al 2020 wang et al 2022b wang et al 2022c however the presence of cl could induce the production of large amounts of hocl and cl2 with a high oxidation capacity promoting contaminant degradation wang et al 2022b additionally the reaction of cl and pms results in the production of hocl which could degrade contaminant directly as illustrated in fig 1b smx degradation profiles were fitted well by the pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 with high correlation coefficients r2 0 92 specifically the higher k value of smx degradation in ion containing solution might also be related to the reversible reaction between cl and so4 or oh oyekunle et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the cl could react with so4 to yield cl and cl2 eqs 2 and 3 which could be transformed to oh via eqs 4 and 5 besides the existence of hclo in the system could be further decomposed to generate 1o2 eq 6 a similar conclusion has been confirmed by zhang et al who found that increasing the cl concentration from 1 to 50 mm the steady state concentration of dominant 1o2 was raised from 1 15 10 10 m to 4 48 10 10 m further facilitating the degradation of pollutants zhang et al 2021e also hclo has been demonstrated to react with pms to produce 1o2 eq 7 accelerating the degradation process oyekunle et al 2021 thus the available cl could be converted to other ros 1o2 and free radicals instead of only chlorine species eventually affecting pollutant degradation 1 ln c c 0 k t where t is the reaction time k is the first order kinetic rate constant c and c0 are the smx concentrations at different reaction time and beginning respectively 2 cl so4 cl so4 2 3 cl cl cl2 4 cl oh hocl 5 hocl oh cl 6 2hclo 1o2 h cl 7 2hso5 2hclo 1o2 2h2o 2cl 2so4 2 besides fig s1 presented the pms consumption with smx addition in different media without dmdb 800 the concentration of pms was reduced by 9 74 in the ion containing solution without dom the consumption of pms was slightly increased 12 47 in the secondary effluent with dom suggesting that dom might be barely involved in pms activation process the k values of smx degradation by dmdb 800 pms in different media at various periods were also calculated as exhibited in fig s2 the k value in the ion containing solution was 0 0918 0 009 min 1 within 0 5 min with prolonging reaction time the k value declined to 0 0644 0 005 0 0638 0 004 and 0 0499 0 003 min 1 within 5 20 20 40 and 40 60 min of oxidation respectively a similar trend was observed in the secondary effluent and the k values at different reaction time were all lower than those in the ion containing solution clearly the presence of dom inhibited the smx degradation 3 2 variation of active sites and identification and contribution of reactive oxygen species ros the surface properties of dmdb 800 biochar before and after the reaction were investigated all the dmdb 800 samples were composed of c o and n elements fig 2a four peaks were deconvoluted from the xps c1s spectra fig s3a assigning to the cc c c at 284 8 ev coh c n at 285 4 ev co c at 286 2 ev and c o at 288 5 ev ho et al 2019 wang et al 2022c three peaks in n1s spectra fig s3b could be identified as pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n at 398 4 399 9 and 401 2 ev respectively qi et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2022c the o1s spectra fig s3c were divided into three peaks with binding energies of 531 0 532 6 and 533 3 ev corresponding to c o o c o and c o respectively liang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the relative contents of coh c o pyridinic n and graphitic n groups in the used dmdb 800 samples in ion containing solution and secondary effluent dropped markedly compared to those in fresh dmdb 800 fig 2b 2d suggesting they were involved in pms activation for dom degradation detailed information of active sites was presented in text s5 in the dmdb 800 pms system with co existing dom the active sites on catalyst surface might be covered inhibiting smx degradation besides the influence of dom on ros generation was further investigated using different quenching agents typically meoh was considered as an effective scavenger for both so4 k so 4 meoh 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 du et al 2020a whereas tert butanol tba was more sensitive to quench oh k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 k so 4 tba 4 105 m 1 s 1 cai et al 2021 yu et al 2019a in addition l histidine was capable of quenching oh so4 and 1o2 k oh l histidine 5 0 109 m 1s 1 k so 4 l histidine 2 5 106 m 1s 1 and k 1 o 2 l histidine 1 5 108 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 hence meoh tba and l histidine were employed to identify so4 oh and 1o2 species smx degradation efficiency in secondary effluent sample changed slightly after adding tba and meoh fig 3a correspondingly the rate constant of smx degradation declined from 0 0306 min 1 in the blank to 0 0305 and 0 0281 min 1 respectively clearly oh played minor role in dmdb 800 pms systems with dom from fig 3b the k values of smx degradation in ion containing solution in the presence of meoh and tba dropped by 0 38 and 0 23 times in comparison to the blank respectively obviously both so4 and oh participated in smx degradation with the co existence of l histidine the smx removal rates declined remarkably in both secondary effluent and ion containing solution suggesting the crucial role of 1o2 in the smx decomposition noticeably the degradation rate of smx in secondary effluent 15 66 was much lower than that in the ion containing solution 58 05 obviously 1o2 produced in dmdb 800 pms played a more dominant role in the secondary effluent than in the ion containing solution virtually the s n or p atom containing functional groups in dom tend to react with oh dong et al 2010 luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 the so4 prefers to directly attack amino amide and arene groups within dom compounds luo et al 2018 the occurrence of various reactions consumed more oh and so4 in the secondary effluent with dom inhibiting smx degradation subsequently the relative contribution of 1o2 to smx degradation was higher than that in ion containing solutions the k oh k so 4 and k 1 o 2 were calculated via eqs 8 11 the contribution of different ros in the different media was further evaluated via eqs 12 15 yu et al 2022 as shown in fig 3c the contributions of oh so4 and 1o2 in ion containing solution were determined as 23 41 14 31 and 53 17 respectively implying the dominant role of 1o2 in the case comparatively the contributions of oh so4 and other ros were 0 33 7 84 and 1 96 in the secondary effluent respectively showing oh so4 and other ross e g cl and cl2 exhibited weaker roles in the presence of dom noticeably the relative contribution of 1o2 raised to 89 87 implying its primary role in secondary effluent collectively 1o2 dominated in the smx degradation in the two different media by dmdb 800 pms while dom consumed more free radicals 8 k oh k 0 k 1 9 k so 4 k 1 k 2 10 k 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 11 k other ros k 3 12 λ oh k 0 k1 k 0 13 λ so4 k 1 k2 k 0 14 λ 1o2 k 2 k3 k 0 15 λ other ros k 3 k 0 where k 0 was the apparent rate constant of the pristine reaction without any scavenger k 1 k 2 and k 3 represented the apparent rate constants of smx degradation with the introduction of tba methanol and l histidine respectively among them k 0 k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 and k 3 represented apparent rate constants of smx degradation by oh so4 1o2 and other ros respectively 3 3 molecular composition and transformation of dom during catalytic oxidation the van krevelen vk diagram was applied to describe the molecular composition of dom in different samples with the classification criteria described in previous studies fu et al 2020a fu et al 2020b the vk plot can be divided into eight regions corresponding to carbohydrate aminosugars saturated compounds tannins lignins unsaturated hydrocarbons condensed aromatic structures and others fig s4 dom in secondary effluent was mainly composed of cho chos chon chons and p containing compounds such as chop chonp chonps etc which were the major subcategories in dom in general the chos and chon subcategories in secondary effluent were likely to originate from domestic waste excreta and household detergents zhang et al 2021b as presented in fig 4 fig s4 and table s2 the number and relative content of dom components changed obviously after different periods of oxidation in the dmdb 800 pms system the number of cho and chos subcategories exhibited an overall downward trend with prolonged reaction time fig 4a table s2 specifically the number of cho in the raw secondary effluent was 1056 about 1 30 1 33 1 56 and 1 75 times higher than those after 5 20 40 and 60 min of oxidation respectively similarly the number of chos decreased from 1002 to 723 at 5 min 521 at 20 min 556 at 40 min and 438 at 60 min of the catalytic reaction correspondingly the relative content of cho formulas was reduced from 32 94 to 4 52 after reactions for 60 min it can be inferred that cho compounds distributed in the lignins and condensed aromatic structure like regions might be destroyed vulnerably and transformed into other compounds meanwhile the depleted formulas during oxidation processes occupied the region of lower o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 0 5 1 2 values suggesting the compounds with double bonds or aromatic rings in a low oxidation state may be attacked by oxidative species zhang et al 2019b also a similar phenomenon was found for chon and chos formulas with their number decreasing from 546 to 1002 to 169 and 438 and relative percentage declining from 17 72 and 32 18 to 1 16 and 4 68 the removed n and s containing compounds were accumulated in the lignin like region the decreased number and percentage might imply a stronger reactivity of dom molecules containing n or s functional groups e g nh2 nh or s with free radicals zhang et al 2021d the concentration of dom is generally several orders of magnitude higher than that of smx in the actual effluent accordingly the dom could outcompete the smx for ros such as oh and so4 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2022 besides based on the variation of catalyst surface sites in different media in section 3 2 dom could block the active sites on the catalyst surface affecting the pms activation and ros production accordingly fewer oh and so4 radicals were involved in the oxidation process inhibiting the degradation of smx the results were also in good agreement with the reduced contribution of oh and so4 radicals to smx degradation in the secondary effluent however an opposite trend was observed for chons and chosp compounds in comparison with the raw secondary effluent 228 and 7 93 the number and proportion of chons rose to 396 and 65 60 249 and 52 31 369 and 67 22 as well as 433 and 71 05 after 5 20 40 and 60 min of catalytic reaction respectively moreover the number and proportion of chosp were boosted from 52 to 1 45 in raw secondary effluent to 163 and 11 46 at 60 min clearly the elevated number and proportion were assumed to be oxidation or transformation products zhang et al 2019b also the newly formed n and s containing compounds during the oxidation were scattered in the tannins and condensed aromatic structure like regions with higher oxidation states generally hence chos and chon with a low oxidation degree o c 0 4 were more reactive during the oxidation process leading to the formation of highly oxidized molecules o c 0 7 besides no obvious change was observed in terms of the number and abundance of chonp and chonsp compounds in terms of compound classes lignins like compounds were the predominant fractions in all samples accounting for 65 03 78 51 of the total components fig 4b and fig s4 in general lignins like compounds are aromatics consisting of c h and o elements mainly containing phenol oh benzene ring and co luo et al 2022 yuan et al 2017 the oh could realize the addition of unsaturated c c bonds in aromatic compounds varanasi et al 2018 therefore lignins like compounds account for a larger proportion of the recalcitrant dom in secondary effluent the percentage of tannins compounds reached the maximum of 19 10 after reaction of 60 min in dmdb 800 pms system basically the percentage of carbohydrate molecules increased gradually with reaction time and reached a maximum value of 5 32 at 60 min the increased proportion of tannins and carbohydrates might be resistance to oxidation conversely the proportion of saturated compounds in raw secondary effluent was 11 20 higher than those samples treated for 5 1 22 20 3 37 40 3 77 and 60 min 2 02 similarly aminosugar compounds showed a decreasing trend with prolonged oxidation time as reported the saturated and aminosugar compounds are made up of organic substances or monomers containing carboxyl groups luo et al 2022 these compounds might be oxidized by oh to form acids with a lower molecular weight which could be further mineralized into co2 and h2o in the dmdb 800 pms system furthermore condensed aromatics are a group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that contain multiple benzene rings with high unsaturation the relative proportion of aromatic compounds reduced slightly during oxidation notably o c ratio of most molecules in dom was in the range of 0 1 0 8 but increases to 0 2 1 1 after reaction fig s5 suggesting the dom molecules were oxidized in the dmdb 800 pms system in order to better understand the intricate transformation of dom molecules the oxidation pathway of different dom compounds was further elucidated in the dmdb 800 pms system based on mass difference analysis figs 5 and s6 all dom compounds were identified to undergo oxidative decarbonization e g c2h2o c2h6 ch2 and co2 dehydrogenation 2h and dehydration reactions in addition compounds containing n and s elements witnessed deheteroatomisation e g nh no2 h so2 so3 sh2 hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions virtually some ros were more prone to attack some special structures or groups on dom for instance the s n or p atom containing functional groups in dom tends to react with oh via donate more electrons toward the neighboring ch bond and enhance the h atom abstraction dong et al 2010 luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 the so4 prefers to directly attack specific functional groups within dom compounds via an electron transfer pathway such as dom compounds with amino amide and arene groups etc luo et al 2018 the occurrence of various reactions consumed more oh and so4 inhibiting smx degradation 1o2 exhibited little dom scavenging f dom 0 5 because most 1o2 could naturally relax to the ground state triplet oxygen in water wilkinson et al 1995 yang et al 2022 besides the overall reaction rate constant for dom quenching of 1o2 was 0 41 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2022 which is several orders of magnitude lower than that of oh 108 109 m 1s 1 and so4 107 108 m 1s 1 keen et al 2014 lei et al 2022 therefore the degradation of smx by 1o2 was barely influenced by dom typically the total number of reactions followed the order of chos cho chon chons chosp chop chop chonp during the oxidation process all compounds except chonp mainly experienced ch2 2h c2h2o co2 and h2o reactions meanwhile the above reactions occurred more in cho than in other compounds during the four periods of oxidation furthermore nh and no2 h reactions were observed in chon chons and chonsp compounds the number of nh and no2 h reactions was larger in chon than that in chons and chosp compounds it was noticed that numerous desulfonation reactions such as sh2 so2 and so3 appeared primarily in chos rather than in chons chosp and chonsp compounds also hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions were recognized in chons chosp and chonsp in comparison with other compounds chonp participated in less reactions including no2 h c2h6 2h h2o and nh reactions notably the number of detectable precursor product pairs among almost all types of reactions was greater in 0 5 min than in other periods clearly the pre oxidation stage stimulated a considerable number of dom molecular transformation in comparison the number of detectable precursor product pairs was reduced markedly with the oxidation time over 5 min for cho compounds the number of c2h6 reactions occurring at different oxidation periods changed little conversely for chosp containing compounds the number of c2h2o c2h6 ch2 c2o 2h sh2 so2 and so3 reactions at 0 5 min were 10 1 8 4 18 3 6 and 5 separately which were lower compared to those occurred on other compounds the corresponding reaction number increased to 16 8 34 14 28 26 14 and 13 at prolonged oxidation time of 20 40 min as reported p containing heteroatoms were also more vulnerable to be attacked by oh due to the low electronegativity of p wang et al 2022a in terms of elementary composition chosp containing compounds occupied a minor proportion of 1 45 much lower than those containing cho 32 94 chos 32 18 chon 17 72 chons 7 93 etc in original secondary effluent the other compounds might outcompete the chosp containing compounds for ros also other compounds might encapsulate chosp containing compounds in their macromolecular structure thus reducing the sensitivity of chosp to ros during the initial 0 5 min phase of oxidation correspondingly the number of eight reactions was less at 0 5 min period for chosp afterwards more chosp were exposed with prolonged oxidation time triggering the great number of chosp transformations in addition the number of seven types of reactions no2 h nh ch2 2h c2h2o co2 and h2o decreased with the increasing oxidation time for chon compounds it was worth mentioning that the number of reactions occurring in chon declined dramatically within 5 60 min which was also observed in chos and chop compounds in consideration of the overall variation in molecular level properties intensity weighted averages wa were summarized in table 1 the relatively higher double bond equivalent dbewa 8 117 and lower o cwa 0 467 of the raw secondary effluent demonstrated that dom consisted of more unsaturated and less oxidized compounds du et al 2020b varanasi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b moreover the modified aromaticity index aimodwa also dropped slightly after different reaction oxidation time indicating unsaturated and aromatic compounds could be destroyed effectively during the oxidation process furthermore the oxidation degree of dom was elevated which was consistent with the increased o cwa value noticeably the h cwa value of dom in secondary effluent was higher than those after different oxidation time indicating the occurrence of dealkylation reactions e g ch2 and c2h6 occurred zhang et al 2021b the declined mwwa implied large size dom molecules were degraded into lower ones zhang et al 2019a to reflect the transformation of the unsaturated c c double bonds and carbon atom rings in dom during oxidation we calculated the molecular formula dbe the plots of dbe values versus the number of carbon atoms associated with the o c ratios were presented in fig 6 in general a lower number of carbon atoms and dbe value implied smaller molecular weight chain segments and less double bonds in compounds respectively du et al 2020b varanasi et al 2018 wei et al 2021 the amount of the red and orange spots 0 89 o c 1 1 with 0 17 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values was lower in raw secondary effluent compared to the samples after catalytic oxidation fig 6a in addition the number of blue and green spots 0 035 o c 0 73 with 20 30 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values was higher before oxidation it was reasonable to infer that the higher molecular weight compounds with lower oxidation degrees are dominant in the raw secondary effluent as the oxidation time was prolonged the red and orange spots 0 89 o c 1 1 with 0 17 carbon atoms and 0 15 dbe values increased apparently suggesting the production of components with a higher oxidation degree such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes bai et al 2022 wang et al 2020 as reported the k value for the reaction of oh with aliphatic compounds was approximately 109 m 1 s 1 higher than that of so4 k 109 m 1 s 1 varanasi et al 2018 as a result oh might react preferentially with aminosugars and saturated compounds leading to further oxidation varanasi et al 2018 besides some compounds with more than 20 dbe values and 17 30 carbon atoms were generated after oxidation by dmdb 800 pms revealing the increase of unsaturated compounds and cyclic structures wei et al 2021 interestingly the components with 20 30 carbon atoms and 11 15 dbe values disappeared with the oxidation time indicating the oxidation could reduce medium long chain compounds effectively wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 so4 radicals could induce transformation of aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbon components by single electron transfer destroying the components with 20 30 carbon atoms and 11 15 dbe values varanasi et al 2018 ye et al 2017 also oh could react quickly with some larger molecules of aliphatic chains containing more than 20 carbon atoms ruan et al 2021 in order to further understand the dom molecular transformation in dmdb 800 pms system the removed resistant and produced formulas at different oxidation time were compared as shown in fig 7a the removed compounds were distributed in the region with low o c 0 4 and h c 0 5 2 2 during 0 5 min oxidation corresponding to saturated compounds aminosugars and lignins like compounds with a low oxidation degree the resistant compounds mainly have o c from 0 3 to 0 6 and h c from 1 0 to 1 6 attributing to lignins like compounds besides most produced formulas of carbohydrates tannins condensed aromatics and lignins like compounds were scattered in regions with high o c 0 5 indicating an increase in carboxyl group yu et al 2019b the dmdb 800 pms system might decompose oxygen deficient substances preferentially and generate oxygen rich substances in the initial oxidation stage yuan et al 2017 in addition lignins like compounds were refractory components in dom while aminosugars and saturated compounds were decomposed more easily du et al 2020b after 5 20 min of treatment fig 7b the removed molecules were identified in the region with a higher o c value 0 6 clearly carbohydrates tannins and condensed aromatic structures with a high degree of oxidation could be removed effectively via dmdb 800 pms system also the majority of the produced formulas moved to 0 2 o c 0 4 and 0 7 h c 1 5 regions implying partial decomposition of lignins and possible formation of lignin phenols yu et al 2019b meanwhile lignins could be oxidized via radicals with ring opening ruan et al 2021 this matched well with the reduction of resistant formulas in the lignins like region the downward trend in the number of resistant formulas in lignins like regions was also observed in fig 7c d as the reaction time was further extended the removed and produced molecules span in a wider region notably the number of removed molecules declined significantly compared to those at 0 5 and 5 20 min suggesting that the removed molecules might be further decomposed apparently the variations of removed resistant and produced molecules meant that free radicals facilitated the transformation of dom compounds and the formation of refractory intermediates by dmdb 800 pms as shown in fig 8a within 0 5 min of reaction the removed and produced compounds were primarily located in the mw 300 and 400 mw 500 regions respectively obviously more fractions with a lower mw value 350 were decomposed forming compounds with a higher mw value by dmdb 800 pms preferentially in the subsequent 5 20 min fig 8b most of the removed compounds were in the range of mw 500 whereas the produced compounds were observed with mw 350 suggesting dom degradation oh could trigger criegee type reactions by breaking the aromatic ring in dom forming muconic type and aliphatic compounds with a lower mw wang et al 2017 also oh could induce dom transformation and generate smaller mw fractions such as aldehydes ketones alkenes and carboxylic acids ruan et al 2021 as the reaction time increased to 20 40 min the lower mw fractions 350 produced in the 5 20 min period were removed effectively and the new intermediates with a medium higher mw 350 were produced notably the regions with medium higher mw values 350 were occupied by the produced molecules dominantly during the reaction period of 40 60 min fig 8c comparatively the resistant molecules remained in the medium mw fractions region 350 mw 500 at different reaction time specifically most resistant molecules with lower h c 1 0 were eliminated with the extension of reaction time fig 8d indicating the resistant molecules with a higher aromaticity and or unsaturation degree could be further attacked by oh and so4 radicals zhang et al 2021d 3 4 mechanism of dom inhibition to smx degradation in general dom exhibits a strong scavenging ability towards oh so4 and cl species inhibiting smx degradation chlorine radicals could react with organics through chlorination single electron transfer set and hydrogen capture reactions among them chlorination is considered as the most likely pathway leading to the formation of chlorinated byproducts lei et al 2021 in general the reactions of chlorine addition usually existed in chlorination and uv chlorine based aops zhang et al 2021b in the dmdb 800 pms system the possible chlorine radicals in this system were mainly derived from the partial conversion of co existing cl chlorine radicals could be produced through reactions between oh or so4 and cl in dmdb 800 pms system notably the reversible reactions between oh so4 and cl and the reduction by oxidants might lead to low levels of chlorine radicals yang et al 2022 generally chlorine radicals could convert dom via addition and substitution reactions to generate chlorine containing products with high molecular weight zhang et al 2021b based on fticr ms analysis no chlorine containing molecular products were identified in dom conversion process in the dmdb 800 pms system hence chlorine radicals might play a little role in dom transformation process in this study to gain further insight into the effect of dom composition at a molecular level on smx degradation we established the potential correlations between the dom composition and inhibition of smx degradation in the dmdb 800 pms system the k values in the municipal secondary effluent and the ion containing solution represent the smx degradation rates in the presence and absence of dom respectively a linear fit was performed between the percentage of dom molecular composition and the difference in k values of smx degradation in the presence absence of dom at different oxidation intervals the obtained r2 values were presented in fig 9a another linear fit was performed between the percentage of dom compound composition and the difference in k values of smx degradation in the presence absence of dom at different oxidation intervals the corresponding fitting results were presented in fig s7 and s8 and the obtained r2 values were shown in fig 9b besides raw data on the k values of smx degradation with without dom at different oxidation intervals have been listed in fig s1 raw data on the percentage composition of dom molecules and compounds at different oxidation intervals have been supplemented in table s3 as depicted in fig 9 a positive correlation was shown in the blue area and a negative correlation was presented in the red area clearly cho chon chos chop and chonp presented a moderate positive correlation 0 5 r2 0 8 with the inhibition of smx degradation fig 9a demonstrating an apparent restriction to smx degradation by these molecules in dom also the percentage of cho chon chos chop and chonp declined with prolonged reaction time which resulted in the suppression of smx degradation via competition for free radicals in terms of compound classes fig 9b condensed aromatic and aminosugars compounds exhibited strong and moderate inhibition to smx degradation while n containing or n free saturated compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons showed low and weak inhibition text s6 si the possible mechanism of inhibition to smx degradation by dom was depicted in fig 10 oh could react with dom mostly by abstracting a hydrogen atom from a c h bond or addition to an aromatic ring in dom the h atom abstraction might preferentially target aliphatic compounds cho zhang et al 2021d besides s atoms with lower ionization potential could react with so4 via direct single electron transfer set also oh could interact with molecules containing s n or p atom groups in the aqueous phase forming 2σ 1σ two center three electron 2c 3e adducts minakata et al 2009 functional groups containing s n or p atom could donate more electrons to the neighboring c h bond enhancing the h atom abstraction by oh minakata et al 2009 hence oh also showed higher reactivity with molecules containing s n or p atom groups luo et al 2018 minakata et al 2009 generally most aromatic ring compounds with electron donating groups could react with not only so4 via set and addition with unsaturated c c double bond but also oh for aromatic ring addition varanasi et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017 notably the set reactions induced by so4 might have a faster rate compared to addition and h atom abstraction due to the lower energy barrier ye et al 2017 thus condensed aromatic structures might tend to capture so4 and oh in the dmdb 800 pms system aminosugars and saturated compounds containing carboxylic acid monomers could be oxidized into low molecular weight acids by oh readily luo et al 2022 thus aminosugars and saturated compounds exhibited less inhibition to smx degradation than condensed aromatic compounds unsaturated hydrocarbons accounting for only 0 10 of total dom in original effluent could be decomposed slightly with prolonged oxidation time more stable and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were produced consuming fewer free radicals potentially luo et al 2022 therefore the inhibition of smx degradation by unsaturated hydrocarbons could be ignored additionally the reduction of active sites such as graphitic n pyridinic n c o and co might be attributed to the presence of dom partially covering the sites on dmdb 800 surface overall dom inhibited the smx degradation in pms aop via blocking the actives sites on catalyst surface restraining ros production or quenching the ros 4 conclusions in the studied biochar activated pms system oh so4 1o2 and other reactive species e g chlorine containing radicals existed for the degradation of sulfonamide contaminants besides oh so4 and chlorine containing radicals were prone to oxidation reactions with dom in a secondary effluent leading to dom decomposition the presence of dom in the secondary effluent played a negative role in the degradation of sulfonamide contaminants in the heterogeneous pms activation system overall dom suppressed the smx degradation in pms aops by blocking the active sites on the catalyst surface inhibiting ros production besides pms systems with different compositions of reactive species at different oxidation intervals affect the dom conversion pathway oxidative decarbonation e g c2h2o c2h6 ch2 and co2 dehydrogenation 2h and dehydration reactions of dom compounds could occur in pms aop also deheteroatomization e g nh no2 h so2 so3 sh2 hydration h2o and n s oxidation reactions were observed in compounds containing n and s elements the oxygen deficient o c 0 4 and low molecular weight substances mw 350 in dom were preferentially decomposed with oxygen rich o c 0 5 and high molecular weight substances mw 500 produced which were further degraded dom conversion will produce different intermediates the intermediates with different structures have different abilities to compete with the target pollutant for the oxidative species resulting in different inhibition degrees towards pollutant degradation the cho chon chos chop and chonp molecules inhibited smx degradation also the inhibition effect by condensed aromatic structural compounds was higher than that of aminosugars and saturated compounds this work investigated the roles of nom decomposition and intermediates with the aim of clarifying the types of transformation intermediates at different oxidation time intervals and elucidating the possible decomposition paths of dom also the alteration of dom transformation intermediates and the inhibition degree of pollutant degradation by different dom intermediates were determined various groups in dom can affect the contaminant degradation in pms aops via different routes thus the interactions among dom components active species and target pollutants are more important and need to be focused on notably dom might affect smx degradation both via covering sites and trapping free radicals however the primary inhibiting factor was not determined in our work which will be further investigated in the future work also the development of novel catalysts modulation of active sites on catalyst surface and optimization of active species in a ps system are also essential to reduce the inhibitory effect of dom on removal of target pollutants in

14706,heterogeneous catalysts lag far behind their homogeneous counterparts in activating peroxymonosulfate pms for water decontamination due to the low site intrinsic activity and sluggish mass transfer the single atom catalyst can bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts but the difficulty to break scaling relations originating from the site monotony restricts further efficiency upgradation herein through modulating the crystallinity of nh2 uio 66 a porous carbon support with ultrahigh surface area 1721 71 m2 g 1 is obtained to anchor the dual atom fecon6 site which exhibits superior turnover frequency over single atom fen4 and con4 sites 13 07 versus 9 97 9 07 min 1 the as synthesized composite thus outperforms the homogeneous catalytic system fe3 co2 for sulfamethoxazole smz degradation and the catalyst dose normalized kinetic rate constant 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeds reported values by 1 2 orders of magnitude moreover only 20 mg of the catalyst can run a fluidized bed reactor to realize continuous zero discharge of smz in multiple actual waters for up to 8 33 h unlike all reported reaction routes the catalysis on the diatomic site follows a new surface collision oxidation path i e the dispersed catalyst adsorbs pms to generate surface activated pms with high potential which collides with surrounding smz and directly seizes electron from it to induce pollutant oxidation theoretical calculation indicates that the enhanced activity of fecon6 site stems from the diatomic synergy leading to stronger pms adsorption larger near fermi level density of states and optimal global gibbs free energy evolution overall this work provides an effective strategy of constructing heterogeneous dual atom catalyst pms process to achieve faster pollution control than homogeneous system and sheds light on the interatomic synergetic mechanism for pms activation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollution control advanced oxidation process dual atom catalyst peroxymonosulfate diatomic synergy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ever growing demand for clean water and safe eco environment stimulates the upgradation of wastewater treatment technologies dias et al 2023 among them the advanced oxidation process aop is powerful in degrading refractory organic pollutants to reduce the effluent toxicity hodges et al 2018 peroxymonosulfate pms with a reactive oo bond in the asymmetric structure is widely employed to initiate aop owing to the simplicity of its activation li et al 2023 compared with homogeneous systems utilizing heat light or metal ions to activate pms the heterogeneous catalysis possesses prominent merits including neglectable energy expenditure and convenient catalyst recycling gujar et al 2022 however limited by the low site intrinsic activity and sluggish mass transfer heterogeneous catalysts still lag far behind homogeneous ones in terms of the catalytic efficiency qian et al 2021 this dims their application prospects because more catalysts are required to ensure the treatment effectiveness promoting the kinetic rate of heterogeneous catalysts to approach or even surpass that of homogeneous catalysts is thus of great necessity but remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate structural design strategy recently the single atom catalysts sacs featuring atomically dispersed metal sites have demonstrated excellent pms activation efficiency because of the unsaturated metal coordination structure and maximum atom utilization li et al 2018 moreover sacs can bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by integrating the well defined quasi homogeneous sites into solid materials weon et al 2020 consequently an ideal platform can be constructed by sacs to precisely explore the heterogeneous structure activity relationship at the atomic level which in turn provides valid guidance for the catalyst structure design guo et al 2019 gao et al tuned the metal center atom mn fe co ni cu of carbon supported sacs and established the relation between the metal kind and catalytic performance gao et al 2021 the fe sac was found to possess higher activity than co sac while co2 was better than fe2 in homogeneous systems for pms assisted pollutant degradation gao et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 although this work and other frontier researches proposed various regulatory strategies to enhance the intrinsic activity of sacs the inherent defects of sacs in catalyzing complex reactions could not be overcome an et al 2023 due to the structural monotony of active sites sacs suffer from the limitation of scaling relations between the adsorption energies of similar adsorbates i e the adsorptions of an adsorbate and its derived molecules on the identical site are either all strong or all weak zhang et al 2023 this makes it difficult for sacs to find a thermodynamic balance between strongly adsorbing reactants efficiently activating intermediates and easily desorbing products ying et al 2021 therefore in the complicated pms based catalytic oxidation process involving multiple intermediates e g so4 oh o and reaction steps energetically unfavorable step or high energy barrier may exist which causes the hardship of sacs to break the kinetic constraint and further improve the catalytic efficiency gao et al 2021 mi et al 2021 a promising approach to tackle this issue is introducing another metal atom into the active center of sacs to form heteronuclear dual atom catalysts hdacs which contain two different metal atoms in one site sun et al 2023 when the metal spacing matches with the size of pms molecule the metal dimers can act as two collaborative grippers to strongly adsorb pms consequently generating high surface concentration of oxidants cheng et al 2023 wang et al 2022 meanwhile the increased site area and asymmetric electron distribution of the paired metal center can provide a variety of options for the bonding and activation of different intermediates products derived from pms which is conducive to accelerating the rate determining step and optimizing the global energy configuration sun et al 2022 besides the construction of above hdacs to boost the intrinsic activity of catalytic sites the selection of supports is also crucial because ideal supports can supply suitable microenvironments for the efficient operation of active centers zhu et al 2020 among various candidates the carbon matrix derived from metal organic frameworks mofs can inherit the large surface area and abundant pores which enable high degree of site exposure and unimpeded mass transfer wang et al 2020a although mofs derived carbon supported hdacs have recently displayed enhanced catalytic activity in the field of energy conversion the research on their feasibility in activating pms to fleetly decompose contaminants is still in its infancy fan et al 2023 liu et al 2022 more importantly whether bimetallic atoms have synergistic effect in promoting reaction kinetics and the associated catalytic mechanism remain ambiguous which deserves further exploration in this work a porous carbon matrix with fe co diatomic sites was synthesized by a co adsorption pyrolysis strategy using low crystallinity nh2 uio 66 as the precursor the as obtained composite not only owned higher efficiency than fe co sacs and its homogeneous counterpart for sulfamethoxazole smz as model pollutant degradation via pms activation but also exhibited superior performance beyond reported state of the art catalysts besides a fluidized bed reactor was constructed to evaluate its dynamic smz removal effectiveness in actual waters chemical quenching tests electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular probe experiments were conducted to identify the predominant reactive oxygen species ros by means of dissolved oxygen monitoring electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculation a new surface collision oxidation path for smz elimination was discovered the interaction behavior between pms and smz on the dual atom site and fe co synergistic mechanism for ultrafast catalytic kinetics were thoroughly revealed the smz degradation pathways and effluent biotoxicity were also investigated overall this work could guide the rational design of hdacs for efficient pms activation and advance the atom level mechanism understanding of pms based aop 2 material and methods the details of chemicals and materials material preparation and characterizations catalytic degradation procedure analytic methods and computational methods were presented in texts s1 s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization the hdac with atomically dispersed fe co sites on porous carbon support was synthesized by a co adsorption pyrolysis strategy firstly zirconium chloride zrcl4 and 2 amino 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid nh2 h2bdc were assembled to yellowish nh2 uio 66 via the solvothermal reaction fig s1 subsequently fe2 and co2 were synchronously adsorbed into the mof with nh2 group on its ligand to yield a yellow green composite u feco laying the foundation for forming bimetallic sites in the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra the peaks at 1060 8 and 3362 2 cm 1 were ascribed to nh2 rocking and stretching vibrations respectively fig s2 wang et al 2020b they were shifted down to 1059 9 and 3351 4 cm 1 after metal adsorption respectively confirming the metal complexation with nh2 next the u feco was pyrolyzed during which the strong n coordination and micropore confinement prevented metal atoms from agglomerating into nanoparticles zhang et al 2019 contrarily abundant zro2 nanoparticles of 10 nm were generated in the carbon matrix due to the high zr content in the precursor as evidenced by the transmission scanning electron microscopy tem sem and x ray diffraction xrd pattern fig s3 by eliminating zro2 with hf solution the fe co hdac u feco c was eventually obtained for preparing nh2 uio 66 acids were usually used to depress the ionization of cooh on the ligand which could slow down the coordination process and improve the assembly accuracy to obtain high crystallinity mof fig s4 lin et al 2019 however acids were designedly unused in our synthesis consequently zrcl4 and nh2 h2bdc rapidly polymerized into large aggregations with low crystallinity fig s4 as shown in fig 1 a u feco c inherited the irregular morphology of nh2 uio 66 after pyrolysis contrarily the u feco c synthesized with formic acid denoted as u feco c acid presented a well defined polyhedron appearance fig 1b interestingly the specific surface area and pore volume of u feco c reached 1721 71 m2 g 1 and 1 39 cm3 g 1 respectively much higher than those 856 76 m2 g 1 and 0 65 cm3 g 1 of u feco c acid fig 1c table s1 the pore diameters of the former centered at 1 37 and 3 69 nm were also obviously larger than those of the latter fig 1c inset these suggested that compared to the rigid frame with high crystallinity the relatively disordered structure of nh2 uio 66 favors the generation of carbon support with augmented surface area and pore size which gave rise to higher site accessibility and enlarged channels for mass transfer in the high resolution tem hrtem image of u feco c the lattice fringes belonging to fe co containing crystals did not appear while the associated characteristic diffraction spots were also absent in the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig s5 besides except the peak around 23 6 ascribed to the 002 lattice plane of graphitic carbon no signals derived from metal crystals were detected in the xrd pattern of u feco c fig s6 miao et al 2021 these results jointly implied that fe and co species existed as isolated atoms rather than nanoparticles in the catalyst the spherical aberration corrected high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy sachaadf stem in fig 1d clearly revealed abundant coupled bright spots distributed on the carbon support which were highlighted with red circles and identified as the bimetallic atom pairs based on the distinct contrast between heavy metals and light carbon element li et al 2021 the spacings of two randomly selected atom pairs labeled as a1 a2 and b1 b2 were measured and they were both about 0 24 nm apart fig 1e furthermore 30 atom pairs were chosen for statistical analysis the gauss fitting testified that their distances were concentrated at 0 241 nm 2 41 å accounting for 51 13 of all tested pairs fig 1f the haadf micrograph and elemental mapping of u feco c manifested the homogenous distribution of fe co n and c elements over the entire architecture fig 1g the appearance of both fe and co signals hinted that fe co dual atom sites were successfully embedded into n doped carbon framework han et al 2021 for comparison the single atom catalysts u fe c u co c were also synthesized with the sem and tem images shown in fig s7 in the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum of u feco c the high resolution n 1 s peak was deconvoluted into five peaks at 398 21 399 02 400 62 401 72 and 404 65 ev which were assigned to pyridinic n metal n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively suggesting the presence of fe co n complex fig s8 chu et al 2021 the metal local coordination structure and valence state of samples were determined by the x ray absorption fine structure xafs spectroscopy the rising edge in the normalized fe k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes curve of u fe c was located between those of fe foil and fe3o4 indicating the average fe valence state δ between 0 and 8 3 fig 2 a lin et al 2019 for u feco c the fe k edge xanes spectrum almost coincided with that of fe2o3 manifesting its fe valence state approaching 3 the k 3 weighted fe k edge spectra for fourier transformed extended xafs ft exafs were displayed in fig 2b in u fe c the main peak assigned to the fe n coordination was observed around 1 50 å while no fe fe signal at 2 21 å was detected indicating the atomically dispersion of fe species lin et al 2019 besides the peak associated with the fe n coordination another distinct peak attributed to the fe metal scattering appeared at approximately 2 21 å for u feco c implying the possible formation of dual atom fe co bond han et al 2019 the exafs fitting with fe n and or fe co paths was conducted to obtain the quantitative coordination configuration the average n coordination number of fe center in u fe c was 4 1 which suggested that fe species mainly existed as the fen4 structure table s2 for u feco c the average n and co numbers surrounding fe atom were 4 2 and 0 9 respectively with the bond length of fe co pair calculated as 2 42 å fig 2c similar analyses were performed for the co k edge xafs data of u co c and u feco c the co valence state in u co c was between 0 and 2 and the co species were anchored on the carbon matrix as single atom con4 form without the presence of co co signal fig 2d e and table s2 the co atom in u feco c with 2 δ 8 3 was coordinated by 4 1 n atoms and 1 1 fe atom averagely with the co fe bond length of 2 40 å fig 2d f additionally the wavelet transform wt contour plots were exhibited in fig 2g the fe species in u feco c demonstrated a main intensity maximum at 6 41 å 1 and a weak one at 9 34 å 1 which represented the fe n coordination and fe co scattering respectively the co atom in u feco c displayed intensity maximum at 5 60 å 1 reflecting the co n coordination the extra intensity at 7 36 å 1 was ascribed to the co fe coordination based on these results the atomically dispersed fe co pair was evidenced and deduced to be present as the fecon6 structure to testify it a fecon6 model was constructed and optimized by theoretical calculation as fig 2f inset the simulated fe co bond length of 2 40 å matched well with the measured fe co spacing of 2 41 å fig 1f and exafs fitted values of 2 42 or 2 40 å corroborating the rationality of fecon6 structure 3 2 catalytic performance the activity of as synthesized catalysts was evaluated by degrading smz via pms activation fig 3 a the single pms failed to remove smz 2 indicating the negligible oxidation capacity of pms alone in contrast the combination of catalysts and pms resulted in a significant decrease in smz concentration the carbonized nh2 uio 66 without loading metals u c decomposed 72 16 of smz within 6 min after loading co or fe the u co c and u fe c increased smz degradation ratios to 77 28 and 91 33 respectively suggesting the high reactivity of single atom metal n c sites notably the u feco c containing both fe and co exhibited the best performance with eliminating 97 44 of smz at 6 min meanwhile a markedly suppressed efficiency was observed for u feco c acid which in turn proved that the high surface area and poriness of u feco c favored site exposure and mass transfer as well as improved smz adsorption capacity 198 56 versus 148 72 mg g 1 thus accelerating the catalysis moreover the fe and co contents in u feco c were measured as 1 50 and 1 67 wt by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes the corresponding concentrations of fe3 1 20 mg l 1 and co2 1 34 mg l 1 ions were used to construct a homogeneous catalytic system with pms which only removed 40 39 of smz in 6 min this suggested that the heterogeneous catalytic efficiency of u feco c surpassed that of metal ions pms homogeneous system noted that the above reduction in smz concentration was mainly attributed to degradation because mixtures containing catalyst powders and solution were injected into methanol during sampling which desorbed 95 of smz from catalysts thus excluding the contribution of adsorption to smz removal the reaction data were fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic equation with the rate constant k and smz decomposition half life t 1 2 shown in fig 3b the k values of different catalysts obeyed the order of fe3 co2 0 09 min 1 u c 0 48 min 1 u feco c acid 1 75 min 1 u co c 2 34 min 1 u fe c 5 67 min 1 u feco c 7 94 min 1 while t 1 2 followed the opposite sequence noteworthily the catalyst dose normalized k value of u feco c 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeded those of reported heterogeneous catalysts by 1 2 orders of magnitude under comparable concentration ratios of pms to smz testifying the ultrahigh efficiency of diatomic site for pms activation fig 3c table s3 additionally the fe and co amounts in u fe c and u co c were also detected by icp aes as 1 84 and 1 75 wt respectively the turnover frequency tof min 1 of each catalytic site which represented the intrinsic activity was then calculated with eq 1 wang et al 2022 1 tof δ n pollutant m metal m 0 w metal δ t where δn pollutant mol l 1 m metal g mol 1 m 0 g l 1 w metal wt and δt min denoted the mole concentration of pollutant converted relative atomic mass of metal catalyst dosage mass content of metal in the catalyst and reaction time respectively since most smz was degraded within the first 15 s the chosen δt was set as 0 25 min meanwhile because the mole numbers of fe and co in u feco c were different the molar concentration m 0 w metal m metal of fe co diatomic sites was considered as 21 43 µmol l 1 assuming that all fe atoms were paired with co the tofs of u co c u fe c and u feco c were 9 07 9 97 and 13 07 min 1 respectively which demonstrated the higher intrinsic activity of dual atom site than single atom sites the influence of inorganic anions with the concentration of 500 mmol l 1 which surpassed those used in most reports on smz degradation was investigated fig 3d no3 and h2po4 exerted limited inhibition to smz elimination so4 2 reduced smz degradation ratio to 85 18 due to its strong site competition against pms hco3 also delayed the catalysis with removing 70 58 of smz in 6 min possibly because the hydrolysis of hco3 increased solution ph to 8 15 and thus reduced the positive surface potential to depress pms adsorption surprisingly cl greatly expedited the reaction with smz being completely degraded in 15 s which should result from the generation of highly reactive hclo by cl and catalyst activated pms for smz oxidation luo et al 2019 in addition natural organic matter nom 20 mg l 1 slightly decreased smz removal ratio to 91 79 suggesting the excellent anti interference ability of u feco c the effect of reaction temperature t on the catalytic activity was exhibited in fig 3e with t rising from 5 to 35 c the k value decreased monotonously from 8 17 to 6 91 min 1 which was opposite to the reported rule wang and wang 2020 the whole reaction involved the surface adsorption and chemical oxidation of contaminants and increasing t could accelerate the chemical oxidation by affording reactants more energy to cross the activation energy barrier therefore the reduced efficiency at higher t should stem from the deterioration of smz adsorption indeed the smz adsorption capacity of u feco c declined from 214 98 to 191 20 mg g 1 when t increased from 5 to 35 c fig s9 because higher t made the smz vibration intensified which weakened the stable adhesion of smz on the catalyst then the reduced smz surface concentration lowered the degradation efficiency overall the outstanding low temperature tolerance allowed u feco c to work efficiently in cold conditions the impact of solution ph on smz degradation was shown in fig 3f at the initial ph of 5 the highest efficiency was obtained with k of 10 59 min 1 when ph was decreased to 3 the catalysis was slightly depressed due to the stabilizing effect of h on pms huang et al 2017 when ph increased from 5 to 10 the smz removal rate was declined gradually the isoelectric point of u feco c was 6 61 based on the zeta potential test fig s10 increasing ph reduced the surface potential to restrain the capture of pms however even at ph 10 the smz removal ratio still reached 90 77 suggesting that u feco c possessed excellent adaptability to a wide ph range of 3 10 moreover the metal ions released from the catalyst were undetectable indicating that the strong n coordination could inhibit the metal deintercalation to evaluate the application prospect of u feco c a fluidized bed reactor was constructed for dynamic smz removal from real waters fig 3g the pms and smz solutions were pumped into the reactor with dispersed catalyst a porous titanium ti filter head was immersed below the liquid level to prevent the catalyst powder from running off the solution was extracted from the reactor after catalysis by a peristaltic pump 100 mg of commercial co3o4 30 nm and fe3o4 100 nm nanoparticles were mixed as the reference catalyst to run the reactor where smz was immediately leaked within the first 0 83 h fig 3h when only 20 mg of u feco c was loaded the smz in tap water yangtze river and yangshan lake waters was completely removed for 8 33 8 33 and 5 83 h and degraded by 90 for 14 17 14 17 and 12 50 h corresponding to the treated water amount of 1 70 1 70 and 1 50 l respectively which attested the superior ability of u feco c in continuous smz treatment besides the smz degradation was expedited by increasing catalyst dosage and pms concentration or decreasing smz concentration the catalytic activity was well maintained in five cycles with the aid of thermal regeneration the u feco c pms system also efficiently removed other pollutants including methyl orange phenol and bisphenol a figs s11 13 3 3 determination of catalytic path quenching tests were used to identify the dominant ros responsible for smz degradation ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine l h could scavenge hydroxyl and sulfate radicals oh and so4 oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively wang et al 2021 the inhibitory impacts of etoh and tba on smz decomposition were limited indicating the weak contribution of oh and so4 to the catalysis fig 4 a in the presence of p bq and l h the smz removal efficiency decreased significantly suggesting that o2 and 1o2 might dominate the oxidation electron spin resonance epr spectroscopy was employed to further detect ros in the system fig 4b with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping reagent adding u feco c to pms aqueous solution displayed distinct seven line peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 attributed to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dpmox which was often generated from the dmpo oxidation in non radical controlled systems cheng et al 2023 changing the solvent from water to methanol was utilized to detect o2 however the peaks of dmpox with markedly weakened intensity due to the depressed dmpo adsorption onto catalyst by methanol rather than the characteristic signal of dmpoo2 adduct was observed manifesting that o2 was not produced wang et al 2021 the 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was applied as the trapping agent for 1o2 because they could react to form 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempn wang et al 2021 nevertheless no exclusive three line peaks assigned to tempn appeared on the epr spectrum ruling out the existence of 1o2 the contradictory results between quenching tests and epr detections prompted us to further verify the true ros for smz degradation with molecular probes the 7 hydroxycoumarin produced by the addition reaction between coumarin and oh could emit fluorescence with the maximum wavelength at 462 80 nm wang et al 2015 however no fluorescence was detected from the u feco c pms coumarin mixture after catalysis certifying that oh was indeed unformed fig 4c the nitro blue tetrazolium chloride monohydrate nbt could be reduced by o2 to monoformazan which had a maximum absorption at 530 nm in the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum zhu et al 2021 nevertheless the peak ascribed to monoformazan did not appear after reaction indicating the absence of o2 fig 4d since 1o2 possessed a longer lifetime in heavy water d2o or tba t d2o 20 μs t tba 34 μs than in h2o t h2o 2 μs the efficiency of 1o2 controlled reaction could be improved when the solvent was changed from h2o to d2o or tba luo et al 2019 however the smz removal ratio at 6 min decreased from 97 44 in h2o to 89 02 in d2o and 59 35 in tba solution respectively indicating that 1o2 was also not involved in the reaction fig 4e therefore the strongly depressed catalysis by p bq and l h in the quenching tests should result from the direct consumption of the activated pms on u feco c surface by p bq and l h rather than the generation of o2 and 1o2 in the system which were subsequently quenched by p bq and l h the high valent metal oxo species hvmos might also induce the decomposition of organic pollutants by fe or co containing catalysts cheng et al 2023 phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso could specifically react with hvmos to produce phenyl methyl sulfone pmso2 through the oxygen transfer reaction cheng et al 2023 in high performance liquid chromatography hplc spectra the pmso and pmso2 standards were detected at 6 77 and 12 68 min respectively fig 4f for the u feco c pms pmso mixed system the pmso2 peak was not obtained during reaction suggesting that hvmos played a negligible role in smz removal with the exclusion of above ros the catalyst mediated electron transfer path cmetp for smz degradation was investigated as reported the combination of pms and active sites on catalyst surface could form high potential complexes which extracted electrons from co adsorbed organic pollutants with catalyst support as the conductor to trigger pollutant oxidation miao et al 2021 to explore the possible contribution of cmetp a galvanic cell connected by the salt bridge was constructed as fig 5 a two catalyst coated carbon cloth electrodes were linked by copper wires to form the closed circuit with a galvanometer to record the current and then placed into two half cells containing water the smz solution was first injected into one cell and stirred for 30 min to ensure adsorption equilibrium of smz onto the catalyst the pms stock solution was then added to the other cell to initiate the reaction as smz and pms were present separately smz could only be degraded through electron transfer and if the cmetp worked a current signal would appear in the circuit along with the attenuated smz concentration yang et al 2023 however no recognizable current and smz degradation were detected suggesting that cmetp was not in effect fig 5b to confirm it premixing experiments were conducted it was well documented that for cmetp controlled catalysis premixing catalysts and pms would not cause pms decomposition in the absence of contaminants because there were no pollutants as electron donors to consume the formed high potential complexes he et al 2022 consequently adding pollutants at different time points after premixing catalysts and pms would not bring obvious variation in the degradation efficiency however when smz was introduced to the solution after premixing u feco c and pms for 5 min the degradation was sharply suppressed with smz removal ratio of only 39 76 at 6 min fig 5c this indicated that even without smz the pms in u feco c pms system was still markedly decomposed which did not match the characteristics of cmetp to identify the decomposition product of pms the dissolved oxygen do content in bulk solution was monitored fig 5d during the measurement the argon tube was first submerged to remove do and then pulled up onto the water surface since argon was denser than air an argon layer was formed on top of water to prevent oxygen o2 in air from dissolving when a degassed pms solution was injected into ultrapure water the do concentration rose slightly from 0 40 to 0 50 mg l 1 in 0 5 min because the pms self decomposition reaction produced o2 eq 2 2 2 hso 5 2 hso 4 o 2 according to the henry s law the solubility of a gas in water was proportional to its partial pressure as the o2 partial pressure was close to 0 in the argon layer do would be released outside the water resulting in the subsequent gradual decline in do content inversely when pms was added into the solution with dispersed catalysts do concentration increased dramatically by 0 81 mg l 1 in 7 min this suggested that after being activated by u feco c the reactivity of surface bound pms was improved allowing it to react readily with surrounding pms to manufacture more o2 the do concentration then tended to a plateau as o2 generation and dissolving out established the balance interestingly when pms was introduced to the catalyst smz mixed solution the do increase became much weaker which implied that the surface activated pms reacted with smz more preferentially than with pms in solution thus inhibiting o2 formation the evolution of pms concentration was also recorded fig 5e the pms content in u feco c pms system was reduced quickly by 66 72 within 6 min due to the adsorption and decomposition of pms for cmetp dominated reaction adding smz could accelerate pms consumption because pms would be expended by co adsorbed smz however in the presence of smz the descending of pms concentration instead slowed down again certifying that cmetp was not responsible for smz degradation more importantly it confirmed that smz acted as a competitor over pms in solution to react with surface activated pms leading to the decelerated consumption of pms in bulk solution based on these results a new surface collision oxidation path scop was proposed in fig 5f firstly pms was adsorbed and activated by the active site the surface activated pms was thus endowed with high redox potential followed by colliding with surrounding smz molecule and directly snatching electron from it to induce the degradation unlike cmetp this process did not require the catalyst support to mediate electron transfer as the electron shuttle if the scop governed the catalysis the satisfactory catalyst dispersibility was necessary which guaranteed the quick collision of catalyst with pms and smz to account for the ultrafast smz removal therefore the settlement curves of catalysts were recorded by the uv vis spectroscopy figs s14 and 5g at the absorption wavelength of 975 nm commercial co3o4 nanoparticles 30 nm rapidly settled with the absorbance dropping by 82 30 in 30 min on the contrary the absorbance of u feco c dispersed solution maintained almost constant meanwhile after standing still for 30 min no obvious settlement was observed in the photograph fig 5g inset suggesting that u feco c could be stably dispersed in water to ensure its immediate collision with reactants moreover the chronopotentiometry curves in fig 5h showed that the potential of the catalyst coated electrode rose sharply after the addition of pms the potential increment of u feco c 0 524 v was higher than that 0 378 v of u c indicating the formation of surface activated pms with higher potential he et al 2022 the chronoamperometry curves were exhibited in fig 5i compared to the current of u c bearing electrode that of u feco c coated electrode increased more markedly after adding pms which suggested that the electron exchange between pms and fe co dual atom sites occurred intensively chen et al 2022 smz was subsequently introduced and made the current on u feco c upsurge again due to the fast electron transport when smz diffused onto the catalyst surface and reacted with the surface activated pms chen et al 2022 furthermore adding ki an indicator of surface bound ros into the u feco c pms smz system almost completely stop the reaction with only 7 56 of smz being removed at 6 min demonstrating that smz was indeed degraded by the surface activated pms fig s15 wang et al 2021 these results collectively proved that the scop was reasonable 3 4 catalytic center recognition and synergetic mechanism to ascertain whether fe co dual atom site was the catalytic center the scn poisoning test was performed scn could strongly combine with metal n c sites to prevent the pms bonding lin et al 2019 after adding scn the catalysis was nearly terminated highlighting that fe co diatomic site was definitely the active center for pms activation fig s16 this was also verified by the result that elevating the amount of fe and co precursors for synthesizing u feco c improved catalytic efficiency fig s17 theoretical calculation was conducted to gain deeper insights into the catalytic process and synergistic mechanism between bimetallic atoms flat graphene sheets with fen4 con4 and fecon6 sites were established to represent u fe c u co c and u feco c respectively the optimal adsorption structures of pms hso5 at these sites and corresponding difference charge density dcd results were shown in fig 6 a the adsorption of pms at fecon6 site contained two modes one was that the so3 fragment approached fe atom mode i and the other was that the so3 moiety was near co atom mode ii the pms adsorption energies e ads at con4 fen4 and fecon6 sites were 0 471 0 568 0 958 mode i and 0 918 mode ii ev respectively indicating that the fe co dual atom site could bind pms more firmly than single atom sites and thus form a higher pms concentration on catalyst surface to accelerate the catalysis moreover based on the bader charge and dcd analysis it was visually observed that the electron with the charge amount q of 0 736 0 802 e flowed from active sites to pms this caused the enlargement of oo bond length l oo in pms from initial 1 466 å to 1 469 1 472 å then establishing the activation state of pms with high redox potential wang et al 2021 the summed and partial density of states dos of co 3d and fe 3d orbitals were calculated in fig 6b when a metal was coordinated with pms the lone electron pair of o in pms would be donated to the metal 3d vacant orbital and the metal 3d electrons could also flow back to pms through feedback π bond therefore the dos distribution of metal 3d orbital near the fermi energy level e f determined the reactivity between metal and pms the dos of co or fe 3d orbital in fecon6 site was markedly different from that in con4 or fen4 site suggesting that the metal electronic structures were altered after forming diatomic structure meanwhile the dual atom site possessed higher dos near e f than single atom sites proving the superior reactivity of the former according to the above mentioned scop four elementary reactions were proposed to represent the whole catalytic reaction as following 3 h2so5 so5h h e 4 so5h h e so4 h2o 5 so4 h e so4h 6 so4h h e h2so4 where denoted the active site first pms was adsorbed onto the catalytic site then the dangling so5h and subsequently generated so4 groups acted as oxidants to seize electrons from pollutants finally so4h was desorbed from the catalyst to complete site regeneration the gibbs free energy profiles of the catalyses at fen4 con4 and fecon6 sites were exhibited in fig 6c the downhill free energies of the activation and oxidation steps at all sites indicated that these reactions were exothermic and proceeded spontaneously for con4 site the minimal free energy change in pms activation and the first oxidation step jointly caused its weakest catalytic activity compared with fen4 and con4 sites the greater decline in the free energy of pms activation on fecon6 site confirmed that fe and co atoms could synergistically capture and activate pms meanwhile although the two oxidation steps at fen4 and fecon6 mode ii sites were more energetically favorable than those at fecon6 mode i the desorption of so4h from the formers required more energy than the latter being 0 837 and 1 041 ev versus 0 597 ev leading to the more difficult site regeneration therefore the fecon6 site with pms adsorbed through mode i was globally optimal in free energy the species evolution of pms on fecon6 site mode i was depicted in fig 6d overall the substantially enhanced activity of dual atom fecon6 site relative to single atom fen4 or con4 site resulted from the improved pms adsorption larger near fermi level dos and suitable free energy evolution 3 5 degradation pathway and toxicity evolution to deduce the degradation pathways of smz theoretical calculations were also carried out to identify targeted sites vulnerable to ros attacks on smz molecule because smz in the u feco c pms system was decomposed through scop rather than free radical reactions the condensed fukui index f and condensed dual descriptor cdd which could point out atoms prone to undergo electrophilic reactions were calculated yang et al 2023 the f and cdd isosurfaces and values of all atoms in smz were shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the atoms with larger f or more negative cdd were more easily to react with electrophiles i e ros corresponding to the cyan areas on the f figure and blue areas on the cdd isosurface yang et al 2023 the average of f values was 0 0357 e å 3 therefore the c2 c5 n11 h12 h13 o15 o16 n17 n23 o24 atoms were most likely to be attacked and lose electrons the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms was applied to detect the degradation intermediates of smz as shown in figs s18 and s19 based on these three possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 7c in pathway i the s14 n17 bond of smz was cleaved to yield p1 and p2 p2 continued to decompose by removal of hso3 group and was oxidized to p3 in pathway ii the c5 s14 bond of smz was attacked to form p3 and the intermediate i1 i1 was further converted to p4 in pathway iii the n23 o24 bond in the oxazole ring of smz broke to produce p5 which was then decomposed into p6 and further oxidized to p3 the total organic carbon toc test showed that the mineralization ratio of smz within 6 min was 46 34 fig s20 which suggested that with the ring opening reaction and deep oxidation smz could be destroyed into small molecules and finally mineralized to evaluate the ecotoxicity of degradation products their bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicities were predicted using the toxicity estimation software tool yang et al 2023 after degradation the bioaccumulation factors of all products 0 17 10 52 were lower than that of smz 17 11 indicating the diminished ability of these chemicals to accumulate in organisms fig 7d the developmental toxicity index of smz was 0 85 which was classified as the developmental toxicant level fig 7e after catalysis the majority of products showed reduced developmental toxicity that belonged to the developmental non toxicant grade although the developmental toxicities of p5 and p6 were higher they would be sequentially converted to p3 with lower toxicity of 0 26 to visualize the toxicity evolution the mung bean cultivation experiment was conducted unprocessed and treated smz solutions were used as nutrient solutions respectively after 3 days of cultivation the growth statuses of mung beans were compared it was obvious that smz solution strongly inhibited the germination of mung beans and the average length of beansprots was only 1 79 cm fig 7f inversely the beansprots cultured with degraded solution grew vigorously with the average bud length reaching 8 77 cm these results showed that the catalytic reaction could not only eliminate smz but also reduced biological toxicity of effluents 4 conclusion this work developed a mof derived carbon supported hdac by the co adsorption pyrolysis method the obtained u feco c outperformed its homogeneous counterpart in activating pms to degrade smz the catalyst dose normalized k value reached 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeding reported values by 1 2 orders of magnitude moreover the fecon6 diatomic site possessed higher tof 13 07 min 1 than single atom fen4 and con4 sites the catalytic system maintained excellent efficiency in the presence of anions and nom and over a wide range of temperatures and ph in addition u feco c could run a fluidized bed reactor to achieve zero discharge of smz in multiple actual waters for up to 8 33 h the catalysis followed a new surface collision oxidation path where the dispersed catalyst captured pms to form surface activated pms with high potential which collided with surrounding smz and directly grabbed electron from it to complete pollutant oxidation the enhanced activity of fecon6 site originated from the diatomic synergy which induced stronger pms adsorption greater dos near fermi level and optimal global energy evolution besides u feco c enabled both smz mineralization and effective reduction of effluent biotoxicity overall this work paved the way for the rational design of hdac for efficient water decontamination and shed light on the synergetic pms activation mechanism on dual atom sites credit authorship contribution statement changqing zhu conceptualization data curation

14706,heterogeneous catalysts lag far behind their homogeneous counterparts in activating peroxymonosulfate pms for water decontamination due to the low site intrinsic activity and sluggish mass transfer the single atom catalyst can bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts but the difficulty to break scaling relations originating from the site monotony restricts further efficiency upgradation herein through modulating the crystallinity of nh2 uio 66 a porous carbon support with ultrahigh surface area 1721 71 m2 g 1 is obtained to anchor the dual atom fecon6 site which exhibits superior turnover frequency over single atom fen4 and con4 sites 13 07 versus 9 97 9 07 min 1 the as synthesized composite thus outperforms the homogeneous catalytic system fe3 co2 for sulfamethoxazole smz degradation and the catalyst dose normalized kinetic rate constant 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeds reported values by 1 2 orders of magnitude moreover only 20 mg of the catalyst can run a fluidized bed reactor to realize continuous zero discharge of smz in multiple actual waters for up to 8 33 h unlike all reported reaction routes the catalysis on the diatomic site follows a new surface collision oxidation path i e the dispersed catalyst adsorbs pms to generate surface activated pms with high potential which collides with surrounding smz and directly seizes electron from it to induce pollutant oxidation theoretical calculation indicates that the enhanced activity of fecon6 site stems from the diatomic synergy leading to stronger pms adsorption larger near fermi level density of states and optimal global gibbs free energy evolution overall this work provides an effective strategy of constructing heterogeneous dual atom catalyst pms process to achieve faster pollution control than homogeneous system and sheds light on the interatomic synergetic mechanism for pms activation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollution control advanced oxidation process dual atom catalyst peroxymonosulfate diatomic synergy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ever growing demand for clean water and safe eco environment stimulates the upgradation of wastewater treatment technologies dias et al 2023 among them the advanced oxidation process aop is powerful in degrading refractory organic pollutants to reduce the effluent toxicity hodges et al 2018 peroxymonosulfate pms with a reactive oo bond in the asymmetric structure is widely employed to initiate aop owing to the simplicity of its activation li et al 2023 compared with homogeneous systems utilizing heat light or metal ions to activate pms the heterogeneous catalysis possesses prominent merits including neglectable energy expenditure and convenient catalyst recycling gujar et al 2022 however limited by the low site intrinsic activity and sluggish mass transfer heterogeneous catalysts still lag far behind homogeneous ones in terms of the catalytic efficiency qian et al 2021 this dims their application prospects because more catalysts are required to ensure the treatment effectiveness promoting the kinetic rate of heterogeneous catalysts to approach or even surpass that of homogeneous catalysts is thus of great necessity but remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate structural design strategy recently the single atom catalysts sacs featuring atomically dispersed metal sites have demonstrated excellent pms activation efficiency because of the unsaturated metal coordination structure and maximum atom utilization li et al 2018 moreover sacs can bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by integrating the well defined quasi homogeneous sites into solid materials weon et al 2020 consequently an ideal platform can be constructed by sacs to precisely explore the heterogeneous structure activity relationship at the atomic level which in turn provides valid guidance for the catalyst structure design guo et al 2019 gao et al tuned the metal center atom mn fe co ni cu of carbon supported sacs and established the relation between the metal kind and catalytic performance gao et al 2021 the fe sac was found to possess higher activity than co sac while co2 was better than fe2 in homogeneous systems for pms assisted pollutant degradation gao et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 although this work and other frontier researches proposed various regulatory strategies to enhance the intrinsic activity of sacs the inherent defects of sacs in catalyzing complex reactions could not be overcome an et al 2023 due to the structural monotony of active sites sacs suffer from the limitation of scaling relations between the adsorption energies of similar adsorbates i e the adsorptions of an adsorbate and its derived molecules on the identical site are either all strong or all weak zhang et al 2023 this makes it difficult for sacs to find a thermodynamic balance between strongly adsorbing reactants efficiently activating intermediates and easily desorbing products ying et al 2021 therefore in the complicated pms based catalytic oxidation process involving multiple intermediates e g so4 oh o and reaction steps energetically unfavorable step or high energy barrier may exist which causes the hardship of sacs to break the kinetic constraint and further improve the catalytic efficiency gao et al 2021 mi et al 2021 a promising approach to tackle this issue is introducing another metal atom into the active center of sacs to form heteronuclear dual atom catalysts hdacs which contain two different metal atoms in one site sun et al 2023 when the metal spacing matches with the size of pms molecule the metal dimers can act as two collaborative grippers to strongly adsorb pms consequently generating high surface concentration of oxidants cheng et al 2023 wang et al 2022 meanwhile the increased site area and asymmetric electron distribution of the paired metal center can provide a variety of options for the bonding and activation of different intermediates products derived from pms which is conducive to accelerating the rate determining step and optimizing the global energy configuration sun et al 2022 besides the construction of above hdacs to boost the intrinsic activity of catalytic sites the selection of supports is also crucial because ideal supports can supply suitable microenvironments for the efficient operation of active centers zhu et al 2020 among various candidates the carbon matrix derived from metal organic frameworks mofs can inherit the large surface area and abundant pores which enable high degree of site exposure and unimpeded mass transfer wang et al 2020a although mofs derived carbon supported hdacs have recently displayed enhanced catalytic activity in the field of energy conversion the research on their feasibility in activating pms to fleetly decompose contaminants is still in its infancy fan et al 2023 liu et al 2022 more importantly whether bimetallic atoms have synergistic effect in promoting reaction kinetics and the associated catalytic mechanism remain ambiguous which deserves further exploration in this work a porous carbon matrix with fe co diatomic sites was synthesized by a co adsorption pyrolysis strategy using low crystallinity nh2 uio 66 as the precursor the as obtained composite not only owned higher efficiency than fe co sacs and its homogeneous counterpart for sulfamethoxazole smz as model pollutant degradation via pms activation but also exhibited superior performance beyond reported state of the art catalysts besides a fluidized bed reactor was constructed to evaluate its dynamic smz removal effectiveness in actual waters chemical quenching tests electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular probe experiments were conducted to identify the predominant reactive oxygen species ros by means of dissolved oxygen monitoring electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculation a new surface collision oxidation path for smz elimination was discovered the interaction behavior between pms and smz on the dual atom site and fe co synergistic mechanism for ultrafast catalytic kinetics were thoroughly revealed the smz degradation pathways and effluent biotoxicity were also investigated overall this work could guide the rational design of hdacs for efficient pms activation and advance the atom level mechanism understanding of pms based aop 2 material and methods the details of chemicals and materials material preparation and characterizations catalytic degradation procedure analytic methods and computational methods were presented in texts s1 s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization the hdac with atomically dispersed fe co sites on porous carbon support was synthesized by a co adsorption pyrolysis strategy firstly zirconium chloride zrcl4 and 2 amino 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid nh2 h2bdc were assembled to yellowish nh2 uio 66 via the solvothermal reaction fig s1 subsequently fe2 and co2 were synchronously adsorbed into the mof with nh2 group on its ligand to yield a yellow green composite u feco laying the foundation for forming bimetallic sites in the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra the peaks at 1060 8 and 3362 2 cm 1 were ascribed to nh2 rocking and stretching vibrations respectively fig s2 wang et al 2020b they were shifted down to 1059 9 and 3351 4 cm 1 after metal adsorption respectively confirming the metal complexation with nh2 next the u feco was pyrolyzed during which the strong n coordination and micropore confinement prevented metal atoms from agglomerating into nanoparticles zhang et al 2019 contrarily abundant zro2 nanoparticles of 10 nm were generated in the carbon matrix due to the high zr content in the precursor as evidenced by the transmission scanning electron microscopy tem sem and x ray diffraction xrd pattern fig s3 by eliminating zro2 with hf solution the fe co hdac u feco c was eventually obtained for preparing nh2 uio 66 acids were usually used to depress the ionization of cooh on the ligand which could slow down the coordination process and improve the assembly accuracy to obtain high crystallinity mof fig s4 lin et al 2019 however acids were designedly unused in our synthesis consequently zrcl4 and nh2 h2bdc rapidly polymerized into large aggregations with low crystallinity fig s4 as shown in fig 1 a u feco c inherited the irregular morphology of nh2 uio 66 after pyrolysis contrarily the u feco c synthesized with formic acid denoted as u feco c acid presented a well defined polyhedron appearance fig 1b interestingly the specific surface area and pore volume of u feco c reached 1721 71 m2 g 1 and 1 39 cm3 g 1 respectively much higher than those 856 76 m2 g 1 and 0 65 cm3 g 1 of u feco c acid fig 1c table s1 the pore diameters of the former centered at 1 37 and 3 69 nm were also obviously larger than those of the latter fig 1c inset these suggested that compared to the rigid frame with high crystallinity the relatively disordered structure of nh2 uio 66 favors the generation of carbon support with augmented surface area and pore size which gave rise to higher site accessibility and enlarged channels for mass transfer in the high resolution tem hrtem image of u feco c the lattice fringes belonging to fe co containing crystals did not appear while the associated characteristic diffraction spots were also absent in the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig s5 besides except the peak around 23 6 ascribed to the 002 lattice plane of graphitic carbon no signals derived from metal crystals were detected in the xrd pattern of u feco c fig s6 miao et al 2021 these results jointly implied that fe and co species existed as isolated atoms rather than nanoparticles in the catalyst the spherical aberration corrected high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy sachaadf stem in fig 1d clearly revealed abundant coupled bright spots distributed on the carbon support which were highlighted with red circles and identified as the bimetallic atom pairs based on the distinct contrast between heavy metals and light carbon element li et al 2021 the spacings of two randomly selected atom pairs labeled as a1 a2 and b1 b2 were measured and they were both about 0 24 nm apart fig 1e furthermore 30 atom pairs were chosen for statistical analysis the gauss fitting testified that their distances were concentrated at 0 241 nm 2 41 å accounting for 51 13 of all tested pairs fig 1f the haadf micrograph and elemental mapping of u feco c manifested the homogenous distribution of fe co n and c elements over the entire architecture fig 1g the appearance of both fe and co signals hinted that fe co dual atom sites were successfully embedded into n doped carbon framework han et al 2021 for comparison the single atom catalysts u fe c u co c were also synthesized with the sem and tem images shown in fig s7 in the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum of u feco c the high resolution n 1 s peak was deconvoluted into five peaks at 398 21 399 02 400 62 401 72 and 404 65 ev which were assigned to pyridinic n metal n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively suggesting the presence of fe co n complex fig s8 chu et al 2021 the metal local coordination structure and valence state of samples were determined by the x ray absorption fine structure xafs spectroscopy the rising edge in the normalized fe k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes curve of u fe c was located between those of fe foil and fe3o4 indicating the average fe valence state δ between 0 and 8 3 fig 2 a lin et al 2019 for u feco c the fe k edge xanes spectrum almost coincided with that of fe2o3 manifesting its fe valence state approaching 3 the k 3 weighted fe k edge spectra for fourier transformed extended xafs ft exafs were displayed in fig 2b in u fe c the main peak assigned to the fe n coordination was observed around 1 50 å while no fe fe signal at 2 21 å was detected indicating the atomically dispersion of fe species lin et al 2019 besides the peak associated with the fe n coordination another distinct peak attributed to the fe metal scattering appeared at approximately 2 21 å for u feco c implying the possible formation of dual atom fe co bond han et al 2019 the exafs fitting with fe n and or fe co paths was conducted to obtain the quantitative coordination configuration the average n coordination number of fe center in u fe c was 4 1 which suggested that fe species mainly existed as the fen4 structure table s2 for u feco c the average n and co numbers surrounding fe atom were 4 2 and 0 9 respectively with the bond length of fe co pair calculated as 2 42 å fig 2c similar analyses were performed for the co k edge xafs data of u co c and u feco c the co valence state in u co c was between 0 and 2 and the co species were anchored on the carbon matrix as single atom con4 form without the presence of co co signal fig 2d e and table s2 the co atom in u feco c with 2 δ 8 3 was coordinated by 4 1 n atoms and 1 1 fe atom averagely with the co fe bond length of 2 40 å fig 2d f additionally the wavelet transform wt contour plots were exhibited in fig 2g the fe species in u feco c demonstrated a main intensity maximum at 6 41 å 1 and a weak one at 9 34 å 1 which represented the fe n coordination and fe co scattering respectively the co atom in u feco c displayed intensity maximum at 5 60 å 1 reflecting the co n coordination the extra intensity at 7 36 å 1 was ascribed to the co fe coordination based on these results the atomically dispersed fe co pair was evidenced and deduced to be present as the fecon6 structure to testify it a fecon6 model was constructed and optimized by theoretical calculation as fig 2f inset the simulated fe co bond length of 2 40 å matched well with the measured fe co spacing of 2 41 å fig 1f and exafs fitted values of 2 42 or 2 40 å corroborating the rationality of fecon6 structure 3 2 catalytic performance the activity of as synthesized catalysts was evaluated by degrading smz via pms activation fig 3 a the single pms failed to remove smz 2 indicating the negligible oxidation capacity of pms alone in contrast the combination of catalysts and pms resulted in a significant decrease in smz concentration the carbonized nh2 uio 66 without loading metals u c decomposed 72 16 of smz within 6 min after loading co or fe the u co c and u fe c increased smz degradation ratios to 77 28 and 91 33 respectively suggesting the high reactivity of single atom metal n c sites notably the u feco c containing both fe and co exhibited the best performance with eliminating 97 44 of smz at 6 min meanwhile a markedly suppressed efficiency was observed for u feco c acid which in turn proved that the high surface area and poriness of u feco c favored site exposure and mass transfer as well as improved smz adsorption capacity 198 56 versus 148 72 mg g 1 thus accelerating the catalysis moreover the fe and co contents in u feco c were measured as 1 50 and 1 67 wt by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes the corresponding concentrations of fe3 1 20 mg l 1 and co2 1 34 mg l 1 ions were used to construct a homogeneous catalytic system with pms which only removed 40 39 of smz in 6 min this suggested that the heterogeneous catalytic efficiency of u feco c surpassed that of metal ions pms homogeneous system noted that the above reduction in smz concentration was mainly attributed to degradation because mixtures containing catalyst powders and solution were injected into methanol during sampling which desorbed 95 of smz from catalysts thus excluding the contribution of adsorption to smz removal the reaction data were fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic equation with the rate constant k and smz decomposition half life t 1 2 shown in fig 3b the k values of different catalysts obeyed the order of fe3 co2 0 09 min 1 u c 0 48 min 1 u feco c acid 1 75 min 1 u co c 2 34 min 1 u fe c 5 67 min 1 u feco c 7 94 min 1 while t 1 2 followed the opposite sequence noteworthily the catalyst dose normalized k value of u feco c 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeded those of reported heterogeneous catalysts by 1 2 orders of magnitude under comparable concentration ratios of pms to smz testifying the ultrahigh efficiency of diatomic site for pms activation fig 3c table s3 additionally the fe and co amounts in u fe c and u co c were also detected by icp aes as 1 84 and 1 75 wt respectively the turnover frequency tof min 1 of each catalytic site which represented the intrinsic activity was then calculated with eq 1 wang et al 2022 1 tof δ n pollutant m metal m 0 w metal δ t where δn pollutant mol l 1 m metal g mol 1 m 0 g l 1 w metal wt and δt min denoted the mole concentration of pollutant converted relative atomic mass of metal catalyst dosage mass content of metal in the catalyst and reaction time respectively since most smz was degraded within the first 15 s the chosen δt was set as 0 25 min meanwhile because the mole numbers of fe and co in u feco c were different the molar concentration m 0 w metal m metal of fe co diatomic sites was considered as 21 43 µmol l 1 assuming that all fe atoms were paired with co the tofs of u co c u fe c and u feco c were 9 07 9 97 and 13 07 min 1 respectively which demonstrated the higher intrinsic activity of dual atom site than single atom sites the influence of inorganic anions with the concentration of 500 mmol l 1 which surpassed those used in most reports on smz degradation was investigated fig 3d no3 and h2po4 exerted limited inhibition to smz elimination so4 2 reduced smz degradation ratio to 85 18 due to its strong site competition against pms hco3 also delayed the catalysis with removing 70 58 of smz in 6 min possibly because the hydrolysis of hco3 increased solution ph to 8 15 and thus reduced the positive surface potential to depress pms adsorption surprisingly cl greatly expedited the reaction with smz being completely degraded in 15 s which should result from the generation of highly reactive hclo by cl and catalyst activated pms for smz oxidation luo et al 2019 in addition natural organic matter nom 20 mg l 1 slightly decreased smz removal ratio to 91 79 suggesting the excellent anti interference ability of u feco c the effect of reaction temperature t on the catalytic activity was exhibited in fig 3e with t rising from 5 to 35 c the k value decreased monotonously from 8 17 to 6 91 min 1 which was opposite to the reported rule wang and wang 2020 the whole reaction involved the surface adsorption and chemical oxidation of contaminants and increasing t could accelerate the chemical oxidation by affording reactants more energy to cross the activation energy barrier therefore the reduced efficiency at higher t should stem from the deterioration of smz adsorption indeed the smz adsorption capacity of u feco c declined from 214 98 to 191 20 mg g 1 when t increased from 5 to 35 c fig s9 because higher t made the smz vibration intensified which weakened the stable adhesion of smz on the catalyst then the reduced smz surface concentration lowered the degradation efficiency overall the outstanding low temperature tolerance allowed u feco c to work efficiently in cold conditions the impact of solution ph on smz degradation was shown in fig 3f at the initial ph of 5 the highest efficiency was obtained with k of 10 59 min 1 when ph was decreased to 3 the catalysis was slightly depressed due to the stabilizing effect of h on pms huang et al 2017 when ph increased from 5 to 10 the smz removal rate was declined gradually the isoelectric point of u feco c was 6 61 based on the zeta potential test fig s10 increasing ph reduced the surface potential to restrain the capture of pms however even at ph 10 the smz removal ratio still reached 90 77 suggesting that u feco c possessed excellent adaptability to a wide ph range of 3 10 moreover the metal ions released from the catalyst were undetectable indicating that the strong n coordination could inhibit the metal deintercalation to evaluate the application prospect of u feco c a fluidized bed reactor was constructed for dynamic smz removal from real waters fig 3g the pms and smz solutions were pumped into the reactor with dispersed catalyst a porous titanium ti filter head was immersed below the liquid level to prevent the catalyst powder from running off the solution was extracted from the reactor after catalysis by a peristaltic pump 100 mg of commercial co3o4 30 nm and fe3o4 100 nm nanoparticles were mixed as the reference catalyst to run the reactor where smz was immediately leaked within the first 0 83 h fig 3h when only 20 mg of u feco c was loaded the smz in tap water yangtze river and yangshan lake waters was completely removed for 8 33 8 33 and 5 83 h and degraded by 90 for 14 17 14 17 and 12 50 h corresponding to the treated water amount of 1 70 1 70 and 1 50 l respectively which attested the superior ability of u feco c in continuous smz treatment besides the smz degradation was expedited by increasing catalyst dosage and pms concentration or decreasing smz concentration the catalytic activity was well maintained in five cycles with the aid of thermal regeneration the u feco c pms system also efficiently removed other pollutants including methyl orange phenol and bisphenol a figs s11 13 3 3 determination of catalytic path quenching tests were used to identify the dominant ros responsible for smz degradation ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine l h could scavenge hydroxyl and sulfate radicals oh and so4 oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively wang et al 2021 the inhibitory impacts of etoh and tba on smz decomposition were limited indicating the weak contribution of oh and so4 to the catalysis fig 4 a in the presence of p bq and l h the smz removal efficiency decreased significantly suggesting that o2 and 1o2 might dominate the oxidation electron spin resonance epr spectroscopy was employed to further detect ros in the system fig 4b with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping reagent adding u feco c to pms aqueous solution displayed distinct seven line peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 attributed to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dpmox which was often generated from the dmpo oxidation in non radical controlled systems cheng et al 2023 changing the solvent from water to methanol was utilized to detect o2 however the peaks of dmpox with markedly weakened intensity due to the depressed dmpo adsorption onto catalyst by methanol rather than the characteristic signal of dmpoo2 adduct was observed manifesting that o2 was not produced wang et al 2021 the 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was applied as the trapping agent for 1o2 because they could react to form 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempn wang et al 2021 nevertheless no exclusive three line peaks assigned to tempn appeared on the epr spectrum ruling out the existence of 1o2 the contradictory results between quenching tests and epr detections prompted us to further verify the true ros for smz degradation with molecular probes the 7 hydroxycoumarin produced by the addition reaction between coumarin and oh could emit fluorescence with the maximum wavelength at 462 80 nm wang et al 2015 however no fluorescence was detected from the u feco c pms coumarin mixture after catalysis certifying that oh was indeed unformed fig 4c the nitro blue tetrazolium chloride monohydrate nbt could be reduced by o2 to monoformazan which had a maximum absorption at 530 nm in the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum zhu et al 2021 nevertheless the peak ascribed to monoformazan did not appear after reaction indicating the absence of o2 fig 4d since 1o2 possessed a longer lifetime in heavy water d2o or tba t d2o 20 μs t tba 34 μs than in h2o t h2o 2 μs the efficiency of 1o2 controlled reaction could be improved when the solvent was changed from h2o to d2o or tba luo et al 2019 however the smz removal ratio at 6 min decreased from 97 44 in h2o to 89 02 in d2o and 59 35 in tba solution respectively indicating that 1o2 was also not involved in the reaction fig 4e therefore the strongly depressed catalysis by p bq and l h in the quenching tests should result from the direct consumption of the activated pms on u feco c surface by p bq and l h rather than the generation of o2 and 1o2 in the system which were subsequently quenched by p bq and l h the high valent metal oxo species hvmos might also induce the decomposition of organic pollutants by fe or co containing catalysts cheng et al 2023 phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso could specifically react with hvmos to produce phenyl methyl sulfone pmso2 through the oxygen transfer reaction cheng et al 2023 in high performance liquid chromatography hplc spectra the pmso and pmso2 standards were detected at 6 77 and 12 68 min respectively fig 4f for the u feco c pms pmso mixed system the pmso2 peak was not obtained during reaction suggesting that hvmos played a negligible role in smz removal with the exclusion of above ros the catalyst mediated electron transfer path cmetp for smz degradation was investigated as reported the combination of pms and active sites on catalyst surface could form high potential complexes which extracted electrons from co adsorbed organic pollutants with catalyst support as the conductor to trigger pollutant oxidation miao et al 2021 to explore the possible contribution of cmetp a galvanic cell connected by the salt bridge was constructed as fig 5 a two catalyst coated carbon cloth electrodes were linked by copper wires to form the closed circuit with a galvanometer to record the current and then placed into two half cells containing water the smz solution was first injected into one cell and stirred for 30 min to ensure adsorption equilibrium of smz onto the catalyst the pms stock solution was then added to the other cell to initiate the reaction as smz and pms were present separately smz could only be degraded through electron transfer and if the cmetp worked a current signal would appear in the circuit along with the attenuated smz concentration yang et al 2023 however no recognizable current and smz degradation were detected suggesting that cmetp was not in effect fig 5b to confirm it premixing experiments were conducted it was well documented that for cmetp controlled catalysis premixing catalysts and pms would not cause pms decomposition in the absence of contaminants because there were no pollutants as electron donors to consume the formed high potential complexes he et al 2022 consequently adding pollutants at different time points after premixing catalysts and pms would not bring obvious variation in the degradation efficiency however when smz was introduced to the solution after premixing u feco c and pms for 5 min the degradation was sharply suppressed with smz removal ratio of only 39 76 at 6 min fig 5c this indicated that even without smz the pms in u feco c pms system was still markedly decomposed which did not match the characteristics of cmetp to identify the decomposition product of pms the dissolved oxygen do content in bulk solution was monitored fig 5d during the measurement the argon tube was first submerged to remove do and then pulled up onto the water surface since argon was denser than air an argon layer was formed on top of water to prevent oxygen o2 in air from dissolving when a degassed pms solution was injected into ultrapure water the do concentration rose slightly from 0 40 to 0 50 mg l 1 in 0 5 min because the pms self decomposition reaction produced o2 eq 2 2 2 hso 5 2 hso 4 o 2 according to the henry s law the solubility of a gas in water was proportional to its partial pressure as the o2 partial pressure was close to 0 in the argon layer do would be released outside the water resulting in the subsequent gradual decline in do content inversely when pms was added into the solution with dispersed catalysts do concentration increased dramatically by 0 81 mg l 1 in 7 min this suggested that after being activated by u feco c the reactivity of surface bound pms was improved allowing it to react readily with surrounding pms to manufacture more o2 the do concentration then tended to a plateau as o2 generation and dissolving out established the balance interestingly when pms was introduced to the catalyst smz mixed solution the do increase became much weaker which implied that the surface activated pms reacted with smz more preferentially than with pms in solution thus inhibiting o2 formation the evolution of pms concentration was also recorded fig 5e the pms content in u feco c pms system was reduced quickly by 66 72 within 6 min due to the adsorption and decomposition of pms for cmetp dominated reaction adding smz could accelerate pms consumption because pms would be expended by co adsorbed smz however in the presence of smz the descending of pms concentration instead slowed down again certifying that cmetp was not responsible for smz degradation more importantly it confirmed that smz acted as a competitor over pms in solution to react with surface activated pms leading to the decelerated consumption of pms in bulk solution based on these results a new surface collision oxidation path scop was proposed in fig 5f firstly pms was adsorbed and activated by the active site the surface activated pms was thus endowed with high redox potential followed by colliding with surrounding smz molecule and directly snatching electron from it to induce the degradation unlike cmetp this process did not require the catalyst support to mediate electron transfer as the electron shuttle if the scop governed the catalysis the satisfactory catalyst dispersibility was necessary which guaranteed the quick collision of catalyst with pms and smz to account for the ultrafast smz removal therefore the settlement curves of catalysts were recorded by the uv vis spectroscopy figs s14 and 5g at the absorption wavelength of 975 nm commercial co3o4 nanoparticles 30 nm rapidly settled with the absorbance dropping by 82 30 in 30 min on the contrary the absorbance of u feco c dispersed solution maintained almost constant meanwhile after standing still for 30 min no obvious settlement was observed in the photograph fig 5g inset suggesting that u feco c could be stably dispersed in water to ensure its immediate collision with reactants moreover the chronopotentiometry curves in fig 5h showed that the potential of the catalyst coated electrode rose sharply after the addition of pms the potential increment of u feco c 0 524 v was higher than that 0 378 v of u c indicating the formation of surface activated pms with higher potential he et al 2022 the chronoamperometry curves were exhibited in fig 5i compared to the current of u c bearing electrode that of u feco c coated electrode increased more markedly after adding pms which suggested that the electron exchange between pms and fe co dual atom sites occurred intensively chen et al 2022 smz was subsequently introduced and made the current on u feco c upsurge again due to the fast electron transport when smz diffused onto the catalyst surface and reacted with the surface activated pms chen et al 2022 furthermore adding ki an indicator of surface bound ros into the u feco c pms smz system almost completely stop the reaction with only 7 56 of smz being removed at 6 min demonstrating that smz was indeed degraded by the surface activated pms fig s15 wang et al 2021 these results collectively proved that the scop was reasonable 3 4 catalytic center recognition and synergetic mechanism to ascertain whether fe co dual atom site was the catalytic center the scn poisoning test was performed scn could strongly combine with metal n c sites to prevent the pms bonding lin et al 2019 after adding scn the catalysis was nearly terminated highlighting that fe co diatomic site was definitely the active center for pms activation fig s16 this was also verified by the result that elevating the amount of fe and co precursors for synthesizing u feco c improved catalytic efficiency fig s17 theoretical calculation was conducted to gain deeper insights into the catalytic process and synergistic mechanism between bimetallic atoms flat graphene sheets with fen4 con4 and fecon6 sites were established to represent u fe c u co c and u feco c respectively the optimal adsorption structures of pms hso5 at these sites and corresponding difference charge density dcd results were shown in fig 6 a the adsorption of pms at fecon6 site contained two modes one was that the so3 fragment approached fe atom mode i and the other was that the so3 moiety was near co atom mode ii the pms adsorption energies e ads at con4 fen4 and fecon6 sites were 0 471 0 568 0 958 mode i and 0 918 mode ii ev respectively indicating that the fe co dual atom site could bind pms more firmly than single atom sites and thus form a higher pms concentration on catalyst surface to accelerate the catalysis moreover based on the bader charge and dcd analysis it was visually observed that the electron with the charge amount q of 0 736 0 802 e flowed from active sites to pms this caused the enlargement of oo bond length l oo in pms from initial 1 466 å to 1 469 1 472 å then establishing the activation state of pms with high redox potential wang et al 2021 the summed and partial density of states dos of co 3d and fe 3d orbitals were calculated in fig 6b when a metal was coordinated with pms the lone electron pair of o in pms would be donated to the metal 3d vacant orbital and the metal 3d electrons could also flow back to pms through feedback π bond therefore the dos distribution of metal 3d orbital near the fermi energy level e f determined the reactivity between metal and pms the dos of co or fe 3d orbital in fecon6 site was markedly different from that in con4 or fen4 site suggesting that the metal electronic structures were altered after forming diatomic structure meanwhile the dual atom site possessed higher dos near e f than single atom sites proving the superior reactivity of the former according to the above mentioned scop four elementary reactions were proposed to represent the whole catalytic reaction as following 3 h2so5 so5h h e 4 so5h h e so4 h2o 5 so4 h e so4h 6 so4h h e h2so4 where denoted the active site first pms was adsorbed onto the catalytic site then the dangling so5h and subsequently generated so4 groups acted as oxidants to seize electrons from pollutants finally so4h was desorbed from the catalyst to complete site regeneration the gibbs free energy profiles of the catalyses at fen4 con4 and fecon6 sites were exhibited in fig 6c the downhill free energies of the activation and oxidation steps at all sites indicated that these reactions were exothermic and proceeded spontaneously for con4 site the minimal free energy change in pms activation and the first oxidation step jointly caused its weakest catalytic activity compared with fen4 and con4 sites the greater decline in the free energy of pms activation on fecon6 site confirmed that fe and co atoms could synergistically capture and activate pms meanwhile although the two oxidation steps at fen4 and fecon6 mode ii sites were more energetically favorable than those at fecon6 mode i the desorption of so4h from the formers required more energy than the latter being 0 837 and 1 041 ev versus 0 597 ev leading to the more difficult site regeneration therefore the fecon6 site with pms adsorbed through mode i was globally optimal in free energy the species evolution of pms on fecon6 site mode i was depicted in fig 6d overall the substantially enhanced activity of dual atom fecon6 site relative to single atom fen4 or con4 site resulted from the improved pms adsorption larger near fermi level dos and suitable free energy evolution 3 5 degradation pathway and toxicity evolution to deduce the degradation pathways of smz theoretical calculations were also carried out to identify targeted sites vulnerable to ros attacks on smz molecule because smz in the u feco c pms system was decomposed through scop rather than free radical reactions the condensed fukui index f and condensed dual descriptor cdd which could point out atoms prone to undergo electrophilic reactions were calculated yang et al 2023 the f and cdd isosurfaces and values of all atoms in smz were shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the atoms with larger f or more negative cdd were more easily to react with electrophiles i e ros corresponding to the cyan areas on the f figure and blue areas on the cdd isosurface yang et al 2023 the average of f values was 0 0357 e å 3 therefore the c2 c5 n11 h12 h13 o15 o16 n17 n23 o24 atoms were most likely to be attacked and lose electrons the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms was applied to detect the degradation intermediates of smz as shown in figs s18 and s19 based on these three possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 7c in pathway i the s14 n17 bond of smz was cleaved to yield p1 and p2 p2 continued to decompose by removal of hso3 group and was oxidized to p3 in pathway ii the c5 s14 bond of smz was attacked to form p3 and the intermediate i1 i1 was further converted to p4 in pathway iii the n23 o24 bond in the oxazole ring of smz broke to produce p5 which was then decomposed into p6 and further oxidized to p3 the total organic carbon toc test showed that the mineralization ratio of smz within 6 min was 46 34 fig s20 which suggested that with the ring opening reaction and deep oxidation smz could be destroyed into small molecules and finally mineralized to evaluate the ecotoxicity of degradation products their bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicities were predicted using the toxicity estimation software tool yang et al 2023 after degradation the bioaccumulation factors of all products 0 17 10 52 were lower than that of smz 17 11 indicating the diminished ability of these chemicals to accumulate in organisms fig 7d the developmental toxicity index of smz was 0 85 which was classified as the developmental toxicant level fig 7e after catalysis the majority of products showed reduced developmental toxicity that belonged to the developmental non toxicant grade although the developmental toxicities of p5 and p6 were higher they would be sequentially converted to p3 with lower toxicity of 0 26 to visualize the toxicity evolution the mung bean cultivation experiment was conducted unprocessed and treated smz solutions were used as nutrient solutions respectively after 3 days of cultivation the growth statuses of mung beans were compared it was obvious that smz solution strongly inhibited the germination of mung beans and the average length of beansprots was only 1 79 cm fig 7f inversely the beansprots cultured with degraded solution grew vigorously with the average bud length reaching 8 77 cm these results showed that the catalytic reaction could not only eliminate smz but also reduced biological toxicity of effluents 4 conclusion this work developed a mof derived carbon supported hdac by the co adsorption pyrolysis method the obtained u feco c outperformed its homogeneous counterpart in activating pms to degrade smz the catalyst dose normalized k value reached 99 26 l min 1 g 1 exceeding reported values by 1 2 orders of magnitude moreover the fecon6 diatomic site possessed higher tof 13 07 min 1 than single atom fen4 and con4 sites the catalytic system maintained excellent efficiency in the presence of anions and nom and over a wide range of temperatures and ph in addition u feco c could run a fluidized bed reactor to achieve zero discharge of smz in multiple actual waters for up to 8 33 h the catalysis followed a new surface collision oxidation path where the dispersed catalyst captured pms to form surface activated pms with high potential which collided with surrounding smz and directly grabbed electron from it to complete pollutant oxidation the enhanced activity of fecon6 site originated from the diatomic synergy which induced stronger pms adsorption greater dos near fermi level and optimal global energy evolution besides u feco c enabled both smz mineralization and effective reduction of effluent biotoxicity overall this work paved the way for the rational design of hdac for efficient water decontamination and shed light on the synergetic pms activation mechanism on dual atom sites credit authorship contribution statement changqing zhu conceptualization data curation

14707,pharmaceuticals are known to widely occur in the environment and to affect the health of ecosystems sewage treatment plants stps are main emission pathways for pharmaceuticals which are often not sufficiently removed during wastewater treatment in europe stp treatment requirements are specified under the urban wastewater treatment directive uwwtd the introduction of advanced treatment techniques such as ozonation and activated carbon under the uwwtd is expected to be an important option to reduce pharmaceutical emissions in this study we present a european wide analysis of stps

the effectiveness at full uwwtd compliance and 3 the effectiveness when advanced treatment is implemented at stps with a treatment capacity of 100 000 person equivalents based on a literature study the potential of individual stps to reduce pharmaceutical emissions ranged from an average of 9 for stps with primary treatment to 84 for stps applying advanced treatment results of our calculations show that european wide emission of pharmaceuticals can be reduced with 68 when large stps are updated with advanced treatment but spatial differences exist we argue that adequate attention should also be paid with regards to preventing environmental impacts of stps with a capacity 100 000 p e circa 44 of total stp effluent is emitted near natura2000 sites eu nature protection areas of all surface waters receiving stp effluent for which the ecological status has been assessed under the water framework directive 77 have a status of less than good relatively often only primary treatment

pharmaceuticals help to increase the longevity and quality of life for many people however the widespread use of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals also results in releases to the aquatic environment aus der beek et al 2016 this is of concern as most pharmaceuticals are designed to be highly active at low concentrations and resistant to biodegradation khetan and collins 2007 active pharmaceutical ingredients and their transformation products have widely been detected in surface water groundwater and drinking water houtman et al 2014 schulze et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 at some locations pharmaceuticals are already present at levels deemed unsafe classifying them as a global threat to both human and environmental health wilkinson et al 2022 the global consumption of pharmaceuticals has increased over the last decades klein et al 2018 and is expected to rise further due to multiple factors including changes and innovations in clinical practices ageing populations and higher market availability potentially amplifying already existing environmental concentrations belloni et al 2016 bernhardt et al 2017 bunke et al 2019 nagesh et al 2022 oecd 2021 pharmaceuticals may be emitted as a result from production patient excretion and incorrect disposal straub 2016 in order to protect water sources from pharmaceutical pollution multiple actions can be taken over the

they are more cost effective puhlmann et al 2021 via patient excrements pharmaceuticals and their metabolites can enter the wastewater systems where they are not sufficiently removed and are consequently released into the environment luo et al 2014 end of pipe measures such as the treatment of wastewater will remain indispensable as it is clear that pharmaceuticals will continue to be needed and will thus continue to be released into the wastewater kümmerer et al 2018 sewage treatment plants stps are of special relevance as households are seen as one of the most important emission sources of pharmaceuticals to wastewater adeleye et al 2022 comber et al 2015 michael et al 2013 except for specific types of pharmaceuticals which are mainly emitted via hospitals and health institutions herrmann et al 2015 le corre et al 2012 in the eu the water framework directive wfd is implemented to protect surface waters transitional waters coastal waters and groundwater directive 2000 60 ec a key aim of the wfd is to achieve a good ecological status for all water bodies which is influenced amongst others by water quality measurements according to the wfd regularly take place within natura2000 sites a network of key breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species and some rare natural habitat types that the wfd annex v no 1 3 5 specifically refers to a good ecological condition of aquatic systems is important to ensure delivery of ecosystem services in the future grizzetti et al 2019 and an important aim of the eu biodiversity strategy european commission 2020a according to the latest assessment however a good ecological status has only been achieved for 40 of european surface waters and chemicals released via stps are identified as one of the main pressures on these surface water bodies eea 2018a lemm et al 2021 the wfd also links to the eu urban wastewater treatment directive uwwtd 91 271 eec the objective of this directive is to protect the environment for adverse effects of urban waste water and concerns its collection treatment and discharge the uwwtd sets maximum concentrations for the nitrogen phosphorous and organic matter content for treated wastewater but does not address micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals yet the wfd does include several pharmaceutical substances on the so called watch list european commission 2022a in the proposal for a revised uwwtd the european commission lays down the aim to implement advanced treatment to stps treating a load equal to or greater than 100 000 person equivalents p e by 31 december 2035 at the latest european commission 2022b as also mentioned in the strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment the european commission will investigate the feasibility of upgrading selected stps to more advanced treatment technologies european commission 2020b a wide range of advanced treatment methods have been investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater for which either ozonation or activated carbon treatment are reported to be the best performing and most cost effective kosek et al 2020 logar et al 2014 rout et al 2021 advanced treatment techniques have already been implemented in switzerland at selected stps as part of the swiss water conservation legislation introduced in 2016 stamm et al 2015 by following this approach the pressure of pollution on swiss surface waters is estimated to be reduced by 50 foen 2015 a recent study by pistocchi et al 2022a estimates that by following a similar approach in the entire eu the cumulative toxicity of stp effluent will be reduced by circa 36 certain knowledge gaps however still remain for example removal rates as used in the pistocchi et al 2022a study were mainly assumed using models this results in high uncertainties as it is still difficult to generically model the fate of chemicals in advanced treatment processes due to the influence of amongst others specific process conditions influence removal efficiencies fischer et al 2019 inclusion of experimental data might provide better insights in the removal of chemicals in stps and reduce uncertainties pistocchi et al 2022a in this study experimental removal rates are derived from an extensive literature research next we aim to assess the effectiveness of european stps to reduce pharmaceutical emissions for a 1 present 2 full compliance and 3 advanced treatment scenario in addition spatial variation between european stps are assessed for all european river basins taking into account their ecological status as assessed under the wfd as well as proximity to natura 2000 sites for the advanced treatment scenario we follow the approach by pistocchi et al 2022a in order to show the present effectiveness and the possible value of introducing advanced treatment at large stps 100 000 p e 2 methods 2 1 waste water treatment scenarios three different scenarios were analysed in this study for every stp in the eu we considered 1 the present level of treatment present scenario 2 full compliance with the uwwtd in its current form full compliance scenario and 3 a scenario where more advanced treatment either with ozonation or activated carbon is required at large stps advanced treatment scenario for the full compliance scenario envisioned changes to non compliant stps as reported under article 17 of the uwwtd were used to calculate the total capacity in p e per treatment level eea 2022a for the full compliance and the advanced treatment scenarios it was also assumed that 100 of the population is connected to a stp in addition for the advanced treatment scenario all stps with a capacity of 100 000 p e were assigned with advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon in fig 1 a workflow is presented to calculate the population in p e per treatment level first data collected under article 15 of the uwwtd for the year 2020 and reported in waterbase v8 eea 2022a was used to assign treatment levels to individual stps for the present scenario waterbase contains information on the location and characteristics of urban stps with generated wastewater loads above 2 000 population equivalents p e for all eu member states based on availability of data 23 568 stps were selected for our assessment see si1 for more detailed description on steps taken to filter the data treatment levels were defined following uwwtd and oecd definitions oecd 2003 as primary secondary tertiary disinfection or advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon next the total capacity in p e per treatment level was calculated for 5 regions in europe see table 1 defined according to divisions used in the eea indicator assessment eea 2017 data on the total stp capacity per treatment level was combined with eurostat data on the percentage of residents that is not connected to stps eurostat 2022 at time of the analysis eurostat contained data till 2019 hence for most countries data for the year 2019 was used or the latest data available in the database details on the percentage of residents per member state that are not connected an stp are shown in si1 table s1 1 2 2 selected pharmaceuticals and their stp removal rates a list of 58 pharmaceuticals posing the highest risk to aquatic systems was compiled based on already existing prioritisation lists including both parent compounds and metabolites de voogt et al 2009 european commission 2020c foen 2015 norman network 2014 zhou et al 2019 removal efficiencies of these substances by different wastewater treatment techniques were collected in the scientific literature according to the approach first introduced in switzerland upgraded stps will contain either ozonation or activated carbon treatment the removal rates of stps that apply ozonation or activated carbon were combined in this study and averaged to obtain the removal rate for advanced treatment based on the identified references 63 in total removal rates were calculated per pharmaceutical per stp with a specific treatment type only total removal rates were used from full scale stps which apply a combination of techniques next the average removal rate over all substances was used to estimate the fraction being released to the environment and being removed per treatment level a more extensive description of the literature search and calculation method is given in the si1 2 3 spatial analysis the location of stps and their proximity to natura2000 sites was assessed by using a buffer of 2 000 metre as in line with an earlier defined non binding buffer zone eea 2018b natura2000 sites were available for all countries except norway and the united kingdom eea 2022b stp data was also combined with data on the ecological status or potential of water bodies in order to assess the total stp effluent in p e emitted into water bodies with a good or less than good ecological status the ecological status of water bodies as defined under the 2nd river basin management plans was derived from the wise water framework directive database eea 2021 out of the 23 568 stps reported under the uwwtd information on the ecological status of water bodies into which effluent is emitted was available for 15 950 stps a more detailed description on how the datasets were combined is provided in si1 all data analysis was performed in r and qgis 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal rates of pharmaceuticals in stps the removal rates of the 58 pharmaceuticals taken into account in this study for different stp treatment levels are shown in fig 2 for a couple of substances e g acetaminophen atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole relatively many data were available whereas for other substances only few studies or no data could be found details on removal rates for individual substances can be found in the online data repository van dijk et al 2023 specifically for primary and tertiary treatment up to 50 of individual pharmaceutical the literature search did not yield removal rates black cells in fig 2 this can impact the validity and reliability of our analysis and potentially bias the calculated average stp removal rates the calculated removal rates are furthermore biased by the compounds selected in this study in the future data gaps might be partly filled by using modelling approaches such as simpletreat struijs 2014 however simpletreat can only be used to calculate removal for primary and secondary treatment data gaps from the literature were partly found due to incomplete reporting of measured data on stp substance removal in the studies future studies would benefit from more transparent and accessible data on stp removal efficiencies fischer et al 2019 it s important to acknowledge that our assessment may not cover all relevant pharmaceuticals as pollution can vary by location and time and there are a multitude of factors that can influence which pharmaceuticals are present in wastewater bunke et al 2019 massei et al 2018 van gils et al 2019 furthermore it should be noted that this study focused solely on pharmaceuticals and did not consider other types of substances such as biocides and chemicals registered under reach these substances can however also be important sources of pollution in surface waters posthuma et al 2018 van gils et al 2020 when averaging the collected removal rates of all 58 pharmaceuticals per treatment and excluding data gaps primary treatment has a removal potential of circa 9 11 secondary treatment of 42 27 tertiary treatment of 42 27 disinfection of 66 29 and advanced treatment of 84 20 table 2 average removal rates of advanced treatment lie above the removal criteria of 80 earlier laid down in switzerland foen 2015 based on our analysis six substances cyclophosphamide fluconazole gabapentin irbesartan oxypurinol sulfadiazine are however expected to not be well removed by ozonation or activated carbon treatment fig 2 no significant difference p value of 0 05 between ozonation and active carbon treatment was found si1 furthermore no significant difference between removal efficiencies of secondary and tertiary treatment was found as well as between tertiary and disinfection treatment si table si1 5 these findings can help to generate a better picture of pharmaceutical emissions to water bodies as most modelling exercises to date e g in oldenkamp et al 2018 van gils et al 2020 rely on stp models such simpletreat and therefore only consider the fate and removal during primary and secondary treatment lautz et al 2017 struijs 2014 3 2 removal rates and substance characteristics primary treatment intends to reduce the solid content of the wastewater oils and fats grease sand grit and settleable solids based on our search only 9 of the total pharmaceutical load can potentially be removed which is in line with earlier reported total removal rates greenham et al 2019 substance removal by secondary treatment mainly depends on the sorption on the sewage sludge and their degradation or transformation during the treatment and therefore likely removes the more hydrophobic and degradable pharmaceuticals michael et al 2013 with regards to advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon overall removal efficiencies are found to be similar in this study however differences might exist for the removal of some specific compounds treatment with activated carbon can for example be used for removing many hydrophobic and also some charged pharmaceuticals from water whilst high removal after ozonation is usually observed for pharmaceuticals with one or more functional groups such as non aromatic carbon carbon double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings and moieties ikehata et al 2006 michael et al 2013 polar chemicals are usually less well removed in stps fischer et al 2019 gollong et al 2022 sjerps et al 2021 moreover removal rates for non aromatic compounds by activated carbon is often low whilst compounds with unoxidable bonds are able to survive ozonation treatments hale et al 2022 additionally ozonation can lead to the formation of undesired and highly reactive by products hence while ozonation and activated carbon can be effective in removing certain contaminants they are not universally applicable following the approach reported by pronk et al 2020 who proposed a framework to estimate removal efficiencies of water treatment techniques based on substance characteristics we could not identify a clear trend between substance properties and removal rates this might be caused by different study designs or differences in the actual stp removal efficiency due to variations in i quality of waste water entering the stps ii operating conditions such as sludge retention time hydraulic retention time and flow rate and iii other factors such as difference in climate mclachlan et al 2022 michael et al 2013 pomiès et al 2013 yang et al 2017 3 3 total stp removal potential the sankey diagrams of fig 3 a c show to what type of stp treatment level the population is connected and how the fraction of pharmaceuticals is removed or emitted to the environment at present the potential to reduce environmental emissions of pharmaceuticals of all european stps combined is 48 27 fig 3a south east europe has currently the highest percentage of untreated wastewater around 25 of urban wastewater in this region is emitted without any treatment into freshwater systems other differences in treatment level can be observed for specific countries fig 4 for example in southern europe disinfection is applied relatively often even though this is not required under the uwwtd this is likely the effect of national legislations in italy for example a disinfection step needs to be implemented at stps with a capacity of 2000 p e or higher collivignarelli et al 2017 when full compliance would be reached with the current uwwtd the stp removal potential is slightly increased to 52 28 fig 3b most changes in the full compliance scenario are observed in south east and south east europe fig 5 as despite improvements over the last few years these regions currently remain least compliant with the uwwtd european commission 2022c the fact that the current uwwtd has no focus on micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals is reflected by the relatively small increase of the stp potential to reduce pharmaceutical emissions in this full compliance scenario full compliance to the uwwtd is expected to mainly reduce the nutrient and microorganism loads of wastewater in the advanced treatment scenario the emission reduction potential for the selected pharmaceuticals is increased to 69 22 fig 3c advanced treatment is placed in bigger cities and therefore most changes in this scenario are observed in more densely populated areas fig 6 in this study only stps reported under the uwwtd were taken into account meaning stps with a capacity of 2 000 p e are not included 364 650 agglomerations with a capacity of 2000 p e or less corresponding to circa 75 million inhabitants have been identified and are predicted to impact receiving water bodies the percentage of small agglomerations was on average higher in czechia slovakia croatia slovenia romania and poland pistocchi et al 2022b future updates to the uwwtd will likely include smaller stps in the uwwtd dataset european commission 2022d resulting in an completer picture of european stps and their potential to reduce environmental emission of pharmaceuticals 3 4 spatial analysis 3 4 1 water body types for present day conditions relatively often only primary treatment is applied to stps emitting into coastal waters as compared to stps that emit into estuaries or fresh water bodies fig 7 this can also been seen in fig 4 in which the geographical location of all stp and their treatment level under present day conditions are shown main reason for this is that the uwwtd does not specifically protect marine waters and many stps are exempted from stricter treatment when primary treatment is in place article 2 7 uwwtd this is not in line with the wfd which does specifically cover marine systems the treatment level of stps emitting into coastal waters improves under the advanced treatment scenario at more densely populated areas however in other coastal areas from e g norway and croatia mainly primary treatment is applied under all scenarios fig 4 and figure si1 1 this is reason of concern as pharmaceutical pollution already affects marine ecosystems fabbri and franzellitti 2016 mezzelani et al 2018 under the advanced treatment scenario treatment level is improved for stps emitting into all water types stp effluent emitted into lakes also receive relatively lower treatment compared to rivers and transitional waters different water body types may respond different to chemical stressors birk et al 2020 reid et al 2019 stps emitting into smaller water bodies figure si1 2 might be prioritised as for example large rivers are reported to be less impacted by chemical pollution due to their higher dilution capacity compared to other river types lemm et al 2021 future modelling studies should furthermore take chemical consumption data into account to assess whether water bodies and their ecosystems are sufficiently protected and to make cost effective decisions in water quality management with regards to implementation of advanced treatment techniques coppens et al 2015 3 4 2 ecological status under the wfd at present 15 950 out of the 23 568 stps with a total treatment capacity of 5 4e 8 p e emit treated effluent into a surface water bodies for which information on the ecological status was available from fig 8 it can be observed that most 12 396 stps with a total treatment capacity of 4 5e 8 p e of these 15 950 stps emit treated wastewater into water bodies which have a less than good ecological status while water bodies with a good or high ecological status are influenced by less then 1e 8 p e few changes are observed with regards to stp treatment levels under the full compliance scenario compared to the present scenario figures si1 6 and si1 7 the full compliance scenario based on envisioned changes reported under article 17 of the uwwtd primarily involves improving the performance of existing underperforming stps through maintenance or expansion it is anticipated that such changes will mainly lead to a reduction in nutrient enrichment of surface waters which is one of the main pressures hampering a good ecological status of water bodies together with chemical pollution and habitat alterations eea 2018a in the advanced treatment scenario 809 total treatment capacity of 2 8e 8 p e out of the 15 950 stps are updated with advanced treatment fig 8 which has the potential to reduce the pressure of chemical pollution and improve their ecological status management of water at the river basin level is key for implementing the wfd under all scenarios only primary or secondary treatment techniques are applied to most of the generated wastewater load in some rbds in croatia france norway poland portugal and the uk figure si1 5 whereas some waterbodies in these rbds have a less than good ecological status eea 2021 next to prioritization based on a p e cut off it may be beneficial to prioritise stps for advanced treatment based on the ecological status all relevant pressures need to be considered in order to make decisions on the implementation of advanced techniques or other measures to help restore and protect freshwater ecosystems carvalho et al 2019 lemm et al 2021 2019 3 4 3 natura2000 sites at present circa 44 of all treated effluent corresponding to 3 1e 8 p e is emitted directly within natura2000 sites or the 2 km buffer zone fig 9 most of the effluent undergoes tertiary treatment when envisioned changes reported under article 17 of the uwwtd are made under the full compliance scenario some stps are no longer used and new stps are constructed outside natura2000 sites this will result in an increase of total treated effluent and an increase in the amount of effluent treated with a disinfection step for stps emitting in or close to natura2000 however relatively few changes are observed under the advanced treatment scenario 38 of all effluent will be treated with advanced treatment then no difference in treatment level can be observed between stps located near and further away from natura2000 areas in any of the scenarios as stps are identified as one of the main stressors affecting ecological status eea 2018a lemm et al 2021 stps emitting effluent emitted near natura2000 sites could be prioritised for implementation of advanced treatment as well this might especially be relevant in central europe as here the smallest share of effluent is treated with advanced treatment steps figure si1 3 3 5 benefits and considerations of advanced treatment given that not all substances are sufficiently removed by advanced treatment techniques and that it is not feasible to update all stps pistocchi et al 2022c other measures focussing on input prevention need to be considered as well kümmerer et al 2019 wezel et al 2017 furthermore the increased use of chemicals bunke et al 2019 nagesh et al 2022 and demand for clean water boretti and rosa 2019 asks for a paradigm shift in wastewater management where adequately treated wastewater can for example be re used dingemans et al 2020 villarín and merel 2020 climate change is projected to further reduce water availability in sufficient quantity and quality emphasising the importance of such water reuse practices the current study may be used to further model pharmaceutical concentrations in european surface waters and to identify stps for which more advanced treatment might be required and to protect eu aquatic biodiversity this study did not aim to assess what advanced treatment should be implemented the most suitable treatment technique depends on a multitude of factors and will most likely be location specific for example ozonation may result in the formation of toxic by products which is why a post treatment step with a biological active sand filter is recommended von gunten 2018 on the other hand ozonation is unlike activated carbon treatment effective in the inactivation of bacteria consequently when stringent limits for reuse are requested an additional disinfection step might be needed for when activated carbon is implemented in addition other environmental burdens than risks of chemicals need to be assessed treatment with ozonation is for example associated with higher environmental impacts due to its high energy consumption ganora et al 2019 pistocchi et al 2022c one of the aims laid down in the uwwtd proposal is to achieve energy neutrality in the wastewater sector by 2040 european commission 2022b the use of renewable energy resources might help achieve this aim and lower the negative impacts of advanced treatments lutterbeck et al 2020 all this emphasises the need for integrated assessments before deciding whether an stp needs to be updated with advanced treatment pistocchi et al 2017 schuwirth et al 2018 4 conclusion treatment of wastewater is a key component to reduce environmental emissions of pharmaceuticals here we showed that implementing advanced treatment at stps with a capacity of 100 000 p e will improve the total pharmaceutical emission reduction potential of stps in europe from 48 to 69 based on a set of 58 priority pharmaceuticals this set of the 58 pharmaceuticals was based on existing prioritisation lists and covers a wide variety of physical chemical properties and different use categories average stp removal efficiencies ranged from 9 for primary treatment to 84 for advanced treatment the data collected in this study can be complemented with other substance types such as biocides and reach registered chemicals and consumption data to obtain a better understanding of the total chemical pressure on water bodies spatial differences with regard to implemented stp treatment levels exist under all three scenarios coastal waters and lakes seem for example not as well protected as freshwaters whilst some of these coastal waters have already a less than good ecological status or potential furthermore more stringent treatment for stps near natura2000 sites and stps that emit effluent into water bodies with a less than good ecological status was not observed but might be required to protect biodiversity this study did not aim to assess what advanced treatment should be implemented and to define which specific stps need to be upgraded as the most suitable water management option depends on a multitude of factors and will most likely be location specific integrated assessments are needed that estimate total environmental benefits and burdens of stp treatments

sources of pharmaceuticals to wastewater adeleye et al 2022 comber et al 2015 michael et al 2013 except for specific types of pharmaceuticals which are mainly emitted via hospitals and health institutions herrmann et al 2015 le corre et al 2012 in the eu the water framework directive wfd is implemented to protect surface waters transitional waters coastal waters and groundwater directive 2000 60 ec a key aim of the wfd is to achieve a good ecological status for all water bodies which is influenced amongst others by water quality measurements according to the wfd regularly take place within natura2000 sites a network of key breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species and some rare natural habitat types that the wfd annex v no 1 3 5 specifically refers to a good ecological condition of aquatic systems is important to ensure delivery of ecosystem services in the future grizzetti et al 2019 and an important aim of the eu biodiversity strategy european commission 2020a according to the latest assessment however a good ecological status has only been achieved for 40 of european surface waters and chemicals released via stps are identified as one of the main pressures on these surface water bodies eea 2018a lemm et al 2021 the wfd also links to the eu urban wastewater treatment directive uwwtd 91 271 eec the objective of this directive is to protect the environment for adverse effects of urban waste water and concerns its collection treatment and discharge the uwwtd sets maximum concentrations for the nitrogen phosphorous and organic matter content for treated wastewater but does not address micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals yet the wfd does include several pharmaceutical substances on the so called watch list european commission 2022a in the proposal for a revised uwwtd the european commission lays down the aim to implement advanced treatment to stps treating a load equal to or greater than 100 000 person equivalents p e by 31 december 2035 at the latest european commission 2022b as also mentioned in the strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment the european commission will investigate the feasibility of upgrading selected stps to more advanced treatment technologies european commission 2020b a wide range of advanced treatment methods have been investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater for which either ozonation or activated carbon treatment are reported to be the best performing and most cost effective kosek et al 2020 logar et al 2014 rout et al 2021 advanced treatment techniques have already been implemented in switzerland at selected stps as part of the swiss water conservation legislation introduced in 2016 stamm et al 2015 by following this approach the pressure of pollution on swiss surface waters is estimated to be reduced by 50 foen 2015 a recent study by pistocchi et al 2022a estimates that by following a similar approach in the entire eu the cumulative toxicity of stp effluent will be reduced by circa 36 certain knowledge gaps however still remain for example removal rates as used in the pistocchi et al 2022a study were mainly assumed using models this results in high uncertainties as it is still difficult to generically model the fate of chemicals in advanced treatment processes due to the influence of amongst others specific process conditions influence removal efficiencies fischer et al 2019 inclusion of experimental data might provide better insights in the removal of chemicals in stps and reduce uncertainties pistocchi et al 2022a in this study experimental removal rates are derived from an extensive literature research next we aim to assess the effectiveness of european stps to reduce pharmaceutical emissions for a 1 present 2 full compliance and 3 advanced treatment scenario in addition spatial variation between european stps are assessed for all european river basins taking into account their ecological status as assessed under the wfd as well as proximity to natura 2000 sites for the advanced treatment scenario we follow the approach by pistocchi et al 2022a in order to show the present effectiveness and the possible value of introducing advanced treatment at large stps 100 000 p e 2 methods 2 1 waste water treatment scenarios three different scenarios were analysed in this study for every stp in the eu we considered 1 the present level of treatment present scenario 2 full compliance with the uwwtd in its current form full compliance scenario and 3 a scenario where more advanced treatment either with ozonation or activated carbon is required at large stps advanced treatment scenario for the full compliance scenario envisioned changes to non compliant stps as reported under article 17 of the uwwtd were used to calculate the total capacity in p e per treatment level eea 2022a for the full compliance and the advanced treatment scenarios it was also assumed that 100 of the population is connected to a stp in addition for the advanced treatment scenario all stps with a capacity of 100 000 p e were assigned with advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon in fig 1 a workflow is presented to calculate the population in p e per treatment level first data collected under article 15 of the uwwtd for the year 2020 and reported in waterbase v8 eea 2022a was used to assign treatment levels to individual stps for the present scenario waterbase contains information on the location and characteristics of urban stps with generated wastewater loads above 2 000 population equivalents p e for all eu member states based on availability of data 23 568 stps were selected for our assessment see si1 for more detailed description on steps taken to filter the data treatment levels were defined following uwwtd and oecd definitions oecd 2003 as primary secondary tertiary disinfection or advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon next the total capacity in p e per treatment level was calculated for 5 regions in europe see table 1 defined according to divisions used in the eea indicator assessment eea 2017 data on the total stp capacity per treatment level was combined with eurostat data on the percentage of residents that is not connected to stps eurostat 2022 at time of the analysis eurostat contained data till 2019 hence for most countries data for the year 2019 was used or the latest data available in the database details on the percentage of residents per member state that are not connected an stp are shown in si1 table s1 1 2 2 selected pharmaceuticals and their stp removal rates a list of 58 pharmaceuticals posing the highest risk to aquatic systems was compiled based on already existing prioritisation lists including both parent compounds and metabolites de voogt et al 2009 european commission 2020c foen 2015 norman network 2014 zhou et al 2019 removal efficiencies of these substances by different wastewater treatment techniques were collected in the scientific literature according to the approach first introduced in switzerland upgraded stps will contain either ozonation or activated carbon treatment the removal rates of stps that apply ozonation or activated carbon were combined in this study and averaged to obtain the removal rate for advanced treatment based on the identified references 63 in total removal rates were calculated per pharmaceutical per stp with a specific treatment type only total removal rates were used from full scale stps which apply a combination of techniques next the average removal rate over all substances was used to estimate the fraction being released to the environment and being removed per treatment level a more extensive description of the literature search and calculation method is given in the si1 2 3 spatial analysis the location of stps and their proximity to natura2000 sites was assessed by using a buffer of 2 000 metre as in line with an earlier defined non binding buffer zone eea 2018b natura2000 sites were available for all countries except norway and the united kingdom eea 2022b stp data was also combined with data on the ecological status or potential of water bodies in order to assess the total stp effluent in p e emitted into water bodies with a good or less than good ecological status the ecological status of water bodies as defined under the 2nd river basin management plans was derived from the wise water framework directive database eea 2021 out of the 23 568 stps reported under the uwwtd information on the ecological status of water bodies into which effluent is emitted was available for 15 950 stps a more detailed description on how the datasets were combined is provided in si1 all data analysis was performed in r and qgis 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal rates of pharmaceuticals in stps the removal rates of the 58 pharmaceuticals taken into account in this study for different stp treatment levels are shown in fig 2 for a couple of substances e g acetaminophen atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole relatively many data were available whereas for other substances only few studies or no data could be found details on removal rates for individual substances can be found in the online data repository van dijk et al 2023 specifically for primary and tertiary treatment up to 50 of individual pharmaceutical the literature search did not yield removal rates black cells in fig 2 this can impact the validity and reliability of our analysis and potentially bias the calculated average stp removal rates the calculated removal rates are furthermore biased by the compounds selected in this study in the future data gaps might be partly filled by using modelling approaches such as simpletreat struijs 2014 however simpletreat can only be used to calculate removal for primary and secondary treatment data gaps from the literature were partly found due to incomplete reporting of measured data on stp substance removal in the studies future studies would benefit from more transparent and accessible data on stp removal efficiencies fischer et al 2019 it s important to acknowledge that our assessment may not cover all relevant pharmaceuticals as pollution can vary by location and time and there are a multitude of factors that can influence which pharmaceuticals are present in wastewater bunke et al 2019 massei et al 2018 van gils et al 2019 furthermore it should be noted that this study focused solely on pharmaceuticals and did not consider other types of substances such as biocides and chemicals registered under reach these substances can however also be important sources of pollution in surface waters posthuma et al 2018 van gils et al 2020 when averaging the collected removal rates of all 58 pharmaceuticals per treatment and excluding data gaps primary treatment has a removal potential of circa 9 11 secondary treatment of 42 27 tertiary treatment of 42 27 disinfection of 66 29 and advanced treatment of 84 20 table 2 average removal rates of advanced treatment lie above the removal criteria of 80 earlier laid down in switzerland foen 2015 based on our analysis six substances cyclophosphamide fluconazole gabapentin irbesartan oxypurinol sulfadiazine are however expected to not be well removed by ozonation or activated carbon treatment fig 2 no significant difference p value of 0 05 between ozonation and active carbon treatment was found si1 furthermore no significant difference between removal efficiencies of secondary and tertiary treatment was found as well as between tertiary and disinfection treatment si table si1 5 these findings can help to generate a better picture of pharmaceutical emissions to water bodies as most modelling exercises to date e g in oldenkamp et al 2018 van gils et al 2020 rely on stp models such simpletreat and therefore only consider the fate and removal during primary and secondary treatment lautz et al 2017 struijs 2014 3 2 removal rates and substance characteristics primary treatment intends to reduce the solid content of the wastewater oils and fats grease sand grit and settleable solids based on our search only 9 of the total pharmaceutical load can potentially be removed which is in line with earlier reported total removal rates greenham et al 2019 substance removal by secondary treatment mainly depends on the sorption on the sewage sludge and their degradation or transformation during the treatment and therefore likely removes the more hydrophobic and degradable pharmaceuticals michael et al 2013 with regards to advanced treatment ozonation or activated carbon overall removal efficiencies are found to be similar in this study however differences might exist for the removal of some specific compounds treatment with activated carbon can for example be used for removing many hydrophobic and also some charged pharmaceuticals from water whilst high removal after ozonation is usually observed for pharmaceuticals with one or more functional groups such as non aromatic carbon carbon double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings and moieties ikehata et al 2006 michael et al 2013 polar chemicals are usually less well removed in stps fischer et al 2019 gollong et al 2022 sjerps et al 2021 moreover removal rates for non aromatic compounds by activated carbon is often low whilst compounds with unoxidable bonds are able to survive ozonation treatments hale et al 2022 additionally ozonation can lead to the formation of undesired and highly reactive by products hence while ozonation and activated carbon can be effective in removing certain contaminants they are not universally applicable following the approach reported by pronk et al 2020 who proposed a framework to estimate removal efficiencies of water treatment techniques based on substance characteristics we could not identify a clear trend between substance properties and removal rates this might be caused by different study designs or differences in the actual stp removal efficiency due to variations in i quality of waste water entering the stps ii operating conditions such as sludge retention time hydraulic retention time and flow rate and iii other factors such as difference in climate mclachlan et al 2022 michael et al 2013 pomiès et al 2013 yang et al 2017 3 3 total stp removal potential the sankey diagrams of fig 3 a c show to what type of stp treatment level the population is connected and how the fraction of pharmaceuticals is removed or emitted to the environment at present the potential to reduce environmental emissions of pharmaceuticals of all european stps combined is 48 27 fig 3a south east europe has currently the highest percentage of untreated wastewater around 25 of urban wastewater in this region is emitted without any treatment into freshwater systems other differences in treatment level can be observed for specific countries fig 4 for example in southern europe disinfection is applied relatively often even though this is not required under the uwwtd this is likely the effect of national legislations in italy for example a disinfection step needs to be implemented at stps with a capacity of 2000 p e or higher collivignarelli et al 2017 when full compliance would be reached with the current uwwtd the stp removal potential is slightly increased to 52 28 fig 3b most changes in the full compliance scenario are observed in south east and south east europe fig 5 as despite improvements over the last few years these regions currently remain least compliant with the uwwtd european commission 2022c the fact that the current uwwtd has no focus on micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals is reflected by the relatively small increase of the stp potential to reduce pharmaceutical emissions in this full compliance scenario full compliance to the uwwtd is expected to mainly reduce the nutrient and microorganism loads of wastewater in the advanced treatment scenario the emission reduction potential for the selected pharmaceuticals is increased to 69 22 fig 3c advanced treatment is placed in bigger cities and therefore most changes in this scenario are observed in more densely populated areas fig 6 in this study only stps reported under the uwwtd were taken into account meaning stps with a capacity of 2 000 p e are not included 364 650 agglomerations with a capacity of 2000 p e or less corresponding to circa 75 million inhabitants have been identified and are predicted to impact receiving water bodies the percentage of small agglomerations was on average higher in czechia slovakia croatia slovenia romania and poland pistocchi et al 2022b future updates to the uwwtd will likely include smaller stps in the uwwtd dataset european commission 2022d resulting in an completer picture of european stps and their potential to reduce environmental emission of pharmaceuticals 3 4 spatial analysis 3 4 1 water body types for present day conditions relatively often only primary treatment is applied to stps emitting into coastal waters as compared to stps that emit into estuaries or fresh water bodies fig 7 this can also been seen in fig 4 in which the geographical location of all stp and their treatment level under present day conditions are shown main reason for this is that the uwwtd does not specifically protect marine waters and many stps are exempted from stricter treatment when primary treatment is in place article 2 7 uwwtd this is not in line with the wfd which does specifically cover marine systems the treatment level of stps emitting into coastal waters improves under the advanced treatment scenario at more densely populated areas however in other coastal areas from e g norway and croatia mainly primary treatment is applied under all scenarios fig 4 and figure si1 1 this is reason of concern as pharmaceutical pollution already affects marine ecosystems fabbri and franzellitti 2016 mezzelani et al 2018 under the advanced treatment scenario treatment level is improved for stps emitting into all water types stp effluent emitted into lakes also receive relatively lower treatment compared to rivers and transitional waters different water body types may respond different to chemical stressors birk et al 2020 reid et al 2019 stps emitting into smaller water bodies figure si1 2 might be prioritised as for example large rivers are reported to be less impacted by chemical pollution due to their higher dilution capacity compared to other river types lemm et al 2021 future modelling studies should furthermore take chemical consumption data into account to assess whether water bodies and their ecosystems are sufficiently protected and to make cost effective decisions in water quality management with regards to implementation of advanced treatment techniques coppens et al 2015 3 4 2 ecological status under the wfd at present 15 950 out of the 23 568 stps with a total treatment capacity of 5 4e 8 p e emit treated effluent into a surface water bodies for which information on the ecological status was available from fig 8 it can be observed that most 12 396 stps with a total treatment capacity of 4 5e 8 p e of these 15 950 stps emit treated wastewater into water bodies which have a less than good ecological status while water bodies with a good or high ecological status are influenced by less then 1e 8 p e few changes are observed with regards to stp treatment levels under the full compliance scenario compared to the present scenario figures si1 6 and si1 7 the full compliance scenario based on envisioned changes reported under article 17 of the uwwtd primarily involves improving the performance of existing underperforming stps through maintenance or expansion it is anticipated that such changes will mainly lead to a reduction in nutrient enrichment of surface waters which is one of the main pressures hampering a good ecological status of water bodies together with chemical pollution and habitat alterations eea 2018a in the advanced treatment scenario 809 total treatment capacity of 2 8e 8 p e out of the 15 950 stps are updated with advanced treatment fig 8 which has the potential to reduce the pressure of chemical pollution and improve their ecological status management of water at the river basin level is key for implementing the wfd under all scenarios only primary or secondary treatment techniques are applied to most of the generated wastewater load in some rbds in croatia france norway poland portugal and the uk figure si1 5 whereas some waterbodies in these rbds have a less than good ecological status eea 2021 next to prioritization based on a p e cut off it may be beneficial to prioritise stps for advanced treatment based on the ecological status all relevant pressures need to be considered in order to make decisions on the implementation of advanced techniques or other measures to help restore and protect freshwater ecosystems carvalho et al 2019 lemm et al 2021 2019 3 4 3 natura2000 sites at present circa 44 of all treated effluent corresponding to 3 1e 8 p e is emitted directly within natura2000 sites or the 2 km buffer zone fig 9 most of the effluent undergoes tertiary treatment when envisioned changes reported under article 17 of the uwwtd are made under the full compliance scenario some stps are no longer used and new stps are constructed outside natura2000 sites this will result in an increase of total treated effluent and an increase in the amount of effluent treated with a disinfection step for stps emitting in or close to natura2000 however relatively few changes are observed under the advanced treatment scenario 38 of all effluent will be treated with advanced treatment then no difference in treatment level can be observed between stps located near and further away from natura2000 areas in any of the scenarios as stps are identified as one of the main stressors affecting ecological status eea 2018a lemm et al 2021 stps emitting effluent emitted near natura2000 sites could be prioritised for implementation of advanced treatment as well this might especially be relevant in central europe as here the smallest share of effluent is treated with advanced treatment steps figure si1 3 3 5 benefits and considerations of advanced treatment given that not all substances are sufficiently removed by advanced treatment techniques and that it is not feasible to update all stps pistocchi et al 2022c other measures focussing on input prevention need to be considered as well kümmerer et al 2019 wezel et al 2017 furthermore the increased use of chemicals bunke et al 2019 nagesh et al 2022 and demand for clean water boretti and rosa 2019 asks for a paradigm shift in wastewater management where adequately treated wastewater can for example be re used dingemans et al 2020 villarín and merel 2020 climate change is projected to further reduce water availability in sufficient quantity and quality emphasising the importance of such water reuse practices the current study may be used to further model pharmaceutical concentrations in european surface waters and to identify stps for which more advanced treatment might be required and to protect eu aquatic biodiversity this study did not aim to assess what advanced treatment should be implemented the most suitable treatment technique depends on a multitude of factors and will most likely be location specific for example ozonation may result in the formation of toxic by products which is why a post treatment step with a biological active sand filter is recommended von gunten 2018 on the other hand ozonation is unlike activated carbon treatment effective in the inactivation of bacteria consequently when stringent limits for reuse are requested an additional disinfection step might be needed for when activated carbon is implemented in addition other environmental burdens than risks of chemicals need to be assessed treatment with ozonation is for example associated with higher environmental impacts due to its high energy consumption ganora et al 2019 pistocchi et al 2022c one of the aims laid down in the uwwtd proposal is to achieve energy neutrality in the wastewater sector by 2040 european commission 2022b the use of renewable energy resources might help achieve this aim and lower the negative impacts of advanced treatments lutterbeck et al 2020 all this emphasises the need for integrated assessments before deciding whether an stp needs to be updated with advanced treatment pistocchi et al 2017 schuwirth et al 2018 4 conclusion treatment of wastewater is a key component to reduce environmental emissions of pharmaceuticals here we showed that implementing advanced treatment at stps with a capacity of 100 000 p e will improve the total pharmaceutical emission reduction potential of stps in europe from 48 to 69 based on a set of 58 priority pharmaceuticals this set of the 58 pharmaceuticals was based on existing prioritisation lists and covers a wide variety of physical chemical properties and different use categories average stp removal efficiencies ranged from 9 for primary treatment to 84 for advanced treatment the data collected in this study can be complemented with other substance types such as biocides and reach registered chemicals and consumption data to obtain a better understanding of the total chemical pressure on water bodies spatial differences with regard to implemented stp treatment levels exist under all three scenarios coastal waters and lakes seem for example not as well protected as freshwaters whilst some of these coastal waters have already a less than good ecological status or potential furthermore more stringent treatment for stps near natura2000 sites and stps that emit effluent into water bodies with a less than good ecological status was not observed but might be required to protect biodiversity this study did not aim to assess what advanced treatment should be implemented and to define which specific stps need to be upgraded as the most suitable water management option depends on a multitude of factors and will most likely be location specific integrated assessments are needed that estimate total environmental benefits and burdens of stp treatments

14708,hydrogen sulfide h2s production from waste activated sludge was is the main reason for odor emission during anaerobic fermentation system cao has been reported to effectively improve the resources recovery of was but its potential effect on h2s production in anaerobic fermentation process remains unrecognized in present study it was found that the addition of 60 mg g vss cao greatly inhibited h2s production and the maximum yield of h2s was 60 1 1 8 lower than the control mechanism investigation demonstrated that cao destroyed sludge structure and increased the release of intracellular organic matter with hydrogen bonding networks destroying but had a mild effect on the transformation of sulfur containing organic matters and inorganic sulfate reduction additionally the enhancement in h and s2 consumption by alkaline condition and metal ions release was another reason for the inhibition of h2s production in cao addition reactors furthermore microbial analysis showed that cao addition importantly reduced the hydrolysis microorganism particularly denitrification hydrolytic bacterias e g unclassified f chitinophagaceae and dechloromonas sulfate reducing bacterias srbs e g unclassified c deltaproteobacteria and desulfosarcina and genes e g pepd cysn d cysh c and sir involved in organic sulfur hydrolysis and sulfate reduction results from this study provides theoretical insights into the practical applications of cao graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation calcium oxide cao hydrogen sulfide h2s macrogenetic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction activated sludge treatment is widely applied in the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world but recently more and more scientists have focused on its byproduct namely waste activated sludge because of the huge amount of production and potential environmental risks it was reported that about 50 0 million tons waste activated sludge were produced every year in china xu et al 2020 and the global mass is predicted to increase to 103 0 million tons years by 2025 yao et al 2018 waste activated sludge treatment accounted for 60 of the total operating costs of wwtps wang et al 2018 moreover waste activated sludge contained over 70 organic matters e g protein and carbohydrate which was considered as the potential valuable resource and also adsorbed large amounts of pollutant such as antibiotics heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli wang et al 2019 thus its improper disposal would threaten environmental safety and public health at present sludge anaerobic digestion is the most popular sludge disposal technology which could simultaneously realize sludge resource recovery and reduction generally short chain fatty acids scfas ch4 h2 and co2 were the primary product during sludge anaerobic digestion process liu et al 2022 pang et al 2023a 2023b beyond that hydrogen sulfide h2s is also obtained in anaerobic sludge system with the concentration of 10 20 000 ppm ahn et al 2021 h2s is a highly corrosive harmful and toxic gas which could disrupt the structure of cell membrane and the release of abundant foul odors dai et al 2017a it can be seen that the production of h2s poses a potentially serious threat to sludge recovery and environment health lupitskyy et al 2018 during sludge digestion system sulfur containing organics e g proteins and sulfur containing amino acid were firstly degraded into the small molecular organic sulfides e g sulfur alcohol thioether zhang et al 2022 and then these sulfides was further converted into h2s besides sulfate reduction is the another way for h2s production huang et al 2020 however it was reported that fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms would compete with sulfate reducing bacteria sbrs for electrons and substrates such as h2 acetate and etc jung et al 2020 and methanogens were sensitive to sulfide and h2s concentrations dai et al 2017a reported that methanosaeta and methanobacterium were seriously restrained under the h2s concentration of 314 4 10 4 ml g vss this competition might possibly reduce the output of valuable sludge products therefore control and reduction h2s production is essential for sludge digestion processes furthermore it is worth noting that certain sludge pretreatment technologies would impact h2s production when realizing sludge resource reduction for example colom díaz et al 2021 observed that high pressure at 40 bar pretreatment condition significantly reduced h2s production from waste activated sludge recently oxidizer dosing and ultrasound technologies are the widespread sludge pretreatment methods mahdy et al 2020 reported that the reactor injection of 30 ml g vsin air obtained the greatest methane production 335 ml g vsin 1 but resulted in 58 h2s reduction compared to the reactor without air in addition 0 2 g kg vss kmno4 not only significantly improved the release of biodegradable organic matters but also inhibited 76 7 h2s production during sludge digestion system fu et al 2022 as a green oxidant cao is known to be beneficial to sludge resource recovery and successfully used for sludge disposition xin et al 2021 the positive influence of cao on sludge solubilization and organic matter degradation had obtained by yuan et al 2019 under 0 04 g cao g tss and 20 khz ultrasonic united pretreatment interestingly it was observed that cao pretreatment would decrease h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion but the effect of cao on h2s production from waste activated sludge and the relative mechanism is still unreported this study therefore aimed to investigate how cao addition impacts h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion system firstly it was assessed the yield of h2s from anaerobic sludge at the presence of different cao dosages 0 10 20 60 mg g vss then the effect of cao on sulfur containing substance solubilization and hydrolysis sulfide degradation and sulfate reduction was explored finally the changes in key genes and microbial community induced by cao were probed after a long term semi continuous anaerobic digestion operating this study not only provided an intensive understanding for the effect of cao on sulfur cycle during anaerobic sludge system but also extended the application fields of cao 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge characteristics in this study waste activated sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wwtp named yin dingzhuang in baoding china before the test the collected waste activated sludge was firstly filtered through stainless steel mesh 20 mm to remove impurities then concentrated by gravitational setting for 24 h and finally stored in refrigerator at 4 for the subsequent experiment the major characteristics of the concentrated was were described in table 1 2 2 effect of cao on h2s production from was anaerobic digestion system the test was carried out in four 1000 ml serum bottles which were fed with 500 ml thickened sludge 0 50 100 and 300 mg g vss of cao were added into these reactors to achieve cao concentration at 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss respectively all fermenters were stirred at 250 rpm for 10 min to mix the sludge and cao completely to maintaining anaerobic conditions all reactors were flushed with 99 9999 n2 for 5 min afterwards they were sealed and placed in a constant temperature water bath shaker at 30 2 c 150 rpm during the reaction the ph is not controlled but recorded during the entire reaction process all reactors were operated continuously for 18 days and the yield of h2s and ph changes were monitored daily the concentrations of soluble protein and soluble cod were measured in the first three days and the content of acid volatile sulfide and so4 2 were measured during the anaerobic fermentation process 2 3 effect of cao intermediates on h2s production in order to analyze the effect of cao ca2 and ca oh 2 on h2s production from anaerobic sludge four identical bottles with 500 ml raw sludge were conducted in this test 20 mg g vss cao 39 6 mg g vss cacl2 and 26 4 mg g vss ca oh 2 were added into the bottles except that the other operation conditions were same as the batch tests in section 2 2 2 4 effect of cao on sludge structure and sulfur containing substance conversion cao is a typical alkaline oxide and has a great effect on the sludge properties such as sludge structure transformation of substances and cell lysis xin et al 2021 which potentially impacted the yield of h2s thus this study investigated the effect of cao on the dissolution of organic matters and sludge lysis by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand scod proteins and polysaccharides in the early stage of reaction furthermore the variation of sludge structure with different cao addition was evaluated by the technologies of sem eds ftir spectra xps spectra and particle size of the sludge as we know the production of h2s from was anaerobic treatment process mainly included three biological processes namely sulfur containing organic e g proteins hydrolysis organic sulfide conversion and sulfate reduction in order to investigate the effect of cao on these processes a series of simulate experiments were performed by using model compounds of bovine serum protein cysteine and so4 2 as fermentation substrates sulfur containing organics hydrolysis test four identical serum bottles were carried out with a 500 ml working volume each bottle contained 30 ml of waste activated sludge and 270 ml of synthetic wastewater 3 5 g l bovine serum protein was added into each bottles which was identified as the sulfur containing organics also 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao were added into each bottle and the remaining operations were the same as in the above experiment sulfide conversion test in this test the operations were same as in the sulfur containing organics hydrolysis test except that the simulated substrate was replaced with 3000 mg l cysteine sulfate reduction test this test was similar to the above mentioned tests but the simulated substrate was 500 mg l so4 2 the variation of sulfate was detected in each reactors during the period of reaction 2 5 long term operation tests a semi continuous experiment was used to analyze the changes in microbial communities and key genes four serum bottles with a total volume of 2 l were taken each bottle contained 1 l raw was 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao were respectively added into each reactor based on the results obtained in section 2 2 the sludge retention time in semi continuous reactors was set at 18 d thus 55 5 ml of the fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each semi continuous reactor and replaced with the original was other operating conditions were consistent with those described in the batch test after 60 days of operation the production of h2s in these reactors gradually stabilized and then samples were extracted and analyzed for key genes and microbial community 2 6 microbial community analysis total gnomic dna was

folin method respectively wang et al 2020 h2s gas was analyzed by a portable h2s analyzer the analyzer pumps air for 30 s before use to standardize the instrument acid volatile sulfide avs was released from the sludge by adding 6 mol l hydrochloric acid solution under n2 airflow and captured by 0 5 mol l sodium hydroxide solution the sulfate concentration was analyzed by bacro4 so4 2

physical electronics 5600 multi technique system the size distribution of bio aggregates was measured by a laser particle size analysis instrument the surface of was was imaged by the scanning electron microscopy sem and then mapped by energy dispersive xray spectrometry eds 2 8 statistical analysis all batches of experiments were repeated three times anova was used to assess the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao on h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation the cumulative curve of h2s production from anaerobic waste sludge in the presence of different level of cao was described in fig 1 it can be seen that the h2s production from waste anaerobic sludge increased from the 3rd day to the 12th day in all reactors and gradually ended on the 18th day however cao addition was significantly inhibited h2s production and the inhibition was positively correlated with cao concentration the maximum yield of h2s were 363 0 10 4 309 0 10 4 and 187 0 10 4 mg g vss respectively at the reactors with 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao which was 22 5 0 7 34 0 1 0 and 60 1 1 8 lower than that in the control to further evaluate the effect of cao addition on h2s production from anaerobic sludge the experimental data were simulated by using a modified gompertz liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 the curves fitted very well with r2 over 0 990 the experimental results showed that cao addition importantly decreased the potential of h2s production hm and reduced h2s generation rate rm but increased the lag phase time of h2s generation λ in anaerobic digestion system table 2 when cao addition increased from 0 to 60 mg g vss the value of hm rm decreased from 428 13 10 4 to 207 73 10 4 mg g vss 41 72 10 4 to 15 92 10 4 mg g vss d respectively and the value of λ increased from 2 33 0 09 to 3 17 0 14 d it was indicated that cao addition at the relevant level seriously reduced the h2s production and its production rate but improved the lag phase time of h2s generation during anaerobic digestion process 3 2 effect of the potential intermediates of cao on h2s production cao is an alkaline inorganic oxidizing agent and moisture sensitive with alkaline intermediates production cao would be form ca oh 2 eq 1 and or release ca2 and oh eq 2 after adding into the anaerobic sludge which is a typical mixed sludge and hydrous media thus in order to confirm the contribution for h2s production during anaerobic sludge system with cao addition this study assessed the effect of ca2 ca oh 2 and cao on h2s production from anaerobic sludge as shown in fig s1 there were negligible difference between the control and the reactor with 39 6 mg g vss cacl2 in the early stage of the anaerobic digestion nevertheless the cumulative production of h2s decreased with cacl2 addition furthermore it was found that the production of h2s was seriously inhibited by ca oh 2 and cao addition and their maximum yield of h2s respectively was 280 06 10 4 309 0 10 4 mg g vss which was 0 60 and 0 66 times lower than that in the control all the results illustrated that ca oh 2 and ca2 generated by cao both were the contributors to inhibit the production of h2s from anaerobic sludge moreover the production of h2s in the anaerobic sludge system with ca oh 2 addition was the lowest among these reactors suggesting that alkaline environment was the dominating inhibition factors 1 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 2 cao h 2 o c a 2 2 o h 3 3 effect of cao on sludge lysis as known to all waste activated sludge is a complex floc structure and contained the main chemical elements of c h o n and s c5h7no2s0 1 in the extracellular and intracellular sludge floc fu et al 2021 like the carbon containing substances in sludge sulfur containing organic compounds should firstly be released from the sludge floc before fermenter microorganism utilization thus the structure variation of sludge would directly affect the substrate of h2s production and the morphology and structure of sludge would be reflected though a optical observation technique of scanning electron microscope sem as shown in fig 2 a it can be seen that sludge floc structure without treatment in the control reactor was greatly compact and condensed with large sludge size however after cao treatment the sludge flocs were observably destroyed with abundant broken sludge particles furthermore laser particle size analysis technique was applied in this study to describe the degree of sludge breaking zhang et al 2018 previous studies reported that both hydrogen peroxides sodium percarbonate and calcium peroxide pretreatments hydrolyzed large particle size organic matter 300 1000 μm into smaller organic matter with medium particle size reducing 30 100 μm luo et al 2022 dong et al 2022 additionally xiao et al 2018 reported a reduction in the mean particle size d50 from 42 11 μm to 39 22 μm after citric acid and nzvi oxidation treatment of the sludge in this study compared with the control cao addition increased the percentage of sludge size in the range of 30 1 79 4 μm but the value of d90 were respectively 81 08 2 43 81 08 2 43 84 43 2 53 and 69 00 2 07 μm in the reactor with 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao addition it was indicated cao addition promoted sludge lysis and enhanced the concentration of small sludge particle size the potential reason might be the degradation of macromolecular organic matter in the sludge floc fig 2d and fig 3a in addition it was demonstrated that chemical pretreatment e g kmno4 h2o2 fe3o4 etc significantly promoted organic substances release from intracellular to extracellular hu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the more organic matters are dissolved the more serious the sludge flocs are lysed wu et al 2015 accordingly the concentration of soluble cod was significantly improved after cao addition fig 2d particularly the concentrations of soluble cod were respectively 368 7 7 5 391 3 11 1 1413 0 28 3 mg l after 3 days fermentation in the reactors with 10 60 mg cao g vss which higher 16 7 23 8 and 347 1 than that in the reactor without cao addition these data further verified the promotion effect of cao on sludge structure destruction 3 4 details of how cao reduced h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion system h2s production occurs mainly through two pathways e g the degradation and transformation of sulfur containing organic matters and sulfate reduction based on the above results cao addition positively promoted the release of sulfur containing organic matters and then they are further degraded into small organic molecular organics mainly proteins for subsequent biosulfur conversion fig 3 a depicted the variation of protein concentration at different cao levels it can be seen that the concentrations of protein were enhanced with cao addition and they were 128 23 1 58 134 15 1 52 151 41 0 98 and 276 32 3 51 mg l respectively in the reactor with cao addition ranging from 0 to 60 mg g vss in 3rd day furthermore ftir spectra of sludge showed that cao addition increased the intensity of band at 1075 cm 1 1455cm 1 1542 cm 1 1660 cm 1 2925 cm 1 and 3300 3400 cm 1 which are respectively relevant to cc in polysaccharide or nucleic acid c o ch c o in amido i and ii protein substances ch in alkanes and oh in alcohol or phenol xu et al 2019 fig 3b however the analysis of ftir spectra second derivative found cao addition also affected the structure of protein fig s2 which is an available technology for protein secondary structure and conformation it has been reported that protein mainly contained six secondary structure components such as α helix β sheet β turn aggregated strands random coil and antiparallel β sheet among them the α helix and β sheet are the essential shape in the secondary structure of proteins chen et al 2022 the former is a right hand helix conformation consisted by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 while the latter shows a special structure similar to the twisted and pleated sheet table s1 exhibited the proportion of major secondary structure components in protein although cao addition had little effect on the percent of α helix average 0 4 it seriously decreased β sheet ranging from 0 1 to 19 0 it was further suggested cao addition contributed to destroy hydrogen bonding networks and provided more biodegradable substrates for h2s production in addition amounts of sulfate were also found in anaerobic sludge digestion system and they derived from degradation of sulful containing organic matters or sludge itself it was reported sulfate reducing bacteria srbs could reduce sulfate into h2s under anaerobic environment with digestion intermediates e g scfas alcohol and h2 as electron donors jin et al 2022 fig 3c showed the variation of sulfate concentration in the fermenters with different cao addition the concentration of sulfate was respectively 28 06 0 14 26 77 0 13 19 24 0 10 and 18 47 0 19 mg l in the reactors with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss on the third day however its concentration in the reactor with 60 mg g vss cao addition was 2 16 times and 1 74 times higher than that in the control on the ninth and eighteenth day of fermentation the results indicated that the addition of cao more readily inhibited the sulfate production from the conversion of sulfur containing organic matter and also controlled the sulfate reduction which might be one of the reasons for the decrease of h2s yield in order to verify the above supposition batch tests were executed by using bas l cysteine sodium sulfate anhydrous as simulated substrates as shown in table s2 cao addition had a slight inhibition effect on the degradation of bas in the initial stage of fermentation with its degradation rate decreasing from 5 14 0 21 to 0 60 0 06 but then enhanced its degradation this might because higher cao level bring a shock and transitory toxicity to sbrs and other anaerobic microorganisms except that there was a similar degradation rates among these reactors for example the degradation rates of l cysteine and sodium sulfate anhydrous were about 87 96 1 78 and 62 45 1 73 respectively after 2 days fermentation no matter with or without cao addition these results indicated that the presence of cao brought a temporary inhibition the degradation of organic sulfide based on the eq 1 2 the addition of cao was beneficial to increase anaerobic sludge ph as shown in fig 4 a compared with the control higher cao addition level 60 mg g vss cao notably enhanced sludge ph from 7 13 to 8 25 only after one day exposure and the favorable alkaline environment was lasted for six days it is well known that h2s aqueous solution is a weak electrolyte and would ionized partially eq 3 and 4 hence the alkaline environment caused by cao was beneficial to the formation of hs and s2 transformed by h2s previous studies had been reported that 8 ph had a significantly effect on biogas production from waste anaerobic sludge yan et al 2018 yan et al 2018 found that the concentration of h2s was 1 76 mg l at the reactor with initial ph of 6 5 but the production of h2s reduced about 49 1 when sludge ph increased to 8 0 dai et al 2017b also reported h2s were reduced from 150 ppm to 15 ppm with ph increasing from 7 0 to 8 5 what s more although polysaccharide and protein are the main components for sludge some metals also are found in waste activated sludge such as fe mg ca and al which are readily to combine with s2 to form precipitate and or acid volatile sulfide fig 4b and 4c displayed the content of soluble metal ions and acid volatile sulfide in reactors with different cao in this study al was the most abundant soluble metal ions in all fermentation supernate with 761 0 3 81 773 5 3 87 602 0 3 01 and 602 0 2 05 mg l in the reactors with cao addition ranging from 0 60 mg g vss al3 and s2 would undergo double hydrolysis under alkaline environment eq 5 like al ion fe had a similar variation tendency but ca had a converse phenomena kokdemir unsar and perendeci 2018 on the other hand it was observed that cao remarkably improved acid volatile sulfide including mackinawite fes0 94 greigite fe3s4 amorphous monosulfides of metals e g fe zn from 15 56 0 16 to 25 74 0 26 mg l after 18 days of anaerobic fermentation fig 4c xps technology was further utilized to reveal the effect of cao on sulfur content and composition in sludge solid aromatic sulfur aliphatic sulfur sulfate sulfonic acid sulfoxide and inorganic sulfides are the main sulfur substances table s3 yin et al 2021 as can be seen from fig 4d and 4e 60 mg g vss cao increased metal sulfides r sh thiols and metal sulfates by 165 16 18 54 and 19 51 respectively in conclusion cao addition promoted the consumption of h and s2 because of the alkaline condition and metal ions release which decreased h2s emission and reduced its cumulative yield 3 h 2 s h h s 4 h s h s 2 5 a l 3 3 s 2 3 h 2 o al oh 3 3 h 2 s 3 5 microbial community analysis as a typical biochemical process functional microbial activities and key enzymes played a vital role in h2s production this study further explored the effect of cao on anaerobic microbial community through metagenomics technologies the percentage in raw reads and raw bases of sludge in all samples were about 98 80 and 98 53 respectively indicating the data were credible and effective table s4 alpha diversity of microbial community were analyzed with different cao level table s5 the value of simpson which represented the richness and evenness of microbial communities zhu and chen 2022 was 0 0162 and 0 0159 respectively in the reactor without cao addition and 60 mg cao g vss similarly the indexes of chao and shannon used to reflect the abundance and diversity of species were higher in the reactors at presence of cao addition compared to the reactor without cao this illustrated that cao exposure increased the diversity of microbial community to a certain extent based on the three pathway for h2s production during anaerobic fermentation system hydrolysis microorganism and sulfate reducing bacteria srbs are the major contributors it was observed that proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the main microorganism at the phylum level and accounted for over 82 6 of the total microflora fig s3 they are the typical fermentation microorganism and responsible for the degradation and transform of organic substance the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were about 45 5 2 3 and 14 7 1 2 respectively firmicutes is the another common anaerobic fermentation microorganism and its abundance was increased from 0 93 to 1 86 with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss in addition cao showed a positive effect on methanogens for example the abundance of euryarchaeota was respectively 1 84 0 1 1 87 0 1 2 01 0 1 and 2 40 0 3 at presence of 0 60 mg g vss cao fig 5 a exhibited the top 50 microbial populations at genus level to further evaluate the effect of cao on microbial community unclassified f chitinophagaceae unclassified c betaproteobacteria and unclassified p chloroflexi were the top three microorganisms at the genus level and their total relative abundance accounted for 24 4 0 7 in the reactor without cao addition but decreased to 19 9 1 1 in the 60 mg cao g vss reactor furthermore the distribution of hydrolysis microorganism was notably changed by higher cao addition for example unclassified f chitinophagaceae reduced from 10 4 0 3 in the control to 4 9 0 2 in the reactor with 60 mg g vss cao which is a typical denitrification bacteria and utilized complex less degradable organic carbons as electron acceptors compared with the control reactor the abundance of unclassified p acidobacteria was lower at the presence of 60 mg g vss cao addition 3 08 0 3 vs 2 1 0 2 ma et al 2019 had stated acidobacteria is a common fermentation microbe which is responsible to short chain fatty acid production from anaerobic sludge however cao addition improved certain microorganisms such as unclassified p bacteroidetes the control vs 60 mg cao g vss 2 49 0 2 vs 3 9 0 3 unclassified f anaerolineaceae the control vs 60 mg cao g vss 1 08 0 1 vs 1 62 0 2 similar phenomena had been reported by ao et al 2021 besides the abundance of methanothrix was increased from 1 89 0 1 to 2 35 0 2 with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss which competes with srb as electron donors on the other hand it was found that cao addition reduced the total gene code of srbs from 8658 to 7578 reads according to macrogenome nr species annotation fig s4 generally srbs i e desulfosarcina desulfobulbus desulfovibrio and desulfomonile were considered to be capable of so4 2 reduction shi et al 2020 but jin et al 2019 reported srb could work as a fermentation microorganism and cooperate with methanogens when the concentration of so4 2 was depleted hence cooperation between srb and methanogens might take precedence in this study it was indicated that cao importantly reduced the abundances of hydrolysis microorganism particularly denitrification hydrolytic bacteria but enhanced ch4 producers which the main reason for h2s inhibition 3 6 the effect of cao on the conversion of sulfur components in sludge as we know functional genes are the key factors that determine the structure and performance of microorganisms in order to further expound how cao impact microbial community the types and abundance of key genes about h2s production during anaerobic sludge fermentation system were exhibited and evaluated in fig 6 organic s hydrolysis played the primary role for sulfur conversion for organic s hydrolysis pathway the functional genes encoding pepd metn i q and cdo1 involved in the degradation of large molecules of sulfur containing organic matters although the abundance of metn i q and cdo1 were improved in experimental groups cao significantly inhibited pepd which was responsible for the first step of protein hydrolysis in addition the pathways of dissimilatory and assimilation sulfate reduction were profiled based on gene set constructed by srbs indicating that the relevant genes were severely impacted by cao for example relative to the control the relevant abundance of cysn d and sat reduced by 20 9 4 2 and 6 2 in the reactor with 60 mg cao g vss fu et al 2022 stated cysn d and sat encoded the enzyme atp sulfurylase which used sulfate to generate adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps meanwhile higher cao seriously inhibited the generation of sulfide generated from aps reduction through adenylylsulfate kinase and phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase and sulfide reductase encoded by cysh c and sir xie et al 2022 for another cao addition had little effect on apra and dsra b which encode the reductases about adenylylsulfate and dissimilatory sulfide these revealed that cao addition inhibited the initial stage of sulfate contained organic hydrolysis and sulfate reduction which resulted in a decrease in h2s production conclusions this study explored the effect of cao addition on h2s production from was during anaerobic fermentation process and then revealed its relevant mechanism the results showed that cao addition significantly inhibited h2s production in anaerobic sludge fermentation system and about 60 1 1 8 of the maximum h2s yield were reduced by 60 mg g vss cao addition the conversion investigation of sulfur containing substance found cao promoted the release of sulfur contained organic matter but it inhibited organic sulfide hydrolysis and sulfate reduction microbial community analysis showed that unclassified f chitinophagaceae unclassified c betaproteobacteria and unclassified p chloroflexi were the top three microorganisms with 19 9 of total abundance in all reactors furthermore results observed that higher cao addition seriously reduced the abundances of denitrifying hydrolytic bacteria but enhanced ch4 producers functional genes analysis further found that cao severely inhibited the relevant genes such as pepd metn i q cysh c sir which encoded the initial stage of sulfate contained organic hydrolysis and sulfate reduction author contributions hang li planned the experiment yali wang and hongjie wang analyzed the data and wrote the paper hang li xianglong

14708,hydrogen sulfide h2s production from waste activated sludge was is the main reason for odor emission during anaerobic fermentation system cao has been reported to effectively improve the resources recovery of was but its potential effect on h2s production in anaerobic fermentation process remains unrecognized in present study it was found that the addition of 60 mg g vss cao greatly inhibited h2s production and the maximum yield of h2s was 60 1 1 8 lower than the control mechanism investigation demonstrated that cao destroyed sludge structure and increased the release of intracellular organic matter with hydrogen bonding networks destroying but had a mild effect on the transformation of sulfur containing organic matters and inorganic sulfate reduction additionally the enhancement in h and s2 consumption by alkaline condition and metal ions release was another reason for the inhibition of h2s production in cao addition reactors furthermore microbial analysis showed

srbs e g unclassified c deltaproteobacteria and desulfosarcina and genes e g pepd cysn d cysh c and sir involved in organic sulfur hydrolysis and sulfate reduction results from this study provides theoretical insights into the practical applications of cao graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation calcium oxide cao hydrogen sulfide h2s macrogenetic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction activated sludge treatment is widely applied in the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world but recently more and more scientists have focused on its byproduct namely waste activated sludge because of the huge amount of production and potential environmental risks it was reported that about 50 0 million tons waste activated sludge were produced every year in china xu et al 2020 and the global mass is predicted to increase to 103 0 million tons years by 2025 yao et al 2018 waste activated sludge treatment accounted for 60 of the total operating costs of wwtps wang et al 2018 moreover waste activated sludge contained over 70 organic matters e g protein and carbohydrate which was considered as the potential valuable resource and also adsorbed large amounts of pollutant such as antibiotics heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli wang et al 2019 thus its improper disposal would threaten environmental safety and public health at present sludge anaerobic digestion is the most popular sludge disposal technology which could simultaneously realize sludge resource recovery and reduction generally short chain fatty acids scfas ch4 h2 and co2 were the primary product during sludge anaerobic digestion process liu et al 2022 pang et al 2023a 2023b beyond that hydrogen sulfide h2s is also obtained in anaerobic sludge system with the concentration of 10 20 000 ppm ahn et al 2021 h2s is a highly corrosive harmful and toxic gas which could disrupt the structure of cell membrane and the release of abundant foul odors dai et al 2017a it can be seen that the production of h2s poses a potentially serious threat to sludge recovery and environment health lupitskyy et al 2018 during sludge digestion system sulfur containing organics e g proteins and sulfur containing amino acid were firstly degraded into the small molecular organic sulfides e g sulfur alcohol thioether zhang et al 2022 and then these sulfides was further converted into h2s besides sulfate reduction is the another way for h2s production huang et al 2020 however it was reported that fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms would compete with sulfate reducing bacteria sbrs for electrons and substrates such as h2 acetate and etc jung et al 2020 and methanogens were sensitive to sulfide and h2s concentrations dai et al 2017a reported that methanosaeta and methanobacterium were seriously restrained under the h2s concentration of 314 4 10 4 ml g vss this competition might possibly reduce the output of valuable sludge products therefore control and reduction h2s production is essential for sludge digestion processes furthermore it is worth noting that certain sludge pretreatment technologies would impact h2s production when realizing sludge resource reduction for example colom díaz et al 2021 observed that high pressure at 40 bar pretreatment condition significantly reduced h2s production from waste activated sludge recently oxidizer dosing and ultrasound technologies are the widespread sludge pretreatment methods mahdy et al 2020 reported that the reactor injection of 30 ml g vsin air obtained the greatest methane production 335 ml g vsin 1 but resulted in 58 h2s reduction compared to the reactor without air in addition 0 2 g kg vss kmno4 not only significantly improved the release of biodegradable organic matters but also inhibited 76 7 h2s production during sludge digestion system fu et al 2022 as a green oxidant cao is known to be beneficial to sludge resource recovery and successfully used for sludge disposition xin et al 2021 the positive influence of cao on sludge solubilization and organic matter degradation had obtained by yuan et al 2019 under 0 04 g cao g tss and 20 khz ultrasonic united pretreatment interestingly it was observed that cao pretreatment would decrease h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion but the effect of cao on h2s production from waste activated sludge and the relative mechanism is still unreported this study therefore aimed to investigate how cao addition impacts h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion system firstly it was assessed the yield of h2s from anaerobic sludge at the presence of different cao dosages 0 10 20 60 mg g vss then the effect of cao on sulfur containing substance solubilization and hydrolysis sulfide degradation and sulfate reduction was explored finally the changes in key genes and microbial community induced by cao were probed after a long term semi continuous anaerobic digestion operating this study not only provided an intensive understanding for the effect of cao on sulfur cycle during anaerobic sludge system but also extended the application fields of cao 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge characteristics in this study waste activated sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wwtp named yin dingzhuang in baoding china before the test the collected waste activated sludge was firstly filtered through stainless steel mesh 20 mm to remove impurities then concentrated by gravitational setting for 24 h and finally stored in refrigerator at 4 for the subsequent experiment the major characteristics of the concentrated was were described in table 1 2 2 effect of cao on h2s production from was anaerobic digestion system the test was carried out in four 1000 ml serum bottles which were fed with 500 ml thickened sludge 0 50 100 and 300 mg g vss of cao were added into these reactors to achieve cao concentration at 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss respectively all fermenters were stirred at 250 rpm for 10 min to mix the sludge and cao completely to maintaining anaerobic conditions all reactors were flushed with 99 9999 n2 for 5 min afterwards they were sealed and placed in a constant temperature water bath shaker at 30 2 c 150 rpm during the reaction the ph is not controlled but recorded during the entire reaction process all reactors were operated continuously for 18 days and the yield of h2s and ph changes were monitored daily the concentrations of soluble protein and soluble cod were measured in the first three days and the content of acid volatile sulfide and so4 2 were measured during the anaerobic fermentation process 2 3 effect of cao intermediates on h2s production in order to analyze the effect of cao ca2 and ca oh 2 on h2s production from anaerobic sludge four identical bottles with 500 ml raw sludge were conducted in this test 20 mg g vss cao 39 6 mg g vss cacl2 and 26 4 mg g vss ca oh 2 were added into the bottles except that the other operation conditions were same as the batch tests in section 2 2 2 4 effect of cao on sludge structure and sulfur containing substance conversion cao is a typical alkaline oxide and has a great effect on the sludge properties such as sludge structure transformation of substances and cell lysis xin et al 2021 which potentially impacted the yield of h2s thus this study investigated the effect of cao on the dissolution of organic matters and sludge lysis by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand scod proteins and polysaccharides in the early stage of reaction furthermore the variation of sludge structure with different cao addition was evaluated by the technologies of sem eds ftir spectra xps spectra and particle size of the sludge as we know the production of h2s from was anaerobic treatment process mainly included three biological processes namely sulfur containing organic e g proteins hydrolysis organic sulfide conversion and sulfate reduction in order to investigate the effect of cao on these processes a series of simulate experiments were performed by using model compounds of bovine serum protein cysteine and so4 2 as fermentation substrates sulfur containing organics hydrolysis test four identical serum bottles were carried out with a 500 ml working volume each bottle contained 30 ml of waste activated sludge and 270 ml of synthetic wastewater 3 5 g l bovine serum protein was added into each bottles which was identified as the sulfur containing organics also 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao were added into each bottle and the remaining operations were the same as in the above experiment sulfide conversion test in this test the operations were same as in the sulfur containing organics hydrolysis test except that the simulated substrate was replaced with 3000 mg l cysteine sulfate reduction test this test was similar to the above mentioned tests but the simulated substrate was 500 mg l so4 2 the variation of sulfate was detected in each reactors during the period of reaction 2 5 long term operation tests a semi continuous experiment was used to analyze the changes in microbial communities and key genes four serum bottles with a total volume of 2 l were taken each bottle contained 1 l raw was 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao were respectively added into each reactor based on the results obtained in section 2 2 the sludge retention time in semi continuous reactors was set at 18 d thus 55 5 ml of the fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each semi continuous reactor and replaced with the original was other operating conditions were consistent with those described in the batch test after 60 days of operation the production of h2s in these reactors gradually stabilized and then samples were extracted and analyzed for key genes and microbial community 2 6 microbial community analysis total gnomic dna was

significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao on h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation the cumulative curve of h2s production from anaerobic waste sludge in the presence of different level of cao was described in fig 1 it can be seen that the h2s production from waste anaerobic sludge increased from the 3rd day to the 12th day in all reactors and gradually ended on the 18th day however cao addition was significantly inhibited h2s production and the inhibition was positively correlated with cao concentration the maximum yield of h2s were 363 0 10 4 309 0 10 4 and 187 0 10 4 mg g vss respectively at the reactors with 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao which was 22 5 0 7 34 0 1 0 and 60 1 1 8 lower than that in the control to further evaluate the effect of cao addition on h2s production from anaerobic sludge the experimental data were simulated by using a modified gompertz liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 the curves fitted very well with r2 over 0 990 the experimental results showed that cao addition importantly decreased the potential of h2s production hm and reduced h2s generation rate rm but increased the lag phase time of h2s generation λ in anaerobic digestion system table 2 when cao addition increased from 0 to 60 mg g vss the value of hm rm decreased from 428 13 10 4 to 207 73 10 4 mg g vss 41 72 10 4 to 15 92 10 4 mg g vss d respectively and the value of λ increased from 2 33 0 09 to 3 17 0 14 d it was indicated that cao addition at the relevant level seriously reduced the h2s production and its production rate but improved the lag phase time of h2s generation during anaerobic digestion process 3 2 effect of the potential intermediates of cao on h2s production cao is an alkaline inorganic oxidizing agent and moisture sensitive with alkaline intermediates production cao would be form ca oh 2 eq 1 and or release ca2 and oh eq 2 after adding into the anaerobic sludge which is a typical mixed sludge and hydrous media thus in order to confirm the contribution for h2s production during anaerobic sludge system with cao addition this study assessed the effect of ca2 ca oh 2 and cao on h2s production from anaerobic sludge as shown in fig s1 there were negligible difference between the control and the reactor with 39 6 mg g vss cacl2 in the early stage of the anaerobic digestion nevertheless the cumulative production of h2s decreased with cacl2 addition furthermore it was found that the production of h2s was seriously inhibited by ca oh 2 and cao addition and their maximum yield of h2s respectively was 280 06 10 4 309 0 10 4 mg g vss which was 0 60 and 0 66 times lower than that in the control all the results illustrated that ca oh 2 and ca2 generated by cao both were the contributors to inhibit the production of h2s from anaerobic sludge moreover the production of h2s in the anaerobic sludge system with ca oh 2 addition was the lowest among these reactors suggesting that alkaline environment was the dominating inhibition factors 1 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 2 cao h 2 o c a 2 2 o h 3 3 effect of cao on sludge lysis as known to all waste activated sludge is a complex floc structure and contained the main chemical elements of c h o n and s c5h7no2s0 1 in the extracellular and intracellular sludge floc fu et al 2021 like the carbon containing substances in sludge sulfur containing organic compounds should firstly be released from the sludge floc before fermenter microorganism utilization thus the structure variation of sludge would directly affect the substrate of h2s production and the morphology and structure of sludge would be reflected though a optical observation technique of scanning electron microscope sem as shown in fig 2 a it can be seen that sludge floc structure without treatment in the control reactor was greatly compact and condensed with large sludge size however after cao treatment the sludge flocs were observably destroyed with abundant broken sludge particles furthermore laser particle size analysis technique was applied in this study to describe the degree of sludge breaking zhang et al 2018 previous studies reported that both hydrogen peroxides sodium percarbonate and calcium peroxide pretreatments hydrolyzed large particle size organic matter 300 1000 μm into smaller organic matter with medium particle size reducing 30 100 μm luo et al 2022 dong et al 2022 additionally xiao et al 2018 reported a reduction in the mean particle size d50 from 42 11 μm to 39 22 μm after citric acid and nzvi oxidation treatment of the sludge in this study compared with the control cao addition increased the percentage of sludge size in the range of 30 1 79 4 μm but the value of d90 were respectively 81 08 2 43 81 08 2 43 84 43 2 53 and 69 00 2 07 μm in the reactor with 0 10 20 and 60 mg g vss cao addition it was indicated cao addition promoted sludge lysis and enhanced the concentration of small sludge particle size the potential reason might be the degradation of macromolecular organic matter in the sludge floc fig 2d and fig 3a in addition it was demonstrated that chemical pretreatment e g kmno4 h2o2 fe3o4 etc significantly promoted organic substances release from intracellular to extracellular hu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the more organic matters are dissolved the more serious the sludge flocs are lysed wu et al 2015 accordingly the concentration of soluble cod was significantly improved after cao addition fig 2d particularly the concentrations of soluble cod were respectively 368 7 7 5 391 3 11 1 1413 0 28 3 mg l after 3 days fermentation in the reactors with 10 60 mg cao g vss which higher 16 7 23 8 and 347 1 than that in the reactor without cao addition these data further verified the promotion effect of cao on sludge structure destruction 3 4 details of how cao reduced h2s production during anaerobic sludge digestion system h2s production occurs mainly through two pathways e g the degradation and transformation of sulfur containing organic matters and sulfate reduction based on the above results cao addition positively promoted the release of sulfur containing organic matters and then they are further degraded into small organic molecular organics mainly proteins for subsequent biosulfur conversion fig 3 a depicted the variation of protein concentration at different cao levels it can be seen that the concentrations of protein were enhanced with cao addition and they were 128 23 1 58 134 15 1 52 151 41 0 98 and 276 32 3 51 mg l respectively in the reactor with cao addition ranging from 0 to 60 mg g vss in 3rd day furthermore ftir spectra of sludge showed that cao addition increased the intensity of band at 1075 cm 1 1455cm 1 1542 cm 1 1660 cm 1 2925 cm 1 and 3300 3400 cm 1 which are respectively relevant to cc in polysaccharide or nucleic acid c o ch c o in amido i and ii protein substances ch in alkanes and oh in alcohol or phenol xu et al 2019 fig 3b however the analysis of ftir spectra second derivative found cao addition also affected the structure of protein fig s2 which is an available technology for protein secondary structure and conformation it has been reported that protein mainly contained six secondary structure components such as α helix β sheet β turn aggregated strands random coil and antiparallel β sheet among them the α helix and β sheet are the essential shape in the secondary structure of proteins chen et al 2022 the former is a right hand helix conformation consisted by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 while the latter shows a special structure similar to the twisted and pleated sheet table s1 exhibited the proportion of major secondary structure components in protein although cao addition had little effect on the percent of α helix average 0 4 it seriously decreased β sheet ranging from 0 1 to 19 0 it was further suggested cao addition contributed to destroy hydrogen bonding networks and provided more biodegradable substrates for h2s production in addition amounts of sulfate were also found in anaerobic sludge digestion system and they derived from degradation of sulful containing organic matters or sludge itself it was reported sulfate reducing bacteria srbs could reduce sulfate into h2s under anaerobic environment with digestion intermediates e g scfas alcohol and h2 as electron donors jin et al 2022 fig 3c showed the variation of sulfate concentration in the fermenters with different cao addition the concentration of sulfate was respectively 28 06 0 14 26 77 0 13 19 24 0 10 and 18 47 0 19 mg l in the reactors with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss on the third day however its concentration in the reactor with 60 mg g vss cao addition was 2 16 times and 1 74 times higher than that in the control on the ninth and eighteenth day of fermentation the results indicated that the addition of cao more readily inhibited the sulfate production from the conversion of sulfur containing organic matter and also controlled the sulfate reduction which might be one of the reasons for the decrease of h2s yield in order to verify the above supposition batch tests were executed by using bas l cysteine sodium sulfate anhydrous as simulated substrates as shown in table s2 cao addition had a slight inhibition effect on the degradation of bas in the initial stage of fermentation with its degradation rate decreasing from 5 14 0 21 to 0 60 0 06 but then enhanced its degradation this might because higher cao level bring a shock and transitory toxicity to sbrs and other anaerobic microorganisms except that there was a similar degradation rates among these reactors for example the degradation rates of l cysteine and sodium sulfate anhydrous were about 87 96 1 78 and 62 45 1 73 respectively after 2 days fermentation no matter with or without cao addition these results indicated that the presence of cao brought a temporary inhibition the degradation of organic sulfide based on the eq 1 2 the addition of cao was beneficial to increase anaerobic sludge ph as shown in fig 4 a compared with the control higher cao addition level 60 mg g vss cao notably enhanced sludge ph from 7 13 to 8 25 only after one day exposure and the favorable alkaline environment was lasted for six days it is well known that h2s aqueous solution is a weak electrolyte and would ionized partially eq 3 and 4 hence the alkaline environment caused by cao was beneficial to the formation of hs and s2 transformed by h2s previous studies had been reported that 8 ph had a significantly effect on biogas production from waste anaerobic sludge yan et al 2018 yan et al 2018 found that the concentration of h2s was 1 76 mg l at the reactor with initial ph of 6 5 but the production of h2s reduced about 49 1 when sludge ph increased to 8 0 dai et al 2017b also reported h2s were reduced from 150 ppm to 15 ppm with ph increasing from 7 0 to 8 5 what s more although polysaccharide and protein are the main components for sludge some metals also are found in waste activated sludge such as fe mg ca and al which are readily to combine with s2 to form precipitate and or acid volatile sulfide fig 4b and 4c displayed the content of soluble metal ions and acid volatile sulfide in reactors with different cao in this study al was the most abundant soluble metal ions in all fermentation supernate with 761 0 3 81 773 5 3 87 602 0 3 01 and 602 0 2 05 mg l in the reactors with cao addition ranging from 0 60 mg g vss al3 and s2 would undergo double hydrolysis under alkaline environment eq 5 like al ion fe had a similar variation tendency but ca had a converse phenomena kokdemir unsar and perendeci 2018 on the other hand it was observed that cao remarkably improved acid volatile sulfide including mackinawite fes0 94 greigite fe3s4 amorphous monosulfides of metals e g fe zn from 15 56 0 16 to 25 74 0 26 mg l after 18 days of anaerobic fermentation fig 4c xps technology was further utilized to reveal the effect of cao on sulfur content and composition in sludge solid aromatic sulfur aliphatic sulfur sulfate sulfonic acid sulfoxide and inorganic sulfides are the main sulfur substances table s3 yin et al 2021 as can be seen from fig 4d and 4e 60 mg g vss cao increased metal sulfides r sh thiols and metal sulfates by 165 16 18 54 and 19 51 respectively in conclusion cao addition promoted the consumption of h and s2 because of the alkaline condition and metal ions release which decreased h2s emission and reduced its cumulative yield 3 h 2 s h h s 4 h s h s 2 5 a l 3 3 s 2 3 h 2 o al oh 3 3 h 2 s 3 5 microbial community analysis as a typical biochemical process functional microbial activities and key enzymes played a vital role in h2s production this study further explored the effect of cao on anaerobic microbial community through metagenomics technologies the percentage in raw reads and raw bases of sludge in all samples were about 98 80 and 98 53 respectively indicating the data were credible and effective table s4 alpha diversity of microbial community were analyzed with different cao level table s5 the value of simpson which represented the richness and evenness of microbial communities zhu and chen 2022 was 0 0162 and 0 0159 respectively in the reactor without cao addition and 60 mg cao g vss similarly the indexes of chao and shannon used to reflect the abundance and diversity of species were higher in the reactors at presence of cao addition compared to the reactor without cao this illustrated that cao exposure increased the diversity of microbial community to a certain extent based on the three pathway for h2s production during anaerobic fermentation system hydrolysis microorganism and sulfate reducing bacteria srbs are the major contributors it was observed that proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the main microorganism at the phylum level and accounted for over 82 6 of the total microflora fig s3 they are the typical fermentation microorganism and responsible for the degradation and transform of organic substance the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were about 45 5 2 3 and 14 7 1 2 respectively firmicutes is the another common anaerobic fermentation microorganism and its abundance was increased from 0 93 to 1 86 with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss in addition cao showed a positive effect on methanogens for example the abundance of euryarchaeota was respectively 1 84 0 1 1 87 0 1 2 01 0 1 and 2 40 0 3 at presence of 0 60 mg g vss cao fig 5 a exhibited the top 50 microbial populations at genus level to further evaluate the effect of cao on microbial community unclassified f chitinophagaceae unclassified c betaproteobacteria and unclassified p chloroflexi were the top three microorganisms at the genus level and their total relative abundance accounted for 24 4 0 7 in the reactor without cao addition but decreased to 19 9 1 1 in the 60 mg cao g vss reactor furthermore the distribution of hydrolysis microorganism was notably changed by higher cao addition for example unclassified f chitinophagaceae reduced from 10 4 0 3 in the control to 4 9 0 2 in the reactor with 60 mg g vss cao which is a typical denitrification bacteria and utilized complex less degradable organic carbons as electron acceptors compared with the control reactor the abundance of unclassified p acidobacteria was lower at the presence of 60 mg g vss cao addition 3 08 0 3 vs 2 1 0 2 ma et al 2019 had stated acidobacteria is a common fermentation microbe which is responsible to short chain fatty acid production from anaerobic sludge however cao addition improved certain microorganisms such as unclassified p bacteroidetes the control vs 60 mg cao g vss 2 49 0 2 vs 3 9 0 3 unclassified f anaerolineaceae the control vs 60 mg cao g vss 1 08 0 1 vs 1 62 0 2 similar phenomena had been reported by ao et al 2021 besides the abundance of methanothrix was increased from 1 89 0 1 to 2 35 0 2 with cao increasing from 0 to 60 mg g vss which competes with srb as electron donors on the other hand it was found that cao addition reduced the total gene code of srbs from 8658 to 7578 reads according to macrogenome nr species annotation fig s4 generally srbs i e desulfosarcina desulfobulbus desulfovibrio and desulfomonile were considered to be capable of so4 2 reduction shi et al 2020 but jin et al 2019 reported srb could work as a fermentation microorganism and cooperate with methanogens when the concentration of so4 2 was depleted hence cooperation between srb and methanogens might take precedence in this study it was indicated that cao importantly reduced the abundances of hydrolysis microorganism particularly denitrification hydrolytic bacteria but enhanced ch4 producers which the main reason for h2s inhibition 3 6 the effect of cao on the conversion of sulfur components in sludge as we know functional genes are the key factors that determine the structure and performance of microorganisms in order to further expound how cao impact microbial community the types and abundance of key genes about h2s production during anaerobic sludge fermentation system were exhibited and evaluated in fig 6 organic s hydrolysis played the primary role for sulfur conversion for organic s hydrolysis pathway the functional genes encoding pepd metn i q and cdo1 involved in the degradation of large molecules of sulfur containing organic matters although the abundance of metn i q and cdo1 were improved in experimental groups cao significantly inhibited pepd which was responsible for the first step of protein hydrolysis in addition the pathways of dissimilatory and assimilation sulfate reduction were profiled based on gene set constructed by srbs indicating that the relevant genes were severely impacted by cao for example relative to the control the relevant abundance of cysn d and sat reduced by 20 9 4 2 and 6 2 in the reactor with 60 mg cao g vss fu et al 2022 stated cysn d and sat encoded the enzyme atp sulfurylase which used sulfate to generate adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps meanwhile higher cao seriously inhibited the generation of sulfide generated from aps reduction through adenylylsulfate kinase and phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase and sulfide reductase encoded by cysh c and sir xie et al 2022 for another cao addition had little effect on apra and dsra b which encode the reductases about adenylylsulfate and dissimilatory sulfide these revealed that cao addition inhibited the initial stage of sulfate contained organic hydrolysis and sulfate reduction which resulted in a decrease in h2s production conclusions this study explored the effect of cao addition on h2s production from was during anaerobic fermentation process and then revealed its relevant mechanism the results showed that cao addition significantly inhibited h2s production in anaerobic sludge fermentation system and about 60 1 1 8 of the maximum h2s yield were reduced by 60 mg g vss cao addition the conversion investigation of sulfur containing substance found cao promoted the release of sulfur contained organic matter but it inhibited organic sulfide hydrolysis and sulfate reduction microbial community analysis showed that unclassified f chitinophagaceae unclassified c betaproteobacteria and unclassified p chloroflexi were the top three microorganisms with 19 9 of total abundance in all reactors furthermore results observed that higher cao addition seriously reduced the abundances of denitrifying hydrolytic bacteria but enhanced ch4 producers functional genes analysis further found that cao severely inhibited the relevant genes such as pepd metn i q cysh c sir which encoded the initial stage of sulfate contained organic hydrolysis and sulfate reduction author contributions hang li planned the experiment yali wang and hongjie wang analyzed the data and wrote the paper hang li xianglong

14709,organophosphate esters opes as an important class of new pollutants have been pervasively detected in global aquatic products arousing widespread public concern due to their potential bioaccumulative behavior and consequent risks with the continuous improvement of living standards of citizens there have been constant increment of the proportion of aquatic products in diets of people the levels of opes exposed to residents may also be rising due to the augmented consumption of aquatic products posing potential hazards on human health especially for people in coastal areas the present study integrated the concentrations profiles bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in global aquatic products including mollusca crustacea and fish evaluated health risks of opes through aquatic products in daily diets by mont carol simulation mcs and found asia has been the most polluted area in terms of the concentration of opes in aquatic products and would have been increasingly polluted among all studied opes chlorinated opes generally showed accumulation predominance it is worth noting that some opes were found bioaccumulated and or biomagnified in aquatic ecosystems though mcs revealed relative low exposure risks of residents sensitive and special groups such as children adolescents and fishermen may face more serious health risks than the average residents finally knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are discussed encouraging more long term and systematic global monitoring comprehensive studies of novel opes and opes metabolites and more toxicological studies to completely evaluate the potential risks of opes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organophosphate esters aquatic products

the study https fdc nal usda gov 2 2 monte carlo simulations monte carlo simulations mcs were employed to estimate the daily dose of intake edi of opes through aquatic foods 100 000 simulations were conducted python 3 9 0 for each ope individual and the population of each continent asia north america europa and oceania for each simulation n types of sea foods were selected from the candidate list of aquatic products which had been tested for the abundance of the given type of ope whereas n followed a poisson distribution p o s s i o n n λ 4 the average daily amount of aquatic food a person

ope i was assumed followed by a normal distribution n o r m a l μ ope i δ ope i 2 where μ ope i is usually the mean of concentration of the sampled aquatic products and the corresponding δ ope i was their standard deviation unless if the concentrations of ope individual was only marked as detected the μ ope i would be half of method limited of quantitation and the corresponding δ ope i was 1 3 of

include abalone mussels oysters clams scallops squid etc imbs et al 2021 which are an important source of animal derived protein for humans in 2018 global caught molluscs reached nearly 6 million tonnes and farmed molluscs produced the 17 70 million tonnes fao 2020 to date available data on the occurrence of opes in molluscs are limited molluscs are usually at the relatively low trophic level in aquatic ecosystem available data of opes in molluscs mainly focused on asia europe and north america fig 1 the highest mean opes in freshwater molluscs was found in the freshwater mussel anodonta woodiana in meiliang bay taihu lake 36 02 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 which was higher than that of freshwater mussel that of pearl mussel unio douglasiae and that of bivalve corbicula fluminea from zhushan bay taihu lake 3 92 11 15 and 21 75 ng g ww respectively wang et al 2019a in china the highest mean opes in marine molluscs was found in oysters crassostrea gigas from weizhou island china 41 01 ng g ww ding et al 2020 which was comparable to that of freshwater mussels from meiliang bay taihu lake 36 02 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 the mean opes in blue mussels mytilus edulis from the coast of sweden 16 23 ng g ww sundkvist et al 2010 was comparable to that of mussels mytilus edulis and mytilus galloprovincialis 16 30 ng g ww from northern coast of spain castro et al 2020b but was much higher than that of cockle cerastoderma edule 3 95 ng g ww from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 and that of mussel mytilus edulis and oyster crassostrea gigas 3 87 ng g ww from the korean coast choi et al 2020 and that of bivalve mytilus californianus 0 80 ng g ww from san francisco bay usa sutton et al 2019 the mean opes in mussel from supermarkets in antwerp belgium 3 72 ng g ww xu et al 2015 was lower than that of scallop and oyster from belgian markets 7 83 ng g ww poma et al 2018 but higher than that of oyster from markets in queensland australia 1 50 ng g ww he et al 2018b overall the average concentration of opes in molluscs from asia 3 87 41 01 ng g ww choi et al 2020 ding et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018 was generally higher than that of mollusc in europe and north america 0 80 16 23 ng g ww brandsma et al 2015 castro et al 2020b poma et al 2018 sundkvist et al 2010 sutton et al 2019 xu et al 2015 this may be related to the transfer of the flame retardants market from europe and america to asia in recent years for example the growth rate of the consumption of flame retardants in china reached up to 13 which was significantly higher than that of in the usa 2 0 and that of in europe 1 5 van der veen and de boer 2012 3 2 crustaceans crustaceans including crabs and shrimps etc imbs et al 2021 have been more and more merchandized and generalized in recent decades and now accounting for 30 of the total global fisheries catch behringer and duermit moreau 2021 however available data on opes in crustaceans is scarce fig 2 for freshwater crustaceans low level of opes were found in taihu lake shrimps macrobranchium nipponense 2 03 ng g ww and white shrimps exopalaemon modestus 3 74 ng g ww from zhushan bay of taihu lake wang et al 2019a in comparison slightly higher opes were measured in shrimps taihu lake shrimp and white shrimp from the meiliang bay of taihu lake 12 73 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 the elevated levels of opes were found in red claws crabs chiromantes haematocheir 20 84 ng g ww and greasyback shrimps metapenaeus ensi 28 08 ng g ww from qi ao island mangrove nature reserve of southern china xie et al 2022a which may be attributed to the large discharge of domestic sewage the highest levels of opes was found in oriental river prawn macrobrachium nipponense 33 96 ng g ww from an enclosed e waste polluted pond in qingyuan southern china liu et al 2019a which were one order of magnitude higher than that in zhushan bay taihu lake 2 03 3 74 ng g ww wang et al 2019a electronic waste e waste dismantling is an important emission source of traditional bfrs and opes ge et al 2020 huang et al 2018 thus could substantially contribute to the high levels of opes in shrimps from qingyuan the highest levels of opes in marine crustaceans was found in wild green mud crab scylla paramamosain from weizhou island china 44 10 ng g ww ding et al 2020 where also observed the highest contamination of opes for marine molluscs this may indicate that a possible emission source of opes existed in weizhou island the relatively lower opes was found in green mud crab samples from mariculture farms of the beibu gulf china 12 02 ng g ww zhang et al 2020 which comparable to that of in shore crabs carcinus maenas collected from western scheldt estuary of netherlands 9 97 ng g ww brandsma et al 2015 the levels of opes in shrimp samples purchased from supermarkets in antwerp belgium xu et al 2015 and queensland australia he et al 2018b were 2 41 and 1 01 ng g ww respectively which were much lower than the levels of opes in crustaceans from asia 3 3 fishes opes and their derivative products have widely been detected in fishes whose dietary intake gill respiration and dermal contact could accumulate contaminants in the aquatic environments pantelaki and voutsa 2020 importantly fishes are one of the most important sources of high quality protein for humans accounting for 16 of the animal derived protein consuming by human beings tidwell and allan 2001 in the asia mean opes levels in fishes from china 5 17 47 52 ng g ww bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 he et al 2019 hou et al 2017 liu et al 2019b 2019a 2019c wang et al 2019a xie et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 were generally higher than those of other countries fig 3 such as philippines 4 35 ng g ww kim et al 2011 and korea 5 12 ng g ww choo et al 2018 the mean opes in freshwater fishes such as common carp cyprinus carpio crucian carp carassius auratus lake anchovy coilia ectenes etc from zhushan bay wang et al 2019a and meiliang bay zhao et al 2018 in taihu lake were 9 49 and 7 44 ng g ww respectively which were comparable to those in mud carp cirrhinus molitorella tilapia tilapia nilotica and plecostomus hypostomus plecostomus from rivers in the pearl river delta southern china 10 25 g g ww liu et al 2019b in comparison the relatively high opes were found in freshwater fish from rivers of beijing 23 37 ng g ww hou et al 2017 chongqing 47 52 ng g ww he et al 2019 and guangdong 19 21 ng g ww xie et al 2022a liu et al investigated opes in several freshwater fish snakehead ophiocephalus argus catfish clarias batrachus crucian carp mud carp cirrhinus molitorella from a pond near an electronic waste site in qingyuan china including snakehead ophiocephalus argus catfish clarias batrachus crucian carp mud carp cirrhinus molitorella and opes in snakehead and catfish 4 30 5 10 ng g ww were lower than those of crucian carp and mud carp 10 00 17 00 ng g ww liu et al 2019a possibly indicating species specific accumulation of opes the highest mean opes in marine fishes was presented in laizhou bay northern china 30 22 ng g ww bekele et al 2021a this may be related to the presence of opes production plants along the coast of laizhou bay zhong et al 2020 opes in marine fish from weizhou island of the south china sea was the second most abundant 12 71 ng g ww ding et al 2020 which was higher than that in marine fish from xiangshan bay of ningbo 5 17 ng g ww zhang et al 2022 similar to marine molluscs and crustaceans opes in marine fish from the weizhou island in the south china sea were also at high levels ding et al 2020 further suggesting that the potential local emission sources of opes in this region the moderate contamination level of opes was found in marine fishes from the market in nanjing with a mean of 9 45 ng g ww gao et al 2014 concentrations of opes in fish products also varied considerably in different regions of europe the mean opes in freshwater fishes from evrotas river adige river and sava river in three european basins were 5 19 4 42 and 2 23 ng g ww giulivo et al 2017 respectively which were slightly lower than in perch perca fluviatilis 9 95 ng g ww from lakes in sweden sundkvist et al 2010 elevated concentrations of opes were observed in fish from llobregat river spain 17 62 ng g ww santín et al 2016 and from the north american great lakes 19 58 ng g ww choi et al 2022 the dense population and developed industry around the great lakes of north american may be the reason for the high opes in the fish in the great lakes for marine fish the mean opes in eels anguilla from bizerte lagoon tunisia mekni et al 2020 in atlantic herring clupea harengus from baltic sea de wit et al 2020 in viviparous eelpout zoarces viviparus from the swedish coast sundkvist et al 2010 and in fish from western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 were 14 99 11 14 13 35 and 18 17 ng g ww respectively in comparison relatively lower of the mean opes were found in marine fish from barcelon 9 20 ng g ww garcia garin et al 2020 from a marine protected area the cap de creus mpa 7 40 ng g ww garcia garin et al 2020 from svalbard norway 8 06 ng g ww hallanger et al 2015 and from the mediterranean sea 7 27 ng g ww sala et al 2022 the mean opes in commercially available fish from spain castro et al 2020a belgium poma et al 2018 and sweden poma et al 2017 were 6 63 3 14 and 4 95 ng g ww respectively which were comparable to the mean opes in commercially available fish from new york the usa 2 51 ng g ww wang and kannan 2018 but higher than that in fish products purchased from the market of queensland in australia 0 64 ng g ww he et al 2018b similar to the results of molluscs and crustaceans the mean levels of opes in fish products were higher in asia 5 12 47 52 ng g ww than in europe north america and australia 0 64 18 17 ng g ww further suggesting that the increased use of opes in this region had a significant impact on the occurrence of opes in the local environment and ecosystem worthwhile noticing opes were also detected in fish notothenia coriiceps 0 31 ng g ww from king george island in antarctica fu et al 2020 and stickleback pungitiu spungitius 5 56 ng g ww from alaska in the arctic zheng et al 2020 indicating that opes have enough longer persistence in environment and might be transported from source region to remote polar regions through long range transport 3 4 characteristics of ope individual composition compositional characteristics of opes in aquatic products were discussed according to the different side chain substituents as following chlorinated opes alkyl opes and aryl opes the predominance of chlorinated opes was observed in aquatic products with the average relative abundance ranging from 20 to 73 fig 4 in vitro studies have shown that the biotransformation of opes is structure specific resulting in the slowest biotransformation rate of chlorinated opes among the 3 main types of opes greaves et al 2016b additionally the predominance of chlorinated opes in aquatic products may be related to the relatively highest abundance of chlorinated opes in their living environment water or sediment among the 3 main types vasseghian et al 2022 xie et al 2022b fu et al 2023 two chlorinated opes tcep and tcipp were predominant among all chlorinated opes in aquatic products at most of time with average relative abundance of 11 and 26 respectively the relatively low log k ow of tcep and tcipp 3 make them difficult to adsorb on activated sludge particles therefore the removing efficient of tcep and tcipp in wwtps are low resulting in their extensive existence in natural waters meyer and bester 2004 moreover the half lives of tcep 2904 h and tcipp 5100 h in water were obviously higher than those of other non chlorinated opes 906 h zhang et al 2016 the more abundance of tcep and tcipp in water environment and their longer persistence compared to those other opes resulting in their exposure to aquatic organisms in longer time and large quantities additionally tcep and tcipp showed greater resistant to biodegradation than non chlorinated opes zhang et al 2016 therefore the predominance of tcep and tcipp in aquatic products may be related to their physicochemical properties in certain cases of aquatic products tboep tnbp tehp and tphp were predominant specifically tehp was the most abundant ope individual in those fish from adige river of italy giulivo et al 2017 manila bay of philippines kim et al 2011 rivers in the pearl river delta of china liu et al 2019b and llobregat river of spain santín et al 2016 with the relative abundance of 22 22 44 and 35 respectively high abundance of tphp was found in mussels from belgium poma et al 2018 and spain castro et al 2020b accounting for 80 and 79 of σopes respectively in addition the mean relative abundance of tphp in fish from a pond in qingyuan of china liu et al 2019c and that of the fish in a mangrove nature reserve in southern china xie et al 2022a were also exceeded 40 tboep was the predominant ope in aquatic products crabs oysters fish collected from the weizhou island china ding et al 2020 in fish from rivers of spain castro et al 2020b in aquatic products bivalves crabs fish from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 and in capelin from the svalbard norway hallanger et al 2015 with the relative contributions higher than 20 high abundance of tnbp was also found in stickleback from alaska in the arctic zheng et al 2020 crucian carp from beijing hou et al 2017 and chongqing he et al 2019 accounting for 55 57 and 30 of σopes respectively the mean relative abundances of tnbp more than 30 were found for crucian carp mud carp and catfish from a pond polluted by e waste dismantling in qingyuan south china liu et al 2019a the relative high abundance of tehp among opes in some aquatic products may be related to its relative high bioaccumulation potential because the log k ow of tehp 9 49 table s1 is greater than 5 differently tphp tnbp and tboep had relatively low predicted log k ow values 4 49 4 00 and 3 75 respectively which suggest their relative low bioaccumulation potential the relatively high abundance of tphp tnbp and tboep in some aquatic products may be attributed to their relative high contamination level in water environment for example the relatively high abundance of tboep were found in the seawater from weizhou island of south china sea 29 ding et al 2020 and found in the sediments from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands 36 brandsma et al 2015 the relative high abundance of tnbp was found in the river water from chongqing 29 he et al 2019 and the relative high abundance of tphp was found in the sediments of mangrove nature reserve from the pearl river estuary of south china 47 xie et al 2022a in addition the relatively higher abundance of tnbp were found in small mud carp 69 and small catfish 63 from a pond in qingyuan of china than those in large mud carp 47 and large catfish 47 liu et al 2019a which may indicate an age specific bioaccumulation and metabolism 4 bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes 4 1 bioaccumulation of opes sediment act as not only a reservoir of organic pollutants but also act as an important potential source of organic pollutants in molluscs crustaceans and benthic fish wang et al 2018a biota sediment accumulation factors bsafs calculated by the ratio of the lipid normalized concentration of organic contaminants in organisms to that of the organic carbon normalized concentration in sediments and have been widely used to evaluate the bioavailability of organic contaminants in sediment wong et al 2001 the bsafs of opes in aquatic products were summarized in table s3 the bsaf values of opes in aquatic products from zhushan bay of taihu lake in china were all lower than 1 of which the bsafs of opes in invertebrates ranged from 6 90 10 4 0 32 which were slightly higher than those in benthic fish 2 1 10 4 0 19 wang et al 2019a bsafs of opes in fish from laizhou bay of china ranged from 0 03 to 0 10 bekele et al 2019 in addition the bsafs of opes detected in fish from coastal areas of korea choi et al 2020 and from sava river adige river and evrotas river in europe giulivo et al 2017 were also lower than 1 these results showed the relatively low bioavailability of opes in sediments however xie et al found that the mean bsafs of all six ope individuals in aquatic products from the mangrove nature reserve were higher than 1 and the log bsafs of opes had a significantly negative correlation with log k ow xie et al 2022a inconsistently the log bsaf of opes in benthic invertebrates from zhushan bay in taihu lake increased along with the increasing of log k ow 1 44 5 73 whereas the log bsaf of opes were decreased along with the increasing of log k ow 5 73 wang et al 2019a the trend of increasing first and then decreasing for the log bsaf values of opes mediated by their log k ow were also found in fish from the laizhou bay bekele et al 2019 and xiangshan bay of china zhang et al 2022 the peak level of bsafs were presented when the log k ow are 4 59 and 5 73 respectively different association trends were found between the log bsafs and the log k ow of opes in different studies indicating that the bioavailability of opes is influenced not only by log k ow but also by other factors such as temperature and the continuous presence of local point source of opes though data on the relations between temperature and bsafs are still not available it can still be assured that temperature plays an important role on the distribution of pollutants in aquatic environment for example a rise of temperature would increase the bsafs of methylmercury for amphipod curtis et al 2019 the snakeheads and prawns from a pond close to e waste dismantling area in qingyuan china liu et al 2019a and the loachs and crucian carps from rivers of beijing china hou et al 2017 were all found having their bsafs higher than 1 which may be attributed to the continuous input of local point source pollution into opes bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in organisms and their trophic transfer behavior in ecosystems are important factors for assessing their potential ecological risk van der veen and de boer 2012 bioaccumulation factors bafs and bioconcentration factors bcfs calculated by the ratio of the wet weight concentration of pollutants in organisms to that of the concentration of pollutants in water as a method which have been widely used to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of certain pollutants van der veen and de boer 2012 the bafs of opes in aquatic products were also summarized in table s3 the log bcfs of 15 opes ranged from 0 036 to 3 027 table s1 which was lower than the lower threshold defined by the stockholm convention log bcf 3 70 greaves et al 2016a indicating their limited bioaccumulation potential the log bafs values of tdcipp tcep and tcipp in the aquatic ecosystem of laizhou bay china were 2 70 2 50 and 2 30 respectively bekele et al 2019 similarly the log bafs of tdcipp tcep and tcipp in the aquatic ecosystem of zhushan bay of taihu lake china were 1 26 0 72 and 0 46 respectively wang et al 2019a however wang et al reported the relative high log baf of tehp in benthic invertebrates 4 70 and benthic fish 4 40 from the aquatic ecosystem of zhushan bay of taihu lake china wang et al 2019a bekele et al investigated the bioaccumulation potential of opes in a marine food web form the laizhou bay china where the log baf value of tehp in organisms was up to 4 64 bekele et al 2019 xie et al investigated the bioaccumulation behavior of opes in aquatic products a mangrove nature reserve from the pearl river estuary of china and found that the average log bafww of tehp among different species was 3 82 xie et al 2022a the log bafww 3 82 4 70 of tehp in these studies was higher than the lower threshold defined by the stockholm convention for pops log baf 3 70 indicating the relative high bioaccumulation potential of tehp some studies have shown that the log baf of opes is significantly and positively correlated with their corresponding log k ow bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019a the log k ow of tehp 9 49 table s1 was higher than others opes such as tcep 1 70 tdcipp 3 65 and tcipp 2 68 which may be the cause of the relatively higher log baf of tehp than other opes however some studies showed that inverted parabolic correlation or even no correlation were found between the log baf values of opes and their corresponding log k ow which may be indicate that log k ow can have an effect on the log baf of opes within a certain range of log k ow or the log k ow of opes was not the only one factor affecting their log baf li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 wang et al compared the log bafww of opes in benthic invertebrates and fish and found that the log bafww of tphp ehdpp and tehp were higher in benthic invertebrates 2 71 4 70 than in fish 2 54 4 40 wang et al 2019a ding et al showed that the average log bafdw of opes in different marine products in the tropical south china sea was in the sequence of oysters 3 78 crab 3 65 fish 3 06 ding et al 2020 similarly the log bafww of opes in shrimp from a pond of qingyuan china 2 58 was also greater than that of fish 2 40 liu et al 2019a it was reported that p450 enzymes in organisms play an important role in the degradation and metabolism of exogenous pollutants the activity of p450 enzymes in aquatic organisms was reported to be higher in fish than invertebrates thus resulting in the relatively faster biotransformation of opes in fish livingstone 1998 therefore the speed of metabolism of opes in different organisms may an important factor affecting the residual of opes in organisms in addition the habitat of different aquatic products anthropogenic sources and other factors may also affect the bioaccumulation of opes to different degrees 4 2 trophic transfer of opes biomagnification factors bmfs and trophic magnification factors tmfs are commonly used to assess the transfer of contaminants between predators and preys or in food chains webs borgå et al 2012 data on biomagnification trophic level magnification of opes in aquatic food chains webs are scarce and limited studies generally focused on lake and marine aquatic food webs table s4 biomagnification of opes including tphp cdpp and tcrp tep tnbp tboep tehp tcep tcipp and tdcipp has been identified in marine food chains webs with tmfs ranging from 1 06 to 5 20 bekele et al 2021 fu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 kim et al found a significant positive correlation between tphp concentration and trophic level in benthic fish from the manila bay philippines indicating the trophic magnification potential of tphp kim et al 2011 wang et al found that ehdpp had trophic magnification behavior in the aquatic food chain of zhushan bay taihu lake china with a tmf of 3 61 wang et al 2019a however zhao et al found that opes had trophic dilution behavior in the aquatic food chain from meiliang bay of taihu lake china with tmfs of 0 55 0 39 and 0 42 respectively for tcipp tdcipp and tcrp zhao et al 2018 liu et al also found trophic dilution for tnbp and tphp in the aquatic food chain from a pond close to an e waste dismantling plant from qingyuan china with tmfs of 0 57 and 0 62 respectively liu et al 2019a brandsma et al studied the trophic transfer behavior of opes in a food web of the western scheldt river in the netherlands and found that tboep tcipp and tcep had trophic magnification behavior in the benthic food chain but not in the pelagic food chain brandsma et al 2015 therefore the trophic transfer behavior of opes in aquatic food chains may be related to the structure of food chains and the habitats of organisms notably the average p450 enzyme content in fish 322 pmol mg is higher than that in mollusc 73 pmol mg livingstone 1998 probably resulting in more and quicker metabolisms of opes in fish than that in mollusc which may be the reason of the trophic dilution of opes in some pelagic food chain evidently there have been report in our previous study which showed that tcep and tcipp presented trophic magnification in the antarctic marine food chain from archeogastropoda nacella concinna agas neogastropoda trophon geversianus ngas fish notothenia coriiceps to cape petrel daption capense fu et al 2020 it was also reported that opes in birds could be rapidly metabolized by p450 enzymes while the metabolic rate of opes in cape petrels feathers collected in our previous study may be greatly reduced due to the absence of enzymes in feathers thus resulting in the biomagnification of opes in the whole food chain porter et al 2014 ding et al found that the tmfs of seven opes including tcep tcipp tdcipp tibp tnbp tphp and tboep were significantly and positively correlated with latitude i e the tmfs of tropical opes were lower than those of temperate and boreal opes ding et al 2020 since the metabolism of organic pollutants in organisms were operated by the catalytic action of a series of enzymes livingstone 1998 temperature was an important factor on the enzymatic metabolism therefore temperature could affect the metabolism of opes in the organism which in turn affected the trophic transfer behavior of opes 5 risk assessment of opes through aquatic product ingestion 5 1 point assessment of opes hitherto studies to the potential risk of opes in aquatic products were scarce and focused on a limited number of countries including china bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 xie et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 philippines kim et al 2011 belgium malarvannan et al 2015 poma et al 2018 sweden poma et al 2017 and the usa wang and kannan 2018 wang et al investigated opes in foodstuffs from albany new york united states and the median concentration of σ15opes in fish and mussels was 7 11 ng g ww which was comparable to meat 6 75 ng g ww but much higher than in dairy product 1 22 ng g ww cereal product 1 94 ng g ww and cooking oil 1 16 ng g ww wang and kannan 2018 σ9 opes in fish 1 80 ng g ww from the southeast queensland australia was higher than those in dairy products 1 40 ng g ww meat 1 00 ng g ww and eggs 1 00 ng g ww he et al 2018b chen et al reported the opes in animal derived foods in china and showed that the mean 14opes were decreased in the sequence of meat 16 3 ng g ww aquatic products 12 10 ng g ww eggs 11 30 ng g ww milk 6 47 ng g ww chen et al 2021 it can be seen that aquatic products intake is an important route for human exposure to opes considering the day by day increase in per capita intake of aquatic products the importance to integrate available data on aquatic products and comprehensively analyze the potential risks of opes through dietary intake is obvious the estimated daily intake edi ng kg bw day of contaminants was calculated by the daily intake of food multiplying the wet weight concentration of contaminants in food and was commonly used to assess the potential health risks of contaminants to human beings based on dietary intake wang et al 2019a the reference dose value rfd is a metric proposed by the epa for the risk evaluation of non carcinogens which is obtained by dividing the chronic no observed adverse effect level noael by the safety factor sf 1000 wang et al 2019a the rfd of ope individuals were shown in table 1 with the values ranging from 13 000 tmtp to 25 000 tep ng kg bw day li et al 2019a ope individuals were considered to be at potential risks when the edi of certain ope was higher than their corresponding rfd li et al 2018 bekele et al assessed edis of opes of rural and urban residents in northern china through marine fish based on the 95th percentile opes concentration edis of opes for urban residents 3 10 22 10 ng kg bw day through marine fish intake were approximately twice as high as those of rural residents 1 70 12 00 ng kg bw day bekele et al 2021 similarly the edis of opes through marine aquatic products crabs oysters and fish intake for urban residents 0 16 12 03 ng kg bw day in southern china based on the 95th percentile opes concentrations was higher than that for rural residents 0 09 6 50 ng kg bw day ding et al 2020 urban residents generally consumed more marine products than those of rural residents which might result in the relatively higher edis of opes found in urban residents with respect to those of rural residents ding et al further assessed the relative contribution of different seafoods oysters crabs and shrimps to the edis of opes based on the 90th percentile ope concentration of which oysters took up the highest contribution to the edis of opes 50 and followed by shrimps 25 and crabs 25 ding et al 2020 those results might suggest that the potential health risk of residents through molluscs intake was higher than those of crustaceans and those of fish the edis of opes of adolescents in southern china through seafood intake 0 14 8 18 ng kg bw day was comparable to those of children 0 10 6 33 ng kg bw day but higher than that of adults 0 08 3 51 ng kg bw day zhang et al 2020 similarly the edis of opes for young children 36 80 ng kg bw day through the consumption of aquatic products from the mangrove nature reserves in china was higher than those of children 23 70 ng kg bw day those of adolescents 23 10 ng kg bw day and those of adults 11 50 ng kg bw day xie et al 2022a therefore attention should be paid to the potential health risks for young children exposed to opes based on average concentration of opes in fish products the edis of opes in coastal residents of the philippines ranged from 0 07 to 2 00 ng kg bw day kim et al 2011 the edi of opes in general population 0 01 0 10 ng kg bw day was much lower than that of fishermen 0 25 2 50 ng kg bw day by evaluating the mean concentration of opes in eel from the flanders belgium malarvannan et al 2015 for mediterranean residents the edis of opes through seafood intake ranged from nd to 12 60 ng kg bw day based on the 95th percentile ope concentration sala et al 2022 for residents of sweden the edis of opes through the consumption of fish products ranged from 3 00 to 112 00 ng kg bw day based on the average ope concentration poma et al 2017 currently the edis of opes for residents through aquatic products intake were several orders of magnitude lower than their corresponding rfds indicating the low health risk of opes through aquatic products intake 5 2 monte carlo simulation currently dietary exposure assessment of opes in aquatic products generally based on point evaluation model such as the edi model li et al 2019b point evaluation model assumes that the concentration of chemicals in foods is constant and the residents dietary consumption is equivalent while the residents dietary exposure to opes may be discontinuous and day by day variable peng et al 2016 therefore in the present study a nonparametric probabilistic evaluation model based on monte carlo simulation mcs was performed in dietary exposures risks of opes in aquatic products which provides not only quantitative results but also their variability and uncertainty thompson and graham 1996 the concentration of opes in aquatic products from asia europe oceania and north america were systematic collected 100 000 times of mcs were simulated to evaluate the edis of opes of residents through aquatic products intake fig 5 mcs covers all possible scenarios that may not be experienced in field sampling activities wu et al 2011 therefore simulations in mcs were performed to the obtain the edis of 50th 90th and 99th percentile of dietary opes exposed population and thereby to assess the risk of ope exposure through aquatic product consumption in the general population in highly exposed populations and extremely highly exposed populations respectively table 1 based on the 50th percentile edis in aquatic products the medium edi of total opes for residents of north america 12 07 ng kg bw day through aquatic products intake was higher than that in asia 8 92 ng kg bw day in europe 5 07 ng kg bw day ng kg bw day and in oceania 1 21 ng kg bw day the 90th percentile edi of opes via aquatic products consumed by residents of north america 29 30 ng kg bw day was also higher than that of asia 19 15 ng kg bw day and europe 19 04 ng kg bw day in the 50th percentile ope exposure scenario the profiles of total opes and those of individual opes suggested that tcep and tcipp would have contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products for asian and oceanian residents whereas tcrp would have contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products for residents of north america the lower relative proportion of chlorinated opes than those of the other opes such as ehdpp tboep and tehp in edis of total opes through aquatic products intake of european populations which could be attribute to the restriction on chlorinated opes in europe van der veen and de boer 2012 the edis of total opes for residents of oceania through aquatic products intake was the least 1 21 ng kg bw day among north america asia europe and oceanian residents in the 50th percentile ope exposure scenario whereas in the 90th percentile ope exposure scenario the edis of total opes for residents of oceania through aquatic products intake was the highest 59 74 ng kg bw day among the above four continental populations in fact only one study investigated opes in aquatic products in oceania he et al 2018b tcipp was detected in all samples whereas other opes including tcep tdcipp tboep tphp tehp tcrp and ehdpp were detected in less than 30 of samples for asian populations in addition to tcipp tnbp also greatly contributed 4 35 ng kg bw day to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products based on the 90th percentile edi of ope which was different with the profile at 50th percentile edi of the populations this suggested that available data on ope in asian aquatic products had relatively high concentrations of tnbp similarly the mcs study on opes in drinking water intaking by chinese residents found a relative high contribution of tcipp and tnbp to edis of total opes vasseghian et al 2022 tnbp was not only used as flame retardant but also used as hydraulic oil and lubricant additive so the dominance of tnbp in total opes in asia may be related to its thriving transportation and prosperous logistics industry van der veen and de boer 2012 it is noteworthy that despite the differences in local ope use history and dietary habits of the population chlorinated opes tcep tcipp tdcipp contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the aquatic products intake for residents among all populations on the four continents based on the profile of 99th percentile edi of opes although the restrict regulation on chlorinated opes have been introduced the potential ecological and human health risks of chlorinated opes need to be given high priority due to the predominance of chlorinated opes in aquatic products the mcs results based on the 99th percentile ope concentration in aquatic products showed that edis of opes for residents of four continents through the aquatic products intake were far below the rfds established by usepa table 1 therefore the potential health risks due to the consumption of aquatic products for global residents are relative low at present to date only a few of opes had reported rfds and insufficiency study on toxic mechanisms and endpoints of opes which limited the comprehensive understanding on health risks of opes to human being blum et al 2019 additionally with the increasing use of opes in the worldwide the contamination of opes in global aquatic products may further increase in the future thereby rising health risks based on the existing data on opes in aquatic products in asia 2013 2018 we simulated and predicted the temporal trend of opes exposure through aquatic products intake by residents in the region 2019 2029 fig s1 its results showed that the edis of opes through aquatic products intake by population in asia would increase continuously which may induce the increasing exposure risks of opes in addition to aquatic products intake other dietary exposure in combination with inhalation and dermal exposure the edis of opes in residents would close to their corresponding rfds thus posing the health risks to human being poma et al 2018 it is noteworthy that exposure risk assessment based solely on opes and neglecting their transformation products may underestimate the potential health risks of opes through dietary exposure opes could be metabolize to organophosphate diesters di opes hydroxylated di opes hydroxylated tri opes and hydroxylated glucuronide conjugate metabolites in organisms su et al 2015 some metabolites of opes have been detected in indoor dust tan et al 2019 waste water and sludge wang et al 2019b river water fu et al 2017 and even in human blood and urine e wang et al 2014 recently our pervious study simultaneously investigated tri opes and di opes in global fishmeal samples and found that the mean concentration of 8 di opes 49 60 ng g dw was comparable to that of 16 tri opes 59 30 ng g dw li et al 2020b to date only one study simultaneously assessed the dietary exposures of opes and its metabolites and the result showed that the edis of bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate bdcipp and diphenyl phosphate dphp were higher than their respectively opes he et al 2018a 2018b more critically some studies suggested that the toxicity of certain di opes may be higher than their corresponding parent tri opes for example bcipp bdcipp and dphp have higher estrogen disrupting and mineralocorticoid disrupting potential than their corresponding parent tri opes li et al 2020a su et al 2014 therefore metabolites of opes should be simultaneously investigated to understand the potential risks of opes through dietary exposures 6 gaps and limitations huang et al identified more than 56 opes that had been produced by 367 factories around the world huang et al 2022 however no more than 20 ope individuals were investigated in aquatic products so far which suggested a large knowledge gap between the comprehensive understanding of opes in environment and aquatic products and more investigation including all opes were needed moreover data on the occurrence of opes in aquatic products mainly focused on china sweden belgium and australia and the usa global and long term monitoring of opes in aquatic products are limited within the present data opes in aquatic products from asia were generally higher than those from europe and north america one of the reason maybe the shift of the flame retardants production market from europe and north america to asia moreover e waste dismantling is an important emission source of flame retardants including opes wei et al 2015 the transportation of e waste from europe and north america to south east asia and west africa might also contribute to the global transfer of opes lundgren 2012 therefore research on opes in aquatic products from southeast asian countries and west african countries is likely to become a research hotspots inconsistent bioaccumulation and trophic transfer behavior of opes were found in different aquatic ecosystems bekele et al 2019 bekele et al 2021 fu et al 2020 greaves et al 2016a liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018 physicochemical properties of opes e g solubility k ow organic carbon water partition coefficient and ph dependent hydrolysis biological characteristics of aquatic organisms e g lipid content biotransformation potential growth stages and feeding habits and environmental factors e g ph salinity and temperature as well as anthropogenic point source may influence the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in aquatic organisms at present only a few studies have explored the impact of a small number of factors on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in aquatic products such as k ow and biotransformation 7 conclusion and perspectives the present review summarized the occurrence bioaccumulation trophic transfer and potential exposure risks of opes in global aquatic products among the studied opes chlorinated opes generally showed accumulation predominance in global aquatic products and strongest similarity with pops in terms of environmental behavior such as persistency toxicity long range transport and biomagnification in aquatic food chain therefore future research should pay more attention to the potential ecological and health risks of chlorinated opes monte carlo simulations suggested that the edis of opes through aquatic products intake for residents were much lower than their respectively rfds indicating the low exposure risks of opes for residents through aquatic products intake at present however children and adolescents as sensitive population and fishermen as special occupation group may face higher health risks than those of general adults specially the time series analysis forecasted continuously increasing edis of opes for residents in asia through aquatic products intake suggesting an augmenting exposure risks of opes based on the current research we recommend some future directions as following long term systematic global monitoring of opes contamination in aquatic products is needed urgently thus to understand the spatiotemporal trend of opes contamination to comprehend the chronical variation of population exposure risk of opes and to promote scientific surveillance and control of opes 1 previous studies showed that varies cooking process could significantly affect the levels composition and distribution of pops in food bendig et al 2013 gao et al 2020 current studies on exposure risks of opes through the aquatic products mostly focused on the concentration of opes in the raw material but ignored the transfer and transformation of opes during cooking processes which could introduce a large degree of uncertainty in assessing dietary exposure of opes on both intake and pattern in order to accurately assess human exposure risks of opes the transfer and transformation of opes during cooking of aquatic products should be considered 2 metabolites of opes such as di opes and hydroxylated metabolites of opes have recently been detected in different environmental media fu et al 2023 and some di opes are even more toxic than their corresponding parent opes liu et al 2021a therefore the potential risk of opes through aquatic products intake in previous studies may be underestimated for human beings some novel opes such as 2 isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate ipdp have recently been detected in environmental and fish samples li et al 2022 therefore comprehensive study on novel opes and ope metabolites in aquatic products is need to be urgently conducted currently studies on opes in environmental and biota are mostly based on target analysis target analysis can only analyze limited number of known opes but not novel opes or their metabolites due to the absence of commercial standards therefore future studies should pay more attention to the occurrence profiles and dietary exposure of opes through suspect analysis and or non targeted analysis 3 the toxicity data of both legacy and novel opes are scarce there is an urgent need for computational methods such as quantitative structure activity relationships qsar polishchuk 2017 read across sedykh et al 2020 molecular simulations enyoh et al 2022 virtual screening shoichet 2004 and adverse outcome pathways aop yang et al 2022 which can elucidate toxicity mechanisms predict chemical toxicity and thus provide essential data support for risk evaluations of novel opes declaration of

14709,organophosphate esters opes as an important class of new pollutants have been pervasively detected in global aquatic products arousing widespread public concern due to their potential bioaccumulative behavior and consequent risks with the continuous improvement of living standards of citizens there have been constant increment of the proportion of aquatic products in diets of people the levels of opes exposed to residents may also be rising due to the augmented consumption of aquatic products posing potential hazards on human health especially for people in coastal areas the present study integrated the concentrations profiles bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in global aquatic products including mollusca crustacea and fish evaluated health risks of opes through aquatic products in daily diets by mont carol simulation mcs and found asia has been the most polluted area in terms of the concentration of opes in aquatic products and would have been increasingly polluted among all studied opes chlorinated opes generally showed accumulation predominance it is worth noting that some opes were found bioaccumulated and or biomagnified in aquatic ecosystems though mcs revealed relative low exposure risks of residents sensitive and special groups such as children adolescents and fishermen may face more serious health risks than the average residents finally knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are discussed encouraging more long term and systematic global monitoring comprehensive studies of novel opes and opes metabolites and more toxicological studies to completely evaluate the potential risks of opes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organophosphate esters aquatic products bioaccumulation trophic transfer exposure risks monte carlo simulations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes are a group of synthetic phosphate derivatives including chlorinated opes alkyl opes and aryl opes table s1 greaves and letcher 2017 opes have been extensively used as flame retardants plasticizers and antifoaming agents in a broad spectrum of products including electronics construction materials furniture textiles plastics and food packaging hou et al 2016 the regulation of traditional brominated flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and hexabromocyclododecane hbcd in the stockholm convention blum et al 2019 has spired the global production and consumption of opes as their alternatives the global consumption of opes increased from 186 000 tonnes in 2001 to 1 million tonnes in 2018 fu et al 2023 zhu et al 2020 china has been one of major producers of organophosphorus flame retardants as its production increased from 141 500 tonnes in 2014 to 294 200 tonnes in 2020 zhang et al 2021 since they can be easily released to the surrounding environment through volatilization abrasion and or dissolution wang et al 2014 opes have been widely detected in a variety of environmental compartments such as waters lai et al 2019 lee et al 2016 atmosphere lee et al 2019 wang et al 2018b sediments bacaloni et al 2007 soil cui et al 2017 and organisms zhang et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the concentrations of opes are already higher than those of traditional brominated flame retardants in many environmental compartments wang et al 2020 nowadays opes as new pollutants are causing widespread public concern exposed to some opes such as tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep tris 2 chloroisopropyl phosphate tcipp triphenyl phosphate tphp tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcipp tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tcep and tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp may result in adverse outcomes in fish daphnia birds and rodents such as growth inhibition hou et al 2016 tissue lesions du et al 2015 developmental and reproductive toxicity yuan et al 2018 and neurotoxicity van der veen and de boer 2012 opes also have the potential to cause illness among human beings such as lipidome homeostasis disorders zhao et al 2016 endocrine disruption liu et al 2012 and reproductive failure gao et al 2022 considering the increasing use of opes their potential ecological and human health risks have been of great concern to governments and the public saillenfait et al 2018 the prohibition to the use of chlorinated opes such as tcep tdcipp and tcipp in merchandise had been pronounced by the us canada and the eu van der veen and de boer 2012 whereas china had put tcep and ippp into the list of primarily controlled chemicals in 2020 china mee 2020 opes could enter water bodies by multiple pathways including industrial and domestic wastewater discharges and atmospheric dry and or wet deposition hu et al 2014 opes in water environment could be bioaccumulated in various aquatic organisms xie et al 2022b opes at real environmental concentrations could result in various adverse effects on aquatic organisms for example fecundity reduction zhu et al 2015 endocrine disruption wang et al 2013 and developmental toxicity han et al 2014 in zebrafish danio rerio and neurotoxicity in chinese minnow gobiocypris rarus yuan et al 2016 in addition tdcipp has been demonstrated lethal to embryo of crucian carp carassius carassius in taihu lake li et al 2021 opes in aquatic organisms can also be transferred along trophic levels thus posing threats to the entire aquatic ecosystem and even extending to human liu et al 2021b attention should be paid to the opes exposure for human through aquatic products intake the global annual growth rate of edible fishes had been at 3 10 on average from 1961 to 2017 which was higher than that of any other animal derived protein foods 2 10 fao 2020 the per capita consumption of edible fishes per year grew from 9 00 kg fresh weight in 1961 to 20 50 kg in 2018 with an annual growth rate of 1 50 fao 2020 dietary intake is one of the most important pathways for human exposure to many legacy and novel persistent organic pollutants pops opes in aquatic organisms can reach up to μg g wet weight ww van der veen and de boer 2012 and aquatic products intake may be a significant pathway of human exposure to opes potentially posing health risks to people especially those from coastal areas li et al 2019a in the present study we reviewed available data on the occurrence distribution bioaccumulation and trophic transfer behavior and exposure risks of opes in aquatic products including molluscs crustaceans and fishes from peer reviewed papers and provided an outlook on the current issues and research trends in this field we aimed to provide data support and scientific basis for opes management strategies and aquatic products safety assurance 2 materials and methods 2 1 data selection and statistical strategy to retrieve the concentration of opes in aquatic products including fishes shellfishes crustaceans and seaweeds fao 2020 studies from the year 2000 to the end of 2022 on pubmed scopus science direct web of science and google scholar were investigated the keywords including organophosphate esters opes dietary aquatic products seafood and aquatic ecosystem were searched combined or alone besides the endnote software version x8 was employed to filter and review all extracted data and then to remove repetitive and irrelevant articles mean concentrations of total opes opes and the levels of ope individuals were integrated and discussed in the present review the detail data was shown in supplementary materials table s2 mean concentration of opes and each ope individual were mostly reported in studies for few studies without reporting mean level of opes we calculated the mean opes and each ope individual from the data in their papers in order to maintain the authenticity of data some rules were set as following 1 opes concentrations were set as zero when these individuals were not analyzed or not detected in the cited references 2 opes concentrations were set as half of the limits of quantification loq if below the loq the different units of concentration of opes across different studies such as ng g dry weight dw and ng g lipid weight lw were all converted to ng g ww based on the water and lipid contents of the studied species reported in the cited references some standard lipid and water content were cited from the usda fooddata central database as alternative when the water and lipid content of the samples were not available in the study https fdc nal usda gov 2 2 monte carlo simulations monte carlo simulations mcs were employed to estimate the daily dose of intake edi of opes through aquatic foods 100 000 simulations were conducted python 3 9 0 for each ope individual and the population of each continent asia north america europa and oceania for each simulation n types of sea foods were selected from the candidate list of aquatic products which had been tested for the abundance of the given type of ope whereas n followed a poisson distribution p o s s i o n n λ 4 the average daily amount of aquatic food a person taken q continent were randomly partitioned in to portions such that 1 q continent i 1 n q i where i labels the selected aquatic product q continent were provided by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao q north america 61 37 g q aisa 66 03 g q europe 59 18 g q oceania 66 30 g fao 2020 for each type of aquatic product the concentration of each ope in food taken by a person c ope i was assumed followed by a normal distribution n o r m a l μ ope i δ ope i 2 where μ ope i is usually the mean of concentration of the sampled aquatic products and the corresponding δ ope i was their standard deviation unless if the concentrations of ope individual was only marked as detected the μ ope i would be half of method limited of quantitation and the corresponding δ ope i was 1 3 of method limit of detection as if the ope individual was not detected the μ ope i would be 1 3 of method limit of detection whereas δ ope i was at its 1 2 the μ ope i and δ ope i were shown in table s3 edis were calculated as 2 ed i ope i 1 n q i c ope i bw where bw is the body weight assumed as a constant 60 kg 3 occurrence of opes in aquatic products 3 1 molluscs the typical edible molluscs include abalone mussels oysters clams scallops squid etc imbs et al 2021 which are an important source of animal derived protein for humans in 2018 global caught molluscs reached nearly 6 million tonnes and farmed molluscs produced the 17 70 million tonnes fao 2020 to date available data on the occurrence of opes in molluscs are limited molluscs are usually at the relatively low trophic level in aquatic ecosystem available data of opes in molluscs mainly focused on asia europe and north america fig 1 the highest mean opes in freshwater molluscs was found in the freshwater mussel anodonta woodiana in meiliang bay taihu lake 36 02 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 which was higher than that of freshwater mussel that of pearl mussel unio douglasiae and that of bivalve corbicula fluminea from zhushan bay taihu lake 3 92 11 15 and 21 75 ng g ww respectively wang et al 2019a in china the highest mean opes in marine molluscs was found in oysters crassostrea gigas from weizhou island china 41 01 ng g ww ding et al 2020 which was comparable to that of freshwater mussels from meiliang bay taihu lake 36 02 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 the mean opes in blue mussels mytilus edulis from the coast of sweden 16 23 ng g ww sundkvist et al 2010 was comparable to that of mussels mytilus edulis and mytilus galloprovincialis 16 30 ng g ww from northern coast of spain castro et al 2020b but was much higher than that of cockle cerastoderma edule 3 95 ng g ww from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 and that of mussel mytilus edulis and oyster crassostrea gigas 3 87 ng g ww from the korean coast choi et al 2020 and that of bivalve mytilus californianus 0 80 ng g ww from san francisco bay usa sutton et al 2019 the mean opes in mussel from supermarkets in antwerp belgium 3 72 ng g ww xu et al 2015 was lower than that of scallop and oyster from belgian markets 7 83 ng g ww poma et al 2018 but higher than that of oyster from markets in queensland australia 1 50 ng g ww he et al 2018b overall the average concentration of opes in molluscs from asia 3 87 41 01 ng g ww choi et al 2020 ding et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018 was generally higher than that of mollusc in europe and north america 0 80 16 23 ng g ww brandsma et al 2015 castro et al 2020b poma et al 2018 sundkvist et al 2010 sutton et al 2019 xu et al 2015 this may be related to the transfer of the flame retardants market from europe and america to asia in recent years for example the growth rate of the consumption of flame retardants in china reached up to 13 which was significantly higher than that of in the usa 2 0 and that of in europe 1 5 van der veen and de boer 2012 3 2 crustaceans crustaceans including crabs and shrimps etc imbs et al 2021 have been more and more merchandized and generalized in recent decades and now accounting for 30 of the total global fisheries catch behringer and duermit moreau 2021 however available data on opes in crustaceans is scarce fig 2 for freshwater crustaceans low level of opes were found in taihu lake shrimps macrobranchium nipponense 2 03 ng g ww and white shrimps exopalaemon modestus 3 74 ng g ww from zhushan bay of taihu lake wang et al 2019a in comparison slightly higher opes were measured in shrimps taihu lake shrimp and white shrimp from the meiliang bay of taihu lake 12 73 ng g ww zhao et al 2018 the elevated levels of opes were found in red claws crabs chiromantes haematocheir 20 84 ng g ww and greasyback shrimps metapenaeus ensi 28 08 ng g ww from qi ao island mangrove nature reserve of southern china xie et al 2022a which may be attributed to the large discharge of domestic sewage the highest levels of opes was found in oriental river prawn macrobrachium nipponense 33 96 ng g ww from an enclosed e waste polluted pond in qingyuan southern china liu et al 2019a which were one order of magnitude higher than that in zhushan bay taihu lake 2 03 3 74 ng g ww wang et al 2019a electronic waste e waste dismantling is an important emission source of traditional bfrs and opes ge et al 2020 huang et al 2018 thus could substantially contribute to the high levels of opes in shrimps from qingyuan the highest levels of opes in marine crustaceans was found in wild green mud crab scylla paramamosain from weizhou island china 44 10 ng g ww ding et al 2020 where also observed the highest contamination of opes for marine molluscs this may indicate that a possible emission source of opes existed in weizhou island the relatively lower opes was found in green mud crab samples from mariculture farms of the beibu gulf china 12 02 ng g ww zhang et al 2020 which comparable to that of in shore crabs carcinus maenas collected from western scheldt estuary of netherlands 9 97 ng g ww brandsma et al 2015 the levels of opes in shrimp samples purchased from supermarkets in antwerp belgium xu et al 2015 and queensland australia he et al 2018b were 2 41 and 1 01 ng g ww respectively which were much lower than the levels of opes in crustaceans from asia 3 3 fishes opes and their derivative products have widely been detected in fishes whose dietary intake gill respiration and dermal contact could accumulate contaminants in the aquatic environments pantelaki and voutsa 2020 importantly fishes are one of the most important sources of high quality protein for humans accounting for 16 of the animal derived protein consuming by human beings tidwell and allan 2001 in the asia mean opes levels in fishes from china 5 17 47 52 ng g ww bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 he et al 2019 hou et al 2017 liu et al 2019b 2019a 2019c wang et al 2019a xie et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 were generally higher than those of other countries fig 3 such as philippines 4 35 ng g ww kim et al 2011 and korea 5 12 ng g ww choo et al 2018 the mean opes in freshwater fishes such as common carp cyprinus carpio crucian carp carassius auratus lake anchovy coilia ectenes etc from zhushan bay wang et al 2019a and meiliang bay zhao et al 2018 in taihu lake were 9 49 and 7 44 ng g ww respectively which were comparable to those in mud carp cirrhinus molitorella tilapia tilapia nilotica and plecostomus hypostomus plecostomus from rivers in the pearl river delta southern china 10 25 g g ww liu et al 2019b in comparison the relatively high opes were found in freshwater fish from rivers of beijing 23 37 ng g ww hou et al 2017 chongqing 47 52 ng g ww he et al 2019 and guangdong 19 21 ng g ww xie et al 2022a liu et al investigated opes in several freshwater fish snakehead ophiocephalus argus catfish clarias batrachus crucian carp mud carp cirrhinus molitorella from a pond near an electronic waste site in qingyuan china including snakehead ophiocephalus argus catfish clarias batrachus crucian carp mud carp cirrhinus molitorella and opes in snakehead and catfish 4 30 5 10 ng g ww were lower than those of crucian carp and mud carp 10 00 17 00 ng g ww liu et al 2019a possibly indicating species specific accumulation of opes the highest mean opes in marine fishes was presented in laizhou bay northern china 30 22 ng g ww bekele et al 2021a this may be related to the presence of opes production plants along the coast of laizhou bay zhong et al 2020 opes in marine fish from weizhou island of the south china sea was the second most abundant 12 71 ng g ww ding et al 2020 which was higher than that in marine fish from xiangshan bay of ningbo 5 17 ng g ww zhang et al 2022 similar to marine molluscs and crustaceans opes in marine fish from the weizhou island in the south china sea were also at high levels ding et al 2020 further suggesting that the potential local emission sources of opes in this region the moderate contamination level of opes was found in marine fishes from the market in nanjing with a mean of 9 45 ng g ww gao et al 2014 concentrations of opes in fish products also varied considerably in different regions of europe the mean opes in freshwater fishes from evrotas river adige river and sava river in three european basins were 5 19 4 42 and 2 23 ng g ww giulivo et al 2017 respectively which were slightly lower than in perch perca fluviatilis 9 95 ng g ww from lakes in sweden sundkvist et al 2010 elevated concentrations of opes were observed in fish from llobregat river spain 17 62 ng g ww santín et al 2016 and from the north american great lakes 19 58 ng g ww choi et al 2022 the dense population and developed industry around the great lakes of north american may be the reason for the high opes in the fish in the great lakes for marine fish the mean opes in eels anguilla from bizerte lagoon tunisia mekni et al 2020 in atlantic herring clupea harengus from baltic sea de wit et al 2020 in viviparous eelpout zoarces viviparus from the swedish coast sundkvist et al 2010 and in fish from western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 were 14 99 11 14 13 35 and 18 17 ng g ww respectively in comparison relatively lower of the mean opes were found in marine fish from barcelon 9 20 ng g ww garcia garin et al 2020 from a marine protected area the cap de creus mpa 7 40 ng g ww garcia garin et al 2020 from svalbard norway 8 06 ng g ww hallanger et al 2015 and from the mediterranean sea 7 27 ng g ww sala et al 2022 the mean opes in commercially available fish from spain castro et al 2020a belgium poma et al 2018 and sweden poma et al 2017 were 6 63 3 14 and 4 95 ng g ww respectively which were comparable to the mean opes in commercially available fish from new york the usa 2 51 ng g ww wang and kannan 2018 but higher than that in fish products purchased from the market of queensland in australia 0 64 ng g ww he et al 2018b similar to the results of molluscs and crustaceans the mean levels of opes in fish products were higher in asia 5 12 47 52 ng g ww than in europe north america and australia 0 64 18 17 ng g ww further suggesting that the increased use of opes in this region had a significant impact on the occurrence of opes in the local environment and ecosystem worthwhile noticing opes were also detected in fish notothenia coriiceps 0 31 ng g ww from king george island in antarctica fu et al 2020 and stickleback pungitiu spungitius 5 56 ng g ww from alaska in the arctic zheng et al 2020 indicating that opes have enough longer persistence in environment and might be transported from source region to remote polar regions through long range transport 3 4 characteristics of ope individual composition compositional characteristics of opes in aquatic products were discussed according to the different side chain substituents as following chlorinated opes alkyl opes and aryl opes the predominance of chlorinated opes was observed in aquatic products with the average relative abundance ranging from 20 to 73 fig 4 in vitro studies have shown that the biotransformation of opes is structure specific resulting in the slowest biotransformation rate of chlorinated opes among the 3 main types of opes greaves et al 2016b additionally the predominance of chlorinated opes in aquatic products may be related to the relatively highest abundance of chlorinated opes in their living environment water or sediment among the 3 main types vasseghian et al 2022 xie et al 2022b fu et al 2023 two chlorinated opes tcep and tcipp were predominant among all chlorinated opes in aquatic products at most of time with average relative abundance of 11 and 26 respectively the relatively low log k ow of tcep and tcipp 3 make them difficult to adsorb on activated sludge particles therefore the removing efficient of tcep and tcipp in wwtps are low resulting in their extensive existence in natural waters meyer and bester 2004 moreover the half lives of tcep 2904 h and tcipp 5100 h in water were obviously higher than those of other non chlorinated opes 906 h zhang et al 2016 the more abundance of tcep and tcipp in water environment and their longer persistence compared to those other opes resulting in their exposure to aquatic organisms in longer time and large quantities additionally tcep and tcipp showed greater resistant to biodegradation than non chlorinated opes zhang et al 2016 therefore the predominance of tcep and tcipp in aquatic products may be related to their physicochemical properties in certain cases of aquatic products tboep tnbp tehp and tphp were predominant specifically tehp was the most abundant ope individual in those fish from adige river of italy giulivo et al 2017 manila bay of philippines kim et al 2011 rivers in the pearl river delta of china liu et al 2019b and llobregat river of spain santín et al 2016 with the relative abundance of 22 22 44 and 35 respectively high abundance of tphp was found in mussels from belgium poma et al 2018 and spain castro et al 2020b accounting for 80 and 79 of σopes respectively in addition the mean relative abundance of tphp in fish from a pond in qingyuan of china liu et al 2019c and that of the fish in a mangrove nature reserve in southern china xie et al 2022a were also exceeded 40 tboep was the predominant ope in aquatic products crabs oysters fish collected from the weizhou island china ding et al 2020 in fish from rivers of spain castro et al 2020b in aquatic products bivalves crabs fish from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands brandsma et al 2015 and in capelin from the svalbard norway hallanger et al 2015 with the relative contributions higher than 20 high abundance of tnbp was also found in stickleback from alaska in the arctic zheng et al 2020 crucian carp from beijing hou et al 2017 and chongqing he et al 2019 accounting for 55 57 and 30 of σopes respectively the mean relative abundances of tnbp more than 30 were found for crucian carp mud carp and catfish from a pond polluted by e waste dismantling in qingyuan south china liu et al 2019a the relative high abundance of tehp among opes in some aquatic products may be related to its relative high bioaccumulation potential because the log k ow of tehp 9 49 table s1 is greater than 5 differently tphp tnbp and tboep had relatively low predicted log k ow values 4 49 4 00 and 3 75 respectively which suggest their relative low bioaccumulation potential the relatively high abundance of tphp tnbp and tboep in some aquatic products may be attributed to their relative high contamination level in water environment for example the relatively high abundance of tboep were found in the seawater from weizhou island of south china sea 29 ding et al 2020 and found in the sediments from the western scheldt estuary of netherlands 36 brandsma et al 2015 the relative high abundance of tnbp was found in the river water from chongqing 29 he et al 2019 and the relative high abundance of tphp was found in the sediments of mangrove nature reserve from the pearl river estuary of south china 47 xie et al 2022a in addition the relatively higher abundance of tnbp were found in small mud carp 69 and small catfish 63 from a pond in qingyuan of china than those in large mud carp 47 and large catfish 47 liu et al 2019a which may indicate an age specific bioaccumulation and metabolism 4 bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes 4 1 bioaccumulation of opes sediment act as not only a reservoir of organic pollutants but also act as an important potential source of organic pollutants in molluscs crustaceans and benthic fish wang et al 2018a biota sediment accumulation factors bsafs calculated by the ratio of the lipid normalized concentration of organic contaminants in organisms to that of the organic carbon normalized concentration in sediments and have been widely used to evaluate the bioavailability of organic contaminants in sediment wong et al 2001 the bsafs of opes in aquatic products were summarized in table s3 the bsaf values of opes in aquatic products from zhushan bay of taihu lake in china were all lower than 1 of which the bsafs of opes in invertebrates ranged from 6 90 10 4 0 32 which were slightly higher than those in benthic fish 2 1 10 4 0 19 wang et al 2019a bsafs of opes in fish from laizhou bay of china ranged from 0 03 to 0 10 bekele et al 2019 in addition the bsafs of opes detected in fish from coastal areas of korea choi et al 2020 and from sava river adige river and evrotas river in europe giulivo et al 2017 were also lower than 1 these results showed the relatively low bioavailability of opes in sediments however xie et al found that the mean bsafs of all six ope individuals in aquatic products from the mangrove nature reserve were higher than 1 and the log bsafs of opes had a significantly negative correlation with log k ow xie et al 2022a inconsistently the log bsaf of opes in benthic invertebrates from zhushan bay in taihu lake increased along with the increasing of log k ow 1 44 5 73 whereas the log bsaf of opes were decreased along with the increasing of log k ow 5 73 wang et al 2019a the trend of increasing first and then decreasing for the log bsaf values of opes mediated by their log k ow were also found in fish from the laizhou bay bekele et al 2019 and xiangshan bay of china zhang et al 2022 the peak level of bsafs were presented when the log k ow are 4 59 and 5 73 respectively different association trends were found between the log bsafs and the log k ow of opes in different studies indicating that the bioavailability of opes is influenced not only by log k ow but also by other factors such as temperature and the continuous presence of local point source of opes though data on the relations between temperature and bsafs are still not available it can still be assured that temperature plays an important role on the distribution of pollutants in aquatic environment for example a rise of temperature would increase the bsafs of methylmercury for amphipod curtis et al 2019 the snakeheads and prawns from a pond close to e waste dismantling area in qingyuan china liu et al 2019a and the loachs and crucian carps from rivers of beijing china hou et al 2017 were all found having their bsafs higher than 1 which may be attributed to the continuous input of local point source pollution into opes bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in organisms and their trophic transfer behavior in ecosystems are important factors for assessing their potential ecological risk van der veen and de boer 2012 bioaccumulation factors bafs and bioconcentration factors bcfs calculated by the ratio of the wet weight concentration of pollutants in organisms to that of the concentration of pollutants in water as a method which have been widely used to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of certain pollutants van der veen and de boer 2012 the bafs of opes in aquatic products were also summarized in table s3 the log bcfs of 15 opes ranged from 0 036 to 3 027 table s1 which was lower than the lower threshold defined by the stockholm convention log bcf 3 70 greaves et al 2016a indicating their limited bioaccumulation potential the log bafs values of tdcipp tcep and tcipp in the aquatic ecosystem of laizhou bay china were 2 70 2 50 and 2 30 respectively bekele et al 2019 similarly the log bafs of tdcipp tcep and tcipp in the aquatic ecosystem of zhushan bay of taihu lake china were 1 26 0 72 and 0 46 respectively wang et al 2019a however wang et al reported the relative high log baf of tehp in benthic invertebrates 4 70 and benthic fish 4 40 from the aquatic ecosystem of zhushan bay of taihu lake china wang et al 2019a bekele et al investigated the bioaccumulation potential of opes in a marine food web form the laizhou bay china where the log baf value of tehp in organisms was up to 4 64 bekele et al 2019 xie et al investigated the bioaccumulation behavior of opes in aquatic products a mangrove nature reserve from the pearl river estuary of china and found that the average log bafww of tehp among different species was 3 82 xie et al 2022a the log bafww 3 82 4 70 of tehp in these studies was higher than the lower threshold defined by the stockholm convention for pops log baf 3 70 indicating the relative high bioaccumulation potential of tehp some studies have shown that the log baf of opes is significantly and positively correlated with their corresponding log k ow bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019a the log k ow of tehp 9 49 table s1 was higher than others opes such as tcep 1 70 tdcipp 3 65 and tcipp 2 68 which may be the cause of the relatively higher log baf of tehp than other opes however some studies showed that inverted parabolic correlation or even no correlation were found between the log baf values of opes and their corresponding log k ow which may be indicate that log k ow can have an effect on the log baf of opes within a certain range of log k ow or the log k ow of opes was not the only one factor affecting their log baf li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 wang et al compared the log bafww of opes in benthic invertebrates and fish and found that the log bafww of tphp ehdpp and tehp were higher in benthic invertebrates 2 71 4 70 than in fish 2 54 4 40 wang et al 2019a ding et al showed that the average log bafdw of opes in different marine products in the tropical south china sea was in the sequence of oysters 3 78 crab 3 65 fish 3 06 ding et al 2020 similarly the log bafww of opes in shrimp from a pond of qingyuan china 2 58 was also greater than that of fish 2 40 liu et al 2019a it was reported that p450 enzymes in organisms play an important role in the degradation and metabolism of exogenous pollutants the activity of p450 enzymes in aquatic organisms was reported to be higher in fish than invertebrates thus resulting in the relatively faster biotransformation of opes in fish livingstone 1998 therefore the speed of metabolism of opes in different organisms may an important factor affecting the residual of opes in organisms in addition the habitat of different aquatic products anthropogenic sources and other factors may also affect the bioaccumulation of opes to different degrees 4 2 trophic transfer of opes biomagnification factors bmfs and trophic magnification factors tmfs are commonly used to assess the transfer of contaminants between predators and preys or in food chains webs borgå et al 2012 data on biomagnification trophic level magnification of opes in aquatic food chains webs are scarce and limited studies generally focused on lake and marine aquatic food webs table s4 biomagnification of opes including tphp cdpp and tcrp tep tnbp tboep tehp tcep tcipp and tdcipp has been identified in marine food chains webs with tmfs ranging from 1 06 to 5 20 bekele et al 2021 fu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 kim et al found a significant positive correlation between tphp concentration and trophic level in benthic fish from the manila bay philippines indicating the trophic magnification potential of tphp kim et al 2011 wang et al found that ehdpp had trophic magnification behavior in the aquatic food chain of zhushan bay taihu lake china with a tmf of 3 61 wang et al 2019a however zhao et al found that opes had trophic dilution behavior in the aquatic food chain from meiliang bay of taihu lake china with tmfs of 0 55 0 39 and 0 42 respectively for tcipp tdcipp and tcrp zhao et al 2018 liu et al also found trophic dilution for tnbp and tphp in the aquatic food chain from a pond close to an e waste dismantling plant from qingyuan china with tmfs of 0 57 and 0 62 respectively liu et al 2019a brandsma et al studied the trophic transfer behavior of opes in a food web of the western scheldt river in the netherlands and found that tboep tcipp and tcep had trophic magnification behavior in the benthic food chain but not in the pelagic food chain brandsma et al 2015 therefore the trophic transfer behavior of opes in aquatic food chains may be related to the structure of food chains and the habitats of organisms notably the average p450 enzyme content in fish 322 pmol mg is higher than that in mollusc 73 pmol mg livingstone 1998 probably resulting in more and quicker metabolisms of opes in fish than that in mollusc which may be the reason of the trophic dilution of opes in some pelagic food chain evidently there have been report in our previous study which showed that tcep and tcipp presented trophic magnification in the antarctic marine food chain from archeogastropoda nacella concinna agas neogastropoda trophon geversianus ngas fish notothenia coriiceps to cape petrel daption capense fu et al 2020 it was also reported that opes in birds could be rapidly metabolized by p450 enzymes while the metabolic rate of opes in cape petrels feathers collected in our previous study may be greatly reduced due to the absence of enzymes in feathers thus resulting in the biomagnification of opes in the whole food chain porter et al 2014 ding et al found that the tmfs of seven opes including tcep tcipp tdcipp tibp tnbp tphp and tboep were significantly and positively correlated with latitude i e the tmfs of tropical opes were lower than those of temperate and boreal opes ding et al 2020 since the metabolism of organic pollutants in organisms were operated by the catalytic action of a series of enzymes livingstone 1998 temperature was an important factor on the enzymatic metabolism therefore temperature could affect the metabolism of opes in the organism which in turn affected the trophic transfer behavior of opes 5 risk assessment of opes through aquatic product ingestion 5 1 point assessment of opes hitherto studies to the potential risk of opes in aquatic products were scarce and focused on a limited number of countries including china bekele et al 2021 ding et al 2020 xie et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 philippines kim et al 2011 belgium malarvannan et al 2015 poma et al 2018 sweden poma et al 2017 and the usa wang and kannan 2018 wang et al investigated opes in foodstuffs from albany new york united states and the median concentration of σ15opes in fish and mussels was 7 11 ng g ww which was comparable to meat 6 75 ng g ww but much higher than in dairy product 1 22 ng g ww cereal product 1 94 ng g ww and cooking oil 1 16 ng g ww wang and kannan 2018 σ9 opes in fish 1 80 ng g ww from the southeast queensland australia was higher than those in dairy products 1 40 ng g ww meat 1 00 ng g ww and eggs 1 00 ng g ww he et al 2018b chen et al reported the opes in animal derived foods in china and showed that the mean 14opes were decreased in the sequence of meat 16 3 ng g ww aquatic products 12 10 ng g ww eggs 11 30 ng g ww milk 6 47 ng g ww chen et al 2021 it can be seen that aquatic products intake is an important route for human exposure to opes considering the day by day increase in per capita intake of aquatic products the importance to integrate available data on aquatic products and comprehensively analyze the potential risks of opes through dietary intake is obvious the estimated daily intake edi ng kg bw day of contaminants was calculated by the daily intake of food multiplying the wet weight concentration of contaminants in food and was commonly used to assess the potential health risks of contaminants to human beings based on dietary intake wang et al 2019a the reference dose value rfd is a metric proposed by the epa for the risk evaluation of non carcinogens which is obtained by dividing the chronic no observed adverse effect level noael by the safety factor sf 1000 wang et al 2019a the rfd of ope individuals were shown in table 1 with the values ranging from 13 000 tmtp to 25 000 tep ng kg bw day li et al 2019a ope individuals were considered to be at potential risks when the edi of certain ope was higher than their corresponding rfd li et al 2018 bekele et al assessed edis of opes of rural and urban residents in northern china through marine fish based on the 95th percentile opes concentration edis of opes for urban residents 3 10 22 10 ng kg bw day through marine fish intake were approximately twice as high as those of rural residents 1 70 12 00 ng kg bw day bekele et al 2021 similarly the edis of opes through marine aquatic products crabs oysters and fish intake for urban residents 0 16 12 03 ng kg bw day in southern china based on the 95th percentile opes concentrations was higher than that for rural residents 0 09 6 50 ng kg bw day ding et al 2020 urban residents generally consumed more marine products than those of rural residents which might result in the relatively higher edis of opes found in urban residents with respect to those of rural residents ding et al further assessed the relative contribution of different seafoods oysters crabs and shrimps to the edis of opes based on the 90th percentile ope concentration of which oysters took up the highest contribution to the edis of opes 50 and followed by shrimps 25 and crabs 25 ding et al 2020 those results might suggest that the potential health risk of residents through molluscs intake was higher than those of crustaceans and those of fish the edis of opes of adolescents in southern china through seafood intake 0 14 8 18 ng kg bw day was comparable to those of children 0 10 6 33 ng kg bw day but higher than that of adults 0 08 3 51 ng kg bw day zhang et al 2020 similarly the edis of opes for young children 36 80 ng kg bw day through the consumption of aquatic products from the mangrove nature reserves in china was higher than those of children 23 70 ng kg bw day those of adolescents 23 10 ng kg bw day and those of adults 11 50 ng kg bw day xie et al 2022a therefore attention should be paid to the potential health risks for young children exposed to opes based on average concentration of opes in fish products the edis of opes in coastal residents of the philippines ranged from 0 07 to 2 00 ng kg bw day kim et al 2011 the edi of opes in general population 0 01 0 10 ng kg bw day was much lower than that of fishermen 0 25 2 50 ng kg bw day by evaluating the mean concentration of opes in eel from the flanders belgium malarvannan et al 2015 for mediterranean residents the edis of opes through seafood intake ranged from nd to 12 60 ng kg bw day based on the 95th percentile ope concentration sala et al 2022 for residents of sweden the edis of opes through the consumption of fish products ranged from 3 00 to 112 00 ng kg bw day based on the average ope concentration poma et al 2017 currently the edis of opes for residents through aquatic products intake were several orders of magnitude lower than their corresponding rfds indicating the low health risk of opes through aquatic products intake 5 2 monte carlo simulation currently dietary exposure assessment of opes in aquatic products generally based on point evaluation model such as the edi model li et al 2019b point evaluation model assumes that the concentration of chemicals in foods is constant and the residents dietary consumption is equivalent while the residents dietary exposure to opes may be discontinuous and day by day variable peng et al 2016 therefore in the present study a nonparametric probabilistic evaluation model based on monte carlo simulation mcs was performed in dietary exposures risks of opes in aquatic products which provides not only quantitative results but also their variability and uncertainty thompson and graham 1996 the concentration of opes in aquatic products from asia europe oceania and north america were systematic collected 100 000 times of mcs were simulated to evaluate the edis of opes of residents through aquatic products intake fig 5 mcs covers all possible scenarios that may not be experienced in field sampling activities wu et al 2011 therefore simulations in mcs were performed to the obtain the edis of 50th 90th and 99th percentile of dietary opes exposed population and thereby to assess the risk of ope exposure through aquatic product consumption in the general population in highly exposed populations and extremely highly exposed populations respectively table 1 based on the 50th percentile edis in aquatic products the medium edi of total opes for residents of north america 12 07 ng kg bw day through aquatic products intake was higher than that in asia 8 92 ng kg bw day in europe 5 07 ng kg bw day ng kg bw day and in oceania 1 21 ng kg bw day the 90th percentile edi of opes via aquatic products consumed by residents of north america 29 30 ng kg bw day was also higher than that of asia 19 15 ng kg bw day and europe 19 04 ng kg bw day in the 50th percentile ope exposure scenario the profiles of total opes and those of individual opes suggested that tcep and tcipp would have contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products for asian and oceanian residents whereas tcrp would have contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products for residents of north america the lower relative proportion of chlorinated opes than those of the other opes such as ehdpp tboep and tehp in edis of total opes through aquatic products intake of european populations which could be attribute to the restriction on chlorinated opes in europe van der veen and de boer 2012 the edis of total opes for residents of oceania through aquatic products intake was the least 1 21 ng kg bw day among north america asia europe and oceanian residents in the 50th percentile ope exposure scenario whereas in the 90th percentile ope exposure scenario the edis of total opes for residents of oceania through aquatic products intake was the highest 59 74 ng kg bw day among the above four continental populations in fact only one study investigated opes in aquatic products in oceania he et al 2018b tcipp was detected in all samples whereas other opes including tcep tdcipp tboep tphp tehp tcrp and ehdpp were detected in less than 30 of samples for asian populations in addition to tcipp tnbp also greatly contributed 4 35 ng kg bw day to the edis of total opes through the consumption of aquatic products based on the 90th percentile edi of ope which was different with the profile at 50th percentile edi of the populations this suggested that available data on ope in asian aquatic products had relatively high concentrations of tnbp similarly the mcs study on opes in drinking water intaking by chinese residents found a relative high contribution of tcipp and tnbp to edis of total opes vasseghian et al 2022 tnbp was not only used as flame retardant but also used as hydraulic oil and lubricant additive so the dominance of tnbp in total opes in asia may be related to its thriving transportation and prosperous logistics industry van der veen and de boer 2012 it is noteworthy that despite the differences in local ope use history and dietary habits of the population chlorinated opes tcep tcipp tdcipp contributed the most to the edis of total opes through the aquatic products intake for residents among all populations on the four continents based on the profile of 99th percentile edi of opes although the restrict regulation on chlorinated opes have been introduced the potential ecological and human health risks of chlorinated opes need to be given high priority due to the predominance of chlorinated opes in aquatic products the mcs results based on the 99th percentile ope concentration in aquatic products showed that edis of opes for residents of four continents through the aquatic products intake were far below the rfds established by usepa table 1 therefore the potential health risks due to the consumption of aquatic products for global residents are relative low at present to date only a few of opes had reported rfds and insufficiency study on toxic mechanisms and endpoints of opes which limited the comprehensive understanding on health risks of opes to human being blum et al 2019 additionally with the increasing use of opes in the worldwide the contamination of opes in global aquatic products may further increase in the future thereby rising health risks based on the existing data on opes in aquatic products in asia 2013 2018 we simulated and predicted the temporal trend of opes exposure through aquatic products intake by residents in the region 2019 2029 fig s1 its results showed that the edis of opes through aquatic products intake by population in asia would increase continuously which may induce the increasing exposure risks of opes in addition to aquatic products intake other dietary exposure in combination with inhalation and dermal exposure the edis of opes in residents would close to their corresponding rfds thus posing the health risks to human being poma et al 2018 it is noteworthy that exposure risk assessment based solely on opes and neglecting their transformation products may underestimate the potential health risks of opes through dietary exposure opes could be metabolize to organophosphate diesters di opes hydroxylated di opes hydroxylated tri opes and hydroxylated glucuronide conjugate metabolites in organisms su et al 2015 some metabolites of opes have been detected in indoor dust tan et al 2019 waste water and sludge wang et al 2019b river water fu et al 2017 and even in human blood and urine e wang et al 2014 recently our pervious study simultaneously investigated tri opes and di opes in global fishmeal samples and found that the mean concentration of 8 di opes 49 60 ng g dw was comparable to that of 16 tri opes 59 30 ng g dw li et al 2020b to date only one study simultaneously assessed the dietary exposures of opes and its metabolites and the result showed that the edis of bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate bdcipp and diphenyl phosphate dphp were higher than their respectively opes he et al 2018a 2018b more critically some studies suggested that the toxicity of certain di opes may be higher than their corresponding parent tri opes for example bcipp bdcipp and dphp have higher estrogen disrupting and mineralocorticoid disrupting potential than their corresponding parent tri opes li et al 2020a su et al 2014 therefore metabolites of opes should be simultaneously investigated to understand the potential risks of opes through dietary exposures 6 gaps and limitations huang et al identified more than 56 opes that had been produced by 367 factories around the world huang et al 2022 however no more than 20 ope individuals were investigated in aquatic products so far which suggested a large knowledge gap between the comprehensive understanding of opes in environment and aquatic products and more investigation including all opes were needed moreover data on the occurrence of opes in aquatic products mainly focused on china sweden belgium and australia and the usa global and long term monitoring of opes in aquatic products are limited within the present data opes in aquatic products from asia were generally higher than those from europe and north america one of the reason maybe the shift of the flame retardants production market from europe and north america to asia moreover e waste dismantling is an important emission source of flame retardants including opes wei et al 2015 the transportation of e waste from europe and north america to south east asia and west africa might also contribute to the global transfer of opes lundgren 2012 therefore research on opes in aquatic products from southeast asian countries and west african countries is likely to become a research hotspots inconsistent bioaccumulation and trophic transfer behavior of opes were found in different aquatic ecosystems bekele et al 2019 bekele et al 2021 fu et al 2020 greaves et al 2016a liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018 physicochemical properties of opes e g solubility k ow organic carbon water partition coefficient and ph dependent hydrolysis biological characteristics of aquatic organisms e g lipid content biotransformation potential growth stages and feeding habits and environmental factors e g ph salinity and temperature as well as anthropogenic point source may influence the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in aquatic organisms at present only a few studies have explored the impact of a small number of factors on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of opes in aquatic products such as k ow and biotransformation 7 conclusion and perspectives the present review summarized the occurrence bioaccumulation trophic transfer and potential exposure risks of opes in global aquatic products among the studied opes chlorinated opes generally showed accumulation predominance in global aquatic products and strongest similarity with pops in terms of environmental behavior such as persistency toxicity long range transport and biomagnification in aquatic food chain therefore future research should pay more attention to the potential ecological and health risks of chlorinated opes monte carlo simulations suggested that the edis of opes through aquatic products intake for residents were much lower than their respectively rfds indicating the low exposure risks of opes for residents through aquatic products intake at present however children and adolescents as sensitive population and fishermen as special occupation group may face higher health risks than those of general adults specially the time series analysis forecasted continuously increasing edis of opes for residents in asia through aquatic products intake suggesting an augmenting exposure risks of opes based on the current research we recommend some future directions as following long term systematic global monitoring of opes contamination in aquatic products is needed urgently thus to understand the spatiotemporal trend of opes contamination to comprehend the chronical variation of population exposure risk of opes and to promote scientific surveillance and control of opes 1 previous studies showed that varies cooking process could significantly affect the levels composition and distribution of pops in food bendig et al 2013 gao et al 2020 current studies on exposure risks of opes through the aquatic products mostly focused on the concentration of opes in the raw material but ignored the transfer and transformation of opes during cooking processes which could introduce a large degree of uncertainty in assessing dietary exposure of opes on both intake and pattern in order to accurately assess human exposure risks of opes the transfer and transformation of opes during cooking of aquatic products should be considered 2 metabolites of opes such as di opes and hydroxylated metabolites of opes have recently been detected in different environmental media fu et al 2023 and some di opes are even more toxic than their corresponding parent opes liu et al 2021a therefore the potential risk of opes through aquatic products intake in previous studies may be underestimated for human beings some novel opes such as 2 isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate ipdp have recently been detected in environmental and fish samples li et al 2022 therefore comprehensive study on novel opes and ope metabolites in aquatic products is need to be urgently conducted currently studies on opes in environmental and biota are mostly based on target analysis target analysis can only analyze limited number of known opes but not novel opes or their metabolites due to the absence of commercial standards therefore future studies should pay more attention to the occurrence profiles and dietary exposure of opes through suspect analysis and or non targeted analysis 3 the toxicity data of both legacy and novel opes are scarce there is an urgent need for computational methods such as quantitative structure activity relationships qsar polishchuk 2017 read across sedykh et al 2020 molecular simulations enyoh et al 2022 virtual screening shoichet 2004 and adverse outcome pathways aop yang et al 2022 which can elucidate toxicity mechanisms predict chemical toxicity and thus provide essential data support for risk evaluations of novel opes declaration of
