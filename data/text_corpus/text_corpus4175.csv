20875,a fully nonlinear two dimensional numerical method based on potential flow theory for water waves and their interaction with surface piercing rigid bodies is presented the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method is used to solve the laplace equation for the velocity potential and its time derivative the hpc method which is a high order method using analytical expressions harmonic polynomials to represent the solution inside overlapping cells has previously been shown accurate and efficient supplementary research has shown that in order to maximally benefit from the method s accuracy it is a requirement that square or close to square cells are used here we use an immersed boundary method to model non stationary boundaries such as the free surface or the surface of a rigid body and overlapping body fixed grids that are locally cartesian to refine the solution near moving bodies combining these two modelling concepts with the hpc method represents the main novel contribution in the present work with this combined method denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm the challenge of generating boundary fitted grids for complex boundaries is avoided moreover square cells can be used throughout the domain and the solution can be refined locally without increasing the number of unknowns unnecessarily the method is systematically validated and verified against analytical experimental and numerical reference results the cases studied include propagation of steep waves forced heave motions of a semi submerged circular cylinder and a fixed and freely floating ship section in beam sea waves for the freely floating ship section the present method is compared in detail with results from a dedicated study performed with a fully nonlinear boundary element method for cases with roll motions up to 30 the present results are generally in good agreement with reference results even for the most challenging wave body interaction cases considered based on this we later intend to use the method to examine in depth the importance of nonlinear effects in the interaction between waves and rigid bodies graphical abstract keywords nonlinear potential flow theory harmonic polynomial cell method numerical wave tank wave propagation wave body interaction 1 introduction for decades the oil and gas industry has relied on drilling and production ships and platforms in harsh locations nowadays coastal and offshore regions are populated by an increasing amount of fixed and floating structures wind turbines have been deployed in the water first supported by bottom fixed foundations and more recently as floating installations in deeper waters other innovative renewable energy concepts such as floating solar islands patterson et al 2019 are proposed in coastal regions and fish farms are moved away from fjords and into the ocean by moving marine structures to more remote locations they are exposed to more challenging wave conditions consider as an example offshore installations in the north sea these experience steep essentially wind generated sea states with significant wave heights larger than 15 m and thus tremendous loads and wave induced responses disregarding violent and partly local effects such as slamming the structures are traditionally dimensioned by combining loads and responses from linear analysis tools with correction factors from hydrodynamic model tests and safety factors provided in rules and regulations slowly varying wave loads are assumed to be of second order and either estimated from linear analysis using approximations de hauteclocque et al 2012 or from a full second order hydrodynamic analysis based on a perturbation approach using such efficient analysis tools is justified by the assumption that the structures global behaviour is at most weakly nonlinear however the general validity of such hypothesis has been challenged during recent years in some of the mooring line failures for floating structures in the north sea documented over the last decades kvitrud 2014a b noble denton europe 2006 exceedance of the mooring lines strength capacity is identified as the failure mechanism although unintentional response of dynamic positioning systems may have played a role it is suggested that the environmental loads in particular the wave drift loads could have been larger than the mooring systems were designed to withstand as a consequence of these observations fonseca et al 2016 fonseca and stansberg 2017b and fonseca et al 2017 documented through systematic model tests that wave drift loads may be significantly under predicted by state of the art computational design tools in severe sea states the largest differences are observed for semi submersibles and are mainly due to viscous effects however non negligible differences may also be identified for ship shaped structures where viscous effects are of less importance compared to nonlinear inviscid effects as discussed by fonseca and stansberg 2017a the damping of slowly varying motions may also be influenced by nonlinear effects with the knowledge that linear tools may be insufficient for existing structures in harsh sea states together with the deployment of new complex structures in exposed locations analysis tools properly accounting for nonlinear effects are needed the aim of the present research is therefore 1 to develop an accurate and efficient numerical method to study nonlinear wave and wave body interaction problems and 2 to provide fundamental insight into global nonlinear effects beyond the capability of linear and weakly nonlinear methods only two dimensional 2d scenarios are considered however the methods are developed with future extension to three dimensions 3d in mind the water is assumed incompressible and irrotational and viscous effects are neglected hence potential flow theory can be used the present paper is concerned with 1 whereas 2 will be addressed in a separate study several authors have used fully nonlinear potential flow models mostly based on the boundary element method bem these include vinje and brevig 1981 and dommermuth et al 1988 who performed numerical analysis of steep overturning waves in finite water depth in 2d until the point where the overturning wave reattaches to the underlying surface beyond this point potential flow theory does not apply greco 2001 examined water on deck problems in 2d typically relevant for floating production units in large waves you 2012 studied wave loads on and motions of moored ships in finite water depth in both 2d and 3d in addition to incident wave problems fully nonlinear bems have been used to analyse water entry problems for instance sun 2007 investigated water entry of 2d bodies accounting for non viscous flow separation and hydroelastic effects other numerical methods in connection with nonlinear potential flow models include the finite element method fem such as used by wu and eatock taylor 1994 eatock taylor 1996 and yan and ma 2007 ma and yan 2009 and the finite difference method fdm such as used by bingham and zhang 2007 engsig karup et al 2009 and ducrozet et al 2010 a comprehensive overview of the early development of potential flow numerical wave tanks is presented by kim et al 1999 in the present work we use the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method proposed by shao and faltinsen 2012 2014b to solve the laplace equation for the velocity potential numerically using high order harmonic polynomials to represent the solution this method has the potential to solve a problem to a given numerical error more efficiently than alternative numerical methods moreover it gives a global system with a diagonally dominated coefficient matrix in a similar manner as the fdm that can be solved efficiently by iterative matrix solvers several authors have applied the method in 2d liang et al 2015 studied various problems in marine hydrodynamics including coupling with a local solution to deal with singular flows at sharp corners zhu et al 2017 developed a nonlinear nwt for wave propagation strand 2018 modelled the flow inside a closed flexible fish cage using linear theory wang et al 2020 used the hpc method with local grid refinement to study strongly nonlinear phenomena such as overturning waves and water entry of a wedge and applied an irregular cell technique to avoid the drawbacks of using distorted cells the method s accuracy was systematically investigated by ma et al 2018 bardazzi et al 2015 used a generalized hpc method to solve the poisson equation in a viscous flow navier stokes ns solver and further use in connection with viscous flows is currently investigated by the same research group fredriksen 2015 and hanssen et al 2019 coupled the hpc method with ns solvers using domain decomposition dd approaches siddiqui et al 2018 used a weak dd scheme to couple a nonlinear hpc based potential flow solver with the open source ns solver openfoam to investigate the flow inside a damaged ship compartment undergoing forced heave motions in still water in 3d the method has been used by shao and faltinsen 2014b a to investigate nonlinear wave propagation and nonlinear run up around upright bottom mounted cylinders and by liang et al 2020 to model sloshing inside an upright circular tank using an overset mesh technique immersed boundary methods ibm are traditionally not widely used in potential flow solvers however using an ibm in field methods has significant attractive features since it eliminates the need to fit grids to complex boundaries and update these as the boundaries move or deform with time this may both be time consuming and result in poor quality grids recently xu et al 2020 demonstrated an ibm to model the free surface in a 2d fdm with promising results in the hpc method using an ibm to model physical boundaries was first attempted by hanssen et al 2015 in 2d using an approach that required auxiliary interpolation schemes to be constructed utilizing that the hpc method provides analytical expressions for the velocity potential anywhere in the fluid and not only in discrete nodes the need for these auxiliary interpolation schemes was eliminated in the enhanced ibm by hanssen et al 2018 a similar ibm was used by robaux and benoit 2018 2020 to investigate waves propagating over a submerged body and waves interacting with a fixed surface piercing body and by shen et al 2020 to model steep and even overturning sloshing waves inside a 2d closed fish cage with local grid refinement tong et al 2021 used the ibm together with local grid refinement to model waves interacting with a surface piercing body that is fixed or has prescribed motion as an additional modelling concept hanssen et al 2018 introduced an overlapping body fixed cartesian grid to model the region close to a physical wavemaker in the present work we generalize this approach to include a surface piercing body modelled with an ibm in a body fixed cartesian grid in an extension of the work presented by hanssen et al 2017 the body may be fixed or undergo forced or freely floating motion in addition to combining the hpc method with immersed boundaries and overlapping grids in a novel way this is to our knowledge the first published study where the hpc method is used to couple the hydrodynamic problem with the equations of rigid body motion the rest of the paper is organized as follows first theoretical background related to body fixed reference frames and potential flow theory is given then the implementation of the numerical method is described finally comparisons against existing reference results for wave propagation and wave body interaction are presented before main conclusions are drawn 2 theoretical framework relevant background for body fixed reference frames and fundamental equations of potential flow theory in inertial and body fixed reference frames is outlined two dimensional 2d water waves and their interaction with a surface piercing fixed or floating structure are considered 2 1 coordinate systems a right handed inertial earth fixed coordinate o x z system is introduced where the z axis is positive in upward direction with origin in the mean water line the o x z system coincides with the x z plane of a right handed three dimensional 3d o x y z system thus angular motions and moments are referred to as rotation about the y axis body fixed coordinate systems o x b f z b f are introduced for moving bodies illustrated for a floating box shaped structure in fig 1 the body fixed coordinate system is complemented by a body related coordinate system o x z with origin coinciding with that of the o x b f z b f system but axes parallel with the o x z system the wave body interaction cases considered in the present paper are relevant for ships in beam sea waves and motions parallel to the x and z axes are hence denoted as sway and heave respectively rotations α about the y axis are denoted as roll with positive direction indicated in fig 1 a point p x p z p defined in the inertial o x z coordinate system can be expressed in the body fixed coordinate system by a two step coordinate transformation consisting of 1 a coordinate displacement where p is expressed in the body related coordinate system as p x p z p and 2 a coordinate rotation where the coordinates are projected onto the axes of the body fixed coordinate system the coordinate rotation uses a rotation matrix 1 λ α c o s α s i n α s i n α c o s α where α is defined in fig 1 and given in radians this gives the following relations p b f x p b f z p b f λ i b p and p λ b i p b f where λ i b λ α and λ b i λ α when rotating time derivatives of vector quantities between inertial and non inertial coordinate systems one must account for the time rate of change of the unit vectors in the latter e g 2 p λ b i p b f λ b i p b f the overdot here means time derivative relative to the coordinate system that the quantity is defined in i e p and p b f are the time derivatives of p and p b f in the inertial and body fixed coordinate systems respectively the reason for taking the time derivative of p in the inertial coordinate system is that the o x z coordinate system is only displaced and not rotated relative to the o x z coordinate system 2 2 kinematics for a generic vector s the following notation is used hereafter d s d t is the time derivative of s in the inertial reference frame s is the time derivative of s in the reference frame where it is defined a subscript b f explicitly means that the vector is projected along the axes of the o x b f z b f system we now consider the point p in fig 1 the position and velocity of p in the o x z coordinate system are given as 3 r r 0 r 4 d r d t d r 0 d t d r d t r 0 r ω r where ω is the angular velocity vector in 2d given as ω α j with j the unit vector in y direction noting that ω ω 0 in 2d the acceleration of p in the inertial reference frame is 5 d 2 r d t 2 r 0 ω r 0 r ω r 2 ω r ω ω r if p is a fixed point on the body surface the equations simplify to 6 d r d t r 0 ω r 7 d 2 r d t 2 r 0 ω r 0 ω r ω ω r 2 3 time derivative of scalars in addition to vectors also the time derivative of scalar quantities generally differ in inertial and body fixed reference frames faltinsen and timokha 2009 we define d b o q d t as the time derivative of a generic time dependent scalar q performed following the motion of a rigid body if the time derivative is taken in p defined in fig 1 and the location of this point is fixed in o x b f z b f 8 d b o q d t q t r 0 ω r q here q t is the eulerian time derivative of q i e the time derivative of q in a fixed point in the inertial coordinate system 2 4 the equations of motion the translational motions of a rigid body follow from newton s second law which in the inertial reference frame is defined as 9 m d 2 r 0 d t 2 f e x t here m is the body s mass f e x t is the external force vector which is the sum of all loads acting on the body including its weight and d 2 r 0 d t 2 is the acceleration of the centre of gravity in the inertial reference frame the equation may be rewritten in the body fixed reference frame 10 m r 0 b f ω r 0 b f f e x t b f where f e x t b f λ i b f e x t it should be noted that additional terms apply in eq 10 if written for another point than the centre of gravity since then r 0 the equation of rotational motion in the inertial reference frame is 11 i ω ω i ω m e x t with i the rotational inertia matrix and m e x t the total external moment vector the term ω i ω is challenging in 3d because it implies that the body has a time varying inertia shao 2010 avoided this challenge by formulating the problem in the body fixed reference frame in 2d the equation of rotational motion is independent of reference frame and simplifies to 12 i y y α m y e x t where i y y is the body s moment of inertia about the y axis and m y e x t the total external moment about the y axis 2 5 potential flow theory the water is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid with irrotational motion so that the water velocity v can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential φ that satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ x z t 0 faltinsen 1993 the pressure p x z t in the water relative to the atmospheric pressure is given by the bernoulli equation 13 p x z t ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z where ρ is the mass density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity if the time derivative of φ in the point p in fig 1 is estimated in the body fixed reference frame eq 8 may be used to rewrite eq 13 as 14 p x b f z b f t ρ d b o φ d t r 0 ω r φ 1 2 φ 2 g z the most straightforward way to estimate φ t in eq 13 or d b o φ d t in eq 14 is to use a backward finite difference method however it was shown by hanssen et al 2015 that such finite difference schemes may produce spurious temporal oscillations in the fluid pressure and hence in the integrated loads on a body a more accurate method used by e g tanizawa 1995 greco 2001 koo and kim 2004 and sun 2007 is to formulate an auxiliary hydrodynamic problem for the time derivative of φ this is possible because φ t and d b o φ d t satisfy the laplace equation in the present work where we use mixed reference frames in overlapping grids the numerical problem is formulated for φ t in grids modelled in the inertial reference frame and for d b o φ d t in grids modelled in body fixed reference frames hydrodynamic boundary value problems a principal sketch of a numerical domain consisting of the water volume inside a numerical wave tank nwt with a floating body is shown in fig 2 the mathematical boundary value problems bvp to estimate φ and its time derivative inside ω require that appropriate boundary conditions are specified along the closed surface in 2d ω is strictly speaking bounded by a closed curve and not a surface the evolution of the free surface s s f is described by tracking massless markers in time consider a marker with coordinates x z x ζ x in the inertial coordinate system and with velocity potential φ ζ at each time instant dirichlet conditions on the form φ φ ζ are enforced on s s f the values of φ ζ and ζ are updated by integrating the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 in time 15 δ φ ζ δ t 1 2 φ 2 g z v φ ν x t φ φ r e f δ ζ δ t φ z v φ ζ ν x t ζ ζ r e f δ δ t t v is a lagrangian time derivative with v 0 eq 15 represents an eulerian formulation v φ gives a fully lagrangian formulation and v 0 ζ t gives a semi lagrangian formulation where the markers are restricted to move in the z direction in the present work the semi lagrangian formulation requiring the least smoothing is generally used for pure wave propagation cases while the fully lagrangian formulation allowing wave body intersection points to move without constraints is used when analysing scenarios involving wave body interactions a special type of hybrid description is used in the analysis of a heaving semi submerged circular cylinder where the x component of v is written as κ x φ x κ is set to unity at the wave cylinder intersection points giving a fully lagrangian description and decreases linearly towards zero semi lagrangian description some distance away from the cylinder ν x t in eq 15 is a damping coefficient associated with dissipation zones beaches to prevent wave reflections φ r e f and ζ r e f are reference values for the velocity potential and wave elevation respectively the body fixed equivalent of eq 15 is given in hanssen 2019 dirichlet conditions for φ t and d b o φ d t on s s f follow directly from eqs 13 and 14 noting that the pressure is atmospheric on the free surface i e p 0 on the remaining boundaries neumann conditions are imposed in the inertial reference frame these are written 16 φ n u n on s b s s e a b e d s w a l l s w m where n is the normal vector defined in fig 2 the velocity of the boundary u is zero along s s e a b e d and s w a l l on s b and s w m u is given by eq 6 neumann conditions for φ t φ t along s s e a b e d and s w a l l are found by taking the eulerian time derivative of eq 16 in the inertial reference frame noting that n t 0 this gives 17 φ t n 0 on s s e a b e d s w a l l where we have used that φ t φ t boundary conditions for the time derivative of φ along s s e a b e d and s w a l l are always specified in the inertial reference frame on s b and s w m however the mathematical formulation is simplified by specifying boundary conditions in the associated body fixed reference frames the neumann conditions for d b o φ d t on these boundaries are derived by taking the time derivative of eq 16 following the motion of the body 18 d b o φ d t n φ d b o n d t d b o u d t n u d b o n d t although the subscript b f is here omitted it is implicit that all vectors are written in the body fixed coordinate system the normal vector n is hence time independent so that eq 18 becomes 19 d b o φ d t n d b o r 0 ω r d t n the final version of the boundary condition enforced in the body fixed reference frames along s b and s w m thus reads 20 d b o φ d t n r 0 ω r n on s b s w m the change of operators from d b o φ d t to d b o φ d t is discussed by hanssen 2019 3 numerical implementation using the theoretical framework introduced in the previous section a fully nonlinear potential flow numerical wave tank nwt is developed starting from an initial state with still water at t 0 the free surface and rigid body motion are evolved in time with a standard fourth order runge kutta rk4 scheme using the free surface conditions 15 and the equations of motion 10 12 numerically the configuration and properties of the free surface are described by a finite number of markers that are tracked in time after each rk4 sub step the wave elevation ζ and the velocity potential φ ζ imposed as dirichlet condition on the free surface are updated for each marker if there is a rigid body present the position and velocity of this after each rk4 sub step result in updated body boundary neumann conditions on the remaining boundaries i e the flat seabed the wavemaker and the downwave tank wall neumann boundary conditions are enforced hence four bvps for φ must be constructed and solved for each physical time step evolving the solution from t n to t n δ t where δ t is the time step if there is a freely floating body present four bvps must also be solved for the time derivative of φ on the other hand if the body undergoes forced motions it is sufficient to solve the latter bvp only once at the end of each physical time step this is because the body motions in this case are known and not integrated forward in time in the rk4 scheme the hpc method is used as a solver for the hydrodynamic bvps combining an ibm with overlapping cartesian grids to model complex surfaces and motions of rigid bodies the combined method is denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm and represents a novel development in connection with the hpc method the classical 2d formulation of the hpc method and how it is implemented in the ibogm are explained in the two following sections 3 1 the harmonic polynomial cell method the computational domain is divided into overlapping quadrilateral cells as shown in fig 3 for a grid defined in the inertial coordinate system the grid nodes have global horizontal and vertical indices denoted i k each cell is made up of eight boundary nodes numbered from 1 to 8 with grid spacing δ x and δ z in x and z direction respectively the interior node in each cell which is a boundary node in any of the eight overlapping cells is given local index 9 each cell has a local cell fixed coordinate system o x z with origin in this node so that x z x z x 9 z 9 with x 9 z 9 the coordinates of the interior cell node in the global coordinate system in a grid specified in a body fixed o x b f z b f coordinate system as illustrated in fig 4 the local coordinates inside a cell are given as x z x b f z b f x 9 b f z 9 b f with x 9 b f z 9 b f the coordinates of the interior cell node in the body fixed coordinate system consider an arbitrarily located point p within the highlighted cell in either fig 3 or fig 4 with coordinates p x p z p in the cell s local coordinate system the velocity potential in this point is represented as a linear combination of the velocity potentials in the cell s boundary nodes φ i i 1 8 21 φ x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i taking the gradient of eq 21 gives the velocity vector 22 φ x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i in the origin of the local cell fixed coordinate system eq 21 becomes 23 φ 9 φ 0 0 i 1 8 c 1 i φ i and is used to enforce continuity of the solution throughout the computational domain in eqs 21 23 f j x z is either the real or imaginary part of the complex n th order harmonic polynomial x i z n with i 1 c j i is an element of the inverse of the matrix d with elements d i j f j x i z i where x i z i are the coordinates of the i th boundary node since f j x z satisfies the laplace equation so does automatically the representation of φ in eq 21 the same complete set of harmonic polynomials up to third order and incomplete set up to fourth order as used by shao and faltinsen 2012 is included in the expressions the selection of harmonic polynomials is discussed by ma et al 2018 where it is concluded that this is generally the best choice for an eight node cell because polynomials up to fourth order are included a spatial accuracy up to fourth order can be expected however under certain conditions an even better spatial accuracy can be achieved ma et al 2018 recognizing that φ i are the only time dependent variables ineq 21 we have that 24 φ t x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i and 25 φ t x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i where φ t i φ i t in the interior cell node eq 24 becomes 26 φ t 9 φ t 0 0 i 1 8 c 1 i φ t i replacing φ t i with d b o φ i d t eqs 24 26 describe d b o φ x z d t in a body fixed formulation it is reminded that d b o φ d t is the time derivative of φ following the motion of a body which we may think of as an eulerian type derivative in the body fixed reference frame if mixed reference frames are used this difference is accounted for by using eq 8 27 d b o φ x z d t i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i r 0 ω r i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i a similar expression is required to write φ t as a function of d b o φ d t 3 2 immersed boundary overlapping grid method the hpc method is implemented using an immersed boundary method ibm combined with overlapping grids and the resulting method is therefore referred to as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm the main reason for using these two modelling concepts is to facilitate an accurate and computationally efficient numerical implementation for general wave and wave rigid body interaction problems such problems are characterized by non stationary boundaries that may be described by complex geometries moreover local refinements of the computational domain may be necessary with the ibm arbitrarily shaped boundaries can be modelled straightforwardly while grids overlapping enables local refinement a significant advantage of the ibogm is that cartesian grids with square cells can be used throughout which is found to be crucial in order to take advantage of the higher order accuracy offered by the hpc method ma et al 2018 a principal sketch of the layout of a nwt modelled using the ibogm is show in fig 5 the coarse background grid defined in the inertial reference frame is fixed whereas the body fixed grids follow the motions of the wavemaker and floating body respectively nevertheless all grids are stationary in their respective reference frames so that the coefficients c j i in eqs 21 27 only need to be computed once which is beneficial with respect to computational efficiency without the use of overlapping grids local grid refinement close to moving boundaries would have been more complicated using only square cells although promising results using quad tree refinement techniques have recently been published the bvps for φ and its time derivative lead to global matrix equations on the form a φ b φ and a φ t b φ t where a is a shared global coefficient matrix φ and φ t are vectors that contain the velocity potential and its time derivative respectively of all grid nodes in the computational domain and b φ and b φ t are vectors with boundary conditions a is a sparse and narrow banded matrix dominated by entries of the continuity equation 23 an example of the structure of a is given later in fig 9 boundary conditions on physical boundaries on the free surface dirichlet conditions for φ and its time derivative are enforced by evaluating eqs 21 and 24 in the most appropriate cells containing it see fig 6 a these cells are denoted free surface ghost cells and are determined by first selecting free surface ghost nodes which are the nodes just above the free surface the ghost cells are the cells where the ghost nodes have local node number 7 or 5 or 8 if the node is at rigid boundaries occasionally some additional ghost nodes must be introduced in the ghost cells in order to have the same number of unknowns and equations rows in a the number of free surface dirichlet conditions is equal to the number of ghost nodes for each ghost node the dirichlet condition is enforced in the point on the free surface with the same x coordinate as the node if it belongs to the background grid or with the same x b f coordinate if the node is defined in an overlapping grid if there are two ghost nodes with the same x or x b f coordinate this means that the boundary condition for the same point on the free surface is enforced twice however since the boundary conditions are enforced using different ghost cells a does not become singular if the free surface markers are modelled with a fully lagrangian formulation their positions will generally differ from the vertical grid lines whereas if the semi lagrangian formulation is used the markers by definition move along the grid lines in z or z b f direction from a robustness point of view it is found beneficial to enforce dirichlet conditions in the locations where the free surface intersects the vertical grid lines therefore in the fully lagrangian approach third order b splines are used to interpolate the free surface elevation and potential in points that are not wave body intersection points to the x or x b f coordinates of the grid nodes these points are referred to as evaluation points in fig 7 one may wonder why this is done instead of using eq 21 to enforce dirichlet conditions directly in the markers position indeed at a frozen time instant this is allowed as long as there are enough markers located inside each cell when attempting to use this approach in a simulation however free surface instabilities rapidly occur this is believed to be related to the fact that the accuracy of the numerical solution varies inside the cell as was documented in 2d by ma et al 2018 they showed that the error of the numerical representation of φ in a cell is small along the vertical grid line through the centre of the cell and with the b spline interpolation we are able to enforce boundary conditions for φ in these high accuracy locations it is found equally important that φ is estimated with eq 22 in the same points as where the dirichlet conditions for φ are enforced hence we use third order b splines also to interpolate the values of φ back to each of the markers where they are required in connection with the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions since the evaluation points coincide with the markers when the semi lagrangian formulation is used no b spline interpolation of free surface properties is necessary in this case as illustrated in fig 7 a when the semi lagrangian formulation is used each grid has its separate set of free surface markers markers that belong to the background grid inside one of the overlapping grids are in this case inactive with properties interpolated from the markers in the overlapping grid with this approach the free surface is a single continuous boundary no matter if the semi lagrangian or fully lagrangian description is used for nodes on the tank walls seabed wavemaker and surface piercing body neumann boundary conditions are enforced through eqs 22 and 25 for the moving wavemaker and body the equations are applied in body fixed reference frames the body has an arbitrary geometry and generally does not intersect nodes in the body fixed grid and is hence modelled as an immersed boundary in this boundary conditions are enforced in discrete points along the boundary using body boundary ghost cells that contain the points red shaded cells in fig 6 b the algorithm used to deal with body boundaries here is as follows first body boundary ghost nodes inside the body are selected for each of these the discrete point on the wetted part of the body closest to the ghost node is selected we make sure that the same point on the body boundary is not used several times which may lead to a singular matrix system finally we select the most appropriate ghost cell to be used to enforce the body boundary condition in the selected point a reasonable choice of ghost cells is found to be characterized by that the ghost cells overlap and that the majority of their area is outside the body using the ibm in the body fixed grid the procedure of identifying body boundary ghost cells only has to be performed once at the start of the simulation however during the simulation it may happen that the pre selected body boundary points come above the instantaneous free surface in this case the body boundary conditions related to these are instead enforced in body boundary points just below the free surface the green shaded cell in fig 6 b is denoted a double cell used to enforce the free surface dirichlet and body boundary neumann conditions in the wave body intersection point with coordinates x w b i z w b i simultaneously denoting the local node indices in this cell 1 8 a set of fictitious nodes 1 8 are introduced with the same locations the double cell contains a double node with local index k i e a replica of the node with local index k which is the green node in the example in fig 6 b using the node with index k and the cell with local node indices 1 8 we enforce free surface dirichlet conditions in the point x w b i z w b i through eqs 21 and 24 similarly we use the node with index k and the cell with indices 1 8 to enforce neumann conditions in x w b i z w b i through eqs 22 and 25 in addition we enforce φ i φ i and d b o φ i d t d b o φ i d t for i 1 8 i k the intention of the double cells is to introduce additional unknowns that enable us to enforce more than one boundary condition per wave body intersection point however it is noted that the results applying this technique are found to be in close agreement with the results obtained only applying free surface dirichlet conditions in x w b i z w b i for reasons that require a dedicated theoretical study that is not part of the present work it is also noted that the water velocity used in the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 is estimated using the double cells where the dirichlet free surface condition is enforced instead using the double cells where the neumann body boundary condition is enforced i e the cells with indices 1 8 may give some non physical spurious oscillations an obvious consequence of using ghost cells in fig 6 is that a numerical solution exists outside the physical domain it is important to point out that this solution has no physical meaning other than ensuring that the enforced boundary conditions are satisfied coupling between grids continuity of the solution between the background grid and the overlapping grids is ensured through an implicit two way coupling for φ this is provided by using eq 21 while for its time derivative equation 27 is used to account for the mixed reference frames the coupling is illustrated in fig 8 in selecting cells used to interpolate the solution between the grids care is taken to avoid recurrence recurrence here means that a cell in the background grid used to interpolate the solution in an overlapping grid contains nodes that have their solution interpolated from the overlapping grid and vice versa an effective way to avoid this is to let the red nodes in fig 8 a be some minimum distance away from the red nodes in b this distance should at least be equal to the largest grid spacing in any of the two grids a consequence of the ibm and the coupling between grids is that a changes with time because the number of nodes in the computational domain and their associated equations vary with time consequently a must be built every time step as it will later be discussed in connection with fig 14 this operation amounts to a large portion of the overall computational time an example of a is given in fig 9 although some non zero off diagonal entries exist due to coupling between the different grids the matrix is diagonally dominated and the global matrix equations can be efficiently solved by iterative solvers for sparse matrix systems in the present work a bicgstab solver with tolerance 5 1 0 9 is used with a splu decomposition of a as pre conditioner this solver is part of the scipy python library and gives stable and efficient solutions of the global matrix equations integration of pressure when φ and its time derivative are obtained from the solution of the hydrodynamic bvps the pressure is computed using the body fixed version of the bernoulli equation 14 in a set of discrete points on the body boundary the body boundary is here parametrized by a tangential coordinate s in anti clockwise direction forces and moment are obtained by integrating the pressure over the instantaneous wetted body surface s 0 s s 1 28 f b f t s 0 s 1 p s t n b f s d s 29 m y t j s 0 s 1 p s t p b f s n b f s d s p b f s represents the body fixed coordinates of the point with tangential coordinate s relative to the centre of gravity a negative sign appears in front of the integrals because the normal vector n b f is defined outwards m y is independent of reference frame in 2d while the force vector can be expressed in the inertial reference frame as f λ b i f b f in the case of a freely floating body the body motions are coupled with the fluid dynamic problem this is highlighted by the fact that the pressure forces and moments are needed to estimate the body accelerations from the equations of motion 10 12 but at the same time the pressure depends on the time derivative of φ that is obtained by solving a bvp where the same accelerations give the body boundary conditions this principally means that the body accelerations appear in both sides of the equations of motion this coupling is handled here through the iterative scheme illustrated in fig 10 where the vector θ contains the translational and angular accelerations in the body fixed reference frame the input to each iteration loop is a guess of θ denoted as θ 0 initially estimated using backward finite difference the iteration is terminated when the error ϵ having the dimension of the acceleration term with the largest individual error is less than some predefined value ϵ t o l the reason for using an absolute rather than a relative error as termination criterion is that the latter may lead to a slow convergence or even divergence when the accelerations are close to zero with ϵ t o l 1 0 3 which is found to be a reasonable value for the cases considered here the number of iterations is typically in the order of five the iteration scheme is efficient since it is only performed at the end of every physical time step and because it introduces no changes to the coefficient matrix a or its pre conditioner matrix only the elements in the right hand side vector b φ t corresponding to body boundary conditions for d b o φ d t require updating alternatively the coupling between the body motions and the fluid dynamic problem can be handled intrinsically without iteration for example with the mode decomposition and indirect methods used by koo and kim 2004 or the implicit method proposed by tanizawa 1995 however these methods were developed for bem solvers with collocation points distributed over the body surface and using these techniques in the ibogm is likely related with challenges taking the implicit method as an example this requires that the integrals in eqs 28 29 are implicitly written into a in a modified coefficient matrix a since a a the same pre conditioner matrix cannot be used as in the bvp for φ and the additional terms written into a reduce the sparsity compared to a these two aspects may contribute adversely to the computational efficiency moreover including the boundary integrals over the surface of the body in a is expected to influence the numerical stability in an ibm especially when the rigid body motions are large to robustly include such non iterative methods in the ibogm therefore requires a dedicated effort and is not pursued in the present work the convergence of the iterative body acceleration scheme is investigated in fig 11 for one of the most numerically challenging freely floating body cases that will be discussed in section 4 4 here the surge motion obtained using 45 time steps per incident wave period is in good agreement with results using 90 time steps per wave period this is also the case for the heave and roll motions and 45 time steps per wave period therefore give sufficiently converged results for this case the average number of iterations n i t e r is around eight with the largest time step δ t n i t e r is reduced when δ t is reduced which indicates that the iterative scheme performs as intended when the time step is reduced we expect smaller inconsistencies between the body accelerations and pressure loads requiring fewer iterations f b f and m y in eqs 28 29 are part of the external loads in the right hand sides of the equations of motion 10 and 12 the external force vector also includes the vertical gravity force and possibly stiffness and linear damping forces 30 f b f e x t f b f λ i b m g k λ i b b l r 0 c r 0 where b l is a linear damping matrix c is a stiffness matrix and r 0 η 1 i η 3 k η 1 and η 3 are sway and heave motions in the inertial coordinate system where i and k are unit vectors along the x and z axes respectively the external moment may include linear and quadratic roll damping 31 m y e x t m y b η 5 l η 5 b η 5 q η 5 η 5 where b η 5 l and b η 5 q are linear and quadratic damping coefficients and η 5 is the roll motion in radians special treatment of wave body intersection points using markers to track the free surface evolution it is important to prevent that the markers on wave body intersection points separate from the body boundary especially when the body geometry is non vertical in the free surface region this is ensured by reformulating the fully lagrangian version of the kinematic free surface condition 15 in the tangential coordinate s defined in connection with eqs 28 29 32 d s d t σ z φ u b here u b is the velocity of the body surface in the marker location given by eq 6 and σ z is the component in the z b f direction of a sign function defined as s i g n φ u b if the intersection point is on the left side of the body and as s i g n φ u b on the right side of the body since the wave body intersection points are managed in the body fixed reference frame φ u b expresses the velocity magnitude of the wave body intersecting marker relative to this frame the argument allowing us to use eq 32 is that since neumann conditions enforcing zero relative normal velocity between the water and body are applied in the wave body intersection points the markers trajectories by definition have to be tangential to the surface in some scenarios such as when the semi submerged circular cylinder discussed later is forced to oscillate at a high frequency in heave small angles between the free surface and the body surface can occur if these angles become too small they may cause numerical instabilities to promote numerical robustness a jet cutting scheme is therefore invoked when either the interior or exterior angle between free surface s and body boundary s tangents become less than 5 the jet cutting scheme is illustrated in fig 12 marker 1 is removed marker 2 is projected normally onto the body and a new marker is introduced between marker 2 and 3 the markers are then redistributed to ensure equal horizontal spacing the markers before and after the jet cutting are denoted 1 5 and 1 5 respectively reduction of free surface instabilities especially when using the fully lagrangian formulation of eq 15 instabilities may develop on the free surface to prevent this the third order five point filter used by sun 2007 is applied to the free surface elevation and velocity potential after every complete time step in addition the fully lagrangian markers are redistributed with even horizontal spacing so that they do not cluster together with the semi lagrangian formulation of eq 15 hanssen et al 2018 found that a weaker twelfth order savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 is sufficient wave generation and absorption waves are generated with a moving physical wavemaker of either a piston or flap type where the former is typically used to generate shallow water waves and the latter to generate waves in intermediate and deep water a temporal ramp function r w m t defined as 0 5 1 cos π t t r a m p if t t r a m p and 1 0 otherwise is introduced to avoid numerical instabilities due to an impulsive start of the wavemaker t r a m p is the ramp function s duration typically taken between three and five times the characteristic wave period considering a flap wavemaker with steady state angular motion α w m t the flap signal used in a simulation is thus α w m t α w m t r w m t waves are absorbed at numerical beaches modelled through the damping coefficient ν x t in eq 15 because reflected and radiated waves do not decay with distance in 2d dissipation zones are necessary both towards the wavemaker upwave and the tank wall in the opposite downwave side the purpose of the upwave beach is to dissipate waves propagating back towards the wavemaker and φ r e f and ζ r e f in eq 15 are hence estimated from linear wavemaker theory see e g dean and dalrymple 1991 it was demonstrated by hanssen 2019 that this approach gives satisfactory results meaning that the fully nonlinear solution is retained a short distance away from the beach an advantage of using linear theory is that both regular and irregular waves can be accounted for in a straightforward manner the purpose of the downwave beach is to prevent any wave reflections from the tank wall hence φ r e f and ζ r e f are equal to zero for this beach ν x t can be decomposed into a spatial and temporal contribution ν x t ν x δ t 0 where δ t 0 is a step function which is zero for t t 0 and 1 for t t 0 t 0 is zero for the downwave beach and is chosen larger than the time when transient waves associated with start up of the wavemaker have propagated out of the beach for the upwave beach ν x follows the definition in greco 2001 33 ν x 0 x x 0 ν m a x 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 x 0 x x 1 downwave ν m a x 1 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 x 0 x x 1 upwave ν m a x x x 1 where ν m a x is an empirically chosen coefficient x 0 and x 1 are the start and endpoints respectively of the beach ξ is an auxiliary normalized coordinate defined as ξ x x 0 l b e a c h where l b e a c h x 1 x 0 is the beach length as a general guidance l b e a c h can be taken as two times the characteristic wavelength reasonable values for ν m a x are generally found to be in the range 2 4 s 1 if l b e a c h is too short this may require a large ν m a x which can lead to wave reflections from the beach itself schematic summary of solution algorithm the flowchart in fig 13 illustrates the main steps involved in evolving the numerical solution from the known state at time t n to the unknown state at t n 1 t n δ t for a freely floating body case δ t is here the constant time step for a general solution variable y with time derivative given in the form y y y t the rk4 time integration scheme can be expressed as 34 y n 1 y n δ t 6 k 1 y 2 k 2 y 2 k 3 y k 4 y with coefficients k i y i 1 4 35 k 1 y y y n t n k 2 y y y n 0 5 δ t k 1 y t n 0 5 δ t k 3 y y y n 0 5 δ t k 2 y t n 0 5 δ t k 4 y y y n δ t k 3 y t n δ t in fig 13 the vectors φ and φ t contain the velocity potential and its time derivative in all active grid nodes these are obtained from solving the global matrix equations corresponding to the hydrodynamic bvps φ and x contain the velocity potential and position of all free surface markers the time derivatives of these are estimated from the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 if the semi lagrangian versions of the free surface conditions are used only the vertical components in x are involved in the rk4 scheme if instead the fully lagrangian versions of the free surface conditions are used the markers are redistributed with even spacing in horizontal direction after each complete rk4 cycle the vector θ r 0 α contains the translational and angular rigid body motions and the double time derivative of θ i e the rigid body accelerations are estimated from the equations of motion an asterisk indicates the state of a variable or matrix after one of the three fictitious euler steps involved in the rk4 scheme for each physical time step four hydrodynamic bvps must be solved for φ together with 4 n i t e r bvps for the time derivative of φ computational effort the computational effort involved in the different parts of the ibogm is discussed using one of the freely floating body cases that will be presented in section 4 4 as example as fig 14 shows building the global matrix equation for φ accounts for more than 20 of the total cpu time the majority of this time is spent to generate a since the size and topology of a inevitably change with time in the ibogm recognizing that the majority of a is populated by entries of the connectivity eq 23 a useful technique that has been used here to limit the time spent constructing a is to initially generate a reservoir coefficient matrix a where eq 23 is inserted for all grid nodes except for those that are on boundaries at any given time relevant parts of a are copied into the correct locations in a without this technique the time to construct a increases notably generating the right hand side vector for the global matrix equation of the time derivative of φ amounts to a little more than 10 of the total cpu time it is noted that this vector is not entirely rebuilt for each of the cycles in the iterative scheme in fig 10 only the entries for body boundary ghost nodes are updated when a new body acceleration is estimated the time used by the iterative matrix solver including generation of pre conditioner matrices amounts to more than 25 of the total time while estimating and integrating the pressure over the wetted body surface amounts to a little less than 10 of the total cpu time since the pressure has to be integrated in each loop of the iterative scheme in fig 10 this time is significantly reduced if the body has prescribed motions moreover it is expected that the time can be further reduced by optimizing the reuse of hpc expressions that do not change during the iterations the remaining tasks in the other group in fig 14 include writing post processing files transforming coordinates between different coordinate systems and more it is expected that the method s cpu time can be further reduced and this will be increasingly important when extending from 2d to 3d 4 validation and verification validation and verification studies comparing results against experimental numerical and theoretical reference results are presented hereafter first the solver s ability to propagate waves with nonlinear characteristics are considered thereafter cases with rigid bodies 1 forced to oscillate in still water radiation and 2 kept fixed in incident waves diffraction are investigated finally all aspects of the solver are combined for a freely floating body in incident waves full wave body interaction 4 1 wave propagation the solver s ability to propagate waves with different nonlinear features such as steep waves in deep water wave wave interaction and solitary waves in shallow water and a focused plunging wave was documented by hanssen et al 2018 an additional study considering waves with steepness close to a breaking criterion is presented here for completeness the basis is the experiments performed by baarholm 2001 with periodic steep waves to study wave impacts on deck structures with low clearance to the still water level the experiments were carried out in a wave flume 13 5 m long 0 6 m wide and with a water depth h equal to 1 0 m the wave elevation was measured in a single wave probe that we here assume was located in the middle of the tank although baarholm states that the location of the wave probe sometimes was changed between cases the three cases denoted d03 003 n30 004 and n30 008 in baarholm 2001 with characteristics given in table 1 are considered where k ζ c is a measure of the crest steepness the table includes half the breaking wave height h b given by the following criterion in mei et al 2005 36 h b λ 0 14 tanh k h this assumes that a wave breaks when the horizontal particle velocity in the crest exceeds the phase speed of the wave although ζ c differs from 0 5 h b for nearly breaking waves the breaking criterion indicates that especially the case n30 004 is close to wave breaking the waves in the experiments were generated by a flap type wavemaker hinged 0 1 m above the seabed however neither the stroke nor the ramp period of the wavemaker are known and have to be assumed we here use a ramp time of 5 s while the wavemaker s angular stroke s w m a is approximated using linear wavemaker theory resulting in the following s w m a values 3 209 for d03 003 3 638 for n30 004 and 4 498 for n03 008 the time step δ t and grid spacing δ x δ z are set to 0 02 s and 0 05 m respectively for all three cases similar grid spacings are used in the stationary background grid and in the body fixed grid moving with the wavemaker this gives at least 30 time steps per wave period and at least 31 grid points per wavelength the length of the wave tank is increased to 16 5 m in the numerical analysis to allow for a 6 m long numerical beach with damping coefficient ν m a x 2 0 s 1 at the opposite side of the wavemaker the free surface markers are semi lagrangian i e only allowed to move in vertical direction the wave elevation in the probe located 6 25 m from the position of the wavemaker at rest is compared with the experimental results in fig 15 for the cases in table 1 given the uncertainty related to the wavemaker signal and the probe position used in the experiments the agreement is deemed satisfactory the largest deviations are observed for the case with ζ c closest to 0 5 h b n30 004 which may partly be explained by that modelling such steep wave is challenging both experimentally and numerically 4 2 forced heave motions of a semi submerged circular cylinder in still water the forced harmonic heave motion of a half submerged circular cylinder in still water studied experimentally by tasai and koterayama 1976 and numerically by sun 2007 is considered this case is characterized by two numerically challenging nonlinear features 1 the body has non vertical geometry where it intersects the free surface and 2 local nonlinear wave behaviour develops close to the body for high oscillation frequencies it is noted that the main results for the heaving cylinder has already been documented in hanssen et al 2017 the cylinder has radius r 0 1 m and the heave motion is given as η 3 t ϵ η 3 r sin ω t where ϵ η 3 η 3 a r and ω are the non dimensional heave amplitude and the angular oscillation frequency respectively from the time series of the vertical force f 3 t the heave added mass and damping coefficients a 33 and b 33 can be estimated as follows sun 2007 37 a 33 b 3 1 c 33 η 3 a ω 2 η 3 a 38 b 33 a 3 1 ω η 3 a the hydrostatic restoring coefficient is defined as c 33 ρ g d with ρ the water density g the acceleration of gravity and d 2 r the cylinder s diameter the fourier coefficients in eqs 37 38 follow by expanding the heave force signal in a fourier series 39 f 3 t f 3 0 n 1 f 3 n sin n ω t δ n where f 3 n and δ n are the n th order force amplitude and phase angle respectively the force amplitudes are estimated as 40 f 3 0 1 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t d t a 3 0 f 3 n sin δ n 2 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t cos n ω t d t a 3 n f 3 n cos δ n 2 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t sin n ω t d t b 3 n n 1 where t 2 π ω is the oscillation period and m 1 is the number of full oscillation periods used in the estimation taken so that f 3 t has steady state behaviour for t 0 t t 0 m t the mean force f 3 0 and the second order force amplitude f 3 2 are defined as 41 f 3 0 a 3 0 ρ g s 0 and 42 f 3 2 a 3 2 2 b 3 2 2 where s 0 0 5 π r 2 is the mean submerged area of the cylinder eight non dimensional oscillation frequencies 0 20 ω 2 r g 1 61 are analysed for a single heave amplitude ϵ η 3 0 2 the computational domain is symmetric about the vertical axis through the cylinder centre fig 16 the length of the numerical domain is l t a n k 10 λ where 0 39 m λ 3 15 m is the wavelength for the radiated waves estimated from the deep water dispersion relation the same water depth h 1 50 m is used for all frequencies numerical beaches with length 2 λ are used towards the tank walls on both sides of the cylinder to prevent wave reflections the free surface is described using the hybrid formulation of the free surface conditions 15 where the free surface markers at the wave body intersection points move in a fully lagrangian manner and thus never separate from the body surface while the markers in the background grid are semi lagrangian and thus restricted to move in parallel with the inertial z axis the spacing between free surface markers in the body fixed grid is significantly smaller than in the stationary background grid where the markers are distributed so that their horizontal positions coincide with those of the grid nodes the dimension of the overlapping body fixed grid equal in both directions is 20 r for the lowest and 5 r for the highest frequency all grids are uniform with square cells where the grid spacing in the background grid is taken as δ x δ z λ 18 in the body fixed grid δ x b f δ z b f is taken between r 9 and r 5 where the former is required for the most challenging high frequency cases and the latter is considered a minimum to give a proper description of the cylinder s geometry in the ibm the time step is taken in the range t 200 δ t t 55 where the smallest time step was required for the highest frequency ω 2 r g 1 61 for this frequency large free surface curvatures develop close to the wave body intersection points so that the jet cutting scheme is activated the main simulation parameters are summarized in table 2 the added mass and damping coefficients and the mean and second order forces derived with the present ibogm method are compared with reference results from various sources in fig 17 the theoretical results for a 33 and b 33 are derived by tasai and koterayama 1976 with a linear theory while the theoretical results for f 3 0 and f 3 2 are computed by papanikolaou 1980 using a second order theory the experimental results are by tasai and koterayama 1976 while the results by sun 2007 are obtained from a nonlinear boundary element method bem all the reference results are extracted from plots in sun 2007 the ibogm results for a 33 b 33 and f 3 2 are in good agreement with the references and especially with the numerical results by sun for f 3 0 where it should be noted that there is some scatter in the experimental data and that the values are small some differences can be observed the case with ω 2 r g 1 61 found to be the most numerically challenging case due to large free surface curvatures close to the cylinder is further examined the time series of the heave force on the cylinder containing higher order harmonics is compared with results from the analysis by sun in fig 18 the two curves are generally consistent and the differences observed in the troughs are considered acceptable comparing two different methods for a numerically challenging case the free surface elevation close to the cylinder at six different time instants throughout an oscillation cycle for ω 2 r g 1 61 is compared with sun s results obtained through personal communication in fig 19 consistent behaviour between the two solvers are observed both close to the wave body intersection points and further away from the cylinder indicating that the present numerical modelling of the flow at the wave body intersection points is physically sound even with significant local nonlinear behaviour of the free surface 4 3 a fixed 2d ship section in regular waves a 2d ship section in beam sea regular waves was studied experimentally by nojiri and murayama 1975 in japanese and later numerically by tanizawa et al 1999 the ship section has breadth b 0 50 m draught h 0 25 m and bilge radius 0 064 m since the present analysis is performed in 2d we define the fictitious length of the ship section in y direction as l s 1 0 m the incident periodic waves are characterized by their non dimensional wave frequency ξ b ω 2 b 2 g k b 2 and a linear amplitude ζ a 0 5 h with h the wave height here ω is the angular wave frequency g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wave number as given by the linear dispersion relation assuming deep water conditions the associated wavelength is λ 2 π k the waves included for the fixed ship section are defined in table 3 all simulations are performed for 20 t where t 2 π ω is the wave period a sketch of the numerical wave tank used in the analysis is shown in fig 20 the length of the tank l t a n k is equal to 8 λ and the depth h λ i e deep water conditions the ship section is located in the middle of the tank with numerical beaches with length l b e a c h 2 λ located on both sides the beach on the wavemaker side uses linear wavemaker theory as reference solution the incident waves are generated with a rotating flap type wavemaker hinged a distance 0 5 h from the seabed the wavemaker strokes required to obtain the waves specified in table 3 are estimated using linear wavemaker theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and the duration of the ramp function is 4 t for all cases in table 3 a time step δ t t 45 is used in the background grid and the body fixed grid following the motion of the wavemaker the uniform grid spacings are λ 25 in the square ship section fixed grid that has sides at least 2 5 b long the grid spacing is taken as the minimum between b 12 and λ 25 as an example the grids used in the simulation with ξ b 0 25 are shown in fig 21 for this case λ is much larger than b hence the grid spacing in the ship section fixed grid is much smaller than in the background grid transfer functions for the mean wave drift force in sway x direction and first order wave loads in sway heave and roll are presented in fig 22 the ibogm results are compared to linear and experimental results by nojiri and murayama 1975 and nonlinear bem results by tanizawa et al 1999 for the mean wave drift force the theoretical curve is derived by nojiri and murayama 1975 from a second order theory the mean wave drift forces by tanizawa et al 1999 and in the ibogm analyses are obtained from direct pressure integration dpi several methods to estimate the mean wave drift force have been systematically compared where it is concluded that dpi is the most accurate the details of this comparison being outside the scope of the present paper will be documented in a future publication the ibogm transfer functions are obtained from a fourier analysis over the last four wave periods of the force time histories where steady state behaviour is ensured the wave height used in the experiments is not known however for the freely floating scenario results for wave heights 3 5 and 7 cm are presented it is thus reasonable to assume that the experiments presented for the fixed body are performed with one of these the first order wave loads obtained with the ibogm for both h 1 cm and h 7 cm are generally consistent with the reference results for the largest wave frequencies some scatter is seen in the experimental results which may be due to wave nonlinearity experimental uncertainty or a combination of the two the roll moments presented by tanizawa et al 1999 are consistently slightly larger than the linear experimental and ibogm values the first order wave loads show little sensitivity to the wave height for the mean wave drift force the ibogm results are consistent with the second order theory up to ξ b 1 0 but give lower values above this frequency the difference increases with increasing wave height indicating higher than second order effects the same behaviour is qualitatively observed in the experimental results tanizawa et al 1999 present larger mean wave drift forces than the ibogm for ξ b 1 0 but with the same qualitative ξ b dependence the reason for this difference is not fully understood but the fact that tanizawa et al 1999 use a nwt with l t a n k 6 λ instead of 8 λ as used here may contribute moreover it is understood that tanizawa et al 1999 generate waves at a fixed control surface using linear wave theory instead of using a physical wavemaker which may induce an artificial steady stokes type drift shao 2010 4 4 a freely floating 2d ship section in regular waves the same 2d ship section as considered in the previous section is analysed here as freely floating for the largest wave height in table 3 the ship section has mass m 125 kg roll inertia i y y 4 0145 kg m 2 and the vertical centre of gravity is k g 0 135 m from the keel a linear sway damping b 22 l 19 8 n s 1 and sway stiffness c 22 197 58 n m 1 acting in the body s centre of gravity are included with the remaining damping and stiffness terms set to zero all parameters are taken from tanizawa et al 1999 the damping and stiffness forces relate to motion in the inertial reference frame the simulations length is 60 t i e three times longer than for the fixed ship section this is because transient motions are slowly decaying so that it takes longer to reach approximately steady state conditions the duration of the wavemaker ramp function is also here 4 t the time step and grid spacings are similar to those used for the fixed ship section the ibogm results are verified against analyses performed with the nonlinear potential flow bem solver developed by greco 2001 using a nwt with identical dimensions and set up as fig 20 waves are generated with the same flap type wavemaker using identical wavemaker signals and the damping and stiffness coefficients are the same as used in the present ibogm analysis also the bem solves an auxiliary bvp for the time derivative of φ the main difference between the two simulations is that the time step in the bem analyses is half of that in the ibogm analyses which was necessary in order to ensure numerical stability and that the bvps for φ and its time derivative are solved in an earth fixed reference frame in the bem solver the bem analysis is therefore considered as an independent verification of the ibogm analysis using a similar numerical set up but a fundamentally different numerical method transfer functions for the mean wave drift force in sway and first order motions in sway heave and roll are compared in fig 23 the ibogm and bem transfer functions are obtained from an identical fourier analysis of the last 10 t of the simulation time series the plots include motions from a linear analysis by koo and kim 2004 and mean wave drift force from a second order theory by the same authors away from the heave and roll resonance frequencies around ξ b 0 5 both solvers produce motions in good agreement with the linear results significant differences from linear results are observed moving towards resonance frequencies indicating non negligible nonlinear effects with roll amplitudes of approximately 30 close to resonance the simulations are numerically challenging and the consistency between the two nonlinear numerical methods are therefore encouraging the mean wave drift force in both the ibogm and bem analyses deviate from the theoretical curve for the steepest waves which is consistent with the behaviour for the fixed ship section in fig 22 close to the resonance frequency region the ibogm gives slightly larger drift forces than the bem since the mean wave drift force is sensitive to the relative motion between the structure and waves it is suggested that this may be related to the slight difference in heave motions observed in the frequency range 0 5 ξ b 0 7 the reason for these differences are not further explored but it should be noted that the heave and roll motions are large and the motions and loads in the different degrees of freedom are coupled with each other the ibogm and bem analyses for the challenging case with ξ b 0 5 can be further examined by comparing motion and load time series in fig 24 showing that the roll moments and motions are visually in excellent agreement consistent with the transfer functions in fig 23 the ibogm gives slightly larger heave amplitudes while the sway forces differ mainly in the troughs although not easy to observe the average sway force over the ten last wave periods i e the mean wave drift force is slightly larger for the ibogm than for the bem a fourier analysis shows that these differences are mainly of third order to finalize the verification fig 25 shows an analysis of the wave elevation close to the ship section and the dynamic pressure distribution over the instantaneous wetted surface for ten different time instants towards the end of the simulations the time series of the sway force is included in each sub plot with the exact time instant of the snapshot indicated one should note that because there is a slight difference in when data are written to file in the ibogm and bem analyses the two simulations are not fully synchronized in all of the sub plots however for sub plots b g and i where the time instants approximately coincide the results are in good agreement although there are local differences in the pressure distribution and the wave elevation the instantaneous positions of the ship section and the sway forces are similar one should keep in mind that these snapshots are taken towards the end of the simulations for a challenging case with roll motions up to 30 where one may anticipate that inconsistencies between the two solvers would have escalated the fact that the two distinctly different solvers give consistent results strengthens the confidence in the ibogm 5 conclusions a numerical wave tank nwt for nonlinear wave and wave rigid body interactions in 2d using potential flow theory has been presented the modelling techniques are developed with future extension to 3d in mind the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method which is a higher order accurate and efficient field method using overlapping cells is employed to solve the laplace equations for the velocity potential and its time derivative an immersed boundary method ibm is proposed to model the free surface and body boundaries and is combined with using overlapping grids following the motion of rigid bodies the combined method representing a novel extension to the hpc method was denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm a consequence of using immersed boundaries is that we operate with ghost nodes and ghost cells where a numerical solution exists in the part of the ghost cells outside the water region the solution in these regions has no physical meaning the ibogm has the following main advantages 1 boundary fitted grids that may be cumbersome to generate for complex boundaries and that must be updated every time the boundaries move are avoided 2 cartesian grids with square cells can be used throughout which is important to maximize the accuracy in the hpc method 3 the solution may be refined locally by increasing the density of overlapping grids without increasing the number of unknowns unnecessarily the following validation and verification cases were presented 1 propagation of regular waves with steepness up to the theoretical breaking limit 2 forced harmonic heave motion of a semi submerged circular cylinder in still water and a 2d ship section with a small bilge radius 3 fixed and 4 freely floating in beam sea regular waves 1 3 consider wave propagation wave radiation and wave diffraction separately whereas in 4 all effects are combined the results from the present analysis agreed well with experimental theoretical and numerical reference results in particular for the freely floating 2d ship section results were systematically compared with a dedicated independent analysis performed with a fully nonlinear boundary element method bem code the comparison included challenging scenarios with resonant roll motions up to 30 the two analyses gave generally consistent loads and motions both indicating significant nonlinear coupling effects near heave and roll resonance both analyses gave mean sway wave drift forces smaller than second order theory for steep waves close to heave and roll resonance slightly different wave drift forces were observed between the two analyses however the differences were considered acceptable since the wave drift forces are sensitive to the first order motions that were large in this frequency range the cases presented in this paper indicate that the proposed ibogm method handles wave and wave rigid body interaction effects accurately it is therefore considered well suited for further examination of nonlinear wave body interaction effects credit authorship contribution statement finn

20875,a fully nonlinear two dimensional numerical method based on potential flow theory for water waves and their interaction with surface piercing rigid bodies is presented the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method is used to solve the laplace equation for the velocity potential and its time derivative the hpc method which is a high order method using analytical expressions harmonic polynomials to represent the solution inside overlapping cells has previously been shown accurate and efficient supplementary research has shown that in order to maximally benefit from the method s accuracy it is a requirement that square or close to square cells are used here we use an immersed boundary method to model non stationary boundaries such as the free surface or the surface of a rigid body and overlapping body fixed grids that are locally cartesian to refine the solution near moving bodies combining these two modelling concepts with the hpc method represents the main novel contribution in the present work with this combined method denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm the challenge of generating boundary fitted grids for complex boundaries is avoided moreover square cells can be used throughout the domain and the solution can be refined locally without increasing the number of unknowns unnecessarily the method is systematically validated and verified against analytical experimental and numerical reference results the cases studied include propagation of steep waves forced heave motions of a semi submerged circular cylinder and a fixed and freely floating ship section in beam sea waves for the freely floating ship section the present method is compared in detail with results from a dedicated study performed with a fully nonlinear boundary element method for cases with roll motions up to 30 the present results are generally in good agreement with reference results even for the most challenging wave body interaction cases considered based on this we later intend to use the method to examine in depth the importance of nonlinear effects in the interaction between waves and rigid bodies graphical abstract keywords nonlinear

production ships and platforms in harsh locations nowadays coastal and offshore regions are populated by an increasing amount of fixed and floating structures wind turbines have been deployed in the water first supported by bottom fixed foundations and more recently as floating installations in deeper waters other innovative renewable energy concepts such as floating solar islands patterson et al 2019 are proposed in coastal regions and fish farms are moved away from fjords and into the ocean by moving marine structures to more remote locations they are exposed to more challenging wave conditions consider as an example offshore installations in the north sea these experience steep essentially wind generated sea states with significant wave heights larger than 15 m and thus tremendous loads and wave induced responses disregarding violent and partly local effects such as slamming the structures are traditionally dimensioned by combining loads and responses from linear analysis tools with correction factors from hydrodynamic model tests and safety factors provided in rules and regulations slowly varying wave loads are assumed to be of second order and either estimated from linear analysis using approximations de hauteclocque et al 2012 or from a full second order hydrodynamic analysis based on a perturbation approach using such efficient analysis tools is justified by the assumption that the structures global behaviour is at most weakly nonlinear however the general validity of such hypothesis has been challenged during recent years in some of the mooring line failures for floating structures in the north sea documented over the last decades kvitrud 2014a b noble denton europe 2006 exceedance of the mooring lines strength capacity is identified as the failure mechanism although unintentional response of dynamic positioning systems may have played a role it is suggested that the environmental loads in particular the wave drift loads could have been larger than the mooring systems were designed to withstand as a consequence of these observations fonseca et al 2016 fonseca and stansberg 2017b and fonseca et al 2017 documented through systematic model tests that wave drift loads may be significantly under predicted by state of the art computational design tools in severe sea states the largest differences are observed for semi submersibles and are mainly due to viscous effects however non negligible differences may also be identified for ship shaped structures where viscous effects are of less importance compared to nonlinear inviscid effects as discussed by fonseca and stansberg 2017a the damping of slowly varying motions may also be influenced by nonlinear effects with the knowledge that linear tools may be insufficient for existing structures in harsh sea states together with the deployment of new complex structures in exposed locations analysis tools properly accounting for nonlinear effects are needed the aim of the present research is therefore 1 to develop an accurate and efficient numerical method to study nonlinear wave and wave body interaction problems and 2 to provide fundamental insight into global nonlinear effects beyond the capability of linear and weakly nonlinear methods only two dimensional 2d scenarios are considered however the methods are developed with future extension to three dimensions 3d in mind the water is assumed incompressible and irrotational and viscous effects are neglected hence potential flow theory can be used the present paper is concerned with 1 whereas 2 will be addressed in a separate study several authors have used fully nonlinear potential flow models mostly based on the boundary element method bem these include vinje and brevig 1981 and dommermuth et al 1988 who performed numerical analysis of steep overturning waves in finite water depth in 2d until the point where the overturning wave reattaches to the underlying surface beyond this point potential flow theory does not apply greco 2001 examined water on deck problems in 2d typically relevant for floating production units in large waves you 2012 studied wave loads on and motions of moored ships in finite water depth in both 2d and 3d in addition to incident wave problems fully nonlinear bems have been used to analyse water entry problems for instance sun 2007 investigated water entry of 2d bodies accounting for non viscous flow separation and hydroelastic effects other numerical methods in connection with nonlinear potential flow models include the finite element method fem such as used by wu and eatock taylor 1994 eatock taylor 1996 and yan and ma 2007 ma and yan 2009 and the finite difference method fdm such as used by bingham and zhang 2007 engsig karup et al 2009 and ducrozet et al 2010 a comprehensive overview of the early development of potential flow numerical wave tanks is presented by kim et al 1999 in the present work we use the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method proposed by shao and faltinsen 2012 2014b to solve the laplace equation for the velocity potential numerically using high order harmonic polynomials to represent the solution this method has the potential to solve a problem to a given numerical error more efficiently than alternative numerical methods moreover it gives a global system with a diagonally dominated coefficient matrix in a similar manner as the fdm that can be solved efficiently by iterative matrix solvers several authors have applied the method in 2d liang et al 2015 studied various problems in marine hydrodynamics including coupling with a local solution to deal with singular flows at sharp corners zhu et al 2017 developed a nonlinear nwt for wave propagation strand 2018 modelled the flow inside a closed flexible fish cage using linear theory wang et al 2020 used the hpc method with local grid refinement to study strongly nonlinear phenomena such as overturning waves and water entry of a wedge and applied an irregular cell technique to avoid the drawbacks of using distorted cells the method s accuracy was systematically investigated by ma et al 2018 bardazzi et al 2015 used a generalized hpc method to solve the poisson equation in a viscous flow navier stokes ns solver and further use in connection with viscous flows is currently investigated by the same research group fredriksen 2015 and hanssen et al 2019 coupled the hpc method with ns solvers using domain decomposition dd approaches siddiqui et al 2018 used a weak dd scheme to couple a nonlinear hpc based potential flow solver with the open source ns solver openfoam to investigate the flow inside a damaged ship compartment undergoing forced heave motions in still water in 3d the method has been used by shao and faltinsen 2014b a to investigate nonlinear wave propagation and nonlinear run up around upright bottom mounted cylinders and by liang et al 2020 to model sloshing inside an upright circular tank using an overset mesh technique immersed boundary methods ibm are traditionally not widely used in potential flow solvers however using an ibm in field methods has significant attractive features since it eliminates the need to fit grids to complex boundaries and update these as the boundaries move or deform with time this may both be time consuming and result in poor quality grids recently xu et al 2020 demonstrated an ibm to model the free surface in a 2d fdm with promising results in the hpc method using an ibm to model physical boundaries was first attempted by hanssen et al 2015 in 2d using an approach that required auxiliary interpolation schemes to be constructed utilizing that the hpc method provides analytical expressions for the velocity potential anywhere in the fluid and not only in discrete nodes the need for these auxiliary interpolation schemes was eliminated in the enhanced ibm by hanssen et al 2018 a similar ibm was used by robaux and benoit 2018 2020 to investigate waves propagating over a submerged body and waves interacting with a fixed surface piercing body and by shen et al 2020 to model steep and even overturning sloshing waves inside a 2d closed fish cage with local grid refinement tong et al 2021 used the ibm together with local grid refinement to model waves interacting with a surface piercing body that is fixed or has prescribed motion as an additional modelling concept hanssen et al 2018 introduced an overlapping body fixed cartesian grid to model the region close to a physical wavemaker in the present work we generalize this approach to include a surface piercing body modelled with an ibm in a body fixed cartesian grid in an extension of the work presented by hanssen et al 2017 the body may be fixed or undergo forced or freely floating motion in addition to combining the hpc method with immersed boundaries and overlapping grids in a novel way this is to our knowledge the first published study where the hpc method is used to couple the hydrodynamic problem with the equations of rigid body motion the rest of the paper is organized as follows first theoretical background related to body fixed reference frames and potential flow theory is given then the implementation of the numerical method is described finally comparisons against existing reference results for wave propagation and wave body interaction are presented before main conclusions are drawn 2 theoretical framework relevant background for body fixed reference frames and fundamental equations of potential flow theory in inertial and body fixed reference frames is outlined two dimensional 2d water waves and their interaction with a surface piercing fixed or floating structure are considered 2 1 coordinate systems a right handed inertial earth fixed coordinate o x z system is introduced where the z axis is positive in upward direction with origin in the mean water line the o x z system coincides with the x z plane of a right handed three dimensional 3d o x y z system thus angular motions and moments are referred to as rotation about the y axis body fixed coordinate systems o x b f z b f are introduced for moving bodies illustrated for a floating box shaped structure in fig 1 the body fixed coordinate system is complemented by a body related coordinate system o x z with origin coinciding with that of the o x b f z b f system but axes parallel with the o x z system the wave body interaction cases considered in the present paper are relevant for ships in beam sea waves and motions parallel to the x and z axes are hence denoted as sway and heave respectively rotations α about the y axis are denoted as roll with positive direction indicated in fig 1 a point p x p z p defined in the inertial o x z coordinate system can be expressed in the body fixed coordinate system by a two step coordinate transformation consisting of 1 a coordinate displacement where p is expressed in the body related coordinate system as p x p z p and 2 a coordinate rotation where the coordinates are projected onto the axes of the body fixed coordinate system the coordinate rotation uses a rotation matrix 1 λ α c o s α s i n α s i n α c o s α where α is defined in fig 1 and given in radians this gives the following relations p b f x p b f z p b f λ i b p and p λ b i p b f where λ i b λ α and λ b i λ α when rotating time derivatives of vector quantities between inertial and non inertial coordinate systems one must account for the time rate of change of the unit vectors in the latter e g 2 p λ b i p b f λ b i p b f the overdot here means time derivative relative to the coordinate system that the quantity is defined in i e p and p b f are the time derivatives of p and p b f in the inertial and body fixed coordinate systems respectively the reason for taking the time derivative of p in the inertial coordinate system is that the o x z coordinate system is only displaced and not rotated relative to the o x z coordinate system 2 2 kinematics for a generic vector s the following notation is used hereafter d s d t is the time derivative of s in the inertial reference frame s is the time derivative of s in the reference frame where it is defined a subscript b f explicitly means that the vector is projected along the axes of the o x b f z b f system we now consider the point p in fig 1 the position and velocity of p in the o x z coordinate system are given as 3 r r 0 r 4 d r d t d r 0 d t d r d t r 0 r ω r where ω is the angular velocity vector in 2d given as ω α j with j the unit vector in y direction noting that ω ω 0 in 2d the acceleration of p in the inertial reference frame is 5 d 2 r d t 2 r 0 ω r 0 r ω r 2 ω r ω ω r if p is a fixed point on the body surface the equations simplify to 6 d r d t r 0 ω r 7 d 2 r d t 2 r 0 ω r 0 ω r ω ω r 2 3 time derivative of scalars in addition to vectors also the time derivative of scalar quantities generally differ in inertial and body fixed reference frames faltinsen and timokha 2009 we define d b o q d t as the time derivative of a generic time dependent scalar q performed following the motion of a rigid body if the time derivative is taken in p defined in fig 1 and the location of this point is fixed in o x b f z b f 8 d b o q d t q t r 0 ω r q here q t is the eulerian time derivative of q i e the time derivative of q in a fixed point in the inertial coordinate system 2 4 the equations of motion the translational motions of a rigid body follow from newton s second law which in the inertial reference frame is defined as 9 m d 2 r 0 d t 2 f e x t here m is the body s mass f e x t is the external force vector which is the sum of all loads acting on the body including its weight and d 2 r 0 d t 2 is the acceleration of the centre of gravity in the inertial reference frame the equation may be rewritten in the body fixed reference frame 10 m r 0 b f ω r 0 b f f e x t b f where f e x t b f λ i b f e x t it should be noted that additional terms apply in eq 10 if written for another point than the centre of gravity since then r 0 the equation of rotational motion in the inertial reference frame is 11 i ω ω i ω m e x t with i the rotational inertia matrix and m e x t the total external moment vector the term ω i ω is challenging in 3d because it implies that the body has a time varying inertia shao 2010 avoided this challenge by formulating the problem in the body fixed reference frame in 2d the equation of rotational motion is independent of reference frame and simplifies to 12 i y y α m y e x t where i y y is the body s moment of inertia about the y axis and m y e x t the total external moment about the y axis 2 5 potential flow theory the water is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid with irrotational motion so that the water velocity v can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential φ that satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ x z t 0 faltinsen 1993 the pressure p x z t in the water relative to the atmospheric pressure is given by the bernoulli equation 13 p x z t ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z where ρ is the mass density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity if the time derivative of φ in the point p in fig 1 is estimated in the body fixed reference frame eq 8 may be used to rewrite eq 13 as 14 p x b f z b f t ρ d b o φ d t r 0 ω r φ 1 2 φ 2 g z the most straightforward way to estimate φ t in eq 13 or d b o φ d t in eq 14 is to use a backward finite difference method however it was shown by hanssen et al 2015 that such finite difference schemes may produce spurious temporal oscillations in the fluid pressure and hence in the integrated loads on a body a more accurate method used by e g tanizawa 1995 greco 2001 koo and kim 2004 and sun 2007 is to formulate an auxiliary hydrodynamic problem for the time derivative of φ this is possible because φ t and d b o φ d t satisfy the laplace equation in the present work where we use mixed reference frames in overlapping grids the numerical problem is formulated for φ t in grids modelled in the inertial reference frame and for d b o φ d t in grids modelled in body fixed reference frames hydrodynamic boundary value problems a principal sketch of a numerical domain consisting of the water volume inside a numerical wave tank nwt with a floating body is shown in fig 2 the mathematical boundary value problems bvp to estimate φ and its time derivative inside ω require that appropriate boundary conditions are specified along the closed surface in 2d ω is strictly speaking bounded by a closed curve and not a surface the evolution of the free surface s s f is described by tracking massless markers in time consider a marker with coordinates x z x ζ x in the inertial coordinate system and with velocity potential φ ζ at each time instant dirichlet conditions on the form φ φ ζ are enforced on s s f the values of φ ζ and ζ are updated by integrating the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 in time 15 δ φ ζ δ t 1 2 φ 2 g z v φ ν x t φ φ r e f δ ζ δ t φ z v φ ζ ν x t ζ ζ r e f δ δ t t v is a lagrangian time derivative with v 0 eq 15 represents an eulerian formulation v φ gives a fully lagrangian formulation and v 0 ζ t gives a semi lagrangian formulation where the markers are restricted to move in the z direction in the present work the semi lagrangian formulation requiring the least smoothing is generally used for pure wave propagation cases while the fully lagrangian formulation allowing wave body intersection points to move without constraints is used when analysing scenarios involving wave body interactions a special type of hybrid description is used in the analysis of a heaving semi submerged circular cylinder where the x component of v is written as κ x φ x κ is set to unity at the wave cylinder intersection points giving a fully lagrangian description and decreases linearly towards zero semi lagrangian description some distance away from the cylinder ν x t in eq 15 is a damping coefficient associated with dissipation zones beaches to prevent wave reflections φ r e f and ζ r e f are reference values for the velocity potential and wave elevation respectively the body fixed equivalent of eq 15 is given in hanssen 2019 dirichlet conditions for φ t and d b o φ d t on s s f follow directly from eqs 13 and 14 noting that the pressure is atmospheric on the free surface i e p 0 on the remaining boundaries neumann conditions are imposed in the inertial reference frame these are written 16 φ n u n on s b s s e a b e d s w a l l s w m where n is the normal vector defined in fig 2 the velocity of the boundary u is zero along s s e a b e d and s w a l l on s b and s w m u is given by eq 6 neumann conditions for φ t φ t along s s e a b e d and s w a l l are found by taking the eulerian time derivative of eq 16 in the inertial reference frame noting that n t 0 this gives 17 φ t n 0 on s s e a b e d s w a l l where we have used that φ t φ t boundary conditions for the time derivative of φ along s s e a b e d and s w a l l are always specified in the inertial reference frame on s b and s w m however the mathematical formulation is simplified by specifying boundary conditions in the associated body fixed reference frames the neumann conditions for d b o φ d t on these boundaries are derived by taking the time derivative of eq 16 following the motion of the body 18 d b o φ d t n φ d b o n d t d b o u d t n u d b o n d t although the subscript b f is here omitted it is implicit that all vectors are written in the body fixed coordinate system the normal vector n is hence time independent so that eq 18 becomes 19 d b o φ d t n d b o r 0 ω r d t n the final version of the boundary condition enforced in the body fixed reference frames along s b and s w m thus reads 20 d b o φ d t n r 0 ω r n on s b s w m the change of operators from d b o φ d t to d b o φ d t is discussed by hanssen 2019 3 numerical implementation using the theoretical framework introduced in the previous section a fully nonlinear potential flow numerical wave tank nwt is developed starting from an initial state with still water at t 0 the free surface and rigid body motion are evolved in time with a standard fourth order runge kutta rk4 scheme using the free surface conditions 15 and the equations of motion 10 12 numerically the configuration and properties of the free surface are described by a finite number of markers that are tracked in time after each rk4 sub step the wave elevation ζ and the velocity potential φ ζ imposed as dirichlet condition on the free surface are updated for each marker if there is a rigid body present the position and velocity of this after each rk4 sub step result in updated body boundary neumann conditions on the remaining boundaries i e the flat seabed the wavemaker and the downwave tank wall neumann boundary conditions are enforced hence four bvps for φ must be constructed and solved for each physical time step evolving the solution from t n to t n δ t where δ t is the time step if there is a freely floating body present four bvps must also be solved for the time derivative of φ on the other hand if the body undergoes forced motions it is sufficient to solve the latter bvp only once at the end of each physical time step this is because the body motions in this case are known and not integrated forward in time in the rk4 scheme the hpc method is used as a solver for the hydrodynamic bvps combining an ibm with overlapping cartesian grids to model complex surfaces and motions of rigid bodies the combined method is denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm and represents a novel development in connection with the hpc method the classical 2d formulation of the hpc method and how it is implemented in the ibogm are explained in the two following sections 3 1 the harmonic polynomial cell method the computational domain is divided into overlapping quadrilateral cells as shown in fig 3 for a grid defined in the inertial coordinate system the grid nodes have global horizontal and vertical indices denoted i k each cell is made up of eight boundary nodes numbered from 1 to 8 with grid spacing δ x and δ z in x and z direction respectively the interior node in each cell which is a boundary node in any of the eight overlapping cells is given local index 9 each cell has a local cell fixed coordinate system o x z with origin in this node so that x z x z x 9 z 9 with x 9 z 9 the coordinates of the interior cell node in the global coordinate system in a grid specified in a body fixed o x b f z b f coordinate system as illustrated in fig 4 the local coordinates inside a cell are given as x z x b f z b f x 9 b f z 9 b f with x 9 b f z 9 b f the coordinates of the interior cell node in the body fixed coordinate system consider an arbitrarily located point p within the highlighted cell in either fig 3 or fig 4 with coordinates p x p z p in the cell s local coordinate system the velocity potential in this point is represented as a linear combination of the velocity potentials in the cell s boundary nodes φ i i 1 8 21 φ x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i taking the gradient of eq 21 gives the velocity vector 22 φ x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i in the origin of the local cell fixed coordinate system eq 21 becomes 23 φ 9 φ 0 0 i 1 8 c 1 i φ i and is used to enforce continuity of the solution throughout the computational domain in eqs 21 23 f j x z is either the real or imaginary part of the complex n th order harmonic polynomial x i z n with i 1 c j i is an element of the inverse of the matrix d with elements d i j f j x i z i where x i z i are the coordinates of the i th boundary node since f j x z satisfies the laplace equation so does automatically the representation of φ in eq 21 the same complete set of harmonic polynomials up to third order and incomplete set up to fourth order as used by shao and faltinsen 2012 is included in the expressions the selection of harmonic polynomials is discussed by ma et al 2018 where it is concluded that this is generally the best choice for an eight node cell because polynomials up to fourth order are included a spatial accuracy up to fourth order can be expected however under certain conditions an even better spatial accuracy can be achieved ma et al 2018 recognizing that φ i are the only time dependent variables ineq 21 we have that 24 φ t x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i and 25 φ t x z i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i where φ t i φ i t in the interior cell node eq 24 becomes 26 φ t 9 φ t 0 0 i 1 8 c 1 i φ t i replacing φ t i with d b o φ i d t eqs 24 26 describe d b o φ x z d t in a body fixed formulation it is reminded that d b o φ d t is the time derivative of φ following the motion of a body which we may think of as an eulerian type derivative in the body fixed reference frame if mixed reference frames are used this difference is accounted for by using eq 8 27 d b o φ x z d t i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ t i r 0 ω r i 1 8 j 1 8 c j i f j x z φ i a similar expression is required to write φ t as a function of d b o φ d t 3 2 immersed boundary overlapping grid method the hpc method is implemented using an immersed boundary method ibm combined with overlapping grids and the resulting method is therefore referred to as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm the main reason for using these two modelling concepts is to facilitate an accurate and computationally efficient numerical implementation for general wave and wave rigid body interaction problems such problems are characterized by non stationary boundaries that may be described by complex geometries moreover local refinements of the computational domain may be necessary with the ibm arbitrarily shaped boundaries can be modelled straightforwardly while grids overlapping enables local refinement a significant advantage of the ibogm is that cartesian grids with square cells can be used throughout which is found to be crucial in order to take advantage of the higher order accuracy offered by the hpc method ma et al 2018 a principal sketch of the layout of a nwt modelled using the ibogm is show in fig 5 the coarse background grid defined in the inertial reference frame is fixed whereas the body fixed grids follow the motions of the wavemaker and floating body respectively nevertheless all grids are stationary in their respective reference frames so that the coefficients c j i in eqs 21 27 only need to be computed once which is beneficial with respect to computational efficiency without the use of overlapping grids local grid refinement close to moving boundaries would have been more complicated using only square cells although promising results using quad tree refinement techniques have recently been published the bvps for φ and its time derivative lead to global matrix equations on the form a φ b φ and a φ t b φ t where a is a shared global coefficient matrix φ and φ t are vectors that contain the velocity potential and its time derivative respectively of all grid nodes in the computational domain and b φ and b φ t are vectors with boundary conditions a is a sparse and narrow banded matrix dominated by entries of the continuity equation 23 an example of the structure of a is given later in fig 9 boundary conditions on physical boundaries on the free surface dirichlet conditions for φ and its time derivative are enforced by evaluating eqs 21 and 24 in the most appropriate cells containing it see fig 6 a these cells are denoted free surface ghost cells and are determined by first selecting free surface ghost nodes which are the nodes just above the free surface the ghost cells are the cells where the ghost nodes have local node number 7 or 5 or 8 if the node is at rigid boundaries occasionally some additional ghost nodes must be introduced in the ghost cells in order to have the same number of unknowns and equations rows in a the number of free surface dirichlet conditions is equal to the number of ghost nodes for each ghost node the dirichlet condition is enforced in the point on the free surface with the same x coordinate as the node if it belongs to the background grid or with the same x b f coordinate if the node is defined in an overlapping grid if there are two ghost nodes with the same x or x b f coordinate this means that the boundary condition for the same point on the free surface is enforced twice however since the boundary conditions are enforced using different ghost cells a does not become singular if the free surface markers are modelled with a fully lagrangian formulation their positions will generally differ from the vertical grid lines whereas if the semi lagrangian formulation is used the markers by definition move along the grid lines in z or z b f direction from a robustness point of view it is found beneficial to enforce dirichlet conditions in the locations where the free surface intersects the vertical grid lines therefore in the fully lagrangian approach third order b splines are used to interpolate the free surface elevation and potential in points that are not wave body intersection points to the x or x b f coordinates of the grid nodes these points are referred to as evaluation points in fig 7 one may wonder why this is done instead of using eq 21 to enforce dirichlet conditions directly in the markers position indeed at a frozen time instant this is allowed as long as there are enough markers located inside each cell when attempting to use this approach in a simulation however free surface instabilities rapidly occur this is believed to be related to the fact that the accuracy of the numerical solution varies inside the cell as was documented in 2d by ma et al 2018 they showed that the error of the numerical representation of φ in a cell is small along the vertical grid line through the centre of the cell and with the b spline interpolation we are able to enforce boundary conditions for φ in these high accuracy locations it is found equally important that φ is estimated with eq 22 in the same points as where the dirichlet conditions for φ are enforced hence we use third order b splines also to interpolate the values of φ back to each of the markers where they are required in connection with the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions since the evaluation points coincide with the markers when the semi lagrangian formulation is used no b spline interpolation of free surface properties is necessary in this case as illustrated in fig 7 a when the semi lagrangian formulation is used each grid has its separate set of free surface markers markers that belong to the background grid inside one of the overlapping grids are in this case inactive with properties interpolated from the markers in the overlapping grid with this approach the free surface is a single continuous boundary no matter if the semi lagrangian or fully lagrangian description is used for nodes on the tank walls seabed wavemaker and surface piercing body neumann boundary conditions are enforced through eqs 22 and 25 for the moving wavemaker and body the equations are applied in body fixed reference frames the body has an arbitrary geometry and generally does not intersect nodes in the body fixed grid and is hence modelled as an immersed boundary in this boundary conditions are enforced in discrete points along the boundary using body boundary ghost cells that contain the points red shaded cells in fig 6 b the algorithm used to deal with body boundaries here is as follows first body boundary ghost nodes inside the body are selected for each of these the discrete point on the wetted part of the body closest to the ghost node is selected we make sure that the same point on the body boundary is not used several times which may lead to a singular matrix system finally we select the most appropriate ghost cell to be used to enforce the body boundary condition in the selected point a reasonable choice of ghost cells is found to be characterized by that the ghost cells overlap and that the majority of their area is outside the body using the ibm in the body fixed grid the procedure of identifying body boundary ghost cells only has to be performed once at the start of the simulation however during the simulation it may happen that the pre selected body boundary points come above the instantaneous free surface in this case the body boundary conditions related to these are instead enforced in body boundary points just below the free surface the green shaded cell in fig 6 b is denoted a double cell used to enforce the free surface dirichlet and body boundary neumann conditions in the wave body intersection point with coordinates x w b i z w b i simultaneously denoting the local node indices in this cell 1 8 a set of fictitious nodes 1 8 are introduced with the same locations the double cell contains a double node with local index k i e a replica of the node with local index k which is the green node in the example in fig 6 b using the node with index k and the cell with local node indices 1 8 we enforce free surface dirichlet conditions in the point x w b i z w b i through eqs 21 and 24 similarly we use the node with index k and the cell with indices 1 8 to enforce neumann conditions in x w b i z w b i through eqs 22 and 25 in addition we enforce φ i φ i and d b o φ i d t d b o φ i d t for i 1 8 i k the intention of the double cells is to introduce additional unknowns that enable us to enforce more than one boundary condition per wave body intersection point however it is noted that the results applying this technique are found to be in close agreement with the results obtained only applying free surface dirichlet conditions in x w b i z w b i for reasons that require a dedicated theoretical study that is not part of the present work it is also noted that the water velocity used in the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 is estimated using the double cells where the dirichlet free surface condition is enforced instead using the double cells where the neumann body boundary condition is enforced i e the cells with indices 1 8 may give some non physical spurious oscillations an obvious consequence of using ghost cells in fig 6 is that a numerical solution exists outside the physical domain it is important to point out that this solution has no physical meaning other than ensuring that the enforced boundary conditions are satisfied coupling between grids continuity of the solution between the background grid and the overlapping grids is ensured through an implicit two way coupling for φ this is provided by using eq 21 while for its time derivative equation 27 is used to account for the mixed reference frames the coupling is illustrated in fig 8 in selecting cells used to interpolate the solution between the grids care is taken to avoid recurrence recurrence here means that a cell in the background grid used to interpolate the solution in an overlapping grid contains nodes that have their solution interpolated from the overlapping grid and vice versa an effective way to avoid this is to let the red nodes in fig 8 a be some minimum distance away from the red nodes in b this distance should at least be equal to the largest grid spacing in any of the two grids a consequence of the ibm and the coupling between grids is that a changes with time because the number of nodes in the computational domain and their associated equations vary with time consequently a must be built every time step as it will later be discussed in connection with fig 14 this operation amounts to a large portion of the overall computational time an example of a is given in fig 9 although some non zero off diagonal entries exist due to coupling between the different grids the matrix is diagonally dominated and the global matrix equations can be efficiently solved by iterative solvers for sparse matrix systems in the present work a bicgstab solver with tolerance 5 1 0 9 is used with a splu decomposition of a as pre conditioner this solver is part of the scipy python library and gives stable and efficient solutions of the global matrix equations integration of pressure when φ and its time derivative are obtained from the solution of the hydrodynamic bvps the pressure is computed using the body fixed version of the bernoulli equation 14 in a set of discrete points on the body boundary the body boundary is here parametrized by a tangential coordinate s in anti clockwise direction forces and moment are obtained by integrating the pressure over the instantaneous wetted body surface s 0 s s 1 28 f b f t s 0 s 1 p s t n b f s d s 29 m y t j s 0 s 1 p s t p b f s n b f s d s p b f s represents the body fixed coordinates of the point with tangential coordinate s relative to the centre of gravity a negative sign appears in front of the integrals because the normal vector n b f is defined outwards m y is independent of reference frame in 2d while the force vector can be expressed in the inertial reference frame as f λ b i f b f in the case of a freely floating body the body motions are coupled with the fluid dynamic problem this is highlighted by the fact that the pressure forces and moments are needed to estimate the body accelerations from the equations of motion 10 12 but at the same time the pressure depends on the time derivative of φ that is obtained by solving a bvp where the same accelerations give the body boundary conditions this principally means that the body accelerations appear in both sides of the equations of motion this coupling is handled here through the iterative scheme illustrated in fig 10 where the vector θ contains the translational and angular accelerations in the body fixed reference frame the input to each iteration loop is a guess of θ denoted as θ 0 initially estimated using backward finite difference the iteration is terminated when the error ϵ having the dimension of the acceleration term with the largest individual error is less than some predefined value ϵ t o l the reason for using an absolute rather than a relative error as termination criterion is that the latter may lead to a slow convergence or even divergence when the accelerations are close to zero with ϵ t o l 1 0 3 which is found to be a reasonable value for the cases considered here the number of iterations is typically in the order of five the iteration scheme is efficient since it is only performed at the end of every physical time step and because it introduces no changes to the coefficient matrix a or its pre conditioner matrix only the elements in the right hand side vector b φ t corresponding to body boundary conditions for d b o φ d t require updating alternatively the coupling between the body motions and the fluid dynamic problem can be handled intrinsically without iteration for example with the mode decomposition and indirect methods used by koo and kim 2004 or the implicit method proposed by tanizawa 1995 however these methods were developed for bem solvers with collocation points distributed over the body surface and using these techniques in the ibogm is likely related with challenges taking the implicit method as an example this requires that the integrals in eqs 28 29 are implicitly written into a in a modified coefficient matrix a since a a the same pre conditioner matrix cannot be used as in the bvp for φ and the additional terms written into a reduce the sparsity compared to a these two aspects may contribute adversely to the computational efficiency moreover including the boundary integrals over the surface of the body in a is expected to influence the numerical stability in an ibm especially when the rigid body motions are large to robustly include such non iterative methods in the ibogm therefore requires a dedicated effort and is not pursued in the present work the convergence of the iterative body acceleration scheme is investigated in fig 11 for one of the most numerically challenging freely floating body cases that will be discussed in section 4 4 here the surge motion obtained using 45 time steps per incident wave period is in good agreement with results using 90 time steps per wave period this is also the case for the heave and roll motions and 45 time steps per wave period therefore give sufficiently converged results for this case the average number of iterations n i t e r is around eight with the largest time step δ t n i t e r is reduced when δ t is reduced which indicates that the iterative scheme performs as intended when the time step is reduced we expect smaller inconsistencies between the body accelerations and pressure loads requiring fewer iterations f b f and m y in eqs 28 29 are part of the external loads in the right hand sides of the equations of motion 10 and 12 the external force vector also includes the vertical gravity force and possibly stiffness and linear damping forces 30 f b f e x t f b f λ i b m g k λ i b b l r 0 c r 0 where b l is a linear damping matrix c is a stiffness matrix and r 0 η 1 i η 3 k η 1 and η 3 are sway and heave motions in the inertial coordinate system where i and k are unit vectors along the x and z axes respectively the external moment may include linear and quadratic roll damping 31 m y e x t m y b η 5 l η 5 b η 5 q η 5 η 5 where b η 5 l and b η 5 q are linear and quadratic damping coefficients and η 5 is the roll motion in radians special treatment of wave body intersection points using markers to track the free surface evolution it is important to prevent that the markers on wave body intersection points separate from the body boundary especially when the body geometry is non vertical in the free surface region this is ensured by reformulating the fully lagrangian version of the kinematic free surface condition 15 in the tangential coordinate s defined in connection with eqs 28 29 32 d s d t σ z φ u b here u b is the velocity of the body surface in the marker location given by eq 6 and σ z is the component in the z b f direction of a sign function defined as s i g n φ u b if the intersection point is on the left side of the body and as s i g n φ u b on the right side of the body since the wave body intersection points are managed in the body fixed reference frame φ u b expresses the velocity magnitude of the wave body intersecting marker relative to this frame the argument allowing us to use eq 32 is that since neumann conditions enforcing zero relative normal velocity between the water and body are applied in the wave body intersection points the markers trajectories by definition have to be tangential to the surface in some scenarios such as when the semi submerged circular cylinder discussed later is forced to oscillate at a high frequency in heave small angles between the free surface and the body surface can occur if these angles become too small they may cause numerical instabilities to promote numerical robustness a jet cutting scheme is therefore invoked when either the interior or exterior angle between free surface s and body boundary s tangents become less than 5 the jet cutting scheme is illustrated in fig 12 marker 1 is removed marker 2 is projected normally onto the body and a new marker is introduced between marker 2 and 3 the markers are then redistributed to ensure equal horizontal spacing the markers before and after the jet cutting are denoted 1 5 and 1 5 respectively reduction of free surface instabilities especially when using the fully lagrangian formulation of eq 15 instabilities may develop on the free surface to prevent this the third order five point filter used by sun 2007 is applied to the free surface elevation and velocity potential after every complete time step in addition the fully lagrangian markers are redistributed with even horizontal spacing so that they do not cluster together with the semi lagrangian formulation of eq 15 hanssen et al 2018 found that a weaker twelfth order savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 is sufficient wave generation and absorption waves are generated with a moving physical wavemaker of either a piston or flap type where the former is typically used to generate shallow water waves and the latter to generate waves in intermediate and deep water a temporal ramp function r w m t defined as 0 5 1 cos π t t r a m p if t t r a m p and 1 0 otherwise is introduced to avoid numerical instabilities due to an impulsive start of the wavemaker t r a m p is the ramp function s duration typically taken between three and five times the characteristic wave period considering a flap wavemaker with steady state angular motion α w m t the flap signal used in a simulation is thus α w m t α w m t r w m t waves are absorbed at numerical beaches modelled through the damping coefficient ν x t in eq 15 because reflected and radiated waves do not decay with distance in 2d dissipation zones are necessary both towards the wavemaker upwave and the tank wall in the opposite downwave side the purpose of the upwave beach is to dissipate waves propagating back towards the wavemaker and φ r e f and ζ r e f in eq 15 are hence estimated from linear wavemaker theory see e g dean and dalrymple 1991 it was demonstrated by hanssen 2019 that this approach gives satisfactory results meaning that the fully nonlinear solution is retained a short distance away from the beach an advantage of using linear theory is that both regular and irregular waves can be accounted for in a straightforward manner the purpose of the downwave beach is to prevent any wave reflections from the tank wall hence φ r e f and ζ r e f are equal to zero for this beach ν x t can be decomposed into a spatial and temporal contribution ν x t ν x δ t 0 where δ t 0 is a step function which is zero for t t 0 and 1 for t t 0 t 0 is zero for the downwave beach and is chosen larger than the time when transient waves associated with start up of the wavemaker have propagated out of the beach for the upwave beach ν x follows the definition in greco 2001 33 ν x 0 x x 0 ν m a x 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 x 0 x x 1 downwave ν m a x 1 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 x 0 x x 1 upwave ν m a x x x 1 where ν m a x is an empirically chosen coefficient x 0 and x 1 are the start and endpoints respectively of the beach ξ is an auxiliary normalized coordinate defined as ξ x x 0 l b e a c h where l b e a c h x 1 x 0 is the beach length as a general guidance l b e a c h can be taken as two times the characteristic wavelength reasonable values for ν m a x are generally found to be in the range 2 4 s 1 if l b e a c h is too short this may require a large ν m a x which can lead to wave reflections from the beach itself schematic summary of solution algorithm the flowchart in fig 13 illustrates the main steps involved in evolving the numerical solution from the known state at time t n to the unknown state at t n 1 t n δ t for a freely floating body case δ t is here the constant time step for a general solution variable y with time derivative given in the form y y y t the rk4 time integration scheme can be expressed as 34 y n 1 y n δ t 6 k 1 y 2 k 2 y 2 k 3 y k 4 y with coefficients k i y i 1 4 35 k 1 y y y n t n k 2 y y y n 0 5 δ t k 1 y t n 0 5 δ t k 3 y y y n 0 5 δ t k 2 y t n 0 5 δ t k 4 y y y n δ t k 3 y t n δ t in fig 13 the vectors φ and φ t contain the velocity potential and its time derivative in all active grid nodes these are obtained from solving the global matrix equations corresponding to the hydrodynamic bvps φ and x contain the velocity potential and position of all free surface markers the time derivatives of these are estimated from the dynamic and kinematic free surface conditions 15 if the semi lagrangian versions of the free surface conditions are used only the vertical components in x are involved in the rk4 scheme if instead the fully lagrangian versions of the free surface conditions are used the markers are redistributed with even spacing in horizontal direction after each complete rk4 cycle the vector θ r 0 α contains the translational and angular rigid body motions and the double time derivative of θ i e the rigid body accelerations are estimated from the equations of motion an asterisk indicates the state of a variable or matrix after one of the three fictitious euler steps involved in the rk4 scheme for each physical time step four hydrodynamic bvps must be solved for φ together with 4 n i t e r bvps for the time derivative of φ computational effort the computational effort involved in the different parts of the ibogm is discussed using one of the freely floating body cases that will be presented in section 4 4 as example as fig 14 shows building the global matrix equation for φ accounts for more than 20 of the total cpu time the majority of this time is spent to generate a since the size and topology of a inevitably change with time in the ibogm recognizing that the majority of a is populated by entries of the connectivity eq 23 a useful technique that has been used here to limit the time spent constructing a is to initially generate a reservoir coefficient matrix a where eq 23 is inserted for all grid nodes except for those that are on boundaries at any given time relevant parts of a are copied into the correct locations in a without this technique the time to construct a increases notably generating the right hand side vector for the global matrix equation of the time derivative of φ amounts to a little more than 10 of the total cpu time it is noted that this vector is not entirely rebuilt for each of the cycles in the iterative scheme in fig 10 only the entries for body boundary ghost nodes are updated when a new body acceleration is estimated the time used by the iterative matrix solver including generation of pre conditioner matrices amounts to more than 25 of the total time while estimating and integrating the pressure over the wetted body surface amounts to a little less than 10 of the total cpu time since the pressure has to be integrated in each loop of the iterative scheme in fig 10 this time is significantly reduced if the body has prescribed motions moreover it is expected that the time can be further reduced by optimizing the reuse of hpc expressions that do not change during the iterations the remaining tasks in the other group in fig 14 include writing post processing files transforming coordinates between different coordinate systems and more it is expected that the method s cpu time can be further reduced and this will be increasingly important when extending from 2d to 3d 4 validation and verification validation and verification studies comparing results against experimental numerical and theoretical reference results are presented hereafter first the solver s ability to propagate waves with nonlinear characteristics are considered thereafter cases with rigid bodies 1 forced to oscillate in still water radiation and 2 kept fixed in incident waves diffraction are investigated finally all aspects of the solver are combined for a freely floating body in incident waves full wave body interaction 4 1 wave propagation the solver s ability to propagate waves with different nonlinear features such as steep waves in deep water wave wave interaction and solitary waves in shallow water and a focused plunging wave was documented by hanssen et al 2018 an additional study considering waves with steepness close to a breaking criterion is presented here for completeness the basis is the experiments performed by baarholm 2001 with periodic steep waves to study wave impacts on deck structures with low clearance to the still water level the experiments were carried out in a wave flume 13 5 m long 0 6 m wide and with a water depth h equal to 1 0 m the wave elevation was measured in a single wave probe that we here assume was located in the middle of the tank although baarholm states that the location of the wave probe sometimes was changed between cases the three cases denoted d03 003 n30 004 and n30 008 in baarholm 2001 with characteristics given in table 1 are considered where k ζ c is a measure of the crest steepness the table includes half the breaking wave height h b given by the following criterion in mei et al 2005 36 h b λ 0 14 tanh k h this assumes that a wave breaks when the horizontal particle velocity in the crest exceeds the phase speed of the wave although ζ c differs from 0 5 h b for nearly breaking waves the breaking criterion indicates that especially the case n30 004 is close to wave breaking the waves in the experiments were generated by a flap type wavemaker hinged 0 1 m above the seabed however neither the stroke nor the ramp period of the wavemaker are known and have to be assumed we here use a ramp time of 5 s while the wavemaker s angular stroke s w m a is approximated using linear wavemaker theory resulting in the following s w m a values 3 209 for d03 003 3 638 for n30 004 and 4 498 for n03 008 the time step δ t and grid spacing δ x δ z are set to 0 02 s and 0 05 m respectively for all three cases similar grid spacings are used in the stationary background grid and in the body fixed grid moving with the wavemaker this gives at least 30 time steps per wave period and at least 31 grid points per wavelength the length of the wave tank is increased to 16 5 m in the numerical analysis to allow for a 6 m long numerical beach with damping coefficient ν m a x 2 0 s 1 at the opposite side of the wavemaker the free surface markers are semi lagrangian i e only allowed to move in vertical direction the wave elevation in the probe located 6 25 m from the position of the wavemaker at rest is compared with the experimental results in fig 15 for the cases in table 1 given the uncertainty related to the wavemaker signal and the probe position used in the experiments the agreement is deemed satisfactory the largest deviations are observed for the case with ζ c closest to 0 5 h b n30 004 which may partly be explained by that modelling such steep wave is challenging both experimentally and numerically 4 2 forced heave motions of a semi submerged circular cylinder in still water the forced harmonic heave motion of a half submerged circular cylinder in still water studied experimentally by tasai and koterayama 1976 and numerically by sun 2007 is considered this case is characterized by two numerically challenging nonlinear features 1 the body has non vertical geometry where it intersects the free surface and 2 local nonlinear wave behaviour develops close to the body for high oscillation frequencies it is noted that the main results for the heaving cylinder has already been documented in hanssen et al 2017 the cylinder has radius r 0 1 m and the heave motion is given as η 3 t ϵ η 3 r sin ω t where ϵ η 3 η 3 a r and ω are the non dimensional heave amplitude and the angular oscillation frequency respectively from the time series of the vertical force f 3 t the heave added mass and damping coefficients a 33 and b 33 can be estimated as follows sun 2007 37 a 33 b 3 1 c 33 η 3 a ω 2 η 3 a 38 b 33 a 3 1 ω η 3 a the hydrostatic restoring coefficient is defined as c 33 ρ g d with ρ the water density g the acceleration of gravity and d 2 r the cylinder s diameter the fourier coefficients in eqs 37 38 follow by expanding the heave force signal in a fourier series 39 f 3 t f 3 0 n 1 f 3 n sin n ω t δ n where f 3 n and δ n are the n th order force amplitude and phase angle respectively the force amplitudes are estimated as 40 f 3 0 1 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t d t a 3 0 f 3 n sin δ n 2 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t cos n ω t d t a 3 n f 3 n cos δ n 2 m t t 0 t 0 m t f 3 t sin n ω t d t b 3 n n 1 where t 2 π ω is the oscillation period and m 1 is the number of full oscillation periods used in the estimation taken so that f 3 t has steady state behaviour for t 0 t t 0 m t the mean force f 3 0 and the second order force amplitude f 3 2 are defined as 41 f 3 0 a 3 0 ρ g s 0 and 42 f 3 2 a 3 2 2 b 3 2 2 where s 0 0 5 π r 2 is the mean submerged area of the cylinder eight non dimensional oscillation frequencies 0 20 ω 2 r g 1 61 are analysed for a single heave amplitude ϵ η 3 0 2 the computational domain is symmetric about the vertical axis through the cylinder centre fig 16 the length of the numerical domain is l t a n k 10 λ where 0 39 m λ 3 15 m is the wavelength for the radiated waves estimated from the deep water dispersion relation the same water depth h 1 50 m is used for all frequencies numerical beaches with length 2 λ are used towards the tank walls on both sides of the cylinder to prevent wave reflections the free surface is described using the hybrid formulation of the free surface conditions 15 where the free surface markers at the wave body intersection points move in a fully lagrangian manner and thus never separate from the body surface while the markers in the background grid are semi lagrangian and thus restricted to move in parallel with the inertial z axis the spacing between free surface markers in the body fixed grid is significantly smaller than in the stationary background grid where the markers are distributed so that their horizontal positions coincide with those of the grid nodes the dimension of the overlapping body fixed grid equal in both directions is 20 r for the lowest and 5 r for the highest frequency all grids are uniform with square cells where the grid spacing in the background grid is taken as δ x δ z λ 18 in the body fixed grid δ x b f δ z b f is taken between r 9 and r 5 where the former is required for the most challenging high frequency cases and the latter is considered a minimum to give a proper description of the cylinder s geometry in the ibm the time step is taken in the range t 200 δ t t 55 where the smallest time step was required for the highest frequency ω 2 r g 1 61 for this frequency large free surface curvatures develop close to the wave body intersection points so that the jet cutting scheme is activated the main simulation parameters are summarized in table 2 the added mass and damping coefficients and the mean and second order forces derived with the present ibogm method are compared with reference results from various sources in fig 17 the theoretical results for a 33 and b 33 are derived by tasai and koterayama 1976 with a linear theory while the theoretical results for f 3 0 and f 3 2 are computed by papanikolaou 1980 using a second order theory the experimental results are by tasai and koterayama 1976 while the results by sun 2007 are obtained from a nonlinear boundary element method bem all the reference results are extracted from plots in sun 2007 the ibogm results for a 33 b 33 and f 3 2 are in good agreement with the references and especially with the numerical results by sun for f 3 0 where it should be noted that there is some scatter in the experimental data and that the values are small some differences can be observed the case with ω 2 r g 1 61 found to be the most numerically challenging case due to large free surface curvatures close to the cylinder is further examined the time series of the heave force on the cylinder containing higher order harmonics is compared with results from the analysis by sun in fig 18 the two curves are generally consistent and the differences observed in the troughs are considered acceptable comparing two different methods for a numerically challenging case the free surface elevation close to the cylinder at six different time instants throughout an oscillation cycle for ω 2 r g 1 61 is compared with sun s results obtained through personal communication in fig 19 consistent behaviour between the two solvers are observed both close to the wave body intersection points and further away from the cylinder indicating that the present numerical modelling of the flow at the wave body intersection points is physically sound even with significant local nonlinear behaviour of the free surface 4 3 a fixed 2d ship section in regular waves a 2d ship section in beam sea regular waves was studied experimentally by nojiri and murayama 1975 in japanese and later numerically by tanizawa et al 1999 the ship section has breadth b 0 50 m draught h 0 25 m and bilge radius 0 064 m since the present analysis is performed in 2d we define the fictitious length of the ship section in y direction as l s 1 0 m the incident periodic waves are characterized by their non dimensional wave frequency ξ b ω 2 b 2 g k b 2 and a linear amplitude ζ a 0 5 h with h the wave height here ω is the angular wave frequency g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wave number as given by the linear dispersion relation assuming deep water conditions the associated wavelength is λ 2 π k the waves included for the fixed ship section are defined in table 3 all simulations are performed for 20 t where t 2 π ω is the wave period a sketch of the numerical wave tank used in the analysis is shown in fig 20 the length of the tank l t a n k is equal to 8 λ and the depth h λ i e deep water conditions the ship section is located in the middle of the tank with numerical beaches with length l b e a c h 2 λ located on both sides the beach on the wavemaker side uses linear wavemaker theory as reference solution the incident waves are generated with a rotating flap type wavemaker hinged a distance 0 5 h from the seabed the wavemaker strokes required to obtain the waves specified in table 3 are estimated using linear wavemaker theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and the duration of the ramp function is 4 t for all cases in table 3 a time step δ t t 45 is used in the background grid and the body fixed grid following the motion of the wavemaker the uniform grid spacings are λ 25 in the square ship section fixed grid that has sides at least 2 5 b long the grid spacing is taken as the minimum between b 12 and λ 25 as an example the grids used in the simulation with ξ b 0 25 are shown in fig 21 for this case λ is much larger than b hence the grid spacing in the ship section fixed grid is much smaller than in the background grid transfer functions for the mean wave drift force in sway x direction and first order wave loads in sway heave and roll are presented in fig 22 the ibogm results are compared to linear and experimental results by nojiri and murayama 1975 and nonlinear bem results by tanizawa et al 1999 for the mean wave drift force the theoretical curve is derived by nojiri and murayama 1975 from a second order theory the mean wave drift forces by tanizawa et al 1999 and in the ibogm analyses are obtained from direct pressure integration dpi several methods to estimate the mean wave drift force have been systematically compared where it is concluded that dpi is the most accurate the details of this comparison being outside the scope of the present paper will be documented in a future publication the ibogm transfer functions are obtained from a fourier analysis over the last four wave periods of the force time histories where steady state behaviour is ensured the wave height used in the experiments is not known however for the freely floating scenario results for wave heights 3 5 and 7 cm are presented it is thus reasonable to assume that the experiments presented for the fixed body are performed with one of these the first order wave loads obtained with the ibogm for both h 1 cm and h 7 cm are generally consistent with the reference results for the largest wave frequencies some scatter is seen in the experimental results which may be due to wave nonlinearity experimental uncertainty or a combination of the two the roll moments presented by tanizawa et al 1999 are consistently slightly larger than the linear experimental and ibogm values the first order wave loads show little sensitivity to the wave height for the mean wave drift force the ibogm results are consistent with the second order theory up to ξ b 1 0 but give lower values above this frequency the difference increases with increasing wave height indicating higher than second order effects the same behaviour is qualitatively observed in the experimental results tanizawa et al 1999 present larger mean wave drift forces than the ibogm for ξ b 1 0 but with the same qualitative ξ b dependence the reason for this difference is not fully understood but the fact that tanizawa et al 1999 use a nwt with l t a n k 6 λ instead of 8 λ as used here may contribute moreover it is understood that tanizawa et al 1999 generate waves at a fixed control surface using linear wave theory instead of using a physical wavemaker which may induce an artificial steady stokes type drift shao 2010 4 4 a freely floating 2d ship section in regular waves the same 2d ship section as considered in the previous section is analysed here as freely floating for the largest wave height in table 3 the ship section has mass m 125 kg roll inertia i y y 4 0145 kg m 2 and the vertical centre of gravity is k g 0 135 m from the keel a linear sway damping b 22 l 19 8 n s 1 and sway stiffness c 22 197 58 n m 1 acting in the body s centre of gravity are included with the remaining damping and stiffness terms set to zero all parameters are taken from tanizawa et al 1999 the damping and stiffness forces relate to motion in the inertial reference frame the simulations length is 60 t i e three times longer than for the fixed ship section this is because transient motions are slowly decaying so that it takes longer to reach approximately steady state conditions the duration of the wavemaker ramp function is also here 4 t the time step and grid spacings are similar to those used for the fixed ship section the ibogm results are verified against analyses performed with the nonlinear potential flow bem solver developed by greco 2001 using a nwt with identical dimensions and set up as fig 20 waves are generated with the same flap type wavemaker using identical wavemaker signals and the damping and stiffness coefficients are the same as used in the present ibogm analysis also the bem solves an auxiliary bvp for the time derivative of φ the main difference between the two simulations is that the time step in the bem analyses is half of that in the ibogm analyses which was necessary in order to ensure numerical stability and that the bvps for φ and its time derivative are solved in an earth fixed reference frame in the bem solver the bem analysis is therefore considered as an independent verification of the ibogm analysis using a similar numerical set up but a fundamentally different numerical method transfer functions for the mean wave drift force in sway and first order motions in sway heave and roll are compared in fig 23 the ibogm and bem transfer functions are obtained from an identical fourier analysis of the last 10 t of the simulation time series the plots include motions from a linear analysis by koo and kim 2004 and mean wave drift force from a second order theory by the same authors away from the heave and roll resonance frequencies around ξ b 0 5 both solvers produce motions in good agreement with the linear results significant differences from linear results are observed moving towards resonance frequencies indicating non negligible nonlinear effects with roll amplitudes of approximately 30 close to resonance the simulations are numerically challenging and the consistency between the two nonlinear numerical methods are therefore encouraging the mean wave drift force in both the ibogm and bem analyses deviate from the theoretical curve for the steepest waves which is consistent with the behaviour for the fixed ship section in fig 22 close to the resonance frequency region the ibogm gives slightly larger drift forces than the bem since the mean wave drift force is sensitive to the relative motion between the structure and waves it is suggested that this may be related to the slight difference in heave motions observed in the frequency range 0 5 ξ b 0 7 the reason for these differences are not further explored but it should be noted that the heave and roll motions are large and the motions and loads in the different degrees of freedom are coupled with each other the ibogm and bem analyses for the challenging case with ξ b 0 5 can be further examined by comparing motion and load time series in fig 24 showing that the roll moments and motions are visually in excellent agreement consistent with the transfer functions in fig 23 the ibogm gives slightly larger heave amplitudes while the sway forces differ mainly in the troughs although not easy to observe the average sway force over the ten last wave periods i e the mean wave drift force is slightly larger for the ibogm than for the bem a fourier analysis shows that these differences are mainly of third order to finalize the verification fig 25 shows an analysis of the wave elevation close to the ship section and the dynamic pressure distribution over the instantaneous wetted surface for ten different time instants towards the end of the simulations the time series of the sway force is included in each sub plot with the exact time instant of the snapshot indicated one should note that because there is a slight difference in when data are written to file in the ibogm and bem analyses the two simulations are not fully synchronized in all of the sub plots however for sub plots b g and i where the time instants approximately coincide the results are in good agreement although there are local differences in the pressure distribution and the wave elevation the instantaneous positions of the ship section and the sway forces are similar one should keep in mind that these snapshots are taken towards the end of the simulations for a challenging case with roll motions up to 30 where one may anticipate that inconsistencies between the two solvers would have escalated the fact that the two distinctly different solvers give consistent results strengthens the confidence in the ibogm 5 conclusions a numerical wave tank nwt for nonlinear wave and wave rigid body interactions in 2d using potential flow theory has been presented the modelling techniques are developed with future extension to 3d in mind the harmonic polynomial cell hpc method which is a higher order accurate and efficient field method using overlapping cells is employed to solve the laplace equations for the velocity potential and its time derivative an immersed boundary method ibm is proposed to model the free surface and body boundaries and is combined with using overlapping grids following the motion of rigid bodies the combined method representing a novel extension to the hpc method was denoted as an immersed boundary overlapping grid method ibogm a consequence of using immersed boundaries is that we operate with ghost nodes and ghost cells where a numerical solution exists in the part of the ghost cells outside the water region the solution in these regions has no physical meaning the ibogm has the following main advantages 1 boundary fitted grids that may be cumbersome to generate for complex boundaries and that must be updated every time the boundaries move are avoided 2 cartesian grids with square cells can be used throughout which is important to maximize the accuracy in the hpc method 3 the solution may be refined locally by increasing the density of overlapping grids without increasing the number of unknowns unnecessarily the following validation and verification cases were presented 1 propagation of regular waves with steepness up to the theoretical breaking limit 2 forced harmonic heave motion of a semi submerged circular cylinder in still water and a 2d ship section with a small bilge radius 3 fixed and 4 freely floating in beam sea regular waves 1 3 consider wave propagation wave radiation and wave diffraction separately whereas in 4 all effects are combined the results from the present analysis agreed well with experimental theoretical and numerical reference results in particular for the freely floating 2d ship section results were systematically compared with a dedicated independent analysis performed with a fully nonlinear boundary element method bem code the comparison included challenging scenarios with resonant roll motions up to 30 the two analyses gave generally consistent loads and motions both indicating significant nonlinear coupling effects near heave and roll resonance both analyses gave mean sway wave drift forces smaller than second order theory for steep waves close to heave and roll resonance slightly different wave drift forces were observed between the two analyses however the differences were considered acceptable since the wave drift forces are sensitive to the first order motions that were large in this frequency range the cases presented in this paper indicate that the proposed ibogm method handles wave and wave rigid body interaction effects accurately it is therefore considered well suited for further examination of nonlinear wave body interaction effects credit authorship contribution statement finn

20876,elevated pile caps are always located close to the still water level where breaking waves can induce great impact loads and threaten the structural stability of bridges this paper focuses on the interaction between breaking waves and an elevated pile cap with a rectangular cross section an elevated cap specimen under three breaking wave conditions was employed in the experimental program the breaking wave loads including the resulting horizontal and vertical loads overturning moments and water pressures exerted on the specimen were measured simultaneously the effects of clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave loads were investigated and a probabilistic description of breaking wave load was presented the results show that with increasing clearance the horizontal breaking wave load and overturning moment increased while the vertical load decreased when the specimen was above the still water level the maximum horizontal wave load was observed when the specimen was located at the breaker tongue of the wave crest the magnitude of the maximum horizontal and vertical load varied with structural orientations of the elevated pile cap gev distribution is effective in modeling the stochastic maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load keywords elevated pile cap breaking wave loads rectangular cross section clearance breaker location structural orientation 1 introduction with economic development population expansion and resource exploitation in coastal zones large and long bridges serving as backbones by connecting coastal communities are constantly emerging many experimental and numerical efforts have been made to investigate the wave loads on such bridges cuomo et al 2009 seiffert et al 2014 guo et al 2015a fang et al 2019 qu et al 2020 these studies investigated the wave loads on different types of bridge decks under regular solitary cnoidal or oblique waves however for structures located in tropical cyclone prone oceans the threat of breaking waves on structural safety cannot be neglected hallowell et al 2016 breaking waves are a kind of wave whose amplitude reaches a critical level at which the breaker tongues can suddenly occur and transform large amounts of wave energy into turbulent kinetic energy liang et al 2017 cuomo et al 2010 reviewed previous studies and stated that breaking wave impact loads could be ten times that of nonbreaking wave loads the breaking waves generated by typhoon soudelor in 2015 caused severe damage to a steel trestle fig 1 a which has previously been used to construct an elevated pile cap for a sea crossing bridge wei et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study breaking wave loads on bridge structures wave deck interactions were the primary concern of earlier investigations of wave loading on bridges serinaldi and cuomo 2011 xu et al 2017 huang et al 2018b however chella et al 2012 provided an overview of the recent research on breaking wave loads and concluded that breaking waves yield the highest hydrodynamic loads on substructures pile groups are commonly used to support sea crossing bridges due to their structural efficiency low cost and ease of construction ti et al 2020 as a rigid transition piece for pile groups elevated pile caps are set to connect piles with piers or pylons and are located close to the still water level swl as shown in fig 1b wei et al 2020 the authors conducted a wave flume experimental program to investigate nonbreaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap of a pile foundation and highlighted that the wave slamming loads occurred when the bottom of the cap was located above the swl xu et al 2020 compared with nonbreaking waves the slamming loads induced by breaking waves are not only more intense but also representing a complex hydrodynamic obstacle with a highly stochastic nature oumeraci h et al 1993 cuomo et al 2010 park et al 2017 2018 conducted a large scale physical experiment and subsequent numerical simulations to explore the breaking wave loads impacting an elevated specimen with a square cross section which is like an elevated pile cap they summarized the relationships between the breaking wave loads and the wave height period structure air gap and wave type moreover since the decks of coastal bridges are long banded structures most experimental and numerical studies on waves in deck assume that the wave direction is perpendicular to the structure and are conducted two dimensionally cox and ortega 2002 huang and xiao 2009 guo et al 2015b qin et al 2017 xu et al 2018 elevated pile caps always have a square rectangular or other complex shaped cross section zhang et al 2020 a review of the previous literature related to breaking wave loads on vertical cylinders shows that the geometry of the structural front significantly affects the breaking wave loads acting on a structure sawaragi and nochino 1984 chan and melville 1989 if there was a misalignment between the structural orientation and the wave direction the structural front of the rectangular pile cap would change accordingly although api 2000 recommended including the directional effect in the estimation of wave loads on decks the impact of misalignments between structural orientation and wave direction on breaking wave loads has not been well addressed shen et al 2020 there is no consensus on the relationship between breaking wave loads and wave directions given the threats of breaking waves and challenges of understanding the associated loads on elevated pile caps a wave flume experimental program was conducted at southwest jiaotong university as a continuation of the authors previous work xu et al 2020 the interaction between breaking waves and elevated pile caps with rectangular cross sections is investigated as follows the approach for the generation of breaking wave conditions and the experimental setup are introduced in section 2 the experimental results including the characteristic horizontal and vertical loads overturning moments and water pressure on the specimen are summarized and analyzed in section 3 section 4 investigates the effects of cap base clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave loads on an elevated cap specimen then a probability assessment is carried out to describe the stochastic breaking wave load finally the major conclusions of this work are remarked and some prospects are put forward 2 setup of breaking wave flume tests 2 1 generation of breaking waves in the flume the laboratory experiments were carried out in a wave flume at southwest jiaotong university as illustrated in fig 2 the details of the wave flume can be found in the authors previous work xu et al 2020 in the flume the x axis defines the longitudinal direction of the flume the y axis defines the width of the flume and the z axis defines the vertical direction to achieve the goal of this paper the first task is to generate a reliable breaking wave in the flume there are two conventional methods used to generate wave breaking in the flume one is to set a bottom slope in the flume to form a shallow terrain along the wave propagation direction ippen and kulin 1954 galvin 1968 iwagaki and sakai 1972 nadaoka et al 1989 the other method referred to as wave focusing is to generate a wave packet composed of regular waves of different frequencies focused at the desired location in the flume kjeldsen and myrhaug 1980 rapp and melville 1990 kway et al 1998 liang et al 2017 at the focusing point the wave becomes very steep due to the superpositions of waves and breaking wave subsequently occurs the former method can continuously generate breaking waves however the flume would need to be remodeled since the flume at southwest jiaotong university is a flat bottom flume the latter can generate breaking waves without any modifications to the flume bottom and is hence chosen here to generate the breaking waves for convenience and save labor related expenses a wave train which contained waves of different frequencies was generated by a piston wavemaker in the experiments the wavemaker made the waves of various celerity focus at the same location simultaneously according to the linear wave theory the free surface elevation can be expressed as the result of the superposition of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies 1 η x t i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t where ω 2 π t is the wave frequency t is the wave period a is the amplitude of the generated wave k is the wavenumber t is time and n is the number of wave components ω and k satisfy the wave dispersion relation as follows 2 ω 2 k g tanh k d where d is the water depth and g is the acceleration of gravity to generate a breaking wave at a distance of x from the wavemaker the wave frequency ω should be calculated as a function of time t i e ω ω t therefore the essential aspect of determining the motion signal of the wavemaker that generates a breaking wave is to determine the variation in frequency over time the wave energy spreads at the group velocity 3 c g 1 2 n c where c is the phase velocity of the wave and n is a coefficient presented in the linear theory 4 c ω k 5 n 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d assuming that the minimum period of a wave that the wavemaker can generate is t 0 the time for that wave to travel the distance of x m is t 0 6 t 0 x c g 0 2 x n 0 c 0 in which the subscript 0 represents the parameters corresponding to a wave with the minimum period t 0 for the subsequent waves generated with period t at moment t to arrive at the same location the time it takes for the wave to travel a distance of x m is t 0 t 7 t 0 t x c g 2 x n c substituting eq 4 into eq 7 the frequency of the wave generated at moment t can be obtained as follows 8 ω t 2 k x n t 0 t in the practice of generating breaking waves the minimum period t 0 is determined according to the capability of the wavemaker the frequency of the wave at moment t is derived from eq 8 considering the dispersion relationship between the wave frequency and wavenumber eq 8 is solved using the iterative method 2 2 experimental model and devices the test specimen is a 1 90 reduced scale model of the prototype cap it has been used in the authors previous work xu et al 2020 and is made of acrylic material with young s modulus of 3 gpa the dimensions of the specimen are 26 67 cm along the x axis 40 cm along the y axis and 15 cm along the z axis the thickness of the specimen wall is 0 8 cm the mass of the specimen is 5 35 kg the blockage ratio of the specimen to the flume width is equal to 0 2 which is lower than 0 4 and has little influence on the downstream flow velocities according to nouri et al 2010 four wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz were positioned in the flume to measure water surface transformations as shown in fig 2 wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 were arranged in front of the specimen with an interval distance of 1 m the distance between wg3 and the front face of the specimen was 0 40 m wg4 was installed on the left of the specimen front edge the four gauges were carefully calibrated during preliminary testing which demonstrated that they all made synchronous and accurate recordings under the control of the same computer as illustrated in fig 3 a the installed experimental model consists of three parts specimen alloy arm and supporting system the specimen and the supporting system were connected by a 0 32 m long alloy arm with a solid circular cross section of 0 04 m in diameter the young s modulus and density of the alloy material are 71 gpa and 2600 kg m3 respectively the bending stiffness of the alloy arm is 8 9 kn m2 since the arm diameter is much smaller than the specimen size the wave impact on the arm can be ignored the supporting system includes the f t force and torque transducer and service bridge the f t transducer is far above the crest of the wave to eliminate the unexpected interaction between the water and the transducer on the measurement the f t transducer was mounted firmly on the service bridge through a lifting rod which could precisely move up and down the natural frequency of the experimental model was measured by a hammer test and analyzed by spectral analysis as shown in fig 4 the measured natural frequency of the whole experimental model is 14 5 hz while the frequency of the model excluding specimen is as high as 81 6 hz the breaking wave loads and moments acting on the specimen along the x y and z directions were measured by the f t transducer since park et al 2017 stated that the impact of the breaking wave could be captured by a sampling rate of 500 hz the sampling rate of this experimental program is hence set to 2330 hz which is much higher than 500 hz for the measurement of breaking wave load the specimen was equipped with six pressure sensors along the middle line to analyze the pressure acting on the front face the sample rate of the pressure sensor was 1000 hz the distance between sensors was 2 cm while sensor 1 was 3 cm below the specimen top and sensor 6 was positioned 2 cm above the specimen bottom fig 3c since discrete wave gauges cannot capture breaker locations accurately visual evaluation through video records was used to determine the breaker location and the distance between the breaker location and the front face of the specimen a grid net was pasted on the side glass wall for convenient and accurate visual evaluation the size of the grids was 0 02 m 2 3 experimental wave conditions in the experiments the water depth d was set to 0 8 m the breaking wave experiments were performed in the specimen free flume to calibrate the deformation of the wave the waves were controlled to break in the given region the characteristics of the breaking waves were recorded and the breaker locations were identified visually the breaker locations of the waves were quite similar between the replicated trials only one plunging breaking wave was generated in each run due to the wavemaker mechanical transmission and wave deformation during propagation the generated wave differed from the input wave thus the analysis was based on the measured wave parameters as illustrated in fig 5 the shape of the waves at the breaking point was asymmetrical concerning both the horizontal and vertical planes the breaking wave parameters are determined according to the definitions introduced by kjeldsen and myrhaug 1980 the breaking wave height h b is defined as the vertical distance between the wave crest and trough when it breaks η b is the crest elevation measured from the swl and l 1 and l 2 are horizontal distances defining the position of the wave crest relative to the zero crossing points three characteristic parameters the crest front steepness ε η b l 1 horizontal asymmetry factor λ l 2 l 1 and vertical asymmetry factor μ η b h b provide a relatively accurate description of the geometric properties of transient near breaking waves by considering the adjacent frames of the visual photographs at breaking the celerity of wave c is determined as the distance over the time that the breaker tongue travels the breaking wave period t is defined as the duration from the beginning of wave breaking to the end of broken waves the parameters of the experimental wave conditions are listed in table 1 the minimum period of each wave train that the wavemaker generated was 0 7 s while the amplitudes of wave components were 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 m corresponding to h b 0 21 0 26 and 0 30 m respectively the typical time histories of water elevation measured by wg1 under h b 0 21 m are shown in fig 6 demonstrating that waves of different frequencies focused together 2 4 loading cases the breaking wave loads on the specimen were tested under the three wave trains generated above for each wave train different parameters related to clearance breaker location and structural orientation were considered the experiments consisted of two series of cases which are listed in table 2 the first series of cases explores the effects of raising or lowering the elevated cap and changing the distance between the cap and the breaker location three breaking wave trains are applied the front face of the specimen is perpendicular to the direction of the wave the clearance height s is defined as the distance from the swl to the specimen bottom according to the dimensions of the specimen and the breaking wave height the clearance height of the test specimen with respect to the swl varied from at grade 0 m to 0 03 m with h b 0 21 m from 0 to 0 05 m with h b 0 26 m and from 0 to 0 045 m and 0 09 m with h b 0 30 m above the swl according to the breaker shapes the process of wave breaking experiences three typical stages i e nonbreaking breaking and broken stages with the propagation of waves occurring along the longitudinal direction of the flume the distance between the specimen and breaker location is defined as a parameter to identify the stage of the breaking wave acting on the specimen in the experiments the breaker location of each wave train is constant the three positions of the specimen selected by visual evaluation to modify its distances from the breaker location are used to illustrate the effect of the breaker location on the wave impact loads on the specimen when the specimen is placed in front of the breaker location no waves break in front of the cap fig 7 a when the front face of the specimen is placed just at the breaker location the wave breaks immediately in front of the cap and the breaker tongue hits the cap at the wave crest level fig 7b when the specimen is placed far away in front of the breaker location the wave is broken and the overcurling breaker tongue hits the specimen far below the wave crest level fig 7c the three specimen location corresponds to the nonbreaking breaking and broken stage respectively the second series of cases illustrates the effect of structural orientation on the breaking wave loads since the cross section of the specimen is rectangular changes in the orientation of the cap change the front shape of the specimen which dominates the breaking wave loads the structure orientation is defined as the angle between the specimen axis and the longitude direction of the flume as shown in fig 8 in the experimental program seven structural orientations are achieved by rotating the specimen orientation between 0 and 90 in 15 degree intervals fig 3b in this study only a wave train with h b 0 30 m is applied the clearance height is set to be a constant of 0 09 cm and the front face of the specimen is placed just at the breaker location 3 experimental results 3 1 filtering of the measured data fig 9 shows the raw data for the horizontal and vertical components of the breaking wave load on the specimen at a clearance height s 0 m in the nonbreaking stage where h b 0 30 m although the experimental model was installed as rigidly as possible high frequency structural oscillations still occurred in the horizontal direction compared to the horizontal stiffness the vertical stiffness of the experimental model was relatively large the structural oscillation of the experimental model could not be completely eliminated from the data since the first vibration mode that resulted from wave impact was integrated into the load and moment data chakrabarti et al 1997 a low pass filter of which the cutoff frequency was set as the natural frequency of the experimental model was therefore used to diminish the structural vibration before further analysis as shown in fig 10 the measured horizontal breaking wave load on the specimen was filtered by a low pass filter at 14 5 hz the filtered horizontal and raw vertical data were used for all analyses presented below a few previous studies have obtained the wave load by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on specimens considering that pressure sensors are not easily affected by specimen vibration huang et al 2018 the pressure integration method was applied to validate the results of the f t transducer on the upstream surface of the specimen the surface was divided into six regions by the sensors the specific dimensions of this division are illustrated in fig 11 the wave load was calculated by summing the pressure integrations occurring over the six regions assuming that the pressure in the vicinity of each sensor was uniform and equal to the measured value a comparison between the pressure integration and filtered load in the nonbreaking stage where s 0 m and h b 0 30 m is shown in fig 12 the filtered results measured by the f t transducer agree well with the pressure integration during the rising process it should be noted that there are still some oscillations occurring during the decay process this is because the low pass filter frequency is set to the dry frequency of the model which is larger than the wet frequency and the structural vibration signals are not completely removed however no additional filtering is applied to avoid that the peak impact load is reduced the dry frequency is taken as the cutoff frequency comparisons between the filtered load and the pressure integration were conducted for all testing cases similar agreements are achieved in most cases however a few exceptions exist for the cases with totally broken waves the measured pressure is not credible due to the considerable amount of air entrapment for the cases where the specimen was set close to the crest of the breaking wave the wave impact may have induced a sharp pressure peak on some of the local probes the assumption of a uniform pressure adopted in the pressure integration overestimates the actual impacting area and results in a more substantial wave load therefore the following investigations are mainly conducted based on the filtered loads measured by the f t transducer 3 2 processing of the repeating trials each loading case was repeated three times to avoid contingency errors in the experiments considering that small differences in the initial conditions may influence the wave loading 20 min intervals between each test were emplaced to allow the water in the flume to calm fig 13 shows the time histories of the breaking wave loads in the three repeated trials the timing of each peak load was matched good agreement was achieved between the time series of each repeated trial in the following analysis the mean and standard deviation of the maximum breaking wave load are calculated to provide information about the repeatability 3 3 horizontal vertical loads and overturning moments snapshots of the first case study under the wave condition h b 0 30 m are presented in fig 14 fig 15 presents the time histories of the horizontal and vertical loads under the wave condition h b 0 30 m the times of the peak horizontal load for the different cases are all adjusted to the same time 71 s for comparison the characteristics of the horizontal and vertical wave loads vary across each stage the horizontal loads all follow the same temporal trend and demonstrate their significant impact the vertical loads are similar for the specimen where s 0 m and 0 045 m while the vertical load for the case where s 0 09 m in the breaking stage is distinct in the case of the breaking stage where s 0 09 m a sharp drop in the vertical load occurs when the horizontal load reaches its maximum the downward vertical load was induced by the downward velocity component of the breaker tongue the specimen was first impacted by the curling breaker tongue rather than the water below the wave crest when the water below the crest reached the specimen the total vertical load tended to be upward moreover the vertical load reaches its maximum before the horizontal load where s 0 m in the nonbreaking and breaking stages the maximum vertical load is similar to the maximum horizontal load when the specimen is located at the swl at the clearances of s 0 45 m and 0 9 m the time difference between the maximum horizontal and vertical loads decreases and the magnitude difference becomes larger fig 16 illustrates the filtered horizontal breaking wave load and overturning moment normalized by their respective maximum in the breaking region where s 0 09 m and h b 0 30 m in each case the maximum breaking wave load and overturning moment occur at nearly the same time the overturning moment m also follows the same temporal trend as that of the horizontal breaking wave load f h which demonstrates that m is a function of f h 3 4 wave pressure on the upstream surface fig 17 shows the time histories of the measured pressure under wave conditions where h b 0 30 m the measured pressure is composed of two parts i e the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures induced by the velocity of a water particle the variation in pressure over time is similar in the cases where s 0 m in the nonbreaking and breaking stages the pressure of each sensor reaches its maximum simultaneously while the rise time is varied the sensor placed at a lower elevation was first touched by the water when the specimen is elevated the difference between the pressures measured by each sensor increases the pressure of sensor 1 which was located near the elevation of the wave crest increased sharply while the pressure of the lowest sensor increased gradually the sharp increase was induced by the intense impact of the breaker tongue on the sensors when the specimen was positioned in the broken stage more than one peak could be observed this was mainly caused by entrapped air when the tongue hit the surface of the water at the moment of maximum horizontal load the pressure distribution along the vertical height of the specimen is obtained and plotted as displayed in fig 18 in the nonbreaking stage the pressure distribution follows a linear function related to sensor elevation in the breaking stage the pressure measured near the breaker tongue reaches its maximum in all cases as the specimen is elevated the pressure gradient steepens with increasing elevation in the broken stage a similar pressure distribution appears at the swl as in the cases where s 0 045 m and 0 09 m in the breaking stage the elevation of the maximum pressure location then drops it is concluded that the closer to the wave crest level the specimen reaches the higher the measured pressure is the different water particle velocities along the vertical direction account for this phenomenon a maximum plunging breaker velocity reaching 2 14 times the phase speed has been noted lim et al 2015 the water particle velocity near the breaker tongue is much larger than that near the swl in the breaking stage thus the measured pressure tends to be nonuniform when approaching the breaker tongue 4 discussions on breaking wave loads in this section the wave loads on the cap specimen are analyzed to obtain more insight into the characteristics of breaking wave loads when combined with the measured pressure the effects of clearance height breaker location and structural orientation are investigated for the compatibility of the wave load results for all loading conditions the maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load were nondimensionalized by ρ g b h h b and ρ g b w h b respectively the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical breaking wave load f h and f v can then be expressed as follows 9 f h f hmax ρ g b h h b 10 f v f vmax ρ g b w h b where f hmax and f vmax are the maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load respectively ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and b h and w are the length height and width of the specimen respectively and h b is the breaking wave height 4 1 effect of clearance fig 19 shows the means and standard deviations of f h as a function of clearance for various wave conditions f h exhibits an increasing tendency with increasing clearances in the nonbreaking and breaking stages which is consistent with the results of park et al 2017 and xu et al 2020 for elevated structures under regular waves since the top of the specimen is set to be no higher than the wave crest the whole front of the specimen is impacted in the nonbreaking and breaking stages in the broken wave region increasing the clearance might decrease the part of the specimen that is directly impacted by the wave the horizontal wave load in the broken stage shows a disordered trend versus that of the clearance owing to air entrapment the elevation of the specimen changes the pressure acting on the specimen resulting in wave load variability the pressure measured at sensor 1 in the breaking region where s 0 09 m is much higher than that of the other sensors across all cases a great pressure was induced by the significant impact of the breaker tongue at the elevation of the wave crest fig 20 shows top view snapshots of the breaking wave as it impacted the cap model in the breaking region it can be observed that the cap model was overtopped by the wave at s 0 m while it was intensely impacted at s 0 09 m the pressure distribution along the vertical direction accounts for this phenomenon as the wave load shows an increasing trend with increasing clearance moreover the movement of the breaker tongue is synchronous along the width of the flume it states that the effect of the sidewall is not significant for the transient breaking waves fig 21 shows the means and standard deviations of f v as a function of clearance the vertical load decreases with increasing clearance when the specimen is above the swl the most notable vertical load occurs when the specimen is elevated to the swl i e the clearance equals zero the experiments in which the specimen is submerged in water are not included in this research the vertical load is generated by the hydraulic pressure exerted on the bottom of the specimen while the breaking wave impacts the specimen along the horizontal direction it is noted that the upward vertical load is mainly induced by the water below the wave crest rather than the breaking part of the wave crest the effect of clearance on the maximum overturning moment around the y axis mirrors that on the horizontal load causing the overturning moment to be mainly induced by the horizontal breaking wave load however the overturning moment is always not directly used for structural analyses in engineering practices but rather the loading point is used instead as illustrated in fig 22 the elevation of the loading point h p is defined as the height of the loading point above the still water level assuming the following relationship between overturning moment m and horizontal wave load f h 11 m f h l in which l is the distance between the loading point and transducer center then h p can be determined with given values of l and s table 3 presents the mean values of l and h p in each case it is clear that the elevation of the loading point reaches its highest level in the breaking stage in the breaker location the elevation of the loading point is the closest to the breaker tongue which induces the maximum wave load in other words the cap specimen is hit by the breaker tongue more easily it is also concluded that the maximum wave load occurs in the case where the overturning wave crest impacts the cap at the crest level or just slightly below the crest level from the above discussion it can be seen that clearance is a critical factor that affects the breaking wave load on the elevated pile cap the horizontal load is sensitive to the elevation difference between the specimen and the breaker tongue while the vertical load depends on the elevation difference between the specimen and the swl 4 2 effect of breaker location figs 23 and 24 show the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical loads acting on the cap in three locations with respect to the breaker location corresponding to different stages of the breaking wave the horizontal wave load on the cap reaches its maximum in the breaking stage at the maximum clearance of each incident wave this finding agrees with previous studies performed in cylinders irschik et al 2003 kamath et al 2016 at the swl the trend of the horizontal wave load versus the specimen location with respect to the breaker location is not consistent the horizontal load in the broken stage is more significant than that in the other two stages where h b 0 30 m this is due to the effect of water splashes induced by the wave as presented in fig 24 the effect of the breaker location on the vertical load is not apparent overall the maximum vertical load in the broken stage is smaller it is noted that the upward vertical load was mainly generated by the hydrostatic pressure on the cap bottom in the broken stage the submerged depth of the cap model was relatively small resulting in a low pressure acting on the bottom 4 3 effect of structural orientation considering that the wave load on the specimen has a component along the y direction as the specimen rotates the resultant horizontal wave load on the specimen is defined as follows 12 f h f x 2 f y 2 where f x and f y are the breaking wave loads along the x and y directions respectively the time histories of f x and f y were measured simultaneously in the experiments thus the time histories of the resultant breaking wave load on the specimen can be calculated using eq 12 the maximum horizontal wave load on the specimen at each orientation is then used to analyze the effect of structural orientation fig 25 shows the means and standard deviations of the maximum horizontal load vertical load and overturning moment as a function of the structural orientation the experiments investigating the effect of structural orientation were conducted during the breaking stage as the specimen rotated from 0 to 90 the maximum wave loads decreased first and then increased the maximum horizontal load and overturning moment reached their minimum values when the orientation was 45 while the maximum vertical load reached its minimum at 60 fig 26 shows four consecutive snapshots with an orientation of 45 it is clear that the breaker tongue was split by the cap edge thus the pressure acting on the upstream surface of the specimen was directly reduced and the rise time was also reduced resulting in a decrease in the maximum horizontal load the upward vertical load is mainly induced by the water below the wave crest rather than the breaking part of the wave crests the changes in structural orientation caused different bottom areas to be impacted by the hydraulic pressure of water below the wave crest thus the maximum horizontal and vertical loads reached their minima at different structural orientations 4 4 probability assessment of breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap according to the experimental data the statistical analyses of both f h and f v on the pile cap specimen are carried out as a function of clearance as illustrated in fig 27 it is clear that the breaking wave load on an elevated pile cap is stochastic and significantly influenced by structure design breaking wave condition etc some previous works allsop 1999 oumeraci et al 2001 suggest studying the exceedance or non exceedance values for the wave impact loads based on statistical analyses many probabilistic models have been developed to quantitatively account for uncertainties and variability of wave impact loads cuomo et al 2011 paulsen et al 2019 shen et al 2020 while the probabilistic description of breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap has not been well understood to investigate the probabilistic description for f h and f v on the elevated pile cap with rectangular cross section the following probabilistic distributions including normal gamma weibull gumbel and generalized extreme value gev are used to fit the experimental data respectively fig 28 shows the probability density function pdf and the cumulative distribution function cdf of the empirical and the fitted distributions of the dimensionless breaking wave loads along the horizontal and vertical direction the root mean square error rmse are calculated to evaluate the agreement between the empirical and fitted data the rmse is defined as follows 13 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n where m i and s i are the empirical and fitted cdf results table 4 lists the rmse values between the empirical and fitted data it is shown that gev distribution coincides with the empirical data better for both f h and f v this finding also agrees with the statement concluded by oumeraci et al 2001 when they studied the best fit probability distribution of breaking wave load on the breakwater therefore gev distribution is used hereafter to describe the maximum dimensionless breaking wave load the cdf of gev distribution is expressed as 14 p f i exp 1 k f i μ σ 1 k f o r k 0 where i denotes the component of breaking wave loads including h or v representing the horizontal or vertical direction respectively μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter of gev distribution the dimensionless breaking wave loads as a function of non exceedance probability can be given by 15 f i σ k ln p k 1 μ where p is the probability of non exceedance of breaking wave load the fitted gev parameters μ k and σ are estimated based on the maximum likelihood method and equal to 1 041 0 12 and 0 3209 for f h and 0 3889 0 3792 and 0 1031 for f v respectively according to the probability distribution and eq 15 f h and f v corresponding to a 90 probability of non exceedance is 1 67 and 0 54 respectively which is useful in defining the breaking wave load case in engineering practice oumeraci et al 2001 5 concluding remarks this paper presents an experimental program designed to explore the wave loads impacting an elevated pile cap with a rectangular cross section during the whole wave breaking process the breaking wave loads combined with the pressures exerted the cap were measured and discussed the effects of clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave load can be summarized as follows 1 the horizontal breaking wave load increased with increasing clearance in the nonbreaking and breaking stages in the broken stage the horizontal wave load showed a disordered trend as a function of clearance the elevation of the specimen directly changed the pressure acting on the specimen resulting in a variable horizontal wave load the upward vertical load decreased with increasing clearance when the specimen was above the swl the most significant vertical load occurred when the specimen was elevated at the swl 2 when the specimen was located at the breaker tongue of the wave crest breaker location the breaker tongue reached its maximum velocity and induced its most intense pressure on the specimen a maximum horizontal wave load on the cap could be observed among those of all three breaker locations 3 when the orientation of the specimen changed the maximum horizontal load and overturning moment decreased to their minimum values when the orientation was 45 while the maximum vertical load reached its minimum at the 60 orientation this is because the horizontal wave load was mainly induced by the impact of the breaker tongue at the wave crest while the vertical load was dominated by the water below the wave crest 4 gev distribution fits both the horizontal and vertical breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap better than the other types of distribution the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical breaking wave loads corresponding to a 90 probability of non exceedance is equal to 1 67 and 0 54 respectively it should be noted that the conclusions were drawn based on the limited experimental results the experiments where the specimen was submerged in water were not included in this research since changing the orientation of a large specimen varies the blockage ratio of the flume and may exacerbate the effect of sidewalls it deserves a careful study by testing more structural orientations in further works the structures above and below the elevated cap are not considered in this study the piles cap pier interaction under breaking waves is complicated but an interesting and important prospect for future study notwithstanding the limitations listed above this study provides a valuable experimental reference for the study of breaking

20876,elevated pile caps are always located close to the still water level where breaking waves can induce great impact loads and threaten the structural stability of bridges this paper focuses on the interaction between breaking waves and an elevated pile cap with a rectangular cross section an elevated cap specimen under three breaking wave conditions was employed in the experimental program the breaking wave loads including the resulting horizontal and vertical loads overturning moments and water pressures exerted on the specimen were measured simultaneously the effects of clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave loads were investigated and a probabilistic description of breaking wave load was presented the results show that with increasing clearance the horizontal breaking wave load and overturning moment increased while the vertical load decreased when the specimen was above the still water level the maximum horizontal wave load was observed when the specimen was located at the breaker tongue of the wave crest the magnitude of the maximum horizontal and vertical load varied with structural orientations of the elevated pile cap gev distribution is effective in modeling the stochastic maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load keywords elevated pile cap breaking wave loads rectangular cross section clearance breaker location structural orientation 1 introduction with economic development population expansion and resource exploitation in coastal zones large and long bridges serving as backbones by connecting coastal communities are constantly emerging many experimental and numerical efforts have been made to investigate the wave loads on such bridges cuomo et al 2009 seiffert et al 2014 guo et al 2015a fang et al 2019 qu et al 2020 these studies investigated the wave loads on different types of bridge decks under regular solitary cnoidal or oblique waves however for structures located in tropical cyclone prone oceans the threat of breaking waves on structural safety cannot be neglected hallowell et al 2016 breaking waves are a kind of wave whose amplitude reaches a critical level at which the breaker tongues can suddenly occur and transform large amounts of wave energy into turbulent kinetic energy liang et al 2017 cuomo et al 2010 reviewed previous studies and stated that breaking wave impact loads could be ten times that of nonbreaking wave loads the breaking waves generated by typhoon soudelor in 2015 caused severe damage to a steel trestle fig 1 a which has previously been used to construct an elevated pile cap for a sea crossing bridge wei et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study breaking wave loads on bridge structures wave deck interactions were the primary concern of earlier investigations of wave loading on bridges serinaldi and cuomo 2011 xu et al 2017 huang et al 2018b however chella et al 2012 provided an overview of the recent research on breaking wave loads and concluded that breaking waves yield the highest hydrodynamic loads on substructures pile groups are commonly used to support sea crossing bridges due to their structural efficiency low cost and ease of construction ti et al 2020 as a rigid transition piece for pile groups elevated pile caps are set to connect piles with piers or pylons and are located close to the still water level swl as shown in fig 1b wei et al 2020 the authors conducted a wave flume experimental program to investigate nonbreaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap of a pile foundation and highlighted that the wave slamming loads occurred when the bottom of the cap was located above the swl xu et al 2020 compared with nonbreaking waves the slamming loads induced by breaking waves are not only more intense but also representing a complex hydrodynamic obstacle with a highly stochastic nature oumeraci h et al 1993 cuomo et al 2010 park et al 2017 2018 conducted a large scale physical experiment and subsequent numerical simulations to explore the breaking wave loads impacting an elevated specimen with a square cross section which is like an elevated pile cap they summarized the relationships between the breaking wave loads and the wave height period structure air gap and wave type moreover since the decks of coastal bridges are long banded structures most experimental and numerical studies on waves in deck assume that the wave direction is perpendicular to the structure and are conducted two dimensionally cox and ortega 2002 huang and xiao 2009 guo et al 2015b qin et al 2017 xu et al 2018 elevated pile caps always have a square rectangular or other complex shaped cross section zhang et al 2020 a review of the previous literature related to breaking wave loads on vertical cylinders shows that the geometry of the structural front significantly affects the breaking wave loads acting on a structure sawaragi and nochino 1984 chan and melville 1989 if there was a misalignment between the structural orientation and the wave direction the structural front of the rectangular pile cap would change accordingly although api 2000 recommended including the directional effect in the estimation of wave loads on decks the impact of misalignments between structural orientation and wave direction on breaking wave loads has not been well addressed shen et al 2020 there is no consensus on the relationship between breaking wave loads and wave directions given the threats of breaking waves and challenges of understanding the associated loads on elevated pile caps a wave flume experimental program was conducted at southwest jiaotong university as a continuation of the authors previous work xu et al 2020 the interaction between breaking waves and elevated pile caps with rectangular cross sections is investigated as follows the approach for the generation of breaking wave conditions and the experimental setup are introduced in section 2 the experimental results including the characteristic horizontal and vertical loads overturning moments and water pressure on the specimen are summarized and analyzed in section 3 section 4 investigates the effects of cap base clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave loads on an elevated cap specimen then a probability assessment is carried out to describe the stochastic breaking wave load finally the major conclusions of this work are remarked and some prospects are put forward 2 setup of breaking wave flume tests 2 1 generation of breaking waves in the flume the laboratory experiments were carried out in a wave flume at southwest jiaotong university as illustrated in fig 2 the details of the wave flume can be found in the authors previous work xu et al 2020 in the flume the x axis defines the longitudinal direction of the flume the y axis defines the width of the flume and the z axis defines the vertical direction to achieve the goal of this paper the first task is to generate a reliable breaking wave in the flume there are two conventional methods used to generate wave breaking in the flume one is to set a bottom slope in the flume to form a shallow terrain along the wave propagation direction ippen and kulin 1954 galvin 1968 iwagaki and sakai 1972 nadaoka et al 1989 the other method referred to as wave focusing is to generate a wave packet composed of regular waves of different frequencies focused at the desired location in the flume kjeldsen and myrhaug 1980 rapp and melville 1990 kway et al 1998 liang et al 2017 at the focusing point the wave becomes very steep due to the superpositions of waves and breaking wave subsequently occurs the former method can continuously generate breaking waves however the flume would need to be remodeled since the flume at southwest jiaotong university is a flat bottom flume the latter can generate breaking waves without any modifications to the flume bottom and is hence chosen here to generate the breaking waves for convenience and save labor related expenses a wave train which contained waves of different frequencies was generated by a piston wavemaker in the experiments the wavemaker made the waves of various celerity focus at the same location simultaneously according to the linear wave theory the free surface elevation can be expressed as the result of the superposition of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies 1 η x t i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t where ω 2 π t is the wave frequency t is the wave period a is the amplitude of the generated wave k is the wavenumber t is time and n is the number of wave components ω and k satisfy the wave dispersion relation as follows 2 ω 2 k g tanh k d where d is the water depth and g is the acceleration of gravity to generate a breaking wave at a distance of x from the wavemaker the wave frequency ω should be calculated as a function of time t i e ω ω t therefore the essential aspect of determining the motion signal of the wavemaker that generates a breaking wave is to determine the variation in frequency over time the wave energy spreads at the group velocity 3 c g 1 2 n c where c is the phase velocity of the wave and n is a coefficient presented in the linear theory 4 c ω k 5 n 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d assuming that the minimum period of a wave that the wavemaker can generate is t 0 the time for that wave to travel the distance of x m is t 0 6 t 0 x c g 0 2 x n 0 c 0 in which the subscript 0 represents the parameters corresponding to a wave with the minimum period t 0 for the subsequent waves generated with period t at moment t to arrive at the same location the time it takes for the wave to travel a distance of x m is t 0 t 7 t 0 t x c g 2 x n c substituting eq 4 into eq 7 the frequency of the wave generated at moment t can be obtained as follows 8 ω t 2 k x n t 0 t in the practice of generating breaking waves the minimum period t 0 is determined according to the capability of the wavemaker the frequency of the wave at moment t is derived from eq 8 considering the dispersion relationship between the wave frequency and wavenumber eq 8 is solved using the iterative method 2 2 experimental model and devices the test specimen is a 1 90 reduced scale model of the prototype cap it has been used in the authors previous work xu et al 2020 and is made of acrylic material with young s modulus of 3 gpa the dimensions of the specimen are 26 67 cm along the x axis 40 cm along the y axis and 15 cm along the z axis the thickness of the specimen wall is 0 8 cm the mass of the specimen is 5 35 kg the blockage ratio of the specimen to the flume width is equal to 0 2 which is lower than 0 4 and has little influence on the downstream flow velocities according to nouri et al 2010 four wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz were positioned in the flume to measure water surface transformations as shown in fig 2 wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 were arranged in front of the specimen with an interval distance of 1 m the distance between wg3 and the front face of the specimen was 0 40 m wg4 was installed on the left of the specimen front edge the four gauges were carefully calibrated during preliminary testing which demonstrated that they all made synchronous and accurate recordings under the control of the same computer as illustrated in fig 3 a the installed experimental model consists of three parts specimen alloy arm and supporting system the specimen and the supporting system were connected by a 0 32 m long alloy arm with a solid circular cross section of 0 04 m in diameter the young s modulus and density of the alloy material are 71 gpa and 2600 kg m3 respectively the bending stiffness of the alloy arm is 8 9 kn m2 since the arm diameter is much smaller than the specimen size the wave impact on the arm can be ignored the supporting system includes the f t force and torque transducer and service bridge the f t transducer is far above the crest of the wave to eliminate the unexpected interaction between the water and the transducer on the measurement the f t transducer was mounted firmly on the service bridge through a lifting rod which could precisely move up and down the natural frequency of the experimental model was measured by a hammer test and analyzed by spectral analysis as shown in fig 4 the measured natural frequency of the whole experimental model is 14 5 hz while the frequency of the model excluding specimen is as high as 81 6 hz the breaking wave loads and moments acting on the specimen along the x y and z directions were measured by the f t transducer since park et al 2017 stated that the impact of the breaking wave could be captured by a sampling rate of 500 hz the sampling rate of this experimental program is hence set to 2330 hz which is much higher than 500 hz for the measurement of breaking wave load the specimen was equipped with six pressure sensors along the middle line to analyze the pressure acting on the front face the sample rate of the pressure sensor was 1000 hz the distance between sensors was 2 cm while sensor 1 was 3 cm below the specimen top and sensor 6 was positioned 2 cm above the specimen bottom fig 3c since discrete wave gauges cannot capture breaker locations accurately visual evaluation through video records was used to determine the breaker location and the distance between the breaker location and the front face of the specimen a grid net was pasted on the side glass wall for convenient and accurate visual evaluation the size of the grids was 0 02 m 2 3 experimental wave conditions in the experiments the water depth d was set to 0 8 m the breaking wave experiments were performed in the specimen free flume to calibrate the deformation of the wave the waves were controlled to break in the given region the characteristics of the breaking waves were recorded and the breaker locations were identified visually the breaker locations of the waves were quite similar between the replicated trials only one plunging breaking wave was generated in each run due to the wavemaker mechanical transmission and wave deformation during propagation the generated wave differed from the input wave thus the analysis was based on the measured wave parameters as illustrated in fig 5 the shape of the waves at the breaking point was asymmetrical concerning both the horizontal and vertical planes the breaking wave parameters are determined according to the definitions introduced by kjeldsen and myrhaug 1980 the breaking wave height h b is defined as the vertical distance between the wave crest and trough when it breaks η b is the crest elevation measured from the swl and l 1 and l 2 are horizontal distances defining the position of the wave crest relative to the zero crossing points three characteristic parameters the crest front steepness ε η b l 1 horizontal asymmetry factor λ l 2 l 1 and vertical asymmetry factor μ η b h b provide a relatively accurate description of the geometric properties of transient near breaking waves by considering the adjacent frames of the visual photographs at breaking the celerity of wave c is determined as the distance over the time that the breaker tongue travels the breaking wave period t is defined as the duration from the beginning of wave breaking to the end of broken waves the parameters of the experimental wave conditions are listed in table 1 the minimum period of each wave train that the wavemaker generated was 0 7 s while the amplitudes of wave components were 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 m corresponding to h b 0 21 0 26 and 0 30 m respectively the typical time histories of water elevation measured by wg1 under h b 0 21 m are shown in fig 6 demonstrating that waves of different frequencies focused together 2 4 loading cases the breaking wave loads on the specimen were tested under the three wave trains generated above for each wave train different parameters related to clearance breaker location and structural orientation were considered the experiments consisted of two series of cases which are listed in table 2 the first series of cases explores the effects of raising or lowering the elevated cap and changing the distance between the cap and the breaker location three breaking wave trains are applied the front face of the specimen is perpendicular to the direction of the wave the clearance height s is defined as the distance from the swl to the specimen bottom according to the dimensions of the specimen and the breaking wave height the clearance height of the test specimen with respect to the swl varied from at grade 0 m to 0 03 m with h b 0 21 m from 0 to 0 05 m with h b 0 26 m and from 0 to 0 045 m and 0 09 m with h b 0 30 m above the swl according to the breaker shapes the process of wave breaking experiences three typical stages i e nonbreaking breaking and broken stages with the propagation of waves occurring along the longitudinal direction of the flume the distance between the specimen and breaker location is defined as a parameter to identify the stage of the breaking wave acting on the specimen in the experiments the breaker location of each wave train is constant the three positions of the specimen selected by visual evaluation to modify its distances from the breaker location are used to illustrate the effect of the breaker location on the wave impact loads on the specimen when the specimen is placed in front of the breaker location no waves break in front of the cap fig 7 a when the front face of the specimen is placed just at the breaker location the wave breaks immediately in front of the cap and the breaker tongue hits the cap at the wave crest level fig 7b when the specimen is placed far away in front of the breaker location the wave is broken and the overcurling breaker tongue hits the specimen far below the wave crest level fig 7c the three specimen location corresponds to the nonbreaking breaking and broken stage respectively the second series of cases illustrates the effect of structural orientation on the breaking wave loads since the cross section of the specimen is rectangular changes in the orientation of the cap change the front shape of the specimen which dominates the breaking wave loads the structure orientation is defined as the angle between the specimen axis and the longitude direction of the flume as shown in fig 8 in the experimental program seven structural orientations are achieved by rotating the specimen orientation between 0 and 90 in 15 degree intervals fig 3b in this study only a wave train with h b 0 30 m is applied the clearance height is set to be a constant of 0 09 cm and the front face of the specimen is placed just at the breaker location 3 experimental results 3 1 filtering of the measured data fig 9 shows the raw data for the horizontal and vertical components of the breaking wave load on the specimen at a clearance height s 0 m in the nonbreaking stage where h b 0 30 m although the experimental model was installed as rigidly as possible high frequency structural oscillations still occurred in the horizontal direction compared to the horizontal stiffness the vertical stiffness of the experimental model was relatively large the structural oscillation of the experimental model could not be completely eliminated from the data since the first vibration mode that resulted from wave impact was integrated into the load and moment data chakrabarti et al 1997 a low pass filter of which the cutoff frequency was set as the natural frequency of the experimental model was therefore used to diminish the structural vibration before further analysis as shown in fig 10 the measured horizontal breaking wave load on the specimen was filtered by a low pass filter at 14 5 hz the filtered horizontal and raw vertical data were used for all analyses presented below a few previous studies have obtained the wave load by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on specimens considering that pressure sensors are not easily affected by specimen vibration huang et al 2018 the pressure integration method was applied to validate the results of the f t transducer on the upstream surface of the specimen the surface was divided into six regions by the sensors the specific dimensions of this division are illustrated in fig 11 the wave load was calculated by summing the pressure integrations occurring over the six regions assuming that the pressure in the vicinity of each sensor was uniform and equal to the measured value a comparison between the pressure integration and filtered load in the nonbreaking stage where s 0 m and h b 0 30 m is shown in fig 12 the filtered results measured by the f t transducer agree well with the pressure integration during the rising process it should be noted that there are still some oscillations occurring during the decay process this is because the low pass filter frequency is set to the dry frequency of the model which is larger than the wet frequency and the structural vibration signals are not completely removed however no additional filtering is applied to avoid that the peak impact load is reduced the dry frequency is taken as the cutoff frequency comparisons between the filtered load and the pressure integration were conducted for all testing cases similar agreements are achieved in most cases however a few exceptions exist for the cases with totally broken waves the measured pressure is not credible due to the considerable amount of air entrapment for the cases where the specimen was set close to the crest of the breaking wave the wave impact may have induced a sharp pressure peak on some of the local probes the assumption of a uniform pressure adopted in the pressure integration overestimates the actual impacting area and results in a more substantial wave load therefore the following investigations are mainly conducted based on the filtered loads measured by the f t transducer 3 2 processing of the repeating trials each loading case was repeated three times to avoid contingency errors in the experiments considering that small differences in the initial conditions may influence the wave loading 20 min intervals between each test were emplaced to allow the water in the flume to calm fig 13 shows the time histories of the breaking wave loads in the three repeated trials the timing of each peak load was matched good agreement was achieved between the time series of each repeated trial in the following analysis the mean and standard deviation of the maximum breaking wave load are calculated to provide information about the repeatability 3 3 horizontal vertical loads and overturning moments snapshots of the first case study under the wave condition h b 0 30 m are presented in fig 14 fig 15 presents the time histories of the horizontal and vertical loads under the wave condition h b 0 30 m the times of the peak horizontal load for the different cases are all adjusted to the same time 71 s for comparison the characteristics of the horizontal and vertical wave loads vary across each stage the horizontal loads all follow the same temporal trend and demonstrate their significant impact the vertical loads are similar for the specimen where s 0 m and 0 045 m while the vertical load for the case where s 0 09 m in the breaking stage is distinct in the case of the breaking stage where s 0 09 m a sharp drop in the vertical load occurs when the horizontal load reaches its maximum the downward vertical load was induced by the downward velocity component of the breaker tongue the specimen was first impacted by the curling breaker tongue rather than the water below the wave crest when the water below the crest reached the specimen the total vertical load tended to be upward moreover the vertical load reaches its maximum before the horizontal load where s 0 m in the nonbreaking and breaking stages the maximum vertical load is similar to the maximum horizontal load when the specimen is located at the swl at the clearances of s 0 45 m and 0 9 m the time difference between the maximum horizontal and vertical loads decreases and the magnitude difference becomes larger fig 16 illustrates the filtered horizontal breaking wave load and overturning moment normalized by their respective maximum in the breaking region where s 0 09 m and h b 0 30 m in each case the maximum breaking wave load and overturning moment occur at nearly the same time the overturning moment m also follows the same temporal trend as that of the horizontal breaking wave load f h which demonstrates that m is a function of f h 3 4 wave pressure on the upstream surface fig 17 shows the time histories of the measured pressure under wave conditions where h b 0 30 m the measured pressure is composed of two parts i e the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures induced by the velocity of a water particle the variation in pressure over time is similar in the cases where s 0 m in the nonbreaking and breaking stages the pressure of each sensor reaches its maximum simultaneously while the rise time is varied the sensor placed at a lower elevation was first touched by the water when the specimen is elevated the difference between the pressures measured by each sensor increases the pressure of sensor 1 which was located near the elevation of the wave crest increased sharply while the pressure of the lowest sensor increased gradually the sharp increase was induced by the intense impact of the breaker tongue on the sensors when the specimen was positioned in the broken stage more than one peak could be observed this was mainly caused by entrapped air when the tongue hit the surface of the water at the moment of maximum horizontal load the pressure distribution along the vertical height of the specimen is obtained and plotted as displayed in fig 18 in the nonbreaking stage the pressure distribution follows a linear function related to sensor elevation in the breaking stage the pressure measured near the breaker tongue reaches its maximum in all cases as the specimen is elevated the pressure gradient steepens with increasing elevation in the broken stage a similar pressure distribution appears at the swl as in the cases where s 0 045 m and 0 09 m in the breaking stage the elevation of the maximum pressure location then drops it is concluded that the closer to the wave crest level the specimen reaches the higher the measured pressure is the different water particle velocities along the vertical direction account for this phenomenon a maximum plunging breaker velocity reaching 2 14 times the phase speed has been noted lim et al 2015 the water particle velocity near the breaker tongue is much larger than that near the swl in the breaking stage thus the measured pressure tends to be nonuniform when approaching the breaker tongue 4 discussions on breaking wave loads in this section the wave loads on the cap specimen are analyzed to obtain more insight into the characteristics of breaking wave loads when combined with the measured pressure the effects of clearance height breaker location and structural orientation are investigated for the compatibility of the wave load results for all loading conditions the maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load were nondimensionalized by ρ g b h h b and ρ g b w h b respectively the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical breaking wave load f h and f v can then be expressed as follows 9 f h f hmax ρ g b h h b 10 f v f vmax ρ g b w h b where f hmax and f vmax are the maximum horizontal and vertical breaking wave load respectively ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and b h and w are the length height and width of the specimen respectively and h b is the breaking wave height 4 1 effect of clearance fig 19 shows the means and standard deviations of f h as a function of clearance for various wave conditions f h exhibits an increasing tendency with increasing clearances in the nonbreaking and breaking stages which is consistent with the results of park et al 2017 and xu et al 2020 for elevated structures under regular waves since the top of the specimen is set to be no higher than the wave crest the whole front of the specimen is impacted in the nonbreaking and breaking stages in the broken wave region increasing the clearance might decrease the part of the specimen that is directly impacted by the wave the horizontal wave load in the broken stage shows a disordered trend versus that of the clearance owing to air entrapment the elevation of the specimen changes the pressure acting on the specimen resulting in wave load variability the pressure measured at sensor 1 in the breaking region where s 0 09 m is much higher than that of the other sensors across all cases a great pressure was induced by the significant impact of the breaker tongue at the elevation of the wave crest fig 20 shows top view snapshots of the breaking wave as it impacted the cap model in the breaking region it can be observed that the cap model was overtopped by the wave at s 0 m while it was intensely impacted at s 0 09 m the pressure distribution along the vertical direction accounts for this phenomenon as the wave load shows an increasing trend with increasing clearance moreover the movement of the breaker tongue is synchronous along the width of the flume it states that the effect of the sidewall is not significant for the transient breaking waves fig 21 shows the means and standard deviations of f v as a function of clearance the vertical load decreases with increasing clearance when the specimen is above the swl the most notable vertical load occurs when the specimen is elevated to the swl i e the clearance equals zero the experiments in which the specimen is submerged in water are not included in this research the vertical load is generated by the hydraulic pressure exerted on the bottom of the specimen while the breaking wave impacts the specimen along the horizontal direction it is noted that the upward vertical load is mainly induced by the water below the wave crest rather than the breaking part of the wave crest the effect of clearance on the maximum overturning moment around the y axis mirrors that on the horizontal load causing the overturning moment to be mainly induced by the horizontal breaking wave load however the overturning moment is always not directly used for structural analyses in engineering practices but rather the loading point is used instead as illustrated in fig 22 the elevation of the loading point h p is defined as the height of the loading point above the still water level assuming the following relationship between overturning moment m and horizontal wave load f h 11 m f h l in which l is the distance between the loading point and transducer center then h p can be determined with given values of l and s table 3 presents the mean values of l and h p in each case it is clear that the elevation of the loading point reaches its highest level in the breaking stage in the breaker location the elevation of the loading point is the closest to the breaker tongue which induces the maximum wave load in other words the cap specimen is hit by the breaker tongue more easily it is also concluded that the maximum wave load occurs in the case where the overturning wave crest impacts the cap at the crest level or just slightly below the crest level from the above discussion it can be seen that clearance is a critical factor that affects the breaking wave load on the elevated pile cap the horizontal load is sensitive to the elevation difference between the specimen and the breaker tongue while the vertical load depends on the elevation difference between the specimen and the swl 4 2 effect of breaker location figs 23 and 24 show the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical loads acting on the cap in three locations with respect to the breaker location corresponding to different stages of the breaking wave the horizontal wave load on the cap reaches its maximum in the breaking stage at the maximum clearance of each incident wave this finding agrees with previous studies performed in cylinders irschik et al 2003 kamath et al 2016 at the swl the trend of the horizontal wave load versus the specimen location with respect to the breaker location is not consistent the horizontal load in the broken stage is more significant than that in the other two stages where h b 0 30 m this is due to the effect of water splashes induced by the wave as presented in fig 24 the effect of the breaker location on the vertical load is not apparent overall the maximum vertical load in the broken stage is smaller it is noted that the upward vertical load was mainly generated by the hydrostatic pressure on the cap bottom in the broken stage the submerged depth of the cap model was relatively small resulting in a low pressure acting on the bottom 4 3 effect of structural orientation considering that the wave load on the specimen has a component along the y direction as the specimen rotates the resultant horizontal wave load on the specimen is defined as follows 12 f h f x 2 f y 2 where f x and f y are the breaking wave loads along the x and y directions respectively the time histories of f x and f y were measured simultaneously in the experiments thus the time histories of the resultant breaking wave load on the specimen can be calculated using eq 12 the maximum horizontal wave load on the specimen at each orientation is then used to analyze the effect of structural orientation fig 25 shows the means and standard deviations of the maximum horizontal load vertical load and overturning moment as a function of the structural orientation the experiments investigating the effect of structural orientation were conducted during the breaking stage as the specimen rotated from 0 to 90 the maximum wave loads decreased first and then increased the maximum horizontal load and overturning moment reached their minimum values when the orientation was 45 while the maximum vertical load reached its minimum at 60 fig 26 shows four consecutive snapshots with an orientation of 45 it is clear that the breaker tongue was split by the cap edge thus the pressure acting on the upstream surface of the specimen was directly reduced and the rise time was also reduced resulting in a decrease in the maximum horizontal load the upward vertical load is mainly induced by the water below the wave crest rather than the breaking part of the wave crests the changes in structural orientation caused different bottom areas to be impacted by the hydraulic pressure of water below the wave crest thus the maximum horizontal and vertical loads reached their minima at different structural orientations 4 4 probability assessment of breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap according to the experimental data the statistical analyses of both f h and f v on the pile cap specimen are carried out as a function of clearance as illustrated in fig 27 it is clear that the breaking wave load on an elevated pile cap is stochastic and significantly influenced by structure design breaking wave condition etc some previous works allsop 1999 oumeraci et al 2001 suggest studying the exceedance or non exceedance values for the wave impact loads based on statistical analyses many probabilistic models have been developed to quantitatively account for uncertainties and variability of wave impact loads cuomo et al 2011 paulsen et al 2019 shen et al 2020 while the probabilistic description of breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap has not been well understood to investigate the probabilistic description for f h and f v on the elevated pile cap with rectangular cross section the following probabilistic distributions including normal gamma weibull gumbel and generalized extreme value gev are used to fit the experimental data respectively fig 28 shows the probability density function pdf and the cumulative distribution function cdf of the empirical and the fitted distributions of the dimensionless breaking wave loads along the horizontal and vertical direction the root mean square error rmse are calculated to evaluate the agreement between the empirical and fitted data the rmse is defined as follows 13 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n where m i and s i are the empirical and fitted cdf results table 4 lists the rmse values between the empirical and fitted data it is shown that gev distribution coincides with the empirical data better for both f h and f v this finding also agrees with the statement concluded by oumeraci et al 2001 when they studied the best fit probability distribution of breaking wave load on the breakwater therefore gev distribution is used hereafter to describe the maximum dimensionless breaking wave load the cdf of gev distribution is expressed as 14 p f i exp 1 k f i μ σ 1 k f o r k 0 where i denotes the component of breaking wave loads including h or v representing the horizontal or vertical direction respectively μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter of gev distribution the dimensionless breaking wave loads as a function of non exceedance probability can be given by 15 f i σ k ln p k 1 μ where p is the probability of non exceedance of breaking wave load the fitted gev parameters μ k and σ are estimated based on the maximum likelihood method and equal to 1 041 0 12 and 0 3209 for f h and 0 3889 0 3792 and 0 1031 for f v respectively according to the probability distribution and eq 15 f h and f v corresponding to a 90 probability of non exceedance is 1 67 and 0 54 respectively which is useful in defining the breaking wave load case in engineering practice oumeraci et al 2001 5 concluding remarks this paper presents an experimental program designed to explore the wave loads impacting an elevated pile cap with a rectangular cross section during the whole wave breaking process the breaking wave loads combined with the pressures exerted the cap were measured and discussed the effects of clearance breaker location and structural orientation on the breaking wave load can be summarized as follows 1 the horizontal breaking wave load increased with increasing clearance in the nonbreaking and breaking stages in the broken stage the horizontal wave load showed a disordered trend as a function of clearance the elevation of the specimen directly changed the pressure acting on the specimen resulting in a variable horizontal wave load the upward vertical load decreased with increasing clearance when the specimen was above the swl the most significant vertical load occurred when the specimen was elevated at the swl 2 when the specimen was located at the breaker tongue of the wave crest breaker location the breaker tongue reached its maximum velocity and induced its most intense pressure on the specimen a maximum horizontal wave load on the cap could be observed among those of all three breaker locations 3 when the orientation of the specimen changed the maximum horizontal load and overturning moment decreased to their minimum values when the orientation was 45 while the maximum vertical load reached its minimum at the 60 orientation this is because the horizontal wave load was mainly induced by the impact of the breaker tongue at the wave crest while the vertical load was dominated by the water below the wave crest 4 gev distribution fits both the horizontal and vertical breaking wave loads on the elevated pile cap better than the other types of distribution the maximum dimensionless horizontal and vertical breaking wave loads corresponding to a 90 probability of non exceedance is equal to 1 67 and 0 54 respectively it should be noted that the conclusions were drawn based on the limited experimental results the experiments where the specimen was submerged in water were not included in this research since changing the orientation of a large specimen varies the blockage ratio of the flume and may exacerbate the effect of sidewalls it deserves a careful study by testing more structural orientations in further works the structures above and below the elevated cap are not considered in this study the piles cap pier interaction under breaking waves is complicated but an interesting and important prospect for future study notwithstanding the limitations listed above this study provides a valuable experimental reference for the study of breaking

20877,examined the spatial and temporal changes in the wave spectra using waves measured in the coastal area at two locations for three years long term variability is examined with era5 reanalysis data the annual average wave spectra have a significant wave height hs of 1m at both locations during the asian monsoon june september the highest wave spectra resulted in hs of 5 1m frequently the wave pattern is with hs of 0 4 0 8m and mean period of 3 8s annually 67 of the time spectra consists of waves from 210 to 230 250 260 and 300 310 with high waves hs 4m from southwest 250 260 due to the presence of significant wind seas and swells energy at the secondary spectral peak is 38 of energy at the principal peak during february may the sea state is dominated 50 of time by locally generated waves and young swells while in monsoon the swells are large 66 75 principal component pc of spectral energy density shows that monsoon and cyclonic storms are resulting in a large variability 90 in the first mode even though the wave characteristics are similar within 125 km distance some metrological events cause significant changes in the waves and it resulted in different 100 year return period values at these locations keywords extreme waves long term variability multi peaked wave spectrum reflected waves wind generated waves 1 introduction the surface waves generated by winds waves hereafter play an important role in many scientific and practical studies waves in the coastal waters significantly impact surf zone circulation and coastal erosion thornton and guza 1986 in addition the primary mechanism for sediment transport and mixing in the coastal zone are the wave driven processes and these processes depend on the energy and direction of the incident waves masselink and pattiaratchi 2001 the waves in the ocean consist of locally generated waves wind sea which are short period high frequency and the waves generated far off swells which are long period low frequency hence the wave spectrum measured at a location in the ocean will be the sum of many wave components produced by winds separated in space and time the swells can propagate great distances away from their source sverdrup and munk 1947 and hence the wave field at a location generally will be a result of both the local and remote forcing alves 2006 semedo et al 2011 rueda et al 2017 the swells can be classified based on significant wave steepness ratio of significant wave height hs and wavelength l and the distance to the generation area young 0 01 hs l 0 025 mature 0 004 hs l 0 01 and old hs l 0 004 the safety hazards associated with swells and wind sea components differ and hence it is important to differentiate between the two chawla et al 2013 due to the combined existence of swells and wind seas the wave spectra are generally bimodal for example in southern california 50 of the sea states are bimodal crosby et al 2016 the spectra with the bimodal structure are 20 25 in the north atlantic soares 1991 annually off the southern brazilian coast 31 of the spectra are multi peaked cuchiara et al 2009 in the indian coastal waters 60 of the spectra are multi peaked kumar et al 2003 in the surf zone wave reflection from very steep beaches is up to 60 for long period waves elgar et al 1994 and causes multi modal spectra multi modal waves cannot be properly defined with integrated parameters hence the wave spectrum depicting how spectral energy density is scattered over directions and frequencies are to be used to categorize different wave systems the shortcomings of using bulk wave parameters for the characterization of waves for many regions of the world are reported by portilla et al 2016 many studies use the wave direction of the largest energy peak of a spectrum which leads to potentially misleading longshore sediment transport george et al 2020 in areas where significant energy is present in secondary spectral peaks defining the peak wave period tp and mean wave direction in a case with swells and wind seas will only consider the most energetic one and disregard the other oceanographic conditions of the nearshore waters along the eastern arabian sea as are subjected to seasonal variability the as experiences three different seasons pre monsoon february may asian monsoon summer southwest monsoon june september and northeast monsoon october january the southwest sw monsoon winds are stronger and pre monsoon and northeast ne monsoon winds are generally weak accordingly the wave climate in the region is affected by the prevailing southwest winds swells propagating from the south southwest and the northwest winds glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 anoop et al 2015 2020 amrutha et al 2017 george et al 2020 the central west coast of india is in the tropical zone and hence the ocean is dominated by swells all year round due to the swell domination most of the spectral energy is in the low frequency part anjali nair and sanil kumar 2017 while swells originated in the south indian ocean and the southern ocean are a major source of wave variability in the eastern as alves 2006 naseef and kumar 2020 their energy gets dissipated on the way resulting in small significant wave heights in shallow water nonlinear triad wave wave interactions and wave dissipation by interactions with the bottom becomes crucial wave statistics of the indian coastal waters are documented by chandramohan et al 1991 based on ship reported deep water wave data the wave climate studies gain momentum after the establishment of directional wave rider buoys at various coastal locations in the shelf sea of india e g kumar et al 1999 2003 kumar and anand 2004 aboobacker et al 2011a glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 2019 even though the coastal waters of the eastern as are subjected to similar open sea conditions annually the percentage of multi peaked wave spectra varied largely within 350 km 54 in the north to 37 in the south because of the variation in local winds kumar et al 2014 understanding the spatial and temporal variability of wave climates is essential for ensuring robust coastal management in the future harvey and woodroffe 2008 the changes in the wave conditions are other major concerns for the nearshore and offshore industries understanding the wave energy from different directional sectors is less understood in the coastal areas off the central west coast of india high tides coinciding with southwest monsoon storm waves can also flood the coastal areas especially low lying areas the lack of wave data covering different years in the nearshore areas poses challenges to the coastal engineers hence they are forced to depend on numerical models or data from nearby areas computational costs limited the global operational model to a grid of 1 1 1 5 1 5 and 0 25 0 25 for regional models chawla et al 2013 thus it is crucial to assess the variations in wave characteristics from place to place within 1 1 5 which is one of the objectives of this paper to study the coastal hydrodynamics and nearshore developments waves measured in the nearshore are required by using field observations of waves and reanalysis data this paper examines the spatial and temporal variations in wave parameters at two locations off the west coast of india spaced at 125 km 1 13 along the eastern as since the changes in bathymetry cause wave refraction focusing or spreading wave energy e g ardhuin et al 2003 the wave data at the same depth contour 15 m water depth are used in the study since during the southwest monsoon in the eastern as waves break in water depth less than 10 m buoys are deployed at 15 m water depth apart from assessing the variability of wave height period direction and wave spectra at the two locations we examined i if swells propagating from the southern ocean heavily influences the local wave climate at the central west coast of india ii the seasonal change of wave spectra especially the differences of wave conditions between southwest monsoon season and the other seasons in one year since there is a lack of long term measured wave data for the eastern as the long term variations in wave height is studied based on 28 years 1992 2019 of hourly reanalysis data of significant height and maximum wave height the paper is organized as the following section 2 describes the study area data and methods used in this investigation in section 3 the obtained results are presented and discussed section 4 presents the conclusions of the study 2 data and methods 2 1 study area wave data measured at 2 locations vengurla 15 842 n 73 563 e and karwar 14 822 n 74 052 e spaced at 125 km along the eastern as fig 1 with the directional waverider buoy for three years january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 is used in the study by analysing the wave spectral characteristics at karwar from 2011 to 2015 anjali nair and sanil kumar 2017 reported that the measured spectra are represented by jonswap spectra hasselmann et al 1973 at low frequencies and donelan spectra donelan et al 1985 at high frequencies with modified spectral parameters tides in the study region are mainly semi diurnal the average tidal range at the northern location vengurla and the southern location karwar is about 2 m during the spring tide in comparison the tidal range is about 0 6 m at the northern location and is about 0 8 m at the southern location during the neap tide it is the region of heavy rainfall with an average rainfall of about 300 cm in a year the continental shelf of the study region is comparatively wide with 50 m depth occurring at 35 km 100 m at 80 km away from the coast 2 2 buoy data at each location 0 9 m diameter datawell mkiii directional waverider buoy datawell 2009 was moored with the standard mooring and the data was collected for 3 years the three accelerometers one vertical and two horizontal directions oriented orthogonally are measured and converted into translational motions in the respective direction in the internal memory of the buoy all the 3 translational motions are stored and retrieved later during the annual maintenance every 30 min data are processed as one record whereas the displacement of the buoy is recorded with a sampling interval of 0 78125s during the measurement period due to the drifting of the deployed buoy from the moored location at karwar and retrieval of wave buoys for routine maintenance 100 data could not be collected in all the years at both locations a pronounced peak of the spectral density at the low frequency side of the spectrum raises the suspicion that the stabilized platform suspension is out of order and can be spurious data datawell 2009 checked for spectral peaks that are orders of magnitude higher than 10 2 m2 hz in the frequency range 0 025 0 035 hz and found that such peaks are present in few records and these data are not used in further analysis the data used in the analysis are 85 96 5 and 99 5 at karwar and 99 9 96 and 100 at vengurla in the years 2015 2016 and 2017 wave data analysis is carried out both in the frequency and time domain wave spectrum is obtained from the fast fourier transform of eight series each consisting of 256 data points datawell 2009 significant wave height hs and the mean wave period tm02 are calculated from the wave spectral moment more details on the data analysis are available in kumar et al 2014 wave spectrum with frequency ranging from 0 025 to 0 58 hz is considered in the wave data analysis the frequency resolution is 0 005 hz for frequencies less than 0 1 hz and it is 0 01 hz from 0 1 to 0 58 hz tp and mean wave direction θm corresponds to the peak of the wave spectral energy density of the sea surface height the directional spread and wave direction are calculated following the circular moments kuik et al 1988 from the half hourly wave spectrum the monthly and seasonally averaged wave spectrum is obtained by averaging the spectral energy density at the respective frequencies over the specified time interval the time referred to in this article is the coordinated universal time utc the role of long period waves tp 12 s short period waves tp 6 s and intermediate period waves 6 tp 12 s in the measured wave data is also evaluated the direction represents where the waves come from 0 means waves are coming from the north 90 waves from the east and so on to provide a better description of the waves in the study region the wave spectra are analyzed individually and characterized by the dominance of wind sea or swell the directional spectrum e f θ is partitioned into wind seas f1 fc f2 0 58 hz and swells f1 0 025 f2 fc and each of them is further partitioned into four components as per equation 1 based on the direction of approach θ 0 168 represents reflected waves from the coast and or the waves due to sea breeze 168 248 represents waves from southern ocean indian ocean 248 276 represents the waves from southwest west and 276 360 the northwest north waves fc is the separation frequency estimated following portilla et al 2009 the wave parameters at 2 locations are inter compared using the bias bias

orthogonal function eof analysis is carried out eof analysis is performed to find out the spatial and temporal variability patterns of a variable e g preisendorfer and mobley 1988 for this study we

analysis pc of spectral energy using eof 2 3 reanalysis data reanalysis era5 data used in the study were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 hersbach et al 2020 even though era5 wave heights are compared with buoy measured data for various locations in the north indian ocean naseef and kumar 2020 the era5 hs and hmax data for the study locations are compared with the measured buoy data from 2015 to 2017 fig 2 the parameters used for comparison of the data are the root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and bias the bias signifies the average difference between the era5 and buoy data and low rmse values indicate a better fit of era5 data with measurements the correlation coefficient 0 98 for hs and 0 97 for hmax at both locations the bias is positive and varies from 0 08 m to 0 18 m for hs and 0 55 m 0 67 m for hmax positive bias indicates a higher wave height in era5 since the era5 data grid point is a comparatively deeper water depth than the buoy location era5 wave height data is higher than the buoy data the measured buoy data is a point measurement whereas the era5 data were produced on a grid with a resolution of the order of 31 km and the mean water depth at the point of interest is different from the buoy location but the wave direction in the era5 data has a large deviation from the measured buoy data in the coastal waters fig 2 buoy mean wave direction corresponds to the spectral peak and in the study area most of the time significant differences are reported in the direction of wind seas and swells amrutha et al 2016 so when wind seas and swells co exist with almost equal magnitude a large difference can be observed between era5 and buoy data 2 4 numerical wave model wavewatch iii wwiii numerical model version 4 18 tolman 1991 developed at noaa ncep national centres for environmental prediction is used for the simulation of waves the simulations are carried out for the year 2015 two model domains are considered i a big domain 75 s 35 n 20 e 112 e with a resolution of 0 5 covering the entire indian ocean and part of the southern ocean and ii a small domain 5 n 25 n 60 e 90 e with a resolution of 0 1 the model is forced with ecmwf era5 wind with 1 h resolution and bathymetry data used is from etopo1 amante and eakins 2008 the spectrum has 36 directional bins and 25 frequency bins spaced exponentially from 0 04 to 0 4056 hz further details of the model setup and the model validation with buoy measured wave data are described in amrutha et al 2016 among different parametrizations st4 physics showed the best performance for a location in the eastern as and hence in the present simulations also st4 physics is used the wave spectrum obtained from the model is compared with the buoy data of vengurla and karwar 2 5 storms and cyclones during 2015 2017 during the measurement period a number of cyclones formed in the as table 1 a brief description about all storm and cyclones occurred in as from 2015 to 2017 is presented here and the track of the cyclones are presented in fig 1 a low pressure area formed at 14 5 n 68 5 e on june 6 2015 developed into tc ashobaa on june 7 2015 and attained a peak intensity of 23 m s and moved towards the oman coast fig 1 a depression formed at 11 5 n 65 e on 28 october in central as developed as cyclonic storm chapala on october 29 2015 and moved towards western as on 30 october tc attained a peak 3 min sustained winds of 59 m s imd 2016 tc megh was formed on november 5 2015 at east central as 14 1 n 66 e followed a path similar to chapala with a peak intensity of 49 m s after moving northward the cyclone turned to the west thereafter the cyclone crossed the yemen coast tc ockhi originated in the eastern andaman sea on november 21 2017 and dissipated near the south coast of gujarat on december 6 2017 imd 2017 2 6 extreme wave analysis extreme value analysis is carried out by following the generalized extreme value gev distribution model with annual maximum values goda 1992 estimate based on annual maximum values is the common approach to ensure that the dataset truly represents extreme values and that the data are independent takbash and young 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 intra annual variability in wave spectral parameters the time series plot of hs at vengurla and karwar from january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 indicates that the pattern of variation is similar at both locations fig 3 as seen in fig 3 the overall variability of hs is distinct by an annual cycle that peaks in the southwest monsoon with hs of 5 1 m the maximum hs of 5 1 m is in 2015 at both locations whereas it is 4 2 m at vengurla and 3 8 m at karwar in other years this noticeable change in the year 2015 is mainly due to the influence of tropical cyclone tc ashobaa 7 12 june occurred in the northern as kotal et al 2016 the list of tcs formed in the as from 2015 to 2017 is listed in table 1 in december 2017 the value hs is about 2 5 m in both locations whereas in 2015 and 2016 it is less than 2 m this significant change in hs in 2017 is due to the impact of tc ockhi 28 november 6 december kumar et al 2018 observed similar changes in waves at 370 km north of vengurla during tc ockhi even though the locations karwar and vengurla are 125 km apart the high waves occurred almost simultaneously at both locations fig 3a and b the distribution of hs in different height ranges indicates that the predominant wave height ranges are 0 4 0 8 m fig 4 a with mean periods of 3 8 s with occurrences of 45 and 49 at karwar and vengurla abnormality index i e the ratio of maximum wave height to significant wave height in a record indicates that only 3 of the records in the analyzed dataset contained freak rogue waves although the number of freak waves was small all of them were with hs higher than 1 m fig 4d and e a large variation in the magnitude of tp is observed due to the combined presence of swells and wind seas in the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon periods fig 3c and d the longer period waves that are seen in fig 4 in the non monsoon period are a great example of the swell dominance in the study area the tp of 10 14 s is most frequent with 52 and 56 at karwar and vengurla fig 4b the waves are predominantly during 43 and 41 at karwar and vengurla from 210 to 230 waves are from 250 to 260 during 17 and 19 of the time at karwar and vengurla and are from 300 to 310 during 8 and 6 of the time at karwar and vengurla fig 4c the joint distribution of significant wave height and tp indicates that the most frequent 45 48 wave pattern for the southwest monsoon is with hs 1 6 2 4 m and tp 10 12 s throughout the northeast monsoon an increase in the period is observed located between 12 and 16 s though the hs 0 4 0 8 m has been the same as in the pre monsoon table 2 also there are relatively larger 20 30 short period waves 4 6 s in the pre and northeast monsoon the highest waves for each season are as follows 7 9 m with a period of 12 s for the southwest monsoon 3 9 m with a period of 8 5 s for pre monsoon and 3 1 m with a period of 7 s for northeast monsoon all these waves had their direction from w sw with the one from northeast monsoon coming from s sw the monthly mean wave parameters hs mean wave period tp wavelength percentage of swell and mean wave direction show a qualitatively close agreement between the two stations fig 5 hs and mean wave period is relatively higher at karwar than vengurla and the estimated difference in these parameters at the locations 125 km apart are about 10 15 at karwar the monthly average hs ranges from a maximum of 2 3 m in june and july and a minimum of 0 6 m from november to january whereas at vengurla it varied from 2 1 to 0 5 fig 3 in line with earlier studies e g anoop et al 2015 naseef and kumar 2020 the findlater jet findlater 1969 is found to have a strong influence on the southwest monsoon averaged hs the high hs in june july is due to the intense southwesterly swell mainly generated by the findlater jet wave height in the most energetic months can be up to a factor 3 9 greater than in the calmer months fig 3 one might hypothesize that the southern ocean swells that propagates all the way to the west coast of india to investigate this hypothesis we present the wave rose diagram of hs for measurements in different months at vengurla fig 6 from june to august during the southwest monsoon the distributions are predominantly narrow with most waves from the sw to w 240 270 with hs from 1 5 to 5 m and tp from 10 to 14 s fig 6 in february april the pattern is rather different with waves mostly from the northwest 290 320 even though the remotely generated southern swell 180 225 is relatively frequent 73 in october november the majority of the waves with hs 1 m the wave rose diagram of tp fig 6 indicates that the northwest waves have a slightly shorter period tp 8 s which implies that they are locally generated waves or young swells the locally generated wind waves and young swells are forced by regional scale wind events that occur in the directional sector between 290 and 320 from a seasonal perspective significant variations are observed in all wave properties in the study area during the southwest monsoon most of the waves 88 are young swells or wind seas 11 6 are mature swells and only 0 3 are old swells while in the northeast monsoon 50 of the waves are old swells 34 are mature swells and 16 are young swells and wind seas during pre monsoon 18 are old swells 51 are mature swells and 31 are young swells and wind seas during the southwest monsoon waves from sw w 240 270 dominate the data set with 86 and 91 of the occurrence at karwar and vengurla fig 6 that scenario modifies in northeast monsoon with a direction switch of the waves from s sw 210 230 with frequencies of 61 and 64 at the locations during pre monsoon wave characteristics are similar to that of the northeast monsoon with the most frequent waves from s sw with 54 and 51 respectively at karwar and vengurla along with waves from nw 290 310 the annual wave rose diagram at karwar and vengurla indicates changes in the northwesterly waves are relatively less at vengurla fig 6 the study shows that throughout the year swells generated by westerlies in the southern hemisphere can propagate into the study area similar to the earlier observations for locations in the eastern as amrutha et al 2017 while waves due to intertropical convergence zone induced easterly trade winds and somali jet findlater 1969 are present during june september 3 2 wave spectrum the spectral analysis decomposes the chaotic surface waves into linear waves having different heights directions and frequencies there is a low frequency signal in the study area that is present throughout the year with varying intensities fig 7 these low frequency waves correspond to the south indian ocean and the southern ocean generated swells naseef and kumar 2020 which is more intense in june july august months fig 7 there is a high frequency component that shifts its direction during the year the high frequency signal is mainly northwesterly during december april and southwesterly in june august which is directly related to the trade winds the waves dominated by local seas i e short period waves wave period 6 s in the measured data of the surface height variance is 18 59 and a relatively high percentage is seen in december april due to the enhancement in the local winds with the maximum in february fig 8 the northwesterly waves are mainly due to shamal and makran events aboobacker et al 2011b anoop et al 2020 the evaluation of the wave spectrum obtained from the numerical model wwiii is done by comparing the monthly average wave spectra with buoy data of vengurla and karwar for 2015 fig 9 it is observed that in all months the numerical model over predicts the swell part at vengurla while at karwar the numerical model slightly underestimated the swell peak except in february and november at both locations from january to may when considerable wind seas are present the model under predicts the wind sea part the input wind data used is the era5 the resolution of which 31 km is not sufficient in the coastal areas subject to sea breeze land breeze and local wind systems in addition the orographic effects and bathymetry play important role in the nearshore environment within 5 km from the coast where the measurements are done the annual mean wave spectrum for different years is displayed in fig 10 the local peaks in a wave spectrum represent various meteorological characteristics there are two predominant energy peaks at 0 077 hz 220 and 0 20 hz 290 which correspond to two predominant wave climate systems in a year during 12 2 of the time which is mainly in the non monsoon period the spectral energy of the wind sea peak is 1 8 times that of the swell the remaining time of the year 87 8 on average spectral energy at the wind sea peak is one third of that at the swell the presence of significant wind seas and swells causes a multi peak spectrum with large spectral energy at both peaks at the secondary spectral peak the spectral energy is 38 of that at the primary peak during february may the sea state off the central west coast is dominated up to 50 of the time by the short period locally generated waves in contrast during the southwest monsoon the percentages of swells are large 66 75 annual average directional spectra show the two well separated wave systems southwesterly swells and northwesterly wind seas fig 10 annually the wave spectra are single peaked during 39 4 43 6 and are maximum during the southwest monsoon period and are minimum in march april during which the multi peaked wave spectra are maximum table 3 most of the multi peaked and single peaked wave spectra are swell dominated for a location in the eastern as 130 km north of vengurla anjali et al 2016 observed that over an annual cycle 29 of the wave spectra are single peaked swell spectra and 42 are multi peaked swell spectra in a year on average 26 of the sea surface height variance is a result of wind seas from 280 to 360 and 28 are the swells from the southwest 168 248 fig 11 in a year 8 are wind seas and 16 are the swells from the directional sector 248 280 table 4 4 of the sea surface height is the swells from 280 to 360 and 9 are the wind seas from 168 to 248 the waves from 0 to 168 are the waves from the coastal direction and in a year these waves contribute 9 of the sea surface height variance fig 11 the waves from the coastal direction are partly due to the reflected waves and partly are the waves due to land breeze anoop et al 2014 seasonally significant variations are observed in both the swell and wind sea contribution to the sea surface height variance from different directional sectors table 4 from february to may the northwesterly wind seas and young swells significant wave steepness from 0 1 to 0 025 is 35 41 at vengurla and 30 47 at karwar table 4 aboobacker et al 2011b reported the presence of summer shamal waves in the eastern as during the pre monsoon period northwesterly wind seas and young swells are also significant from october to january 29 33 at vengurla and 30 33 at karwar table 4 anoop et al 2020 reported that the presence of makran winds and the associated waves in the northern as during the northeast monsoon and pre monsoon seasons october may these northwesterly waves with period less than 8s are mainly due to the shamal and the makran winds no significant variation is observed in the northwesterly waves at the two locations studied during the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon period young swells are mainly from the northwest while the mature and old swells are from the southwest fig 12 during the southwest monsoon young swells are from the west and matured and old swells are from the southwest fig 13 shows the percentage of long period wave period 12 s intermediate period and short period waves in different months at vengurla and karwar the contribution of long period swells in the wave spectral energy is least in june 8 the intermediate period waves 6 s wave period 12 s are high 62 69 from june to september due to the influence of the southwest monsoon fig 13 at both locations the variations in the percentage of different types of waves are similar at the northern location vengurla slightly higher 7 long period waves are observed compared to the southern location karwar whereas the intermediate and short period waves are higher in the southern location the mean energy wave period tm 10 gives extra weight to the lower frequencies and therefore to the longer period waves in the spectrum than mean wave periods tm02 tm 10 is higher 8 5 s during the southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon months indicating large longer period waves compared to pre monsoon months pc of the spectral density of waves at vengurla and karwar for the year 2017 indicates that the first mode shows strong variability 84 and 80 mainly in the southwest monsoon period in both regions with the same pattern fig 14 there is also a peak in november and december that shows the influence of severe tc ockhi which formed in the as all the tcs formed in the as from 2015 to 2017 are presented in table 1 in the second mode karwar shows more variability 9 2 than vengurla 6 34 due to the geographical position of these two regions karwar below vengurla during the end of november and at the beginning of december the influence of tc ockhi is clearly seen in pc2 and pc3 the influence of the sea breeze from january to may is seen in pc2 and pc3 pc of half hourly variability at vengurla in 2015 and 2017 fig 14 indicates that the first mode variability in 2015 is more than 90 that of 2017 84 southwest monsoon is the dominant factor of both years in 2015 a cyclonic storm ashobaa formed in the as from june 7 to 12 kotal et al 2016 and made landfall at the oman coast this also caused the large variability in 2015 the second mode is 6 34 and 8 2 opposite to that of the first mode which is mainly due to the influence of tc ockhi formed in as from 28 nov to dec 6 2017 imd report 2017 directional spreading is narrowest at the spectral peak fp and broadened at frequencies higher and lowers than fp the directional spreading parameter for high waves hs 3 m is less with an average value of 18 compared to the annual average of 25 in the region of the spectral peak peak frequency of the wave spectrum the components are unimodal and the number of bimodal distributions increases at both above and below the peak frequencies similar to the observations of young et al 1995 the observed directional spread at the peak frequency for swell is about 10 while for wind sea it is 30 forristall and ewans 1998 3 3 long term variations in wave height the wave climate at vengurla from 1992 to 2019 is characterized by annual mean hs of 1 19 m and that of karwar is 1 24 m maximum hs during 1992 2019 is 5 06 m at vengurla and 5 19 m at karwar while the annual mean hmax is 2 22 m and 2 34 m at vengurla and karwar with a maximum height of 9 18 m and 9 88 m at karwar at karwar the highest hs 5 19 m and hmax of 9 88 m were on may 29 2006 and the next highest value hs of 5 18 m and hmax of 9 56 m was on june 17 1996 on may 29 2006 the directional waverider buoy deployed at 14 m water depth off goa a location 72 km north of karwar recorded hs of 5 65 m and hmax of 8 m kumar et al 2010 at vengurla the highest hs 5 06 m and hmax of 9 18 m was on june 18 1996 a depression developed on june 17 1996 developed into a severe cyclonic storm arb 01 on june 18 1996 caused the highest wave heights at karwar and vengurla the buoy measured hs and hmax at 23 m water depth at allocation between karwar and vengurla 75 km north of karwar is 5 9 m and 10 1 m kumar 2006 even though vengurla and karwar are located within 125 km and are in the open ocean there is a large variation in wave height on may 29 2006 during one such event from may 29 2006 2100 h to may 30 2006 0000 h the maximum hs at karwar is 5 19 m while that at vengurla is only 3 05 m similarly during this period the maximum hmax is 9 88 m at karwar and is 5 63 m at vengurla snapshot of hs during may 29 2006 2100 h to may 30 2006 0000 h shows the variation in wave height along the eastern as fig 15 since there are significant variations in wave heights at vengirla and karwar for some metrological events as seen during 29 30 may 2006 there is significant variation in 100 year return period wave height at these two study locations the gev annual maxima model based on data from 1992 to 2019 resulted in 5 43 m as the 100 year return level for vengurla and 5 82 m for karwar the 95th percentile value of hs is 4 95 m at vengurla and 5 10 m at karwar whereas the 90th percentile values are 4 78 m and 4 94 m respectively the 100 year return period wave height values estimated with 20 year block data starting from 1992 to 2000 ranged from 4 91 to 5 63 at vengurla and 5 73 6 48 m at karwar table 5 at vengurla the 1992 2011 data block resulted in 5 63 m while at karwar 1996 2015 data block resulted in 6 48 m the higher 100 year return value at karwar compared to vengurla is due to the highest hs of 5 19 m occurred on may 29 2006 the lowest 100 year return value resulted for data from 1999 to 2018 at vengurla 4 91 m and 2000 2019 at karwar 5 73 m the maximum hs of 5 1 m measured during 2015 2017 by the buoy is less than the estimated 100 year extremes for hs of the study area the long term trend of wave climate in the different parts of major oceans is studied young et al 2011 studies of trends in mean values of wave height over the last 30 40 years have shown small increases in mean significant wave height and these trends varied regionally with the largest increases in the southern hemisphere takbash and young 2019 the present study shows that from 1992 to 2019 the annual mean hs shows a weak decreasing trend 0 093 0 14 cm year whereas hmax shows a slightly higher decreasing trend 0 33 and 0 27 cm year at the locations studied fig 16 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 observed that from 1979 to 2012 the average trend of annual mean hs for all the locations in the western shelf seas is 0 06 cm year from 1979 to 2016 nassef and kumar 2017 observed a weak increasing trend 1 1 cm year in annual maximum hs of the central west coast of india earlier many studies pointed out the difference in trend obtained by combining years before and after 1992 due to assimilation of altimeter wave heights into the reanalysis products starting in 1992 aarnes et al 2014 if the data for 1979 to 2019 is considered the trend in annual mean hs in the present study is similar to the values 0 12 cm year at vengurla and 0 13 cm year reported earlier the trend in seasonal average significant wave height and maximum wave height during 1992 2019 is presented in table 6 an increasing trend is observed during the southwest monsoon at both locations for significant wave height and maximum wave height the trend value is similar for significant wave height 0 19 and 0 18 cm year whereas a significant difference in trend value is observed for maximum wave height during the southwest monsoon while during the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon periods decreasing trend is observed in both significant wave height and maximum wave height at both locations table 6 4 conclusions this paper discussed the variations in wave spectral parameters within 125 km along the eastern arabian sea in the non monsoon the spectral characteristics are complicated by bi directional conditions and two main frequency peaks could be recognized one related to waves with tp between 4 and 6 s and another related to waves with tp between 12 and 16 s directional wave spectra indicate that the waves come predominantly from west southwest with an annual mean significant wave height of 1 m apart from the locally generated wind sea waves arriving at the central west coast of india can have three main generation sources more energetic are those forced by southwest monsoon winds followed by waves formed by northwest winds furthermore there are the southern long period swells the characterization of the measured spectra shows a predominance of multi modal cases 56 60 due to the presence of significant wind seas and swells and the unimodal spectra are relatively less spectral energy at the secondary spectral peak is 38 of energy at the principal peak the first mode of pc shows large variability 90 both at vengurla and karwar which is due to the southwest monsoon and tropical cyclones ashobaa 2015 and ockhi 2017 in the arabian sea the tropical cyclones ashobaa and ockhi caused large variations in wave parameters even though the study locations are within 125 km in the coastal waters having the same water depth there is a large variation in wave height during some metrological events and caused variations in 100 year return period values of hs in addition a large variation is observed in the 100 year return period value when different data blocks are used the long term trends observed in wave heights are relatively small even though the wave heights are reasonably well produced in the reanalysis datasets the wave direction in the coastal regions where the co existence of swells and wind seas are in similar magnitudes are poorly represented the findings of the study based on measured buoy data presented here are to be confirmed with long term measured data credit authorship

20877,examined the spatial and temporal changes in the wave spectra using waves measured in the coastal area at two locations for three years long term variability is examined with era5 reanalysis data the annual average wave spectra have a significant wave height hs of 1m at both locations during the asian monsoon june september the highest wave spectra resulted in hs of 5 1m frequently the wave pattern is with hs of 0 4 0 8m and mean period of 3 8s annually 67 of the time spectra consists of waves from 210 to 230 250 260 and 300 310 with high waves hs 4m from southwest 250 260 due to the presence of significant wind seas and swells energy at the secondary spectral peak is 38 of energy at the principal peak during february may the sea state is dominated 50 of time by locally generated waves and young swells while in monsoon the swells are large 66 75 principal component pc of spectral energy density shows that monsoon and cyclonic storms are resulting in a large variability 90 in the first mode even though the wave characteristics are similar within 125 km distance some metrological events cause significant changes in the waves and it resulted in different 100 year return period values at these locations keywords extreme waves long term variability multi peaked wave spectrum reflected waves wind generated waves 1 introduction the surface waves generated by winds waves hereafter play an important role in many scientific and practical studies waves in the coastal waters significantly impact surf zone circulation and coastal erosion thornton and guza 1986 in addition the primary mechanism for sediment transport and mixing in the coastal zone are the wave driven processes and these processes depend on the energy and direction of the incident waves masselink and pattiaratchi 2001 the waves in the ocean consist of locally generated waves wind sea which are short period high frequency and the waves generated far off swells which are long period low frequency hence the wave spectrum measured at a location in the ocean will be the sum of many wave components produced by winds separated in space and time the swells can propagate great distances away from their source sverdrup and munk 1947 and hence the wave field at a location generally will be a result of both the local and remote forcing alves 2006 semedo et al 2011 rueda et al 2017 the swells can be classified based on significant wave steepness ratio of significant wave height hs and wavelength l and the distance to the generation area young 0 01 hs l 0 025 mature 0 004 hs l 0 01 and old hs l 0 004 the safety hazards associated with swells and wind sea components differ and hence it is important to differentiate between the two chawla et al 2013 due to the combined existence of swells and wind seas the wave spectra are generally bimodal for example in southern california 50 of the sea states are bimodal crosby et al 2016 the spectra with the bimodal structure are 20 25 in the north atlantic soares 1991 annually off the southern brazilian coast 31 of the spectra are multi peaked cuchiara et al 2009 in the indian coastal waters 60 of the spectra are multi peaked kumar et al 2003 in the surf zone wave reflection from very steep beaches is up to 60 for long period waves elgar et al 1994 and causes multi modal spectra multi modal waves cannot be properly defined with integrated parameters hence the wave spectrum depicting how spectral energy density is scattered over directions and frequencies are to be used to categorize different wave systems the shortcomings of using bulk wave parameters for the characterization of waves for many regions of the world are reported by portilla et al 2016 many studies use the wave direction of the largest energy peak of a spectrum which leads to potentially misleading longshore sediment transport george et al 2020 in areas where significant energy is present in secondary spectral peaks defining the peak wave period tp and mean wave direction in a case with swells and wind seas will only consider the most energetic one and disregard the other oceanographic conditions of the nearshore waters along the eastern arabian sea as are subjected to seasonal variability the as experiences three different seasons pre monsoon february may asian monsoon summer southwest monsoon june september and northeast monsoon october january the southwest sw monsoon winds are stronger and pre monsoon and northeast ne monsoon winds are generally weak accordingly the wave climate in the region is affected by the prevailing southwest winds swells propagating from the south southwest and the northwest winds glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 anoop et al 2015 2020 amrutha et al 2017 george et al 2020 the central west coast of india is in the tropical zone and hence the ocean is dominated by swells all year round due to the swell domination most of the spectral energy is in the low frequency part anjali nair and sanil kumar 2017 while swells originated in the south indian ocean and the southern ocean are a major source of wave variability in the eastern as alves 2006 naseef and kumar 2020 their energy gets dissipated on the way resulting in small significant wave heights in shallow water nonlinear triad wave wave interactions and wave dissipation by interactions with the bottom becomes crucial wave statistics of the indian coastal waters are documented by chandramohan et al 1991 based on ship reported deep water wave data the wave climate studies gain momentum after the establishment of directional wave rider buoys at various coastal locations in the shelf sea of india e g kumar et al 1999 2003 kumar and anand 2004 aboobacker et al 2011a glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 2019 even though the coastal waters of the eastern as are subjected to similar open sea conditions annually the percentage of multi peaked wave spectra varied largely within 350 km 54 in the north to 37 in the south because of the variation in local winds kumar et al 2014 understanding the spatial and temporal variability of wave climates is essential for ensuring robust coastal management in the future harvey and woodroffe 2008 the changes in the wave conditions are other major concerns for the nearshore and offshore industries understanding the wave energy from different directional sectors is less understood in the coastal areas off the central west coast of india high tides coinciding with southwest monsoon storm waves can also flood the coastal areas especially low lying areas the lack of wave data covering different years in the nearshore areas poses challenges to the coastal engineers hence they are forced to depend on numerical models or data from nearby areas computational costs limited the global operational model to a grid of 1 1 1 5 1 5 and 0 25 0 25 for regional models chawla et al 2013 thus it is crucial to assess the variations in wave characteristics from place to place within 1 1 5 which is one of the objectives of this paper to study the coastal hydrodynamics and nearshore developments waves measured in the nearshore are required by using field observations of waves and reanalysis data this paper examines the spatial and temporal variations in wave parameters at two locations off the west coast of india spaced at 125 km 1 13 along the eastern as since the changes in bathymetry cause wave refraction focusing or spreading wave energy e g ardhuin et al 2003 the wave data at the same depth contour 15 m water depth are used in the study since during the southwest monsoon in the eastern as waves break in water depth less than 10 m buoys are deployed at 15 m water depth apart from assessing the variability of wave height period direction and wave spectra at the two locations we examined i if swells propagating from the southern ocean heavily influences the local wave climate at the central west coast of india ii the seasonal change of wave spectra especially the differences of wave conditions between southwest monsoon season and the other seasons in one year since there is a lack of long term measured wave data for the eastern as the long term variations in wave height is studied based on 28 years 1992 2019 of hourly reanalysis data of significant height and maximum wave height the paper is organized as the following section 2 describes the study area data and methods used in this investigation in section 3 the obtained results are presented and discussed section 4 presents the conclusions of the study 2 data and methods 2 1 study area wave data measured at 2 locations vengurla 15 842 n 73 563 e and karwar 14 822 n 74 052 e spaced at 125 km along the eastern as fig 1 with the directional waverider buoy for three years january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 is used in the study by analysing the wave spectral characteristics at karwar from 2011 to 2015 anjali nair and sanil kumar 2017 reported that the measured spectra are represented by jonswap spectra hasselmann et al 1973 at low frequencies and donelan spectra donelan et al 1985 at high frequencies with modified spectral parameters tides in the study region are mainly semi diurnal the average tidal range at the northern location vengurla and the southern location karwar is about 2 m during the spring tide in comparison the tidal range is about 0 6 m at the northern location and is about 0 8 m at the southern location during the neap tide it is the region of heavy rainfall with an average rainfall of about 300 cm in a year the continental shelf of the study region is comparatively wide with 50 m depth occurring at 35 km 100 m at 80 km away from the coast 2 2 buoy data at each location 0 9 m diameter datawell mkiii directional waverider buoy datawell 2009 was moored with the standard mooring and the data was collected for 3 years the three accelerometers one vertical and two horizontal directions oriented orthogonally are measured and converted into translational motions in the respective direction in the internal memory of the buoy all the 3 translational motions are stored and retrieved later during the annual maintenance every 30 min data are processed as one record whereas the displacement of the buoy is recorded with a sampling interval of 0 78125s during the measurement period due to the drifting of the deployed buoy from the moored location at karwar and retrieval of wave buoys for routine maintenance 100 data could not be collected in all the years at both locations a pronounced peak of the spectral density at the low frequency side of the spectrum raises the suspicion that the stabilized platform suspension is out of order and can be spurious data datawell 2009 checked for spectral peaks that are orders of magnitude higher than 10 2 m2 hz in the frequency range 0 025 0 035 hz and found that such peaks are present in few records and these data are not used in further analysis the data used in the analysis are 85 96 5 and 99 5 at karwar and 99 9 96 and 100 at vengurla in the years 2015 2016 and 2017 wave data analysis is carried out both in the frequency and time domain wave spectrum is obtained from the fast fourier transform of eight series each consisting of 256 data points datawell 2009 significant wave height hs and the mean wave period tm02 are calculated from the wave spectral moment more details on the data analysis are available in kumar et al 2014 wave spectrum with frequency ranging from 0 025 to 0 58 hz is considered in the wave data analysis the frequency resolution is 0 005 hz for frequencies less than 0 1 hz and it is 0 01 hz from 0 1 to 0 58 hz tp and mean wave direction θm corresponds to the peak of the wave spectral energy density of the sea surface height the directional spread and wave direction are calculated following the circular moments kuik et al 1988 from the half hourly wave spectrum the monthly and seasonally averaged wave spectrum is obtained by averaging the spectral energy density at the respective frequencies over the specified time interval the time referred to in this article is the coordinated universal time utc the role of long period waves tp 12 s short period waves tp 6 s and intermediate period waves 6 tp 12 s in the measured wave data is also evaluated the direction represents where the waves come from 0 means waves are coming from the north 90 waves from the east and so on to provide a better description of the waves in the study region the wave spectra are analyzed individually and characterized by the dominance of wind sea or swell the directional spectrum e f θ is partitioned into wind seas f1 fc f2 0 58 hz and swells f1 0 025 f2 fc and each of them is further partitioned into four components as per equation 1 based on the direction of approach θ 0 168 represents reflected waves from the coast and or the waves due to sea breeze 168 248 represents waves from southern ocean indian ocean 248 276 represents the waves from southwest west and 276 360 the northwest north waves fc is the separation frequency estimated following portilla et al 2009 the wave parameters at 2 locations are inter compared using the bias bias

0 5 0 5 hersbach et al 2020 even though era5 wave heights are compared with buoy measured data for various locations in the north indian ocean naseef and kumar 2020 the era5 hs and hmax data for the study locations are compared with the measured buoy data from 2015 to 2017 fig 2 the parameters used for comparison of the data are the root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and bias the bias signifies the average difference between the era5 and buoy data and low rmse values indicate a better fit of era5 data with measurements the correlation coefficient 0 98 for hs and 0 97 for hmax at both locations the bias is positive and varies from 0 08 m to 0 18 m for hs and 0 55 m 0 67 m for hmax positive bias indicates a higher wave height in era5 since the era5 data grid point is a comparatively deeper water depth than the buoy location era5 wave height data is higher than the buoy data the measured buoy data is a point measurement whereas the era5 data were produced on a grid with a resolution of the order of 31 km and the mean water depth at the point of interest is different from the buoy location but the wave direction in the era5 data has a large deviation from the measured buoy data in the coastal waters fig 2 buoy mean wave direction corresponds to the spectral peak and in the study area most of the time significant differences are reported in the direction of wind seas and swells amrutha et al 2016 so when wind seas and swells co exist with almost equal magnitude a large difference can be observed between era5 and buoy data 2 4 numerical wave model wavewatch iii wwiii numerical model version 4 18 tolman 1991 developed at noaa ncep national centres for environmental prediction is used for the simulation of waves the simulations are carried out for the year 2015 two model domains are considered i a big domain 75 s 35 n 20 e 112 e with a resolution of 0 5 covering the entire indian ocean and part of the southern ocean and ii a small domain 5 n 25 n 60 e 90 e with a resolution of 0 1 the model is forced with ecmwf era5 wind with 1 h resolution and bathymetry data used is from etopo1 amante and eakins 2008 the spectrum has 36 directional bins and 25 frequency bins spaced exponentially from 0 04 to 0 4056 hz further details of the model setup and the model validation with buoy measured wave data are described in amrutha et al 2016 among different parametrizations st4 physics showed the best performance for a location in the eastern as and hence in the present simulations also st4 physics is used the wave spectrum obtained from the model is compared with the buoy data of vengurla and karwar 2 5 storms and cyclones during 2015 2017 during the measurement period a number of cyclones formed in the as table 1 a brief description about all storm and cyclones occurred in as from 2015 to 2017 is presented here and the track of the cyclones are presented in fig 1 a low pressure area formed at 14 5 n 68 5 e on june 6 2015 developed into tc ashobaa on june 7 2015 and attained a peak intensity of 23 m s and moved towards the oman coast fig 1 a depression formed at 11 5 n 65 e on 28 october in central as developed as cyclonic storm chapala on october 29 2015 and moved towards western as on 30 october tc attained a peak 3 min sustained winds of 59 m s imd 2016 tc megh was formed on november 5 2015 at east central as 14 1 n 66 e followed a path similar to chapala with a peak intensity of 49 m s after moving northward the cyclone turned to the west thereafter the cyclone crossed the yemen coast tc ockhi originated in the eastern andaman sea on november 21 2017 and dissipated near the south coast of gujarat on december 6 2017 imd 2017 2 6 extreme wave analysis extreme value analysis is carried out by following the generalized extreme value gev distribution model with annual maximum values goda 1992 estimate based on annual maximum values is the common approach to ensure that the dataset truly represents extreme values and that the data are independent takbash and young 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 intra annual variability in wave spectral parameters the time series plot of hs at vengurla and karwar from january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 indicates that the pattern of variation is similar at both locations fig 3 as seen in fig 3 the overall variability of hs is distinct by an annual cycle that peaks in the southwest monsoon with hs of 5 1 m the maximum hs of 5 1 m is in 2015 at both locations whereas it is 4 2 m at vengurla and 3 8 m at karwar in other years this noticeable change in the year 2015 is mainly due to the influence of tropical cyclone tc ashobaa 7 12 june occurred in the northern as kotal et al 2016 the list of tcs formed in the as from 2015 to 2017 is listed in table 1 in december 2017 the value hs is about 2 5 m in both locations whereas in 2015 and 2016 it is less than 2 m this significant change in hs in 2017 is due to the impact of tc ockhi 28 november 6 december kumar et al 2018 observed similar changes in waves at 370 km north of vengurla during tc ockhi even though the locations karwar and vengurla are 125 km apart the high waves occurred almost simultaneously at both locations fig 3a and b the distribution of hs in different height ranges indicates that the predominant wave height ranges are 0 4 0 8 m fig 4 a with mean periods of 3 8 s with occurrences of 45 and 49 at karwar and vengurla abnormality index i e the ratio of maximum wave height to significant wave height in a record indicates that only 3 of the records in the analyzed dataset contained freak rogue waves although the number of freak waves was small all of them were with hs higher than 1 m fig 4d and e a large variation in the magnitude of tp is observed due to the combined presence of swells and wind seas in the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon periods fig 3c and d the longer period waves that are seen in fig 4 in the non monsoon period are a great example of the swell dominance in the study area the tp of 10 14 s is most frequent with 52 and 56 at karwar and vengurla fig 4b the waves are predominantly during 43 and 41 at karwar and vengurla from 210 to 230 waves are from 250 to 260 during 17 and 19 of the time at karwar and vengurla and are from 300 to 310 during 8 and 6 of the time at karwar and vengurla fig 4c the joint distribution of significant wave height and tp indicates that the most frequent 45 48 wave pattern for the southwest monsoon is with hs 1 6 2 4 m and tp 10 12 s throughout the northeast monsoon an increase in the period is observed located between 12 and 16 s though the hs 0 4 0 8 m has been the same as in the pre monsoon table 2 also there are relatively larger 20 30 short period waves 4 6 s in the pre and northeast monsoon the highest waves for each season are as follows 7 9 m with a period of 12 s for the southwest monsoon 3 9 m with a period of 8 5 s for pre monsoon and 3 1 m with a period of 7 s for northeast monsoon all these waves had their direction from w sw with the one from northeast monsoon coming from s sw the monthly mean wave parameters hs mean wave period tp wavelength percentage of swell and mean wave direction show a qualitatively close agreement between the two stations fig 5 hs and mean wave period is relatively higher at karwar than vengurla and the estimated difference in these parameters at the locations 125 km apart are about 10 15 at karwar the monthly average hs ranges from a maximum of 2 3 m in june and july and a minimum of 0 6 m from november to january whereas at vengurla it varied from 2 1 to 0 5 fig 3 in line with earlier studies e g anoop et al 2015 naseef and kumar 2020 the findlater jet findlater 1969 is found to have a strong influence on the southwest monsoon averaged hs the high hs in june july is due to the intense southwesterly swell mainly generated by the findlater jet wave height in the most energetic months can be up to a factor 3 9 greater than in the calmer months fig 3 one might hypothesize that the southern ocean swells that propagates all the way to the west coast of india to investigate this hypothesis we present the wave rose diagram of hs for measurements in different months at vengurla fig 6 from june to august during the southwest monsoon the distributions are predominantly narrow with most waves from the sw to w 240 270 with hs from 1 5 to 5 m and tp from 10 to 14 s fig 6 in february april the pattern is rather different with waves mostly from the northwest 290 320 even though the remotely generated southern swell 180 225 is relatively frequent 73 in october november the majority of the waves with hs 1 m the wave rose diagram of tp fig 6 indicates that the northwest waves have a slightly shorter period tp 8 s which implies that they are locally generated waves or young swells the locally generated wind waves and young swells are forced by regional scale wind events that occur in the directional sector between 290 and 320 from a seasonal perspective significant variations are observed in all wave properties in the study area during the southwest monsoon most of the waves 88 are young swells or wind seas 11 6 are mature swells and only 0 3 are old swells while in the northeast monsoon 50 of the waves are old swells 34 are mature swells and 16 are young swells and wind seas during pre monsoon 18 are old swells 51 are mature swells and 31 are young swells and wind seas during the southwest monsoon waves from sw w 240 270 dominate the data set with 86 and 91 of the occurrence at karwar and vengurla fig 6 that scenario modifies in northeast monsoon with a direction switch of the waves from s sw 210 230 with frequencies of 61 and 64 at the locations during pre monsoon wave characteristics are similar to that of the northeast monsoon with the most frequent waves from s sw with 54 and 51 respectively at karwar and vengurla along with waves from nw 290 310 the annual wave rose diagram at karwar and vengurla indicates changes in the northwesterly waves are relatively less at vengurla fig 6 the study shows that throughout the year swells generated by westerlies in the southern hemisphere can propagate into the study area similar to the earlier observations for locations in the eastern as amrutha et al 2017 while waves due to intertropical convergence zone induced easterly trade winds and somali jet findlater 1969 are present during june september 3 2 wave spectrum the spectral analysis decomposes the chaotic surface waves into linear waves having different heights directions and frequencies there is a low frequency signal in the study area that is present throughout the year with varying intensities fig 7 these low frequency waves correspond to the south indian ocean and the southern ocean generated swells naseef and kumar 2020 which is more intense in june july august months fig 7 there is a high frequency component that shifts its direction during the year the high frequency signal is mainly northwesterly during december april and southwesterly in june august which is directly related to the trade winds the waves dominated by local seas i e short period waves wave period 6 s in the measured data of the surface height variance is 18 59 and a relatively high percentage is seen in december april due to the enhancement in the local winds with the maximum in february fig 8 the northwesterly waves are mainly due to shamal and makran events aboobacker et al 2011b anoop et al 2020 the evaluation of the wave spectrum obtained from the numerical model wwiii is done by comparing the monthly average wave spectra with buoy data of vengurla and karwar for 2015 fig 9 it is observed that in all months the numerical model over predicts the swell part at vengurla while at karwar the numerical model slightly underestimated the swell peak except in february and november at both locations from january to may when considerable wind seas are present the model under predicts the wind sea part the input wind data used is the era5 the resolution of which 31 km is not sufficient in the coastal areas subject to sea breeze land breeze and local wind systems in addition the orographic effects and bathymetry play important role in the nearshore environment within 5 km from the coast where the measurements are done the annual mean wave spectrum for different years is displayed in fig 10 the local peaks in a wave spectrum represent various meteorological characteristics there are two predominant energy peaks at 0 077 hz 220 and 0 20 hz 290 which correspond to two predominant wave climate systems in a year during 12 2 of the time which is mainly in the non monsoon period the spectral energy of the wind sea peak is 1 8 times that of the swell the remaining time of the year 87 8 on average spectral energy at the wind sea peak is one third of that at the swell the presence of significant wind seas and swells causes a multi peak spectrum with large spectral energy at both peaks at the secondary spectral peak the spectral energy is 38 of that at the primary peak during february may the sea state off the central west coast is dominated up to 50 of the time by the short period locally generated waves in contrast during the southwest monsoon the percentages of swells are large 66 75 annual average directional spectra show the two well separated wave systems southwesterly swells and northwesterly wind seas fig 10 annually the wave spectra are single peaked during 39 4 43 6 and are maximum during the southwest monsoon period and are minimum in march april during which the multi peaked wave spectra are maximum table 3 most of the multi peaked and single peaked wave spectra are swell dominated for a location in the eastern as 130 km north of vengurla anjali et al 2016 observed that over an annual cycle 29 of the wave spectra are single peaked swell spectra and 42 are multi peaked swell spectra in a year on average 26 of the sea surface height variance is a result of wind seas from 280 to 360 and 28 are the swells from the southwest 168 248 fig 11 in a year 8 are wind seas and 16 are the swells from the directional sector 248 280 table 4 4 of the sea surface height is the swells from 280 to 360 and 9 are the wind seas from 168 to 248 the waves from 0 to 168 are the waves from the coastal direction and in a year these waves contribute 9 of the sea surface height variance fig 11 the waves from the coastal direction are partly due to the reflected waves and partly are the waves due to land breeze anoop et al 2014 seasonally significant variations are observed in both the swell and wind sea contribution to the sea surface height variance from different directional sectors table 4 from february to may the northwesterly wind seas and young swells significant wave steepness from 0 1 to 0 025 is 35 41 at vengurla and 30 47 at karwar table 4 aboobacker et al 2011b reported the presence of summer shamal waves in the eastern as during the pre monsoon period northwesterly wind seas and young swells are also significant from october to january 29 33 at vengurla and 30 33 at karwar table 4 anoop et al 2020 reported that the presence of makran winds and the associated waves in the northern as during the northeast monsoon and pre monsoon seasons october may these northwesterly waves with period less than 8s are mainly due to the shamal and the makran winds no significant variation is observed in the northwesterly waves at the two locations studied during the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon period young swells are mainly from the northwest while the mature and old swells are from the southwest fig 12 during the southwest monsoon young swells are from the west and matured and old swells are from the southwest fig 13 shows the percentage of long period wave period 12 s intermediate period and short period waves in different months at vengurla and karwar the contribution of long period swells in the wave spectral energy is least in june 8 the intermediate period waves 6 s wave period 12 s are high 62 69 from june to september due to the influence of the southwest monsoon fig 13 at both locations the variations in the percentage of different types of waves are similar at the northern location vengurla slightly higher 7 long period waves are observed compared to the southern location karwar whereas the intermediate and short period waves are higher in the southern location the mean energy wave period tm 10 gives extra weight to the lower frequencies and therefore to the longer period waves in the spectrum than mean wave periods tm02 tm 10 is higher 8 5 s during the southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon months indicating large longer period waves compared to pre monsoon months pc of the spectral density of waves at vengurla and karwar for the year 2017 indicates that the first mode shows strong variability 84 and 80 mainly in the southwest monsoon period in both regions with the same pattern fig 14 there is also a peak in november and december that shows the influence of severe tc ockhi which formed in the as all the tcs formed in the as from 2015 to 2017 are presented in table 1 in the second mode karwar shows more variability 9 2 than vengurla 6 34 due to the geographical position of these two regions karwar below vengurla during the end of november and at the beginning of december the influence of tc ockhi is clearly seen in pc2 and pc3 the influence of the sea breeze from january to may is seen in pc2 and pc3 pc of half hourly variability at vengurla in 2015 and 2017 fig 14 indicates that the first mode variability in 2015 is more than 90 that of 2017 84 southwest monsoon is the dominant factor of both years in 2015 a cyclonic storm ashobaa formed in the as from june 7 to 12 kotal et al 2016 and made landfall at the oman coast this also caused the large variability in 2015 the second mode is 6 34 and 8 2 opposite to that of the first mode which is mainly due to the influence of tc ockhi formed in as from 28 nov to dec 6 2017 imd report 2017 directional spreading is narrowest at the spectral peak fp and broadened at frequencies higher and lowers than fp the directional spreading parameter for high waves hs 3 m is less with an average value of 18 compared to the annual average of 25 in the region of the spectral peak peak frequency of the wave spectrum the components are unimodal and the number of bimodal distributions increases at both above and below the peak frequencies similar to the observations of young et al 1995 the observed directional spread at the peak frequency for swell is about 10 while for wind sea it is 30 forristall and ewans 1998 3 3 long term variations in wave height the wave climate at vengurla from 1992 to 2019 is characterized by annual mean hs of 1 19 m and that of karwar is 1 24 m maximum hs during 1992 2019 is 5 06 m at vengurla and 5 19 m at karwar while the annual mean hmax is 2 22 m and 2 34 m at vengurla and karwar with a maximum height of 9 18 m and 9 88 m at karwar at karwar the highest hs 5 19 m and hmax of 9 88 m were on may 29 2006 and the next highest value hs of 5 18 m and hmax of 9 56 m was on june 17 1996 on may 29 2006 the directional waverider buoy deployed at 14 m water depth off goa a location 72 km north of karwar recorded hs of 5 65 m and hmax of 8 m kumar et al 2010 at vengurla the highest hs 5 06 m and hmax of 9 18 m was on june 18 1996 a depression developed on june 17 1996 developed into a severe cyclonic storm arb 01 on june 18 1996 caused the highest wave heights at karwar and vengurla the buoy measured hs and hmax at 23 m water depth at allocation between karwar and vengurla 75 km north of karwar is 5 9 m and 10 1 m kumar 2006 even though vengurla and karwar are located within 125 km and are in the open ocean there is a large variation in wave height on may 29 2006 during one such event from may 29 2006 2100 h to may 30 2006 0000 h the maximum hs at karwar is 5 19 m while that at vengurla is only 3 05 m similarly during this period the maximum hmax is 9 88 m at karwar and is 5 63 m at vengurla snapshot of hs during may 29 2006 2100 h to may 30 2006 0000 h shows the variation in wave height along the eastern as fig 15 since there are significant variations in wave heights at vengirla and karwar for some metrological events as seen during 29 30 may 2006 there is significant variation in 100 year return period wave height at these two study locations the gev annual maxima model based on data from 1992 to 2019 resulted in 5 43 m as the 100 year return level for vengurla and 5 82 m for karwar the 95th percentile value of hs is 4 95 m at vengurla and 5 10 m at karwar whereas the 90th percentile values are 4 78 m and 4 94 m respectively the 100 year return period wave height values estimated with 20 year block data starting from 1992 to 2000 ranged from 4 91 to 5 63 at vengurla and 5 73 6 48 m at karwar table 5 at vengurla the 1992 2011 data block resulted in 5 63 m while at karwar 1996 2015 data block resulted in 6 48 m the higher 100 year return value at karwar compared to vengurla is due to the highest hs of 5 19 m occurred on may 29 2006 the lowest 100 year return value resulted for data from 1999 to 2018 at vengurla 4 91 m and 2000 2019 at karwar 5 73 m the maximum hs of 5 1 m measured during 2015 2017 by the buoy is less than the estimated 100 year extremes for hs of the study area the long term trend of wave climate in the different parts of major oceans is studied young et al 2011 studies of trends in mean values of wave height over the last 30 40 years have shown small increases in mean significant wave height and these trends varied regionally with the largest increases in the southern hemisphere takbash and young 2019 the present study shows that from 1992 to 2019 the annual mean hs shows a weak decreasing trend 0 093 0 14 cm year whereas hmax shows a slightly higher decreasing trend 0 33 and 0 27 cm year at the locations studied fig 16 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 observed that from 1979 to 2012 the average trend of annual mean hs for all the locations in the western shelf seas is 0 06 cm year from 1979 to 2016 nassef and kumar 2017 observed a weak increasing trend 1 1 cm year in annual maximum hs of the central west coast of india earlier many studies pointed out the difference in trend obtained by combining years before and after 1992 due to assimilation of altimeter wave heights into the reanalysis products starting in 1992 aarnes et al 2014 if the data for 1979 to 2019 is considered the trend in annual mean hs in the present study is similar to the values 0 12 cm year at vengurla and 0 13 cm year reported earlier the trend in seasonal average significant wave height and maximum wave height during 1992 2019 is presented in table 6 an increasing trend is observed during the southwest monsoon at both locations for significant wave height and maximum wave height the trend value is similar for significant wave height 0 19 and 0 18 cm year whereas a significant difference in trend value is observed for maximum wave height during the southwest monsoon while during the pre monsoon and northeast monsoon periods decreasing trend is observed in both significant wave height and maximum wave height at both locations table 6 4 conclusions this paper discussed the variations in wave spectral parameters within 125 km along the eastern arabian sea in the non monsoon the spectral characteristics are complicated by bi directional conditions and two main frequency peaks could be recognized one related to waves with tp between 4 and 6 s and another related to waves with tp between 12 and 16 s directional wave spectra indicate that the waves come predominantly from west southwest with an annual mean significant wave height of 1 m apart from the locally generated wind sea waves arriving at the central west coast of india can have three main generation sources more energetic are those forced by southwest monsoon winds followed by waves formed by northwest winds furthermore there are the southern long period swells the characterization of the measured spectra shows a predominance of multi modal cases 56 60 due to the presence of significant wind seas and swells and the unimodal spectra are relatively less spectral energy at the secondary spectral peak is 38 of energy at the principal peak the first mode of pc shows large variability 90 both at vengurla and karwar which is due to the southwest monsoon and tropical cyclones ashobaa 2015 and ockhi 2017 in the arabian sea the tropical cyclones ashobaa and ockhi caused large variations in wave parameters even though the study locations are within 125 km in the coastal waters having the same water depth there is a large variation in wave height during some metrological events and caused variations in 100 year return period values of hs in addition a large variation is observed in the 100 year return period value when different data blocks are used the long term trends observed in wave heights are relatively small even though the wave heights are reasonably well produced in the reanalysis datasets the wave direction in the coastal regions where the co existence of swells and wind seas are in similar magnitudes are poorly represented the findings of the study based on measured buoy data presented here are to be confirmed with long term measured data credit authorship

20878,the blade airfoil significantly influences the performance of wind turbine this study designs a new hybrid blade airfoil abbreviated as hba based on the previous airfoils s809 and naca 63215 the surface flow modes wake flow characteristics and aerodynamic performance of hba were tested using various reynolds numbers and angles of attack the experimental methods involved 1 the smoke wire visualization at low wind speeds 2 the surface oil flow visualization at high wind speeds 3 the hot wire anemometry and 4 the six force moment balancer at blade stall the lift coefficient of 2 12 for hba is approximately twice that of 1 07 for s809 and naca63215 the maximum lift drag ratio of 6 11 for hba is approximately twice those 3 63 and 3 13 of s809 and naca 63215 moreover the hba has a higher stall angle than those of the other two blades the pitch moment coefficient of hba is also higher than those of s809 and naca 63215 keywords wind turbine blade surface flow mode wake flow characteristics aerodynamic performance 1 introduction the importance of wind power as a renewable and clean energy source has gradually increased sørensen 2011 hansen and madsen 2011 and other researchers have conducted basic researches on the fluid mechanics of typical wind turbines in the application of blade design and wind turbine components they used the flow control mechanism of separation flow the boundary layer on blade surface under certain designs can effectively control the flow field around wind turbine blades thus an increased pressure difference between the suction and pressure surfaces can be achieved which changes the characteristics of aerodynamic performance and improves the wind turbine efficiency the design concept of wind turbine blades is similar to that of wing airfoils however the wing airfoils were utilized in the low and high speed flight and therefore the thickness and airfoil symmetry are important factors in wing design the wind turbine blades were utilized in low speed regime and unsteady flow condition therefore the camber and the twist blade design are the main factors in wind turbine design the previous papers ward 1963 carmichael 1981 mueller and batill 1982 regarding blades and aircraft wings mostly based on the traditional airfoil theories to explore the influence of surface flow and wake flow structures on the aerodynamic performance carmichael 1981 conducted a research on the characteristics of different moving bodies under reynolds number in the range of 102 to 109 for instance volant animals aircrafts and drones have a reynolds number of 104 to 106 he found that the aerodynamic performance is poor when reynolds number is lower than 105 and the aerodynamic performance improves considerably as reynolds number is over 105 ward 1963 revealed that the short separation bubble i e bubble length less than chord about 1 has insignificant effect on the pressure distribution of wing surface however the long separation bubble significantly changed the pressure distribution in addition the lift and drag decreased as the angle of attack α increased mueller and batill 1982 utilized a naca 663 018 to study the effect of surface flow behaviors on the aerodynamic performance they found that a leading edge bubble occurred at re 40 000 and α 8 this leading edge bubble caused a sudden loss of lift for re being about 130 000 and α ranging in 0 and 4 a negative lift coefficient occurred due to the occurrence of laminar separation yen and hsu 2007a used a finite swept back wing naca 0012 aspect ratio 10 to experimentally study the effects of reynolds number and angle of attack on the boundary layer and the aerodynamic performance the characteristic boundary layer flow significantly influenced the lift drag and moment coefficients furthermore the separation bubble length and leading edge bubble length shortened significantly as the angle of attack increases numerous studies on flow structures roshko 1955 lissaman 1983 zaman et al 1989 studied the airfoil surface flow and wake flow lissaman 1983 investigated laminar flow separation the transitional phase and the reattachment of wings at low reynolds numbers the separation occurred around the minimum pressure point in laminar boundary layer which extended from the stagnation point to trailing edge huang et al 2001 utilized a naca 0012 to study the formation evolution and shedding processes of vortex system on the suction surface the particle tracking flow visualization ptfv and particle image velocimetry piv were utilized to obtain the vortex evolution process five characteristic vortex patterns i e attached flow trailing edge vortex separation vortex leading edge vortex and bluff body were identified yen and hsu 2007b utilized a finite swept back wing naca 0012 swept back angle of 15 to experimentally study the flow patterns velocity properties and vortex shedding in the wake five characteristic smoke streak flow modes attached surface flow instability wave in wake vortical wake separation from near leading edge and bluff body wake were classified the instability and shedding of wake flow can be attributed to the instability wave in the shear layer caused from boundary layer separation on the wing surface zaman et al 1989 roshko 1955 found that when the reynolds number is between 103 and 105 the strouhal number st of a cylinder 90 bluff body and plate are constant at 0 21 0 18 and 0 14 respectively this result indicates that the more sharp and flat an object is the lower is the st number huang and lin 1995 have used wind tunnel to measure the vortex flow structure near the wing trailing edge huang et al have obtained two results first at a low reynolds number the st decreases with an increase in the re second at a high reynolds number the st remains constant some relevant experimental investigations studied the flow over wind turbine blades alamian et al 2020 studied the efficiency of a 100 w horizontal axis tidal turbine their experiment results indicated that the turbine performance was close to the surface of the water at different flow speeds the optimum electrical load was found to be promoted 16 40 in efficiency pernod et al 2019 investigated the fluid structure interaction using a flexible composite hydrofoil the strong coupling occurred between fluid and structure with lock in of von karman vortex shedding to the structure for small incidences tafazzoli et al 2020 studied a catenary mooring system for a spar floating wind turbine for the heave roll pitch and yaw degrees of freedom their results show that the minimum structure oscillation happens in the length of 25 m and finally considers the proper behavior of the structure in the length of 25 m this length of chain was added to the anchor chain yen et al 2017 explored the effects of different arrangements such as side by side and tandem in wind turbine towers under various reynolds numbers the characteristic flow modes for the side by side configuration are the anti and in phase vortex modes and those for the tandem arrangement are the single attached and bi vortex modes for side by side wind towers the wake flow field behaved like that of single one when side by side gap ratio is higher than 1 0 the current work is motivated to improve the wind turbine blade efficiency using a new designed blade airfoil this new blade airfoil merged the shapes of s809 and naca 63215 for analyzing the performance of this new designed blade airfoil the surface flow characteristics on blade airfoil wake flow properties and aerodynamic loadings were investigated and measured for observing the flow structures the smoke wire visualization was utilized at low wind speeds and surface oil visualization at high wind speeds the wake flow behind the blade airfoil was detected using the hot wire anemometry the aerodynamic loadings were measured using the six force moment balancer 2 experimental setup 2 1 apparatus fig 1 displays the setup of the experimental equipments in this study yen et al 2017 an open loop wind tunnel was used to obtain a uniform steady flow the wind tunnel comprised six components the filter section inlet dimension 200 2 00 cm2 settling chamber nozzle test section diffuser section outlet diameter 95 cm and axial flow fan the test section had dimensions of 50 cm length 50 cm width 120 cm depth a highly transparent acrylic was installed the test section to observe and photograph the flow structures the blade models were installed at a distance of 30 cm to the test section inlet in x direction and along the centerline of test section floor in z direction for removing the boundary effect munson et al 1994 the blade models were supported perpendicular on a boundary control disc with 1 5 cm gap to the test section floor the turbulence intensity t i was lower than 0 2 as the wind speed in the test section was lower than 3 13 m s the t i increased with the wind speed in addition the t i became almost constant at 0 37 when the wind speed is over 12 52 m s to measure the locations of flow patterns the coordinate system was utilized and its origin was set at the intersection point of leading edge and blade root i e near the test section floor 2 2 blade model the hybrid blade model in the experiment was designed using the two well known blades which comprises an s809 airfoil as the suction surface and a naca 63215 airfoil as the pressure surface the naca 63215 s809 and hybrid blade model had a 6 cm chord and 30 cm half span i e full span aspect

their stable flow structures using smoke wire flow technique a smoke wire was composed of vaporized oil particles that were generated by electric heating paraffin oil on a z shaped resistor the oil particles were observed through the process of diffuse reflection firstly the paraffin oil was brushed on the surface of heating tungsten wire secondly the wire was heated using the electric power to generate smoke particles the characteristic diameter 0 2 mm of heating wire revealed that the wire reynolds number was maintained less than 40 which reduced the appearance of vortex shedding behind the tungsten wire the diameter of smoke particles measured using a laser particle analyzer malvern 1600c was in the range of 1 7 0 3 μm and the smoke density was found to be 5 31 kg m3 this diameter showed that the stoke number flagan and seinfeld 1988 was approximately 10 3 which was significantly less than 1 therefore the smoke particles were reported that they coincided with the air flow yen and fei 2011 in this study the complicated flow structures of the airflow were recorded with a high speed camera nikon d800 camera 2 4 detection of vortex frequency using hot wire anemometry to determine the physical state of an unstable structure in the wake of wind turbine blades a hot wire probe was installed behind the blades the signal of the hot wire probe was input into a fast fourier transform fft analyzer and data acquisition system after the quantified statistical analysis the unstable state of wake flow was investigated in terms of the changes in time t and frequency f domains the hot wire anemometer was set at a constant temperature with a wire diameter of 5 μm and wire length of 1 5 mm the reactive frequency was set as approximately 20 000 hz when detecting the signal of the vortex street structure in the bluff body wake the frequency of the dynamic flow structure did not exceed 300 hz consequently when the sampling ratio was over 10 000 hz and the sample point was at 15 000 points was sufficient for illustrating the flow structures 2 5 force detection on blades the blades were utilized to generate the lift the blade design is related to the lift drag ratio the higher the lift drag ratio is the higher the blade efficiency improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the blades used in this study were measured with the jr3 universal force moment system with a ufs 2012a 15 six component force moment detector the maximum weight capacity of the aforementioned system is f x f y f z 6 kg the maximum torque that can be measured is f x f y f z 30 kg cm and the maximum detection frequency is 250 hz the electric signals of the force and torque were sent to a fft analyzer to calculate the force and torque on the blades 2 6 uncertainties the measurement uncertainty about free stream velocity was estimated at about 3 by using a synchronized micro pressure calibration system the uncertainty of angle of attack α was controlled less than 0 5 using a dividing head adjuster the uncertainties of lift drag and pitching moment estimated using the calibration matrix were 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 respectively therefore the uncertainties of c l c d and c m were about 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 smoke streak flow patterns under low reynolds numbers re 1 2 104 the surface flow on the blades was observed at different angles of attack using the smoke wire technique to visualize the flow patterns as shown in fig 2 under a reynolds number of 8 000 the performance of new designed blade i e hba was classified into three categories according to the images captured from the camera surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge region and bluff body wake at an angle of attack α of 0 the laminar boundary layer on the suction surface of hba separated from the trailing edge the angle of attack affects the position of separation point the shortest distance to the leading edge occurs at α 20 as displayed in figs 2 a and b hba shows the shear layer instability and generates a vortex similar to karman s vortex due to the boundary layer separation the dimension of the generated vortical wake increases with the angle of attack when α is within 0 20 the flow pattern is identified as the surface boundary layer separation when the angle of attack is within 20 40 the separation point is almost at the leading edge as shown figs 2 c and d the flow momentum at the boundary layer is low due to the low reynolds number i e low flow speed the low flow momentum cannot shift the boundary layer into turbulent flow therefore the separation of boundary layer at the suction surface forms a shear layer and the shear layer at the pressure surface generates a small karman vortex this flow pattern was identified as separation from near leading edge with an angle of attack over 40 the distance between the shear layers of the leading and trailing edges increased with the angle of attack for hba the interference of unstable waves disappeared and the unstable waves generated the vortex shedding with an increase in the angle of attack the asymmetrical state of the shear layers gradually became symmetric this flow pattern was identified as the bluff body wake 3 2 surface oil flow patterns the development of surface oil flow patterns on the airfoil surface was observed at different angles of attack under high reynolds numbers re 2 4 104 in this study the surface of hba was coated with a layer of blue colored oil and tested at reynolds number of 8 0 104 using different angles of attack figs 3 a e shows the surface oil flow patterns and figs 3 f j display the hand drawn sketches of figs 3 a e the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of less than 10 are displayed in fig 3 a and f the first upstream dark blue line in the figures represents the separation line the front tip of the separation line was attached to the surface of the airfoil and is known as the attached flow the flow at the wingtips matched the flows observed by bertin and smith 1989 the curving of the separation line toward the front was most likely caused by the tip vortex a vortex appeared near the root of the separation line due to the root effect this phenomenon matched that observed for the plane and cylinder junction in the study of rizzetta 1994 the second blue line in fig 3 a represents the reattachment line which indicates that the reattachment of fluids on the wing surface created a separation bubble and that the separation boundary layer created a turbulent boundary layer downstream of the separation point this pattern is identified as the separation bubble the surface oil flow patterns under the angle of attack of 10 14 are displayed in figs 3 b and g these figures indicate that the separation bubble still existed and moved toward the leading edge with the increase of angle of attack furthermore a surface vortex was generated near the root of hba blade three dark blue lines exist on the blade surface the upstream dark blue line near the leading edge and the downstream line near the trailing edge are the separation lines and the center blue line is the reattachment line this flow pattern is identified as secondary separation the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of 14 19 are depicted in figs 3 c and h these figures indicate that the upstream separation line was extremely close to the leading edge a vortex was created on the pressure surface due to the high turbulent intensity near the root of blade yen et al 2013 this pattern is identified as the leading edge bubble the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of 19 28 are depicted in figs 3 d and i these figures indicate that a strong three dimensional 3d flow existed on the blade surface the leading edge separation bubble was larger than those under lower angles of attack two vortices were created near the wingtip and the wing root on the pressure surface caused from the considerable influence of the wingtip and wall effects which is in agreement with the finding of winkelman and barlow 1980 this flow pattern is identified as 3d flow the surface oil flow patterns obtained under an angle of attack of over 28 are displayed in figs 3 e and j the surface oil flow moved at an extremely low speed with the appearance of recirculation bubbles due to the high reverse pressure this flow pattern is identified as bluff body wake 3 3 flow visualization areas the figures obtained under different reynolds numbers angle of attacks and different visualization methods i e smoke wire in fig 2 and surface oil flow in fig 3 can be classified into eight flow patterns surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge bluff body wake separation bubbles secondary separation leading edge bubbles 3d flow and bluff body wake respectively as displayed in fig 4 the surface boundary layer at low reynolds numbers exhibits three patterns surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge and bluff body wake furthermore the flow patterns obtained under high reynolds numbers using the surface oil flow visualization can be classified into five types separation bubbles secondary separation leading edge bubbles 3d flow and bluff body wake as shown in fig 4 the bluff body wake pattern always occurs at high angle of attack due to the high reverse pressure in the wake at lower angle of attack the high flow momentum at high reynolds numbers caused the separated flow reattached to the blades surface and generated the separation bubble on the blade surface 3 4 turbulence intensity the turbulence intensity t i was measured with the tsi two dimensional constant temperature hot wire anemometer the probed data were captured and analyzed with the ni daq acquisition system and lab view analyzer software the hot wire probe was installed in the wake flow section at x c 2 5 and y c 3 the distribution of turbulence intensity for hba at reynolds number of 8 0 104 is illustrated in fig 5 the turbulence intensity increases with the angle of attack until the angle of attack reached 38 at which the maximum t i of 4 5 occurred when the angle of attack is over 38 the turbulence intensity decreased with an increase in the angle of attack due to bluff body effect for the angle of attack higher than 50 the t i becomes almost a constant of 3 3 3 5 vortex shedding frequency in the wake fig 6 presents the strouhal number of hba which was calculated from the definition of st d fd u f vortex shedding frequency d projected length of wing section normal to the airstream and u free stream speed by using the vortex shedding frequency measured in the wake region at x c 2 5 and y c 3 at a fixed reynolds number of 8 0 104 fig 6 indicates that st d is approximately 0 32 when the angle of attack is 0 with an increase in the angle of attack the strouhal number decreases to approximately 0 2 the strouhal number obtained for hba approximately 0 2 is similar to those obtained by zdravkovich 1996 and roshko 1955 for a single cylinder 3 6 aerodynamic performance 3 6 1 lift coefficient fig 7 shows the lift drag momentum coefficients and the lift drag ratio with changing the angle of attack the three airfoils i e hba naca 63215 and s809 were tested at a fixed reynolds number of 8 0 104 in fig 7 a the maximum lift coefficient c lmax is 2 12 for hba 1 07 for naca 63215 and 1 07 for s809 at angle of attack of 13 9 and 12 respectively furthermore the c l data from somers 1997 and filho et al 2013 have shown in fig 7 a using the solid symbols among three airfoils hba exhibited the highest lift coefficient which is almost twice that of s809 and naca 63215 the hba also has a higher stall angle of attack compared with the other two airfoils 3 6 2 drag coefficient fig 7 b shows the variations of drag coefficient c d with respect to the angle of attack at re 8 104 in fig 7 b the c d increases with the angle of attack for these three blade airfoils fig 7 b also shows that the c d curve has a significant increase after the stall angle of attack and s809 has the highest c d the drag coefficient above the stall angle of attack c dstall was 0 37 for hba 0 46 for s809 and 0 28 for naca 63215 3 6 3 moment coefficient fig 7 c shows the variations of moment coefficient c m with respect to angle of attack the moment coefficient just below the stall angle of attack c mstall is 0 82 0 51 and 0 56 for hba s809 and naca 63215 respectively the moment coefficient after stall c m was 0 65 0 36 and 0 46 for hba s809 and naca 63215 respectively the hba had a higher moment coefficient than those of the other two airfoils thus hba outperformed s809 and naca 63215 3 6 4 lift drag ratio as displayed in fig 7 d the lift drag increased with the angle of attack before stall the hba has the highest lift drag ratio among these three airfoils the maximum lift drag ratios are 6 11 3 6 and 3 2 for hba s809 and naca63215 respectively fig 7 d also shows that the lift drag ratios decrease beyond the stall angle and approach toward 1 81 1 43 and 0 86 for hba naca63215 and s809 respectively 3 6 5 cl vs cd when wind flowed along the suction and pressure surfaces the aerodynamic forces were generated along the blade surfaces the aerodynamic forces were of two types the lift perpendicular to the chord and the drag along the wing direction although increasing the lift is important the increased drag generated with an increased lift must also be considered fig 8 illustrates the relationship between the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient for hba s809 and naca 63215 with changing the angle of attack and a fixed reynolds number of 8 104 the lift coefficient c l increased and the drag coefficient c d also increased before the blade stall at blade stall the maximum lift coefficient of hba is approximately 2 1 and its drag coefficient is 0 37 in addition the maximum lift coefficient of s809 and naca63215 are approximately 1 06 and their drag coefficients are 0 46 and 0 28 for s809 and naca63215 respectively consequently the lift coefficient of hba is approximately twice those of s809 and naca 63215 3 6 6 maximum lift drag ratio the maximum lift drag ratios of these three airfoils at different reynolds numbers were tested and presented in fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 the lift drag ratio increased with reynolds number the hba has the highest lift drag ratio at reynolds number of 80 000 the lift drag ratios of hba s809 and naca 63215 are 6 11 3 63 and 3 13 respectively thus the lift drag ratio of hba is almost twice that of naca 63215 3 7 aerodynamic performance at stall 3 7 1 stall angle of attack fig 10 a shows the curves of stall angle of attack α stall for the hba s809 and naca 63215 with changing the reynolds number the hba has the maximum α stall among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 a also shows that the reynolds number has a weak effect on the stall angle of attack 3 7 2 lift coefficient at stall as displayed in fig 10 b the maximum lift coefficient c lmax increased gradually with the reynolds number the hba has the highest maximum c lmax among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 b shows that the c lmax is approximately 2 1 for hba and 1 07 for s809 and naca63215 thus the maximum lift coefficient of hba is approximately twice that of s809 and naca 63215 3 7 3 drag coefficient at stall fig 10 c illustrates the drag coefficient at stall c dstall with changing the reynolds number with an increase in the reynolds number the c dstall marginally decreased for hba and naca63215 and c dstall decreased significantly at high reynolds number for s809 fig 10 c also shows that the s809 has the highest c dstall among these three blade airfoils and the c dstall for hba is higher than that of naca63215 3 7 4 moment coefficient at stall as depicted in fig 10 d the moment coefficient at stall c msatll of hba s809 and naca 63215 decreased marginally with an increase in reynolds number the curve of c msatll shows that the hba has the highest pitch moment among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 d also shows that the value of c msatll is similar for s809 and naca 63215 thus the aerodynamic performance of hba is superior to those of s809 and naca 63215 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to design a new blade model hba based on two well known airfoils i e s809 and naca 63215 for determining the surface flow modes wake flow characteristics and aerodynamic performance of this new blade at different reynolds numbers and angles of attack the following conclusions were obtained according to the analysis of experimental results 1 under a reynolds number re of less than 12 000 the smoke streak flow

characteristics aerodynamic performance 1 introduction the importance of wind power as a renewable and clean energy source has gradually increased sørensen 2011 hansen and madsen 2011 and other researchers have conducted basic researches on the fluid mechanics of typical wind turbines in the application of blade design and wind turbine components they used the flow control mechanism of separation flow the boundary layer on blade surface under certain designs can effectively control the flow field around wind turbine blades thus an increased pressure difference between the suction and pressure surfaces can be achieved which changes the characteristics of aerodynamic performance and improves the wind turbine efficiency the design concept of wind turbine blades is similar to that of wing airfoils however the wing airfoils were utilized in the low and high speed flight and therefore the thickness and airfoil symmetry are important factors in wing design the wind turbine blades were utilized in low speed regime and unsteady flow condition therefore the camber and the twist blade design are the main factors in wind turbine design the previous papers ward 1963 carmichael 1981 mueller and batill 1982 regarding blades and aircraft wings mostly based on the traditional airfoil theories to explore the influence of surface flow and wake flow structures on the aerodynamic performance carmichael 1981 conducted a research on the characteristics of different moving bodies under reynolds number in the range of 102 to 109 for instance volant animals aircrafts and drones have a reynolds number of 104 to 106 he found that the aerodynamic performance is poor when reynolds number is lower than 105 and the aerodynamic performance improves considerably as reynolds number is over 105 ward 1963 revealed that the short separation bubble i e bubble length less than chord about 1 has insignificant effect on the pressure distribution of wing surface however the long separation bubble significantly changed the pressure distribution in addition the lift and drag decreased as the angle of attack α increased mueller and batill 1982 utilized a naca 663 018 to study the effect of surface flow behaviors on the aerodynamic performance they found that a leading edge bubble occurred at re 40 000 and α 8 this leading edge bubble caused a sudden loss of lift for re being about 130 000 and α ranging in 0 and 4 a negative lift coefficient occurred due to the occurrence of laminar separation yen and hsu 2007a used a finite swept back wing naca 0012 aspect ratio 10 to experimentally study the effects of reynolds number and angle of attack on the boundary layer and the aerodynamic performance the characteristic boundary layer flow significantly influenced the lift drag and moment coefficients furthermore the separation bubble length and leading edge bubble length shortened significantly as the angle of attack increases numerous studies on flow structures roshko 1955 lissaman 1983 zaman et al 1989 studied the airfoil surface flow and wake flow lissaman 1983 investigated laminar flow separation the transitional phase and the reattachment of wings at low reynolds numbers the separation occurred around the minimum pressure point in laminar boundary layer which extended from the stagnation point to trailing edge huang et al 2001 utilized a naca 0012 to study the formation evolution and shedding processes of vortex system on the suction surface the particle tracking flow visualization ptfv and particle image velocimetry piv were utilized to obtain the vortex evolution process five characteristic vortex patterns i e attached flow trailing edge vortex separation vortex leading edge vortex and bluff body were identified yen and hsu 2007b utilized a finite swept back wing naca 0012 swept back angle of 15 to experimentally study the flow patterns velocity properties and vortex shedding in the wake five characteristic smoke streak flow modes attached surface flow instability wave in wake vortical wake separation from near leading edge and bluff body wake were classified the instability and shedding of wake flow can be attributed to the instability wave in the shear layer caused from boundary layer separation on the wing surface zaman et al 1989 roshko 1955 found that when the reynolds number is between 103 and 105 the strouhal number st of a cylinder 90 bluff body and plate are constant at 0 21 0 18 and 0 14 respectively this result indicates that the more sharp and flat an object is the lower is the st number huang and lin 1995 have used wind tunnel to measure the vortex flow structure near the wing trailing edge huang et al have obtained two results first at a low reynolds number the st decreases with an increase in the re second at a high reynolds number the st remains constant some relevant experimental investigations studied the flow over wind turbine blades alamian et al 2020 studied the efficiency of a 100 w horizontal axis tidal turbine their experiment results indicated that the turbine performance was close to the surface of the water at different flow speeds the optimum electrical load was found to be promoted 16 40 in efficiency pernod et al 2019 investigated the fluid structure interaction using a flexible composite hydrofoil the strong coupling occurred between fluid and structure with lock in of von karman vortex shedding to the structure for small incidences tafazzoli et al 2020 studied a catenary mooring system for a spar floating wind turbine for the heave roll pitch and yaw degrees of freedom their results show that the minimum structure oscillation happens in the length of 25 m and finally considers the proper behavior of the structure in the length of 25 m this length of chain was added to the anchor chain yen et al 2017 explored the effects of different arrangements such as side by side and tandem in wind turbine towers under various reynolds numbers the characteristic flow modes for the side by side configuration are the anti and in phase vortex modes and those for the tandem arrangement are the single attached and bi vortex modes for side by side wind towers the wake flow field behaved like that of single one when side by side gap ratio is higher than 1 0 the current work is motivated to improve the wind turbine blade efficiency using a new designed blade airfoil this new blade airfoil merged the shapes of s809 and naca 63215 for analyzing the performance of this new designed blade airfoil the surface flow characteristics on blade airfoil wake flow

test section inlet in x direction and along the centerline of test section floor in z direction for removing the boundary effect munson et al 1994 the blade models were supported perpendicular on a boundary control disc with 1 5 cm gap to the test section floor the turbulence intensity t i was lower than 0 2 as the wind speed in the test section was lower than 3 13 m s the t i increased with the wind speed in addition the t i became almost constant at 0 37 when the wind speed is over 12 52 m s to measure the locations of flow patterns the coordinate system was utilized and its origin was set at the intersection point of leading edge and blade root i e near the test section floor 2 2 blade model the hybrid blade model in the experiment was designed using the two well known blades which

their stable flow structures using smoke wire flow technique a smoke wire was composed of vaporized oil particles that were generated by electric heating paraffin oil on a z shaped resistor the oil particles were observed through the process of diffuse reflection firstly the paraffin oil was brushed on the surface of heating tungsten wire secondly the wire was heated using the electric power to generate smoke particles the characteristic diameter 0 2 mm of heating wire revealed that the wire reynolds number was maintained less than 40 which reduced the appearance of vortex shedding behind the tungsten wire the diameter of smoke particles measured using a laser particle analyzer malvern 1600c was in the range of 1 7 0 3 μm and the smoke density was found to be 5 31 kg m3 this diameter showed that the stoke number flagan and seinfeld 1988 was approximately 10 3 which was significantly less than 1 therefore the smoke particles were reported that they coincided with the air flow yen and fei 2011 in this study the complicated flow structures of the airflow were recorded with a high speed camera nikon d800 camera 2 4 detection of vortex frequency using hot wire anemometry to determine the physical state of an unstable structure in the wake of wind turbine blades a hot wire probe was installed behind the blades the signal of the hot wire probe was input into a fast fourier transform fft analyzer and data acquisition system after the quantified statistical analysis the unstable state of wake flow was investigated in terms of the changes in time t and frequency f domains the hot wire anemometer was set at a constant temperature with a wire diameter of 5 μm and wire length of 1 5 mm the reactive frequency was set as approximately 20 000 hz when detecting the signal of the vortex street structure in the bluff body wake the frequency of the dynamic flow structure did not exceed 300 hz consequently when the sampling ratio was over 10 000 hz and the sample point was at 15 000 points was sufficient for illustrating the flow structures 2 5 force detection on blades the blades were utilized to generate the lift the blade design is related to the lift drag ratio the higher the lift drag ratio is the higher the blade efficiency improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the blades used in this study were measured with the jr3 universal force moment system with a ufs 2012a 15 six component force moment detector the maximum weight capacity of the aforementioned system is f x f y f z 6 kg the maximum torque that can be measured is f x f y f z 30 kg cm and the maximum detection frequency is 250 hz the electric signals of the force and torque were sent to a fft analyzer to calculate the force and torque on the blades 2 6 uncertainties the measurement

attack using the smoke wire technique to visualize the flow patterns as shown in fig 2 under a reynolds number of 8 000 the performance of new designed blade i e hba was classified into three categories according to the images captured from the camera surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge region and bluff body wake at an angle of attack α of 0 the laminar boundary layer on the suction surface of hba separated from the trailing edge the angle of attack affects the position of separation point the shortest distance to the leading edge occurs at α 20 as displayed in figs 2 a and b hba shows the shear layer instability and generates a vortex similar to karman s vortex due to the boundary layer separation the dimension of the generated vortical wake increases with the angle of attack when α is within 0 20 the flow pattern is identified as the surface boundary layer separation when the angle of attack is within 20 40 the separation point is almost at the leading edge as shown figs 2 c and d the flow momentum at the boundary layer is low due to the low reynolds number i e low flow speed the low flow momentum cannot shift the boundary layer into turbulent flow therefore the separation of boundary layer at the suction surface forms a shear layer and the shear layer at the pressure surface generates a small karman vortex this flow pattern was identified as separation from near leading edge with an angle of attack over 40 the distance between the shear layers of the leading and trailing edges increased with the angle of attack for hba the interference of unstable waves disappeared and the unstable waves generated the vortex shedding with an increase in the angle of attack the asymmetrical state of the shear layers gradually became symmetric this flow pattern was identified as the bluff body wake 3 2 surface oil flow patterns the development of surface oil flow patterns on the airfoil surface was observed at different angles of attack under high reynolds numbers re 2 4 104 in this study the surface of hba was coated with a layer of blue colored oil and tested at reynolds number of 8 0 104 using different angles of attack figs 3 a e shows the surface oil flow patterns and figs 3 f j display the hand drawn sketches of figs 3 a e the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of less than 10 are displayed in fig 3 a and f the first upstream dark blue line in the figures represents the separation line the front tip of the separation line was attached to the surface of the airfoil and is known as the attached flow the flow at the wingtips matched the flows observed by bertin and smith 1989 the curving of the separation line toward the front was most likely caused by the tip vortex a vortex appeared near the root of the separation line due to the root effect this phenomenon matched that observed for the plane and cylinder junction in the study of rizzetta 1994 the second blue line in fig 3 a represents the reattachment line which indicates that the reattachment of fluids on the wing surface created a separation bubble and that the separation boundary layer created a turbulent boundary layer downstream of the separation point this pattern is identified as the separation bubble the surface oil flow patterns under the angle of attack of 10 14 are displayed in figs 3 b and g these figures indicate that the separation bubble still existed and moved toward the leading edge with the increase of angle of attack furthermore a surface vortex was generated near the root of hba blade three dark blue lines exist on the blade surface the upstream dark blue line near the leading edge and the downstream line near the trailing edge are the separation lines and the center blue line is the reattachment line this flow pattern is identified as secondary separation the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of 14 19 are depicted in figs 3 c and h these figures indicate that the upstream separation line was extremely close to the leading edge a vortex was created on the pressure surface due to the high turbulent intensity near the root of blade yen et al 2013 this pattern is identified as the leading edge bubble the surface oil flow patterns under an angle of attack of 19 28 are depicted in figs 3 d and i these figures indicate that a strong three dimensional 3d flow existed on the blade surface the leading edge separation bubble was larger than those under lower angles of attack two vortices were created near the wingtip and the wing root on the pressure surface caused from the considerable influence of the wingtip and wall effects which is in agreement with the finding of winkelman and barlow 1980 this flow pattern is identified as 3d flow the surface oil flow patterns obtained under an angle of attack of over 28 are displayed in figs 3 e and j the surface oil flow moved at an extremely low speed with the appearance of recirculation bubbles due to the high reverse pressure this flow pattern is identified as bluff body wake 3 3 flow visualization areas the figures obtained under different reynolds numbers angle of attacks and different visualization methods i e smoke wire in fig 2 and surface oil flow in fig 3 can be classified into eight flow patterns surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge bluff body wake separation bubbles secondary separation leading edge bubbles 3d flow and bluff body wake respectively as displayed in fig 4 the surface boundary layer at low reynolds numbers exhibits three patterns surface boundary layer separation separation from near leading edge and bluff body wake furthermore the flow patterns obtained under high reynolds numbers using the surface oil flow visualization can be classified into five types separation bubbles secondary separation leading edge bubbles 3d flow and bluff body wake as shown in fig 4 the bluff body wake pattern always occurs at high angle of attack due to the high reverse pressure in the wake at lower angle of attack the high flow momentum at high reynolds numbers caused the separated flow reattached to the blades surface and generated the separation bubble on the blade surface 3 4 turbulence intensity the turbulence intensity t i was measured with the tsi two dimensional constant temperature hot wire anemometer the probed data were captured and analyzed with the ni daq acquisition system and lab view analyzer software the hot wire probe was installed in the wake flow section at x c 2 5 and y c 3 the distribution of turbulence intensity for hba at reynolds number of 8 0 104 is illustrated in fig 5 the turbulence intensity increases with the angle of attack until the angle of attack reached 38 at which the maximum t i of 4 5 occurred when the angle of attack is over 38 the turbulence intensity decreased with an increase in the angle of attack due to bluff body effect for the angle of attack higher than 50 the t i becomes almost a constant of 3 3 3 5 vortex shedding frequency in the wake fig 6 presents the strouhal number of hba which was calculated from the definition of st d fd u f vortex shedding frequency d projected length of wing section normal to the airstream and u free stream speed by using the vortex shedding frequency measured in the wake region at x c 2 5 and y c 3 at a fixed reynolds number of 8 0 104 fig 6 indicates that st d is approximately 0 32 when the angle of attack is 0 with an increase in the angle of attack the strouhal number decreases to approximately 0 2 the strouhal number obtained for hba approximately 0 2 is similar to those obtained by zdravkovich 1996 and roshko 1955 for a single cylinder 3 6 aerodynamic performance 3 6 1 lift coefficient fig 7 shows the lift drag momentum coefficients and the lift drag ratio with changing the angle of attack the three airfoils i e hba naca 63215 and s809 were tested at a fixed reynolds number of 8 0 104 in fig 7 a the maximum lift coefficient c lmax is 2 12 for hba 1 07 for naca 63215 and 1 07 for s809 at angle of attack of 13 9 and 12 respectively furthermore the c l data from somers 1997 and filho et al 2013 have shown in fig 7 a using the solid symbols among three airfoils hba exhibited the highest lift coefficient which is almost twice that of s809 and naca 63215 the hba also has a higher stall angle of attack compared with the other two airfoils 3 6 2 drag coefficient fig 7 b shows the variations of drag coefficient c d with respect to the angle of attack at re 8 104 in fig 7 b the c d increases with the angle of attack for these three blade airfoils fig 7 b also shows that the c d curve has a significant increase after the stall angle of attack and s809 has the highest c d the drag coefficient above the stall angle of attack c dstall was 0 37 for hba 0 46 for s809 and 0 28 for naca 63215 3 6 3 moment coefficient fig 7 c shows the variations of moment coefficient c m with respect to angle of attack the moment coefficient just below the stall angle of attack c mstall is 0 82 0 51 and 0 56 for hba s809 and naca 63215 respectively the moment coefficient after stall c m was 0 65 0 36 and 0 46 for hba s809 and naca 63215 respectively the hba had a higher moment coefficient than those of the other two airfoils thus hba outperformed s809 and naca 63215 3 6 4 lift drag ratio as displayed in fig 7 d the lift drag increased with the angle of attack before stall the hba has the highest lift drag ratio among these three airfoils the maximum lift drag ratios are 6 11 3 6 and 3 2 for hba s809 and naca63215 respectively fig 7 d also shows that the lift drag ratios decrease beyond the stall angle and approach toward 1 81 1 43 and 0 86 for hba naca63215 and s809 respectively 3 6 5 cl vs cd when wind flowed along the suction and pressure surfaces the aerodynamic forces were generated along the blade surfaces the aerodynamic forces were of two types the lift perpendicular to the chord and the drag along the wing direction although increasing the lift is important the increased drag generated with an increased lift must also be considered fig 8 illustrates the relationship between the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient for hba s809 and naca 63215 with changing the angle of attack and a fixed reynolds number of 8 104 the lift coefficient c l increased and the drag coefficient c d also increased before the blade stall at blade stall the maximum lift coefficient of hba is approximately 2 1 and its drag coefficient is 0 37 in addition the maximum lift coefficient of s809 and naca63215 are approximately 1 06 and their drag coefficients are 0 46 and 0 28 for s809 and naca63215 respectively consequently the lift coefficient of hba is approximately twice those of s809 and naca 63215 3 6 6 maximum lift drag ratio the maximum lift drag ratios of these three airfoils at different reynolds numbers were tested and presented in fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 the lift drag ratio increased with reynolds number the hba has the highest lift drag ratio at reynolds number of 80 000 the lift drag ratios of hba s809 and naca 63215 are 6 11 3 63 and 3 13 respectively thus the lift drag ratio of hba is almost twice that of naca 63215 3 7 aerodynamic performance at stall 3 7 1 stall angle of attack fig 10 a shows the curves of stall angle of attack α stall for the hba s809 and naca 63215 with changing the reynolds number the hba has the maximum α stall among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 a also shows that the reynolds number has a weak effect on the stall angle of attack 3 7 2 lift coefficient at stall as displayed in fig 10 b the maximum lift coefficient c lmax increased gradually with the reynolds number the hba has the highest maximum c lmax among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 b shows that the c lmax is approximately 2 1 for hba and 1 07 for s809 and naca63215 thus the maximum lift coefficient of hba is approximately twice that of s809 and naca 63215 3 7 3 drag coefficient at stall fig 10 c illustrates the drag coefficient at stall c dstall with changing the reynolds number with an increase in the reynolds number the c dstall marginally decreased for hba and naca63215 and c dstall decreased significantly at high reynolds number for s809 fig 10 c also shows that the s809 has the highest c dstall among these three blade airfoils and the c dstall for hba is higher than that of naca63215 3 7 4 moment coefficient at stall as depicted in fig 10 d the moment coefficient at stall c msatll of hba s809 and naca 63215 decreased marginally with an increase in reynolds number the curve of c msatll shows that the hba has the highest pitch moment among these three blade airfoils furthermore fig 10 d also shows that the value of c msatll is similar for s809 and naca 63215 thus the aerodynamic performance of hba is superior to those of s809 and naca 63215 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to design a new blade model hba based on two well known airfoils i e s809 and naca 63215 for determining the surface flow modes wake flow characteristics and aerodynamic performance of this new blade at different reynolds numbers and angles of attack the following conclusions were obtained according to the analysis of experimental results 1 under a reynolds number re of less than 12 000 the smoke streak flow patterns show three characteristic types surface boundary layer separation separation from the near leading edge region and bluff body wake when re is above 20 000 the surface oil flow patterns are classified into five patterns separation bubbles secondary separation leading edge bubbles bluff body wake and 3d flow 2 when re is fixed at 8 104 the turbulence intensity increased with the angle of attack α until the angle reached 38 when α is over 38 the turbulence intensity decreased with α until α 50 beyond which the turbulence intensity become almost a constant 3 when re is fixed at 8 104 the strouhal number st is 0 32 at α 0 with an increase in α the st approaches 0 2 and then remained almost constant 4 at re 8 104 the lift drag ratios of the hba s809 and naca 63215 are 6 11 3 63 and 3 13 respectively the stall angles of attack for hba s809 and naca 63215 are 13 12 and 9 respectively moreover the moment coefficients at stalling point for hba s809 and naca 63215 are 0 8 0 52 and 0

20879,the oscillating water column is the most widely used wave energy converting technology for onshore applications in the previous studies the performances of the chamber and the turbine were

oscillating water column chamber turbine system free spinning mode experimental study overall efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades marine renewable energy has attracted more attention because of its potential to address the future fossil fuel crisis partly the wave energy has a wide distribution in the ocean with a relatively higher energy density flux and is becoming the research hotspot sheng 2019a babarit 2015 oscillating water column owc is the most successful wave energy converting technology especially for long term and reliable operations the owc plant consists of an air chamber with a submerged open mouth on the skirt wall the incident waves drive the water column to oscillate and generate the reciprocating airflows falcão and henriques 2016 in the primary energy converting stage the self rectifying turbine installed in the duct could make a unidirectional rotation and realize the conversion from the pneumatic power to electricity in the secondary stage falcão et al 2018 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the owc air chamber have significant effects on the efficiency from the waves to the airflows the opening ratio of the chamber could partly substitute the damping effects of the power take off pto which has significant influences on the chamber performance he et al 2013 liu et al 2016b simonetti et al 2017 john ashlin et al 2016 and yamaç and koca 2019 reported that a circular curve bottom is beneficial to the energy capturing performance of the air chamber elhanafi et al 2017 summarized the effects of the submerged depth of the chamber skirt wall on the primary stage efficiencies and it was reported that the capture width ratio of the chamber decreases as the incident wave height increases elhanafi and kim 2018 zheng et al 2019 established a numerical model based on the linear potential flow theory and investigated the effects of the thickness and radius on the wave energy harvesting performance of a cylindrical chamber gaspar et al 2020 studied the effects of the skirt wall on the performance of the air chamber and found an inclined skirt wall could improve the energy converting efficiency of the air chamber some new shapes of the air chamber were proposed to enhance its capability to absorb wave energy boccotti 2007 designed a u shape chamber with an additional vertical wall on the bottom ahead of the skirt wall and found this owc system could make a resonance to some wavelengths without any control strategies malara et al 2017 moretti et al 2020 sheng 2019b and 2019c optimized the hydrodynamic parameters of a back bent duct buoy owc device and predicted its electricity output under real sea conditions rezanejad et al 2019 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of an l shape owc chamber and proposed its optimal shape parameters deng et al 2019 reported that a relatively long immersed horizontal bottom plate is beneficial to absorb the wave energy ning et al 2020 studied the energy harvesting performance of a cylindrical dual chamber and summarized the coupled resonant effect between the inner and outer chambers for the secondary stage the self rectifying air turbines are the most popular ptos used to convert the pneumatic power to the shaft torque of the electricity generator falcão et al 2018 many studies have been conducted to optimize the shape parameters of the rotor blades and guide vanes to enhance the turbine efficiencies setoguchi et al 1998 halder et al 2017 liu et al 2016a ezhilsabareesh et al 2019 liu et al 2017 presented the experimental results of the steady state performance of an axial flow impulse turbine under the fixed speed mode in constant airflows a three dimensional flow driven numerical model developed by liu et al 2018 was employed to investigate the effects of the airflow velocity and the moment of inertia on the operating efficiency of the impulse turbine the unsteady behaviors of the impulse turbine under the free spinning mode in the constant and reciprocating airflows were studied experimentally and numerically cui et al 2019 liu et al 2019 elatife and el marjani 2019 compared the performances between the radial flow turbines designed with circular and elliptical profiles resulting in an enhancement in the turbine efficiency by 19 faÿ et al 2020 proposed six types of turbine control strategies and evaluated their applications in the electrical power output and its reliability in the operation of the mutriku owc plant till now the two energy converting stages in most studies were separated in the investigations of the air chamber common substitutions of the self rectifying turbines are the orifice or the porous material to provide the damping effects to the chamber viviano et al 2018 ignoring the reaction of the chamber to the pto similarly the reaction of the air turbines to the chamber was also hard to be considered in the constant and reciprocating airflow tests recently the wave to wire model has been developed which is mostly used in the prediction of electricity production under various wave conditions the model allows the interactions between two stages to be considered resulting in a more precise prediction in the corresponding indicators suchithra et al 2019 on the other hand the dynamic interactions between the air chamber and the turbine are extremely complicated which cannot be simply reproduced using the porous media or the orifice for instance the rotation speed variation of the air turbines has significant effects on the water column oscillation and the amplitudes of the air pressure subsequently the above changes will influence the turbines directly resulting in the consequent variation of the rotation speed or the shaft torque no matter how complicated substitutions the wave to wire models employ the chamber turbine system has to be simplified at different levels to establish a more accurate wave to wire model an experimental model employing the model turbine directly with the chamber could provide more valuable information and validating data liu et al 2020a and 2020b presented the overall performance of a chamber turbine system for the owc model under the fixed speed turbine mode in regular and irregular waves in the practical engineering application the free spinning mode is also a frequently used control strategy for the self rectifying air turbines which can be regarded as a basis of complicated control strategies to enhance the power output of the plant compared to the fixed speed mode to the limits of our literature review the free spinning mode has not been studied for the chamber turbine model system in this study based on the previous experimental model and testing system the free spinning mode was investigated experimentally under various regular wave conditions effects of the external loads on the primary stage secondary stage and overall efficiencies are presented for different wave scenarios the peak efficiencies under two operating modes are also compared to demonstrate the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic characteristics of the free spinning mode of the owc system 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental apparatus all the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at qingdao municipal key laboratory of ocean renewable energy ocean university of china a scale ratio of 1 15 following the froude similarity law was chosen in the design of owc model and wave conditions for the turbine system the dimensionless flow coefficients determined by the airflow velocity in the duct and the rotation speed of the turbine were designed to fall in the same operational range both for the model and prototype scales the length width and height of the flume are 60 0 m 3 0 m and 1 5 m respectively the flume is divided into two parts by the glass wall 0 8 m wide part and 2 2 m wide part the experimental set up in the wave flume is illustrated in fig 1 the owc model is put in the 0 8 m wide part of the flume which has the same width as the test section the water depth is fixed at 0 75 m during all the tests the piston type wavemaker set at one end of the flume can be controlled by the computer program to generate desired linear and nonlinear wave scenarios the porous materials are placed on a slope at the other end for absorbing the incident waves during the generation and validation of the incident wave scenarios the wave absorbing capability of the flume satisfied the domestic industrial standard the owc model is 50 0 m away from the wavemaker nine times the longest wavelength of all incident wave scenarios this distance can guarantee the full development of the wave train and sufficient valid data to be recorded before the secondarily reflected waves arrive at the model the absorbing beach could absorb the incident waves in the 2 2 m wide flume section to prevent any possible influences from this part the cuboid chamber model was made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates as shown in fig 2 the key shape parameters of the chamber model are listed in table 1 the basic geometry of the chamber and the operating water depth were designed according to the previous studies for the yongsoo prototype plant liu et al 2011 2016b the model scaled chamber width was reduced slightly to satisfy the limit of the flume section in addition the chamber geometry was simplified as a generic shape to provide a fundamental benchmark consisting of both the chamber and a real model turbine instead of any substitutions which was convenient for validations of the wave to wire models or other numerical models five circular holes with a diameter of d w were opened on the top plate for the installation of the wave gauges wgs to measure the free surface elevation in the chamber in addition the red one in fig 1 shows the position of wg used to measure the wave elevation during the generation and validation of incident wave scenarios a smaller circular opening with a diameter of d p is also on the top plate for the installation of the pressure gauge pg because of the geometry complexity and the manufacturing difficulty the design of the impulse turbine used in previous studies liu et al 2018 2019 could not be realized in such a small scale therefore a simplified design was employed based on some experimental data in the steady state liu et al 2020a the impulse turbine model is shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 a the turbine model consists of 28 blades on the rotor and two rows of guide vanes on the upstream and downstream stators the number of guide vanes on each row is 22 the pressure and suction sides of the rotor blade are the circular and elliptical arcs respectively the fixed guide vanes consist of a straight line and a circular arc as illustrated in fig 3 b the 3d model has a rotor radius of 59 0 mm and was installed in a horizontal cylindrical duct with an inner diameter of d d 120 0 mm on the end wall of the chamber as illustrated in fig 3 c the model was made of aluminum alloy and the duct and flange were made of acrylic tubes and plates a shaft was used to connect the rotor and other facilities in the drive train other details of the impulse turbine model can be found in table 2 furthermore the duct area is not optimal to the free surface area in the chamber because of the limits of the testing facility and our manufacturing capability the opening ratio in this study is 2 4 which is larger than the optimal value of 1 0 derived in the previous report elhanafi and kim 2018 consequently the secondary stage and overall efficiencies may not be optimal for the chamber system design the measuring instruments and the data acquisition system are shown in fig 4 the capacitance type wave gauges were employed for the measuring of the free surface elevation in the chamber which has a maximum range of 1100 mm with an accuracy of 0 05 full scale fs the pressure gauge was used to record the pressure difference between the upper space sealed by the water column and the atmosphere its measuring range could vary between 10 kpa with an accuracy of 0 5 fs the turbine connects to the torque transducer and the servo motor in sequence the torque transducer is applied to measure the variation of the torque and rotation speed of the drive train with a range of 0 3000 revolutions per minute rpm and 0 0 3 n m and the accuracy of 0 05 fs the electronic load was connected to the servo motor operating as an electric generator which could provide various loading torques in the drive train by setting different resistance values all the sensors were linked with the data acquisition daq system developed by the research team which could realize the data acquisition synchronously regular wave scenarios were employed in the experimental tests which are convenient for discovering the fundamental characteristics of the chamber turbine system under the free spinning mode four wave heights h 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m and five periods t 1 25 s 1 5 s 1 75 s 2 0 s and 2 25 s were applied and 19 scenarios were generated the combination of h 0 2 m and t 1 25 s is out of the wave making capability of the flume furthermore eleven values of the electronic load were chosen to add the reaction torques to the drive train therefore 209 experimental cases were tested in all the tests the data for at least ten wave cycles were recorded for further processing each case was repeated thrice and the average values were used as the representative ones for the electronic resistance the loading torque acting on the drive train has an excellent proportional relationship with the angular velocity ω it means that the electronic resistance can be represented by the load coefficient k cui et al 2019 with the unit of kg m2 s 1 as listed in table 3 the primary stage secondary stage and overall efficiencies of the chamber turbine system η 1 η 2 and η o are defined as follows 1 η 1 p p p w 2 η 2 p t p p 3 η o η 1 η 2 p t p w where p w p p and p t are the incident wave power pneumatic power and turbine output power the definition of p w can be written as 4 p w 0 5 ρ w g ζ i 2 c g l c w where ρ w g ζ i c g are the water density the gravitational acceleration the incident wave amplitude and the group velocity respectively the definition of c g can be written as 5 c g 0 5 c 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where k is the wave number c is the incident wave speed for each wave frequency defined as 6 c ω k where ω is the angular frequency which can be defined from the dispersion relation 7 ω 2 g k tanh k h the pneumatic power is defined as 8 p p 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t q t d t where p t is the instantaneous air pressure in the chamber t 0 is the time instant when the measurement is activated at the stable stage and n is the number of the wave cycles to be calculated q t is the volumetric flow rate in the duct which can be calculated from the free surface elevation in the chamber where the air compressibility is ignored in the model scale the turbine output power is defined as 9 p t 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t t 0 t ω t t d t where t 0 t and ω t t are the instantaneous turbine torque and angular velocity respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 time histories of key performance parameters a typical testing case of h 0 15 m t 1 50 s and k 9 19 10 4 kg m2 s 1 was chosen for demonstrating the time histories of key performance parameters which are illustrated in fig 5 the free surface elevation in the chamber represented by the nondimensional parameter a c a is shown in fig 5 a where a c is the instantaneous elevation at the center point of the chamber cross section and a is the incident wave amplitude in the stable stage the elevation period of the free surface in the chamber equals that of the incident regular waves and the relative amplitude is only 0 38 times the incident wave amplitude in addition as presented in fig 5 b the variation period of the relative air pressure in the chamber also equals the incident wave period having a phase difference of t 4 with the free surface elevation which is the same as those observed for the fixed rotation speed frs mode reported by liu et al 2020a it indicates that these two control strategies have no difference in the effects of the periods of the water column oscillation and the air pressure variation and their phase relationship the average amplitude of the relative pressure in this case is 416 2 pa the rotation speed of the turbine model under the free spinning mode as shown in fig 5 c experiences a periodic fluctuation the average speed is 418 4 rpm and the fluctuation range is 15 of the average value in fig 5 d the variation pattern of the torque output of the turbine model is similar to that of the rotation speed compared to the frs mode liu et al 2020a no negative turbine output is observed in the free spinning mode for the frs mode at the direction changing moment the airflow cannot afford enough pneumatic torque to balance the shaft torque for maintaining the rotation speed because of the windage effect which is compensated by the servo motor on the other hand the rotation of the turbine is entirely driven by the airflows and no torque needs to be compensated the average torque generated by the turbine is 0 053 n m benefited from the operating mechanism of the self rectifying turbine as illustrated in fig 5 e the pneumatic power is always positive with a doubled variation frequency with an average value of 12 2 w by multiplying the corresponding values from the time history curves of the rotation speed and torque of the turbine as shown in fig 5 f the turbine power can be derived and its varying period is also half of the incident wave period the average turbine power is 2 3 w additional error analysis on this case was conducted to evaluate the precision degree of measured data the statistical averages from the wgs the pg and the torque transducer with related errors are shown in fig 6 the columns are the average values and the vertical error bars represent one standard deviation the variation coefficients for the relative elevation amplitude the air pressure amplitude the average rotation speed and the average turbine torque output defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the average value are 1 3 0 5 0 6 and 1 1 respectively the analysis indicates that the data stability and repeatability are excellent in this study as illustrated in fig 5 the varying frequencies of the rotation speed torque and power output of the turbine are all twice the incident wave frequency because of the self rectifying capability of the turbine additional spectral analysis on the temporal data of the rotation speed and torque output of the turbine model was conducted using the fast fourier transforming technology and the results are presented in fig 7 as expected a spectral peak of the fundamental wave with the corresponding period of 0 75 s can be observed both in fig 7 a and b it is caused by the effective operations of the reciprocating airflow during the inhalation and exhalation another spectral peak of the second order wave also can be observed with the corresponding period of 1 50 s the same as the incident wave period the positive and negative amplitudes of the free surface elevation shown in fig 5 a are not equal which results in an asymmetrical reciprocating airflow and subsequently different turbine behaviours during the inhalation and exhalation evidently in the regular wave scenarios the varying period of these asymmetrical phenomena equals the incident wave period 3 2 rotation speeds of the model turbine compared to the frs mode the rotation speeds of the model turbine under the free spinning mode are entirely determined by the airflows and the resistance loads as the rotation speed of the turbine has significant effects on the performance of the chamber which is discussed firstly in this section in addition as the effects of wave height on statistic characteristics of the rotation speed of the turbine over the range of load coefficient are similar for various values of h only h 0 15 m were employed as a typical wave height to demonstrate the effects of the incident wave period and load coefficient on the operating performance of the chamber turbine model system the average rotation speed and related fluctuation ratios of the model turbine under various wave periods and load coefficients for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 8 in fig 8 a the average rotation speeds are derived from ten wave cycles at the stable stage as shown in fig 5 c for a given wave scenario the value of r decreases with the increase in the load coefficient on the other hand for a given value of k the average rotation speed increases firstly and then decreases as t increases the values of r for t 2 00 s and t 2 25 s are close especially for the larger values of k the maximum and minimum values of r are obtained at 1147 rpm and 162 rpm for t 1 75 s and t 1 25 s respectively for the wave height of 0 05 m 0 10 m and 0 20 m the varying ranges of the turbine rotation speed are 18 424 rpm 107 705 rpm and 335 1313 rpm respectively the fluctuation ratios of the rotation speed of the turbine model f r are shown in fig 8 b which is defined as a nondimensional ratio of the difference between the peak and valley values and the average value of r in each case similarly the value of f r also decreases with the increase in the load coefficient which indicates that the fluctuation degree decreases as the average rotation speed decreases for h 0 15 m the range of f r is between 0 23 and 0 38 for the other three wave heights the ranges of f r are between 0 20 and 0 40 3 3 energy converting efficiency in the primary stage in the primary energy converting stage the oscillating water column is the intermediate media from the wave power to the pneumatic power which determines the volumetric flow rate passing through the model turbine in the duct therefore the elevation of the free surface in the chamber can be considered as an indirect indicator the wave period is represented by the dimensionless relative wavelength of λ l where λ is the incident wave length according to the corresponding period the dimensionless relative elevation amplitudes a a for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 9 where a represents the elevation amplitude of the water column averaged from five wgs in the chamber the results only for six load coefficients were presented in the figure for concision the value of a a increases with the increase in λ l the maximum values are all less than 1 0 and no peaks are observed over the range of tested wave periods for a given wave scenario the elevation amplitude of the free surface increase with the increase in the load coefficient the maximum values are obtained at the maximum value of k as analyzed in section 3 2 the increase in k causes the decrease in the rotation speed of the model turbine and makes the reciprocating airflows pass the turbine more easily which results in an increase in the elevation amplitude the varying range of a a is between 0 27 and 0 66 the distribution patterns for the other three wave heights are similar to that in fig 9 and the varying ranges of a a are 0 52 0 98 0 41 0 88 and 0 32 0 61 for the wave height of 0 05 m 0 10 m and 0 20 m respectively to demonstrate the effects of the operating mode of the model turbine on the free surface elevation four typical wave scenarios are chosen for comparison the data of the frs mode refer to the results reported by liu et al 2020a the comparison of the free surface elevations under two operating modes is shown in fig 10 as the load coefficient is hard to adjust for deriving a perfect matching rotation speed same as the frs mode the rotation speeds for the free spinning mode r free are chosen to be as close as possible to those for the frs mode r forced and the differences are all less than 3 the differences in the free surface elevation amplitude for the two modes are approximately 1 the results indicate that the elevation amplitude is only determined by the rotation speed value of the turbine regardless of the operating mode another parameter that has significant effects on pneumatic power is the air pressure in the chamber the average relative pressure amplitudes p in the chamber for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 11 generally the amplitude p increases sharply firstly and then mildly with the increase in the load coefficient for a given wave scenario the relative pressure amplitude decreases with the increase in the value of k which has a different varying pattern with the free surface elevation amplitude the increase in the load coefficient causes a decrease in the rotation speed of the model turbine resulting in reduced damping effects in the duct and make the reciprocating airflows to pass the turbine more easily which consequently induces the decrease in the air pressure amplitude for all the wave heights the minimum values of p are obtained at 63 9 pa 179 6 pa 265 4 pa and 542 7 pa for λ l 3 9 with k 17 30 10 4 kg m2 s 1 on the other hand the maximum values of p are obtained at 164 5 pa 367 5 pa 604 1 pa and 815 3 pa for λ l 9 2 with the smallest value of k 0 94 10 4 kg m2 s 1 the average relative air pressure amplitude in the chamber under two operating modes of the model turbine for four typical cases are compared in fig 12 the wave scenarios and the chosen rotation speeds for two operating modes in four cases are the same as those in fig 10 in each case for two close rotation speeds the difference in the values of p is minor the differences in case 1 to 4 are 1 0 2 3 0 9 and 1 5 respectively same as the free surface elevation amplitude the relative air pressure amplitude in the chamber is also only determined by the rotation speed of the model turbine regardless of the operating mode the primary stage efficiency can be calculated based on the experimental data using eqns 1 4 and 8 to demonstrate the general varying pattern for various wave heights the contours of the primary stage efficiencies are plotted in fig 13 using the cubic spline interpolation on the experimental data from limited testing cases for any given load coefficient the primary stage efficiency increases firstly and then decreases as λ l increases the values of are relatively higher for 6 0 λ l 8 0 and the peak efficiencies are all obtained in this range of the relative wavelength the load coefficient has significant effects on the value of η 1 by affecting the turbine rotation speed the width of the high efficiency band decreases as the value of k increases for all four wave heights as reported by liu et al 2020a the rotation speed of the model turbine should be restricted to a narrow range 900 1300 rpm to obtain relatively higher values of η 1 the rotation speeds out of this range will result in a decrease in the primary stage efficiency as the rotation speeds described in section 3 2 are mostly less than 1300 rpm the value of η 1 increases as the load coefficient decreases or the rotation speed increases for the four wave heights from 0 05 m to 0 20 m the value of η 1 varies from 0 26 to 0 64 from 0 31 to 0 65 from 0 30 to 0 61 and from 0 26 to 0 55 respectively the peak values of η 1 for various wave scenarios are picked from fig 13 for comparison with those under the frs mode liu et al 2020a which are shown in fig 14 for h 0 05 m in fig 14 a the peak values of η 1 under the free spinning mode are all smaller than those under the frs mode over the test range of λ l as the wave height is relatively smaller the model turbine under the free spinning mode cannot reach the required rotation speed to obtain a higher efficiency for the primary stage under the frs mode the rotation speed could cover an extensive range of the rotation speed for the owc model to obtain more pneumatic power furthermore as shown in fig 14 b the owc model shows similar performance for h 0 10 m as the wave height increases to h 0 15 m and h 0 20 m in fig 14 c and d the peak primary stage efficiencies for given values of λ l under the free spinning mode are very close to those derived from the frs experimental tests in addition no obvious relationship of the rotation speeds under two operating modes is observed these results indicate that the predominant wave scenarios should be carefully considered for selecting a proper operating mode with desired rotation speeds to obtain optimal primary stage efficiencies 3 4 energy converting efficiency in the secondary stage the secondary stage efficiency is determined by the incident pneumatic power and the output power of the model turbine together the torque outputs of the model turbine for h 0 15 m are presented in fig 15 as the typical results in fig 15 a the average torque outputs are calculated in a period of ten wave cycles at the stable stage for a given wave period the average torque output increases with the increase in the load coefficient on the other hand for a given value of k the average torque output increases significantly as t 1 75 s and achieves the peak value at t 1 75 s as the wave period keeps increasing the value of t 0 decreases mildly and the differences between the wave periods are minor different from the frs mode as the model turbine in this study is fully driven by the reciprocating airflows the values of t 0 are all positive the varying patterns for the other wave heights are all similar to those shown in fig 15 a the fluctuation ratios of the torque output f t for h 0 15 m are shown in fig 15 b the calculation method of f t is the same as that of f r the general varying pattern of the fluctuation ratios is to increase with the increase in the value of k the differences between f t and f r also increase as the load coefficient increases the general varying range of f t is between 0 3 and 0 6 for all four wave heights the contours of the secondary stage efficiency for the four wave heights are plotted in fig 16 the contour shapes indicate that the value of η 2 is affected by both the incident wave scenario and the external load for the smaller wave heights in fig 16 a and b the value of η 2 increases firstly and then decreases as λ l increases for a given value of k similarly the secondary stage efficiency obtains higher values for the range of k between 4 0 10 4 kg m2 s 1 and 11 0 10 4 kg m2 s 1 as the load coefficient increases the rotation speed and the torque output will increase and decrease respectively and their product as the turbine power must obtain larger values over a certain range therefore η 2 presents the ring type distribution patterns for smaller wave heights as the wave height increases in fig 16 c and d the effects of λ l become minor with the increase in the incident wave period actually the increase in the relative wave length induces the increase in the elevation amplitude of the free surface in the chamber which subsequently results in the increases in the amplitude of volumetric flow rate in the duct cui et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 have reported that the turbine efficiency varies slightly as the flow coefficient becomes larger which is caused by the increase in the airflow rate in the duct therefore the contour for the larger values of η 2 changes to the band shape and extends to the larger wave periods the varying ranges of η 2 for the four wave heights from small to large are 0 01 0 14 0 04 0 19 0 08 0 24 and 0 05 0 24 respectively for the owc plant under the free spinning mode the secondary stage efficiency could be increased by adjusting the external load properly to satisfy the predominant wave period better the peak values of η 2 for various wave scenarios under two operating modes are compared in fig 17 generally the varying trends of the two operating modes are similar for a given λ l the peak values of η 2 for the free spinning mode are larger than those for the frs mode except that the peak secondary stage efficiencies for the largest value of λ l are very close under the free spinning mode the turbine rotation speed could adjust dynamically according to the variation of the incident airflow velocity this autonomous matching mechanism can ensure the impulse turbine staying in the highly efficient mode for instance the peak value of η 2 at the middle value of λ l under the free spinning mode is increased by 17 9 5 4 9 2 and 3 7 for the four wave heights respectively 3 5 overall efficiency of the chamber turbine system the overall efficiencies of the chamber turbine system for four typical wave heights are presented in fig 18 as the overall efficiency is directly determined by the primary stage and secondary stage efficiencies together the contours of the overall efficiency can be considered as the multiplication overlaps of figs 13 and 16 which results in the ring type distribution pattern without any negative value moreover the significant band characteristics of two stage efficiencies result in the cone peaks around the optimal ranges of the values of k 4 11 10 4 kg m2 s 1 and λ l 6 0 8 0 according to the incident wave climate the design of the owc system should find an optimal chamber length for the resonance with the wavelength the results also indicate that a proper external load could enhance the overall efficiency of the system for the free spinning mode in addition the value of η o cannot keep increasing with the increase in the wave height in this study the overall efficiency is peaked at η o 0 14 for h 0 15 m the varying ranges of η o for the four wave heights from small to large are 0 003 0 09 0 01 0 12 0 03 0 14 and 0 02 0 13 respectively the peak values of η o for various wave scenarios under two operating modes are compared in fig 19 except the wave height of h 0 20 m as shown in fig 19 a b and c the peak values of η o for the free spinning mode are generally larger than those for the frs mode although the peak values of η 1 for these three wave heights are larger for the frs mode the differences for the peak values of η 2 between the two modes are much larger which results in a better performance of the free spinning mode for instance the peak values of the overall efficiency for the free spinning and frs modes are 0 14 and 0 13 respectively for h 0 20 m in fig 19 d the chamber turbine system of the owc model shows a good agreement in two operating modes and obtain very close overall efficiencies 4 conclusions and future work a model scaled oscillating water column device was manufactured and tested in a wave flume using the regular wave scenarios the free spinning of a model turbine was realized in the model tests by imposing the external loads to the electricity generator in the drive train the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performances of the chamber turbine system were investigated in 209 experimental cases the free surface elevation and the air pressure variation in the chamber and the rotation speed and torque output of the model turbine were recorded for further temporal and statistical analysis it was found that the model turbine has good self starting performance under the free spinning mode which could make the self starting in all experimental test cases the average rotation speed of the model turbine decreases with the increase in the load coefficient affecting the primary stage efficiency significantly the increase in the rotation speed enhances the damping effect of the model turbine resulting in an enlarged varying amplitude of the air pressure and the decreased free surface elevation in the chamber for the smaller wave heights the rotation speed under the free spinning is relatively lower for the chamber to obtain the optimal peak value of η 1 as the wave height increases the peak values of η 1 under two modes get closer the torque output of the model turbine increases with the increase in the load coefficient and better secondary stage efficiencies could be obtained over a range of load coefficients meanwhile the turbine shows better performance as more pneumatic power is generated by the chamber for the value of λ l between 6 0 and 8 0 the dynamic and autonomous matching mechanism under the free spinning mode can enhance the peak values of η 2 which are generally larger than those under the frs mode the contour plots indicate that the incident wave period and the external load determine the overall efficiency of the chamber turbine system together the chamber length of the owc plant should be designed to match the predominant incident wave period in addition under the free spinning mode the external load to the electrical generator should be adjusted carefully to obtain optimal overall efficiency the overall efficiencies are all less than 0 15 in this study which is caused by low secondary stage efficiency because of the manufacturing complexity the model size of the impulse turbine could not be reduced further to match the optimal opening ratio of the chamber therefore the experimental model of the chamber turbine system has not operated under a perfect hydrodynamic and aerodynamic condition resulting in a significant reduction in the turbine torque output in the future a numerical model consisting of both the turbine and the chamber will be developed to realize a direct simulation of the hydro aero interactions in the owc system an optimal area ratio between the cross section of the chamber free surface and the duct to install the impulse turbine will be found in the full scale size which can provide more valuable information for the chamber and turbine design to obtain the desired rated power of an owc plant credit

oscillating water column chamber turbine system free spinning mode experimental study overall efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades marine renewable energy has attracted more attention because of its potential to address the future fossil fuel crisis partly the wave energy has a wide distribution in the ocean with a relatively higher energy density flux and is becoming the research hotspot sheng 2019a babarit 2015 oscillating water column owc is the most successful wave energy converting technology especially for long term and reliable operations the owc plant consists of an air chamber

stage the self rectifying turbine installed in the duct could make a unidirectional rotation and realize the conversion from the pneumatic power to electricity in the secondary stage falcão et al 2018 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the owc air chamber have significant effects on the efficiency from the waves to the airflows the opening ratio of the chamber could partly substitute the damping effects of the power take off pto which has significant influences on the chamber performance he et al 2013 liu et al 2016b simonetti et al 2017 john ashlin et al 2016 and yamaç and koca 2019 reported that a circular curve bottom is beneficial to the energy capturing performance of the air chamber elhanafi et al 2017 summarized the effects of the submerged depth of the chamber skirt wall on the primary stage efficiencies and it was reported that the capture width ratio of the chamber decreases as the incident wave height increases elhanafi and kim 2018 zheng et al 2019 established a numerical model based on the linear potential flow theory and investigated the effects of the thickness and radius on the wave energy harvesting performance of a cylindrical chamber gaspar et al 2020 studied the effects of the skirt wall on the performance of the air chamber and found an inclined skirt wall could improve the energy converting efficiency of the air chamber some new shapes of the air chamber were proposed to enhance its capability to absorb wave energy boccotti 2007 designed a u shape chamber with an additional vertical wall on the bottom ahead of the skirt wall and found this owc system could make a resonance to some wavelengths without any control strategies malara et al 2017 moretti et al 2020 sheng 2019b and 2019c optimized the hydrodynamic parameters of a back bent duct buoy owc device and predicted its electricity output under real sea conditions rezanejad et al 2019 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of an l shape owc chamber and proposed its optimal shape parameters deng et al 2019 reported that a relatively long immersed horizontal bottom plate is beneficial to absorb the wave energy ning et al 2020 studied the energy harvesting performance of a cylindrical dual chamber and summarized the coupled resonant effect between the inner and outer chambers for the secondary stage the self rectifying air turbines are the most popular ptos used to convert the pneumatic power to the shaft torque of the electricity generator falcão et al 2018 many studies have been conducted to optimize the shape parameters of the rotor blades and guide vanes to enhance the turbine efficiencies setoguchi et al 1998 halder et al 2017 liu et al 2016a ezhilsabareesh et al 2019 liu et al 2017 presented the experimental results of the steady state performance of an axial flow impulse turbine under the fixed speed mode in constant airflows a three dimensional flow driven numerical model developed by liu et al 2018 was employed to investigate the effects of the airflow velocity and the moment of inertia on the operating efficiency of the impulse turbine the unsteady behaviors of the impulse turbine under the free spinning mode in the constant and reciprocating airflows were studied experimentally and numerically cui et al 2019 liu et al 2019 elatife and el marjani 2019 compared the performances between the radial flow turbines designed with circular and elliptical profiles resulting in an enhancement in the turbine efficiency by 19 faÿ et al 2020 proposed six types of turbine control strategies and evaluated their applications in the electrical power output and its reliability in the operation of the mutriku owc plant till now the two energy converting stages in most studies were separated in the investigations of the air chamber common substitutions of the self rectifying turbines are the orifice or the porous material to provide the damping effects to the chamber viviano et al 2018 ignoring the reaction of the chamber to the pto similarly the reaction of the air turbines to the chamber was also hard to be considered in the constant and reciprocating airflow tests recently the wave to wire model has been developed which is mostly used in the prediction of electricity production under various wave conditions the model allows the interactions between two stages to be considered resulting in a more precise prediction in the corresponding indicators suchithra et al 2019 on the other hand the dynamic interactions between the air chamber and the turbine are extremely complicated which cannot be simply reproduced using the porous media or the orifice for instance the rotation speed variation of the air turbines has significant effects on the water column oscillation and the amplitudes of the air pressure subsequently the above changes will influence the turbines directly resulting in the consequent variation of the rotation speed or the shaft torque no matter how complicated substitutions the wave to wire models employ the chamber turbine system has to be simplified at different levels to establish a more accurate wave to wire model an experimental model employing the model turbine directly with the chamber could provide more valuable information and validating data liu et al 2020a and 2020b presented the overall performance of a chamber turbine system for the owc model under the fixed speed turbine mode in regular and irregular waves in the practical engineering application the free spinning mode is also a frequently used control strategy for the self rectifying air turbines which can be regarded as a basis of complicated control strategies to enhance the power output of the plant compared to the fixed speed mode to the limits of our literature review the free spinning mode has not been studied for the chamber turbine model system in this study based on the previous experimental model and testing system the free spinning mode was investigated experimentally under various regular wave conditions effects of the external loads on the primary stage secondary stage and overall efficiencies are presented for different wave scenarios the peak efficiencies under two operating modes are also compared to demonstrate the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic characteristics of the free spinning mode of the owc system 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental apparatus all the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at qingdao municipal key laboratory of ocean renewable energy ocean university of china a scale ratio of 1 15 following the froude similarity law was chosen in the design of owc model and wave conditions for the turbine system the dimensionless flow coefficients determined by the airflow velocity in the duct and the rotation speed of the turbine were designed to fall in the same operational range both for the model and prototype scales the length width and height of the flume are 60 0 m 3 0 m and 1 5 m respectively the flume is divided into two parts by the glass wall 0 8 m wide part and 2 2 m wide part the experimental set up in the wave flume is illustrated in fig 1 the owc model is put in the 0 8 m wide part of the flume which has the same width as the test section the water depth is fixed at 0 75 m during all the tests the piston type wavemaker set at one end of the flume can be controlled by the computer program to generate desired linear and nonlinear wave scenarios the porous materials are placed on a slope at the other end for absorbing the incident waves during the generation and validation of the incident wave scenarios the wave absorbing capability of the flume satisfied the domestic industrial standard the owc model is 50 0 m away from the wavemaker nine times the longest wavelength of all incident wave scenarios this distance can guarantee the full development of the wave train and sufficient valid data to be recorded before the secondarily reflected waves arrive at the model the absorbing beach could absorb the incident waves in the 2 2 m wide flume section to prevent any possible influences from this part the cuboid chamber model was made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates as shown in fig 2 the key shape parameters of the chamber model are listed in table 1 the basic geometry of the chamber and the operating water depth were designed according to the previous studies for the yongsoo prototype plant liu et al 2011 2016b the model scaled chamber width was reduced slightly to satisfy the limit of the flume section in addition the chamber geometry was simplified as a generic shape to provide a fundamental benchmark consisting of both the chamber and a real model turbine instead of any substitutions which was convenient for validations of the wave to wire models or other numerical models five circular holes with a diameter of d w were opened on the top plate for the installation of the wave gauges wgs to measure the free surface elevation in the chamber in addition the red one in fig 1 shows the position of wg used to measure the wave elevation during the generation and validation of incident wave scenarios a smaller circular opening with a diameter of d p is also on the top plate for the installation of the pressure gauge pg because of the geometry complexity and the manufacturing difficulty the design of the impulse turbine used in previous studies liu et al 2018 2019 could not be realized in such a small scale therefore a simplified design was employed based on some experimental data in the steady state liu et al 2020a the impulse turbine model is shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 a the turbine model consists of 28 blades on the rotor and two rows of guide vanes on the upstream and downstream stators the number of guide vanes on each row is 22 the pressure and suction sides of the rotor blade are the circular and elliptical arcs respectively the fixed guide vanes consist of a straight line and a circular arc as illustrated in fig 3 b the 3d model has a rotor radius of 59 0 mm and was installed in a horizontal cylindrical duct with an inner diameter of d d 120 0 mm on the end wall of the chamber as illustrated in fig 3 c the model was made of aluminum alloy and the duct and flange were made of acrylic tubes and plates a shaft was used to connect the rotor and other facilities in the drive train other details of the impulse turbine model can be found in table 2 furthermore the duct area is not optimal to the free surface area in the chamber because of the limits of the testing facility and our manufacturing capability the opening ratio in this study is 2 4 which is larger than the optimal value of 1 0 derived in the previous report elhanafi and kim 2018 consequently the secondary stage and overall efficiencies may not be optimal for the chamber system design the measuring instruments and the data acquisition system are shown in fig 4 the capacitance type wave gauges were employed for the measuring of the free surface elevation in the chamber which has a maximum range of 1100 mm with an accuracy of 0 05 full scale fs the pressure gauge was used to record the pressure difference between the upper space sealed by the water column and the atmosphere its measuring range could vary between 10 kpa with an accuracy of 0 5 fs the turbine connects to the torque transducer and the servo motor in sequence the torque transducer is applied to measure the variation of the torque and rotation speed of the drive train with a range of 0 3000 revolutions per minute rpm and 0 0 3 n m and the accuracy of 0 05 fs the electronic load was connected to the servo motor operating as an electric generator which could provide various loading torques in the drive train by setting different resistance values all the sensors were linked with the data acquisition daq system developed by the research team which could realize the data acquisition synchronously regular wave scenarios were employed in the experimental tests which are convenient for discovering the fundamental characteristics of the chamber turbine system under the free spinning mode four wave heights h 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m and five periods t 1 25 s 1 5 s 1 75 s 2 0 s and 2 25 s were applied and 19 scenarios were generated the combination of h 0 2 m and t 1 25 s is out of the wave making capability of the flume furthermore eleven values of the electronic load were chosen to add the reaction torques to the drive train therefore 209 experimental cases were tested in all the tests the data for at least ten wave cycles were recorded for further processing each case was repeated thrice and the average values were used as the representative ones for the electronic resistance the loading torque acting on the drive train has an excellent proportional relationship with the angular velocity ω it means that the electronic resistance can be represented by the load coefficient k cui et al 2019 with the unit of kg m2 s 1 as listed in table 3 the primary stage secondary stage and overall efficiencies of the chamber turbine system η 1 η 2 and η o are defined as follows 1 η 1 p p p w 2 η 2 p t p p 3 η o η 1 η 2 p t p w where p w p p and p t are the incident wave power pneumatic power and turbine output power the definition of p w can be written as 4 p w 0 5 ρ w g ζ i 2 c g l c w where ρ w g ζ i c g are the water density the gravitational acceleration the incident wave amplitude and the group velocity respectively the definition of c g can be written as 5 c g 0 5 c 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where k is the wave number c is the incident wave speed for each wave frequency defined as 6 c ω k where ω is the angular frequency which can be defined from the dispersion relation 7 ω 2 g k tanh k h the pneumatic power is defined as 8 p p 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t q t d t where p t is the instantaneous air pressure in the chamber t 0 is the time instant when the measurement is activated at the stable stage and n is the number of the wave cycles to be calculated q t is the volumetric flow rate in the duct which can be calculated from the free surface elevation in the chamber where the air compressibility is ignored in the model scale the turbine output power is defined as 9 p t 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t t 0 t ω t t d t where t 0 t and ω t t are the instantaneous turbine torque and angular velocity respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 time histories of key performance parameters a typical testing case of h 0 15 m t 1 50 s and k 9 19 10 4 kg m2 s 1 was chosen for demonstrating the time histories of key performance parameters which are illustrated in fig 5 the free surface elevation in the chamber represented by the nondimensional parameter a c a is shown in fig 5 a where a c is the instantaneous elevation at the center point of the chamber cross section and a is the incident wave amplitude in the stable stage the elevation period of the free surface in the chamber equals that of the incident regular waves and the relative amplitude is only 0 38 times the incident wave amplitude in addition as presented in fig 5 b the variation period of the relative air pressure in the chamber also equals the incident wave period having a phase difference of t 4 with the free surface elevation which is the same as those observed for the fixed rotation speed frs mode reported by liu et al 2020a it indicates that these two control strategies have no difference in the effects of the periods of the water column oscillation and the air pressure variation and their phase relationship the average amplitude of the relative pressure in this case is 416 2 pa the rotation speed of the turbine model under the free spinning mode as shown in fig 5 c experiences a periodic fluctuation the average speed is 418 4 rpm and the fluctuation range is 15 of the average value in fig 5 d the variation pattern of the torque output of the turbine model is similar to that of the rotation speed compared to the frs mode liu et al 2020a no negative turbine output is observed in the free spinning mode for the frs mode at the direction changing moment the airflow cannot afford enough pneumatic torque to balance the shaft torque for maintaining the rotation speed because of the windage effect which is compensated by the servo motor on the other hand the rotation of the turbine is entirely driven by the airflows and no torque needs to be compensated the average torque generated by the turbine is 0 053 n m benefited from the operating mechanism of the self rectifying turbine as illustrated in fig 5 e the pneumatic power is always positive with a doubled variation frequency with an average value of 12 2 w by multiplying the corresponding values from the time history curves of the rotation speed and torque of the turbine as shown in fig 5 f the turbine power can be derived and its varying period is also half of the incident wave period the average turbine power is 2 3 w additional error analysis on this case was conducted to evaluate the precision degree of measured data the statistical averages from the wgs the pg and the torque transducer with related errors are shown in fig 6 the columns are the average values and the vertical error bars represent one standard deviation the variation coefficients for the relative elevation amplitude the air pressure amplitude the average rotation speed and the average turbine torque output defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the average value are 1 3 0 5 0 6 and 1 1 respectively the analysis indicates that the data stability and repeatability are excellent in this study as illustrated in fig 5 the varying frequencies of the rotation speed torque and power output of the turbine are all twice the incident wave frequency because of the self rectifying capability of the turbine additional spectral analysis on the temporal data of the rotation speed and torque output of the turbine model was conducted using the fast fourier transforming technology and the results are presented in fig 7 as expected a spectral peak of the fundamental wave with the corresponding period of 0 75 s can be observed both in fig 7 a and b it is caused by the effective operations of the reciprocating airflow during the inhalation and exhalation another spectral peak of the second order wave also can be observed with the corresponding period of 1 50 s the same as the incident wave period the positive and negative amplitudes of the free surface elevation shown in fig 5 a are not equal which results in an asymmetrical reciprocating airflow and subsequently different turbine behaviours during the inhalation and exhalation evidently in the regular wave scenarios the varying period of these asymmetrical phenomena equals the incident wave period 3 2 rotation speeds of the model turbine compared to the frs mode the rotation speeds of the model turbine under the free spinning mode are entirely determined by the airflows and the resistance loads as the rotation speed of the turbine has significant effects on the performance of the chamber which is discussed firstly in this section in addition as the effects of wave height on statistic characteristics of the rotation speed of the turbine over the range of load coefficient are similar for various values of h only h 0 15 m were employed as a typical wave height to demonstrate the effects of the incident wave period and load coefficient on the operating performance of the chamber turbine model system the average rotation speed and related fluctuation ratios of the model turbine under various wave periods and load coefficients for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 8 in fig 8 a the average rotation speeds are derived from ten wave cycles at the stable stage as shown in fig 5 c for a given wave scenario the value of r decreases with the increase in the load coefficient on the other hand for a given value of k the average rotation speed increases firstly and then decreases as t increases the values of r for t 2 00 s and t 2 25 s are close especially for the larger values of k the maximum and minimum values of r are obtained at 1147 rpm and 162 rpm for t 1 75 s and t 1 25 s respectively for the wave height of 0 05 m 0 10 m and 0 20 m the varying ranges of the turbine rotation speed are 18 424 rpm 107 705 rpm and 335 1313 rpm respectively the fluctuation ratios of the rotation speed of the turbine model f r are shown in fig 8 b which is defined as a nondimensional ratio of the difference between the peak and valley values and the average value of r in each case similarly the value of f r also decreases with the increase in the load coefficient which indicates that the fluctuation degree decreases as the average rotation speed decreases for h 0 15 m the range of f r is between 0 23 and 0 38 for the other three wave heights the ranges of f r are between 0 20 and 0 40 3 3 energy converting efficiency in the primary stage in the primary energy converting stage the oscillating water column is the intermediate media from the wave power to the pneumatic power which determines the volumetric flow rate passing through the model turbine in the duct therefore the elevation of the free surface in the chamber can be considered as an indirect indicator the wave period is represented by the dimensionless relative wavelength of λ l where λ is the incident wave length according to the corresponding period the dimensionless relative elevation amplitudes a a for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 9 where a represents the elevation amplitude of the water column averaged from five wgs in the chamber the results only for six load coefficients were presented in the figure for concision the value of a a increases with the increase in λ l the maximum values are all less than 1 0 and no peaks are observed over the range of tested wave periods for a given wave scenario the elevation amplitude of the free surface increase with the increase in the load coefficient the maximum values are obtained at the maximum value of k as analyzed in section 3 2 the increase in k causes the decrease in the rotation speed of the model turbine and makes the reciprocating airflows pass the turbine more easily which results in an increase in the elevation amplitude the varying range of a a is between 0 27 and 0 66 the distribution patterns for the other three wave heights are similar to that in fig 9 and the varying ranges of a a are 0 52 0 98 0 41 0 88 and 0 32 0 61 for the wave height of 0 05 m 0 10 m and 0 20 m respectively to demonstrate the effects of the operating mode of the model turbine on the free surface elevation four typical wave scenarios are chosen for comparison the data of the frs mode refer to the results reported by liu et al 2020a the comparison of the free surface elevations under two operating modes is shown in fig 10 as the load coefficient is hard to adjust for deriving a perfect matching rotation speed same as the frs mode the rotation speeds for the free spinning mode r free are chosen to be as close as possible to those for the frs mode r forced and the differences are all less than 3 the differences in the free surface elevation amplitude for the two modes are approximately 1 the results indicate that the elevation amplitude is only determined by the rotation speed value of the turbine regardless of the operating mode another parameter that has significant effects on pneumatic power is the air pressure in the chamber the average relative pressure amplitudes p in the chamber for h 0 15 m are illustrated in fig 11 generally the amplitude p increases sharply firstly and then mildly with the increase in the load coefficient for a given wave scenario the relative pressure amplitude decreases with the increase in the value of k which has a different varying pattern with the free surface elevation amplitude the increase in the load coefficient causes a decrease in the rotation speed of the model turbine resulting in reduced damping effects in the duct and make the reciprocating airflows to pass the turbine more easily which consequently induces the decrease in the air pressure amplitude for all the wave heights the minimum values of p are obtained at 63 9 pa 179 6 pa 265 4 pa and 542 7 pa for λ l 3 9 with k 17 30 10 4 kg m2 s 1 on the other hand the maximum values of p are obtained at 164 5 pa 367 5 pa 604 1 pa and 815 3 pa for λ l 9 2 with the smallest value of k 0 94 10 4 kg m2 s 1 the average relative air pressure amplitude in the chamber under two operating modes of the model turbine for four typical cases are compared in fig 12 the wave scenarios and the chosen rotation speeds for two operating modes in four cases are the same as those in fig 10 in each case for two close rotation speeds the difference in the values of p is minor the differences in case 1 to 4 are 1 0 2 3 0 9 and 1 5 respectively same as the free surface elevation amplitude the relative air pressure amplitude in the chamber is also only determined by the rotation speed of the model turbine regardless of the operating mode the primary stage efficiency can be calculated based on the experimental data using eqns 1 4 and 8 to demonstrate the general varying pattern for various wave heights the contours of the primary stage efficiencies are plotted in fig 13 using the cubic spline interpolation on the experimental data from limited testing cases for any given load coefficient the primary stage efficiency increases firstly and then decreases as λ l increases the values of are relatively higher for 6 0 λ l 8 0 and the peak efficiencies are all obtained in this range of the relative wavelength the load coefficient has significant effects on the value of η 1 by affecting the turbine rotation speed the width of the high efficiency band decreases as the value of k increases for all four wave heights as reported by liu et al 2020a the rotation speed of the model turbine should be restricted to a narrow range 900 1300 rpm to obtain relatively higher values of η 1 the rotation speeds out of this range will result in a decrease in the primary stage efficiency as the rotation speeds described in section 3 2 are mostly less than 1300 rpm the value of η 1 increases as the load coefficient decreases or the rotation speed increases for the four wave heights from 0 05 m to 0 20 m the value of η 1 varies from 0 26 to 0 64 from 0 31 to 0 65 from 0 30 to 0 61 and from 0 26 to 0 55 respectively the peak values of η 1 for various wave scenarios are picked from fig 13 for comparison with those under the frs mode liu et al 2020a which are shown in fig 14 for h 0 05 m in fig 14 a the peak values of η 1 under the free spinning mode are all smaller than those under the frs mode over the test range of λ l as the wave height is relatively smaller the model turbine under the free spinning mode cannot reach the required rotation speed to obtain a higher efficiency for the primary stage under the frs mode the rotation speed could cover an extensive range of the rotation speed for the owc model to obtain more pneumatic power furthermore as shown in fig 14 b the owc model shows similar performance for h 0 10 m as the wave height increases to h 0 15 m and h 0 20 m in fig 14 c and d the peak primary stage efficiencies for given values of λ l under the free spinning mode are very close to those derived from the frs experimental tests in addition no obvious relationship of the rotation speeds under two operating modes is observed these results indicate that the predominant wave scenarios should be carefully considered for selecting a proper operating mode with desired rotation speeds to obtain optimal primary stage efficiencies 3 4 energy converting efficiency in the secondary stage the secondary stage efficiency is determined by the incident pneumatic power and the output power of the model turbine together the torque outputs of the model turbine for h 0 15 m are presented in fig 15 as the typical results in fig 15 a the average torque outputs are calculated in a period of ten wave cycles at the stable stage for a given wave period the average torque output increases with the increase in the load coefficient on the other hand for a given value of k the average torque output increases significantly as t 1 75 s and achieves the peak value at t 1 75 s as the wave period keeps increasing the value of t 0 decreases mildly and the differences between the wave periods are minor different from the frs mode as the model turbine in this study is fully driven by the reciprocating airflows the values of t 0 are all positive the varying patterns for the other wave heights are all similar to those shown in fig 15 a the fluctuation ratios of the torque output f t for h 0 15 m are shown in fig 15 b the calculation method of f t is the same as that of f r the general varying pattern of the fluctuation ratios is to increase with the increase in the value of k the differences between f t and f r also increase as the load coefficient increases the general varying range of f t is between 0 3 and 0 6 for all four wave heights the contours of the secondary stage efficiency for the four wave heights are plotted in fig 16 the contour shapes indicate that the value of η 2 is affected by both the incident wave scenario and the external load for the smaller wave heights in fig 16 a and b the value of η 2 increases firstly and then decreases as λ l increases for a given value of k similarly the secondary stage efficiency obtains higher values for the range of k between 4 0 10 4 kg m2 s 1 and 11 0 10 4 kg m2 s 1 as the load coefficient increases the rotation speed and the torque output will increase and decrease respectively and their product as the turbine power must obtain larger values over a certain range therefore η 2 presents the ring type distribution patterns for smaller wave heights as the wave height increases in fig 16 c and d the effects of λ l become minor with the increase in the incident wave period actually the increase in the relative wave length induces the increase in the elevation amplitude of the free surface in the chamber which subsequently results in the increases in the amplitude of volumetric flow rate in the duct cui et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 have reported that the turbine efficiency varies slightly as the flow coefficient becomes larger which is caused by the increase in the airflow rate in the duct therefore the contour for the larger values of η 2 changes to the band shape and extends to the larger wave periods the varying ranges of η 2 for the four wave heights from small to large are 0 01 0 14 0 04 0 19 0 08 0 24 and 0 05 0 24 respectively for the owc plant under the free spinning mode the secondary stage efficiency could be increased by adjusting the external load properly to satisfy the predominant wave period better the peak values of η 2 for various wave scenarios under two operating modes are compared in fig 17 generally the varying trends of the two operating modes are similar for a given λ l the peak values of η 2 for the free spinning mode are larger than those for the frs mode except that the peak secondary stage efficiencies for the largest value of λ l are very close under the free spinning mode the turbine rotation speed could adjust dynamically according to the variation of the incident airflow velocity this autonomous matching mechanism can ensure the impulse turbine staying in the highly efficient mode for instance the peak value of η 2 at the middle value of λ l under the free spinning mode is increased by 17 9 5 4 9 2 and 3 7 for the four wave heights respectively 3 5 overall efficiency of the chamber turbine system the overall efficiencies of the chamber turbine system for four typical wave heights are presented in fig 18 as the overall efficiency is directly determined by the primary stage and secondary stage efficiencies together the contours of the overall efficiency can be considered as the multiplication overlaps of figs 13 and 16 which results in the ring type distribution pattern without any negative value moreover the significant band characteristics of two stage efficiencies result in the cone peaks around the optimal ranges of the values of k 4 11 10 4 kg m2 s 1 and λ l 6 0 8 0 according to the incident wave climate the design of the owc system should find an optimal chamber length for the resonance with the wavelength the results also indicate that a proper external load could enhance the overall efficiency of the system for the free spinning mode in addition the value of η o cannot keep increasing with the increase in the wave height in this study the overall efficiency is peaked at η o 0 14 for h 0 15 m the varying ranges of η o for the four wave heights from small to large are 0 003 0 09 0 01 0 12 0 03 0 14 and 0 02 0 13 respectively the peak values of η o for various wave scenarios under two operating modes are compared in fig 19 except the wave height of h 0 20 m as shown in fig 19 a b and c the peak values of η o for the free spinning mode are generally larger than those for the frs mode although the peak values of η 1 for these three wave heights are larger for the frs mode the differences for the peak values of η 2 between the two modes are much larger which results in a better performance of the free spinning mode for instance the peak values of the overall efficiency for the free spinning and frs modes are 0 14 and 0 13 respectively for h 0 20 m in fig 19 d the chamber turbine system of the owc model shows a good agreement in two operating modes and obtain very close overall efficiencies 4 conclusions and future work a model scaled oscillating water column device was manufactured and tested in a wave flume using the regular wave scenarios the free spinning of a model turbine was realized in the model tests by imposing the external loads to the electricity generator in the drive train the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performances of the chamber turbine system were investigated in 209 experimental cases the free surface elevation and the air pressure variation in the chamber and the rotation speed and torque output of the model turbine were recorded for further temporal and statistical analysis it was found that the model turbine has good self starting performance under the free spinning mode which could make the self starting in all experimental test cases the average rotation speed of the model turbine decreases with the increase in the load coefficient affecting the primary stage efficiency significantly the increase in the rotation speed enhances the damping effect of the model turbine resulting in an enlarged varying amplitude of the air pressure and the decreased free surface elevation in the chamber for the smaller wave heights the rotation speed under the free spinning is relatively lower for the chamber to obtain the optimal peak value of η 1 as the wave height increases the peak values of η 1 under two modes get closer the torque output of the model turbine increases with the increase in the load coefficient and better secondary stage efficiencies could be obtained over a range of load coefficients meanwhile the turbine shows better performance as more pneumatic power is generated by the chamber for the value of λ l between 6 0 and 8 0 the dynamic and autonomous matching mechanism under the free spinning mode can enhance the peak values of η 2 which are generally larger than those under the frs mode the contour plots indicate that the incident wave period and the external load determine the overall efficiency of the chamber turbine system together the chamber length of the owc plant should be designed to match the predominant incident wave period in addition under the free spinning mode the external load to the electrical generator should be adjusted carefully to obtain optimal overall efficiency the overall efficiencies are all less than 0 15 in this study which is caused by low secondary stage efficiency because of the manufacturing complexity the model size of the impulse turbine could not be reduced further to match the optimal opening ratio of the chamber therefore the experimental model of the chamber turbine system has not operated under a perfect hydrodynamic and aerodynamic condition resulting in a significant reduction in the turbine torque output in the future a numerical model consisting of both the turbine and the chamber will be developed to realize a direct simulation of the hydro aero interactions in the owc system an optimal area ratio between the cross section of the chamber free surface and the duct to install the impulse turbine will be found in the full scale size which can provide more valuable information for the chamber and turbine design to obtain the desired rated power of an owc plant credit
