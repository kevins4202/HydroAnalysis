3720,in this study the stable isotopic compositions δ18o δ2h and d excess in daily precipitation from october 2017 to may 2020 in the lower reach of the yangtze river lyr were examined to understand the relationship between stable isotopic compositions in precipitation and synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns sacps atmospheric circulations over the lyr were classified into seven patterns according to the kirchhofer method with three one and three sacps in the east asian winter monsoon period eawm the monsoon transition period and the east asian summer monsoon period easm respectively precipitation events between most sacps are distinguishable for either δ18o or d excess except for two sacps in the eawm and two sacps in the easm local meteorological variables are primary factors determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation for three sacps in the eawm though the precipitation producing air masses come from different seas under two different sacps in the easm i e the south china sea for one and the western pacific for the other neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable nevertheless the relationships between isotopic composition and meteorological variables appear to be distinguishable between these two sacps the sacp dominant in the monsoon transition tends to have higher δ18o mean value and δ2h mean value in precipitation than all other sacps the d excess in precipitation of this sacp is more likely altered by subcloud evaporation and the retrieval of moisture source d excess information should be treated with cautions similarly d excess in meiyu rain classified in one of the sacps in the easm period is very likely altered by moisture recycling along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway evident from the significant negative relationship between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity along the backward trajectories thus d exess of meiyu rain is very likely positively deviated from its oceanic moisture source overall the findings can provide valuable insights for understanding the relationship between stable isotopes in precipitation and sacps in the east asian monsoon region keywords atmospheric circulation patterns stable isotopes in precipitation deuterium excess lower reach of the yangtze river subcloud process 1 introduction precipitation occurs when a certain weather system transports atmospheric moisture from elsewhere condenses and falls to the surface thus changes and variabilities in moisture sources and their pathways associated with synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns sacps may influence precipitation in an area of interest tang et al 2017 steen larsen et al 2015 guan et al 2013 for instance a significant decrease of precipitation in north china in the late 1970 s about 11 6 is closely related to a decrease of water vapor from all moisture source areas jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b found that the enhanced water vapor transport from the indian ocean and strong local moisture recycling increase precipitation on the tibetan plateau in addition the influence of moisture transport pathways was also widely considered in general precipitation producing air masses originated from ocean tend to result in larger precipitation events liu et al 2017 tang et al 2015 furthermore the relationships between sacps and frequency and size of precipitation have also been discussed liu et al 2019 indicated that the atmospheric circulation during el niño southern oscillation enso events tends to increase the amount and frequency of precipitation over the gulf of mexico and argentina in general stable isotopic compositions in precipitation include lumped effects of conditions in moisture sources transport pathways sacps leading to the precipitation and in cloud and subcloud processes stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are commonly used as tracers to investigate the atmospheric phase of the hydrological cycle liu et al 2015 steen larsen et al 2015 sodemann et al 2008 the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are the components of water molecules and the variations of isotopic compositions are dependent on both the equilibrium and kinetic fractionations isotopic fractionation occurs during the phase transition of water so the isotopic compositions in precipitation and cloud vapor include information of the moisture sources and moisture transport paths wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 although individual stable isotopic composition in precipitation is informative the secondary isotopic parameter d excess defined by d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 is less variable by eliminating the co variation of δ2h and δ18o during the equilibrium fractionation tian et al 2018 guan et al 2013 masson delmotte et al 2008 and is widely used to explore the meteorological conditions of moisture sources and subcloud evaporation effect froehlich et al 2002 dansgaard 1964 many existing studies focus on the relationship between d excess in precipitation and local meteorological variables and meteorological conditions in moisture source areas that is because the kinetic fractionation that occurs under non equilibrium conditions e g subcloud process ocean and land evaporation is primary factor determining the variation of d excess in precipitation graf et al 2019 dansgaard 1964 previous studies indicate that the subcloud process is dependent on relative humidity temperature drop size distribution and height of cloud base graf et al 2019 wang et al 2017 managave et al 2016 guan et al 2013 guan et al 2009 stewart 1975 and the evaporation in moisture sources is dependent on local temperature and relative humidity wu et al 2015 in addition it is generally accepted that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on d excess is relatively small guan et al 2013 although local meteorological variables and meteorological conditions in moisture source regions influence the d excess values in precipitation it does not fully account for the variation of d excess in local precipitation bershaw 2018 recent studies indicate that the d excess in local precipitation is closely related to the meteorological conditions along the atmospheric moisture transport pathways sánchez murillo et al 2017 froehlich et al 2002 the moisture uptake and convection in the upstream regions have a significant effect on the d excess values in downstream precipitation krklec et al 2018 sánchez murillo et al 2017 for example in a humid region water vapor resulting from evaporation in the upstream areas tends to increase d excess values in cloud vapor gat and matsui 1991 while in an arid region the relationship is opposite crawford et al 2017 more specifically variation of moisture fluxes along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway is proven to have an influence on the variation of d excess in local precipitation wang et al 2017 relatively strong moisture flux convergence in the upstream regions leads to a lower d excess in downstream precipitation sánchez murillo et al 2017 klein et al 2015 suggested that the change of relative humidity over the open water along the trajectories may explain a sharp d excess decrease during a cyclone passing over the arctic thus the variation of d excess in local precipitation can provide information of meteorological conditions in the upstream regions and it is useful to identify how the meteorological conditions in moisture sources influence the variation of d excess in local precipitation after correction of the influence of moisture uptake and convection in the upstream regions variations in isotopic compositions in precipitation are also closely associated with sacps which potentially influence the precipitation generating processes tang et al 2017 brenčič et al 2015 burnett et al 2004 precipitation resulting from a particular atmospheric circulation pattern has isotopic characteristics which are different from other atmospheric circulation patterns and the precipitation resulting from similar atmospheric circulation patterns tends to have a similar isotopic characteristic brenčič et al 2015 thus sacp classification is a useful tool to reveal the relationship between isotopic compositions in precipitation and the atmospheric circulation efforts have been made to develop more reasonable classification approaches during the past decades lykoudis et al 2010 the subjective manual classifications are widely accepted as the common methods in meteorological research han et al 2018 brenčič et al 2015 yarnal 1984 for example the atmospheric variables previously used for classification of sacps include moisture sources tang et al 2017 air parcel backwards trajectories burnett et al 2004 or other meteorological variables to classify rainy days into several atmospheric circulation patterns such subjective classifications are difficult to repeat because the judgment of any two researchers may differ yarnal 1984 other studies grouped rainfall events into individual months or seasons in the east asian monsoon region assuming that the atmospheric circulation patterns are consistent in the same month or season zhou et al 2019 tang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yu et al 2015 wang et al 2001 these classification methods are simple but the limitations are obvious because months or seasons are defined based on sun earth relative position not on atmospheric circulation patterns the lower reach of the yangtze river lyr with a large population density is located in the subtropical coastal area in the east asian monsoon region the intensity and frequency of extreme drought and precipitation over the lyr are projected to increase significantly on the background of global warming li et al 2021 guo et al 2013 thus an understanding of mechanisms resulting in local drought and flood is urgently needed to manage the risk of potentially devastating impacts of climate change li et al 2021 qu et al 2018 recent studies have revealed the importance of meteorological conditions in local and changes in sources of moisture in controlling the seasonal variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation in the lyr sui et al 2019 ma et al 2018 dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a tang et al 2015 however how sacps are associated with seasonal variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation is not clear for this region in this study multiple year isotopic compositions in daily precipitation october 2017 to may 2020 and meteorological data are used to investigate controlling factors determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation under different sacps the objectives of this research are to 1 apply a data driven atmospheric circulation categorization method to classify rainfall events and to investigate 2 how stable isotopic compositions in precipitation vary with atmospheric circulation in the lyr 3 what factors primarily determine the variation of d excess for different sacps and 4 how the meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories impact the variation of d excess in local precipitation 2 study area the hemuqiao watershed 119 34 e 34 31 n is located in the lyr and is surrounded by low hilly terrain fig 1 the climate is controlled by the east asian monsoon with an average annual temperature of 14 the minimum mean monthly temperature 1 3 c occurs in january and maximum mean monthly temperature 25 c is in july average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration are 1580 mm and 805 mm respectively liu et al 2012 the study area has four distinct seasons each lasting for three months spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february during the study period summer precipitation accounts for 50 of the annual precipitation while autumn includes a small portion 12 of the annual precipitation table a1 in addition the maximum daily precipitation is 108 mm which occurred in august in 2018 and the longest period without precipitation lasted for 47 days in october and november in 2019 table a1 fig 2 shows the vertically integrated mean water vapor transport in different seasons from october 2017 to may 2020 the daily sea level pressure daily wind fields and daily specific humidity at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data https www psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html are used to produce vertically integrated water vapor flux field from the surface to 300 hpa fig 2 in winter and spring the study area is located at the edge of the southwesterly vapor flux belt the water vapor comes from low latitude continental areas such us southwest china bangladesh northern laos and northern thailand the moisture transport from the northwest of the study area is much weaker than the southwesterly vapor flux belt during summer there are two active rainy seasons in the lyr meiyu season june mid july and typhoon season july september chen 2004 both frequently lead to flooding the primary direction of water vapor transport to the study area changes from southwest to south the meridional vapor flux transport from the south china sea to north due to the intensity of the east asian summer monsoon in summer the integrated water vapor flux indicates that the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western pacific may be the primary moisture source areas in autumn water vapor mainly originates from the bay of bengal entering the study area through the southeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau the magnitude of vertically integrated mean water vapor transport in the southwesterly vapor flux belt in autumn is smaller than that in winter and spring 3 methods 3 1 stable isotope and meteorological data precipitation samples were collected daily over a 2 5 year period from october 1 2017 to may 31 2020 in the middle of hemuqiao watershed about 220 m sea level height and transferred into 30 ml polyethylene vials samples were filtered with 0 22 μm filter paper into 2 ml vials before the stable isotopic compositions being analyzed δ18o and δ2h were measured with thermo fisher mat253 in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in hohai university within 3 months from collection repeated analysis of every rainwater sample for 6 times and the first three results were deleted to minimize the memory of machine the arithmetic mean of the last three results was used to represent the sample isotopic composition analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 1 and 2 respectively in addition to the isotopic data of daily precipitation daily meteorological data was obtained from meteorological station at the outlet of the watershed including temperature relative humidity the precipitation amount data was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm per tip which was located at the same location as precipitation samples collector the precipitation amount temperature specific humidity and relative humidity along the backward trajectories were calculated based on the global reanalysis dataset global data assimilation system gdas1 provided by air resources laboratory arl ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 with a resolution of 1 1 in addition daily outgoing longwave radiation olr from 2017 to 2020 at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa reanalysis data http www psl noaa gov data gridded data uninterp olr html is used to assess the convective intensity 3 2 classification of sacps classification of sacps has been developed since the 1960s in order to distinguish the synoptic patterns which occur most frequently han et al 2018 lykoudis et al 2010 kalkstein et al 1987 thus the atmospheric circulation can be better revealed within a relatively small number of representative patterns the classification methods of sacps can be classified into two categories manual and automated each having its own advantages and disadvantages philipp et al 2010 detail descriptions of the classification methods are summarized by philipp et al 2010 2014 in this study the kirchhofer method a correlation based automated method is adopted to classify sacps yarnal 1984 one advantage of this method is that the subdomains the meteorological variable in each row and column are also considered in the classification process for sacps han et al 2018 another advantage is that this method is more rapidly conducted than manual method and considerably reduces although not eliminates the level of subjectivity romolo et al 2006 in the lyr previous studies have applied this classification method to explore the relationship between air pollution and sacps han et al 2018 shu et al 2017 however whether this method can be used to explore the response of isotopic characteristics in precipitation to different sacps in monsoon regions has not been studied before in this study the daily geopotential height data of 850 hpa at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from ncep reanalysis data https www psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep html is used to classify sacps that is because the precipitation in the east asian monsoon region is closely related to the 850 hpa geopotential height field lee et al 2013 cannon and mckendry 2002 the land sea thermal contrast is the basis for the monsoon circulation formation and the 850 hpa geopotential height is sensitive to the thermal difference between land and sea huang et al 2007 as a result 850 hpa geopotential height field effectively reflects the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns the classification method mainly includes three steps firstly the daily gridded of geopotential height dataset are normalized 1 z i x i x s where zi is the normalized geopotential height value of grid i xi is the original value for grid i x and s are the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the study domain respectively the main purpose of the data normalized is to eliminate the seasonal variability in the geopotential height and to improve the comparability of different seasons secondly kirchhofer scores are calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n z ai z bi 2 where s is kirchhofer score z ai is the normalized value for grid i on day a z bi is the normalized value for grid i on day b n is the numbers of the grid points the kirchhofer scores are calculated for each row sr each column sc and the entire domain st corresponding to number of row nr column nc and the product of the two nt in this study the thresholds for sr sc and st are set to 1 8nr 1 8nc and 0 8nt han et al 2018 yarnal 1984 respectively when the sr sc and st between days a and b are less than their thresholds the sacp between day a and day b is considered similar the day with the maximum similar days is recorded as keyday1 and the keyday1 is the representative day of pattern 1 then all grid geopotential height data of keyday1 and all days similar to keyday1 are removed from the analysis we repeat the calculation to obtain the subsequent keydays until the number of unclassified days are 10 of the total number of days finally all days of the study period are classified as one of the patterns if a day is connected to to more than one keyday and then the lowest kirchhofer score determines which pattern the day belongs to as the precipitation sampling point was located in the lyr atmospheric condition over the area of 110 128 e in longitude and 20 40 n in latitude was used for sacp classification in this study 3 3 hysplit model the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model version 4 was used to calculate the trajectory of water vapor and to identify the moisture source areas rolph et al 2017 stein et al 2015 the hysplit was acquired from the arl noaa https www ready noaa gov hysplit php and has been extensively applied in air parcel trajectories in atmospheric circulation field wang et al 2017 guan et al 2013 in this study a hysplit compatible meteorological data set of gdas1 at 1 1 resolution which was downloaded though the data portal provided in the hysplit interface ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 was used to drive the backward trajectory model in this study the windows based hysplit model was used to simulate the backward trajectories of moisture and to identify the moisture source areas of air masses for each sacp as the precipitation samples collected at 8 00 in each day the 240 hr backward trajectories originating from the sampling site backward trajectory for 8 00 of every rainy day at different height 500 m 1000 m 1500 m were generated 3 4 statistical analysis an analysis of covariance ancova was used to assess the difference of linear relationship between d excess and δ18o among sacps and the mann whitney u test was used to test if any significant differences exist in the isotopic compositions d excess and δ18o in precipitation between any two sacps linear regression was used to explore linear relationship between d excess and δ18o in each sacp and that between various meteorological variables and isotopic compositions in precipitation the correlation coefficient and significance test were analyzed by pearson s correlation test and two tailed t test respectively statistical analyses were conducted in ibm spss statistics 24 4 results 4 1 isotopic characteristics in precipitation under different atmospheric circulation patterns altogether 218 precipitation samples were collected at the hemuqiao watershed during the study period table a1 the precipitation isotopic composition δ18o at the sampling point exhibits notable seasonal variability with more enriched values in spring and winter and depleted values in summer and autumn fig 3 this result shows a consistent seasonal variation pattern of precipitation isotopic composition with other sampling stations in the lyr fig 3 sui et al 2019 ma et al 2018 dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a tang et al 2015 in addition to precipitation isotopic composition analysis sacp classification was performed for each day from october 1 2017 to may 31 2020 at the beginning six dominant sacps are identified fig a1 the study area is controlled by strong east asian summer monsoon in pattern s fig a1 because of the complexity of precipitation types in this period we reclassified this pattern into two patterns pattern s2 and pattern s3 using smaller thresholds thresholds for sr sc and st are 0 6nr 0 6nc and 0 35nt respectively finally seven dominant sacps are identified in this study and the number of classified days accounts for 95 1 of the total days during the study period table 1 we designate these sacps according to the large scale weather systems and the direction of the prevailing wind under each sacp han et al 2018 their names are as follows pattern w1 the east asian trough and the western pacific subtropical high eat wpsh pattern w2 the east asian trough and the mongolian high eat mh pattern w3 the south westerly low level jet llj pattern t1 the western pacific subtropical high with south westerly wind wpsh sw pattern s1 the east asian summer monsoon with south westerly wind easm sw pattern s2 the east asian summer monsoon with strong south westerly wind easm ssw pattern s3 the east asian summer monsoon with a low pressure system in the sea easm lp the mean geopotential height and wind field at 850 hpa during rainy days under different sacps are shown in fig 4 and the temporal distribution of rainy days under different sacps are shown in fig 5 overall the temporal distribution of these patterns forms a seasonal cycle with some overlaps the representative day number of days seasonal distribution number and frequency of rainy days and isotopic compositions in precipitation of each classified sacp are summarized in table 1 the 850 hpa zonal winds averaged over the central south china sea 5 15 n 110 120 e is widely accepted as an index to identify whether the east asian monsoon region is under the control of the east asian summer monsoon easm or the east asian winter monsoon eawm wang et al 2004 the atmospheric circulation classified as pattern t1 which is the transition period between the easm and the eawm mainly occurs in april may and october fig 5 the precipitation isotopic compositions of this pattern are enriched in heavy isotopes 2 40 for δ18o and 12 56 for δ2h with the lowest standard deviation 1 14 for δ18o and 7 04 for δ2h table 1 for pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 in the eawm the central south china sea is influenced strongly by prevailing easterlies fig 4 this is also supported by the temporal distribution of rainy days in fig 5 where the rainy days appear in the eawm period the frequency of rainy days under these three sacps is in the range of 17 76 to 22 60 table 1 the isotopic compositions in precipitation in these patterns ranges from 4 65 to 6 15 for δ18o with an average of 5 10 and from 26 47 to 36 02 for δ2h with an average of 28 53 table 1 for pattern s1 pattern s2 and pattern s3 the central south china sea is influenced strongly by prevailing westerlies fig 4 and these patterns are the dominant sacps in the easm period for pattern s1 the south westerly wind field at 850 hpa is weaker than that in pattern s2 indicating that the influence of the easm on the study area in this pattern is weaker than that in pattern s2 fig 4 and the average values of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation in this pattern are slightly more enriched in heavy isotopes than those in pattern s2 table 1 for pattern s2 the frequency of rainy days is the largest 35 44 precipitation occurring under pattern s3 tends to have a low d excess value the d excess and δ18o in precipitation in different sacps are summarized in fig 6 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows significant differences p 0 001 between some patterns for each pattern in the eawm period there is no significant linear correlation between d excess and δ18o pattern w1 r 0 185 p 0 160 pattern w2 r 0 420 p 0 074 and pattern w3 r 0 222 p 0 174 in the easm period the d excess has significant negative linear relationship with δ18o for pattern s1 r 0 437 p 0 029 pattern s2 r 0 547 p 0 003 for pattern s3 the correlation coefficient is not significant r 0 458 p 0 056 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 196 among these three patterns a more significant negative linear correlation is found between d excess and δ18o r 0 638 p 0 002 in the monsoon transition period pattern t1 4 2 relationship between d excess and relative humidity and precipitation relative humidity rh and precipitation size p are considered to be two main local meteorological factors influencing the d excess values in precipitation through influencing the subcloud evaporation effect guan et al 2013 peng et al 2007 the correlations between d excess in precipitation and local relative humidity and precipitatiaon size in pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 are presented in fig 7 for pattern t1 strong positive correlations are found between d excess in precipitation and relative humidity and precipitation amount fig 7 a and b the correlation coefficients are 0 531 for d excess and relative humidity and 0 585 for d excess and precipitation amount respectively within a 0 05 significance level a multiple linear relationship is established between d excess and relative humidity and precipitation 3 d e x c e s s 0 176 p mm 0 428 r h 33 163 p v a l u e s f o r p a n d r h a r e 0 01 and 0 02 r e s p e c t i v e l y r 2 0 51 thus relative humidity and precipitation combined explains 51 of the d excess variation in pattern t1 for pattern s2 there is significant linear correlation between d excess and relative humidity r 0 445 p 0 018 however no significant correlation is observed between d excess and local meteorological variables for pattern s1 4 3 relationship between d excess and atmospheric variables along the backward trajectories the d excess values in precipitation are sensitive to the meteorological conditions in moisture source areas and can change along the backward trajectories through kinetic fractionation steen larsen et al 2015 guan et al 2013 consequently it is reasonable to study the response of variation of d excess in precipitation to meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories the correlation coefficients r and p values between d excess and cumulative precipitation mean specific humidity mean temperature and mean relative humidity at 1000 m above ground within t days preceding rainfall event in pattern s2 are summarized in fig 8 generally there are relatively strong negative correlations between the d excess in precipitation for pattern s2 and mean specific humidity and mean temperature along the backward trajectories at starting height of 1000 m fig 8 rainy days under pattern s2 are divided into two precipitation types i e meiyu and other precipitation based on the knowledge of relevant precipitation weather systems meiyu is a unique phenomenon of the east asian monsoon region it occurs during june to mid july chen 2004 the type of meiyu is determined according to official designation of the meiyu period 6 20 2018 7 9 2018 6 17 2019 7 17 2019 www cma gov cn overall twenty of the 28 rainy days under pattern s2 resulted from meiyu and the remaining eight rainy days resulted from other precipitation a composite analysis of olr was also conducted for each precipitation types fig 9 because olr data is widely accepted as an indicator for estimating deep convective processes during a precipitation event tang et al 2015 wang and xu 1997 in general areas with low olr values are more likely to result from strong convection and olr is negatively correlated with convective intensity and precipitation tang et al 2015 the average olr value in the study area during the meiyu period is lower than that of other precipitation indicating that the convective activity is stronger in the meiyu period of pattern s2 the precipitation isotopic composition analysis was also performed for the meiyu and other precipitation under pattern s2 the δ18o and d excess values of these two precipitation types in pattern s2 are plotted on a δ18o d excess diagram fig a2 and an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 732 between meiyu and other precipitation under pattern s2 however the influence of meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories on the d excess values exhibits significant differences the correlation coefficients r and p values between d excess in precipitation in different precipitation types and cumulative precipitation mean specific humidity mean temperature and mean relative humidity are calculated fig 8 b for meiyu table a2 for other precipitation strong negative correlations between d excess in meiyu under pattern s2 and mean temperature and mean specific humidity along the trajectories from 2 to 10 days anchored 1000 m above ground at the study site prior to the meiyu are found the r varies from 0 54 to 0 70 and 0 52 to 0 63 for mean specific humidity and mean temperature respectively within a 0 05 confidence limit fig 8 b furthermore the linear correlation between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity along the backward trajectories peaks around 4 days prior to a meiyu rainfall event fig 8 b fig 10 no significant correlations are observed between d excess and cumulative precipitation and relative humidity from 1 day prior to arrival to 10 days prior to arrival p 0 05 of meiyu events in addition backward trajectories analysis exhibits the moisture sources is a mixture of inland and oceanic sources fig 11 as for other precipitation no significant correlations are found between d excess and specific humidity and temperature along the backward trajectories table a2 for pattern s3 a more significantly negative correlation exists between d excess in precipitation and mean relative humidity along the trajectories from 5 to 10 days prior to precipitation and no significant correlations are observed between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity and mean temperature along the trajectories fig a3 rain events under pattern s3 are further divided into two precipitation types i e typhoon and other precipitation the type of typhoon is determined according to the official announcements www cma gov cn overall seven of the 18 events under pattern s3 resulted from typhoon and the remaining eleven events resulted from non typhoon type weather an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 487 between typhoon and other precipitation under pattern s3 fig a2 though the convective activity in the lyr between these precipitation types is quite different fig a4 there are no significant correlations between d excess and atmospheric variables along the backward trajectories in typhoon under pattern s3 and the d excess in other precipitation has significant negative correlation with mean relative humidity along the backward trajectories anchored 1000 m above ground at the study site from 5 to 9 days prior to the precipitation fig a3 5 discussion 5 1 sacp classification for precipitation isotopic analysis for most patterns they are distinguishable for either δ18o or d excess except for pattern w1 and pattern w2 and for pattern s2 and pattern s3 table 2 the precipitation occurring in the easm period in pattern s1 pattern s2 and pattern s3 has more depleted δ18o values and lower d excess values than those in the eawm period in pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 table 1 this result is similar to previous investigations at changsha wu et al 2015 and nanjing tang et al 2015 as for the easm period pattern s1 is characterized by a high pressure system extending westward from the western pacific subtropical high fig 4 the δ18o in precipitation resulting from pattern s1 is distinguishable from other patterns table 2 the enrichment in heavy isotopes of δ18o 5 75 in precipitation in this pattern is very likely associate with its moisture sources the moisture sources are mixed from high latitude inland and the south china sea fig 12 and the precipitation producing air masses from inland may contribute to the enriched δ18o with high d excess values in precipitation in the lyr sui et al 2019 tang et al 2017 tang et al 2015 while under other patterns in the easm the precipitation producing air masses mainly come from the ocean i e the south china sea for pattern s2 and the western pacific for pattern s3 fig 12 though the atmospheric circulation patterns of these two patterns pattern s2 and pattern s3 are different neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable in the monsoon transition period pattern t1 both δ18o and d excess in precipitation exhibit significant differences from those in other patterns table 2 more discussion on this result is included in section 5 2 in the eawm for pattern w1 and pattern w2 the study area is under the control of the different intensity of the western pacific subtropical high and the mongolian high at the 850 hpa level fig 4 but δ18o and d excess in precipitation of these patterns do not exhibit significant differences table 2 the similar local meteorological conditions are likely the main factors resulting in similar isotopic compositions in precipitation in these patterns for example the mean temperature during rainy days in pattern w1 is 7 2 and for pattern w2 is 5 5 fig a5 the mean precipitation during rainy days in pattern w1 is 9 9 mm and for pattern w2 is 10 5 mm fig a5 in addition the moisture sources and magnitude of total water vapor flux for pattern w1 and pattern w2 are similar water vapor over the lyr mainly comes from low latitude land and less affected by ocean moisture fig 12 for pattern w3 the study area is less influenced by the mongolian high and the east asian trough fig 4 and d excess in precipitation resulting from pattern w3 is distinguishable from other patterns in the eawm table 2 though the moisture sources and magnitude of total water vapor flux for pattern w3 are similar to pattern w1 and pattern w2 fig 12 the local meteorological variables are quite different the mean relative humidity during rainy days in pattern w3 is 83 4 in comparison to 86 8 for pattern w1 and 87 5 for pattern w2 this is associated with the higher mean temperature 11 9 in comparison to 7 2 for pattern w1 and 5 5 for pattern w2 during the eawm fig a5 a lower mean relative humidity associated with higher mean temperature tends to increase subcloud evaporation and moisture exchange with ambient moisture in the subcloud layer under pattern w3 this is supported by a negative relationship between temperature and d excess in pattern w3 table 4 in general the categorization of rainy days used kirchhofer method has the advantage for assessing the atmospheric circulation s effect on the isotopic compositions in precipitation than monthly or seasonal grouping of rainy days although either δ18o or d excess in precipitation in different seasons is distinguishable from each other table a3 the classification of rainy days according to season is not sufficient to capture the information contained in isotopic compositions of precipitation as for δ18o there is significantly negative relationship between δ18o and precipitation for pattern w1 and pattern w2 in the eawm from november to april but this relationship is not significant for winter and autumn when seasonal grouping applies table 3 fig a6 fig a9 as for d excess a positive relationship exists between d excess and precipitation size for pattern t1 which occurs in spring and autumn but this relationship is not significant in seasonal grouping table 4 fig a11 fig a13 when we group the rainy days into individual months both δ18o and d excess in precipitation in january and february march and april april and may june and september june and october june and november august and october september and october september and november october and november october and december november and december do not exhibit significant differences table a4 table a5 as for δ18o there is significantly negative relationship between δ18o and precipitation under pattern s1 which occurs in may june july september and october but this relationship is not significant in these months except for june table 3 fig a7 fig a8 fig a9 as for d excess there is significantly negative relationship between d excess and temperature under pattern w3 which occurs in the eawm period but this relationship is not significant from november to april table 4 fig a10 fig a11 fig a13 this is the first attempt to investigate the association of precipitation isotopic compositions with the different sacps classified by the kirchhofer method in the east asian monsoon region some limitations are noted from this study for example different thresholds for sr sc and st could affect the results of the precipitation weather classification a previous study also reported that different thresholds could result in different keydays chosen for each pattern it was found that the total number of patterns increases with a decrease in threshold values huth 1996 in this study the thresholds were adopted according to previous studies barry et al 1981 yarnal 1984 in which the thresholds were applied to investigate the relationship between sacps and air pollution in the lyr han et al 2018 when we used smaller thresholds thresholds for sr sc and st are 0 6nr 0 6nc and 0 35nt respectively to reclassify the pattern which controlled by strong east asian summer monsoon most of meiyu events 20 of the 23 rainy days are categorized into pattern s2 and most of typhoon precipitation days 7 of the 8 rainy days are categorized into pattern s3 however we could not distinguish meiyu and other precipitation 8 events under pattern s2 and typhoon and other precipitation under pattern s3 by adjusting the thresholds this situation suggests the method based on 850 hpa geopotential height field is not sufficient to classify all patterns including other meteorological variables may help to further separate sacps under pattern s2 and pattern s3 for example in this study we demonstrate that mean olr is useful to tell meiyu from other precipitation under pattern s2 5 2 subcloud evaporation during the monsoon transition period pattern t1 subcloud evaporation is expected to cause an increase of δ18o and a decrease of d excess in precipitation wu et al 2015 guan et al 2013 apparent negative correlations between d excess and δ18o in precipitation for pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 suggest that subcloud evaporation may play a role in determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation fig 6 another indicator of subcloud evaporation is the relationship between d excess and relative humidity and between d excess and precipitation size this is also used to further test the effect of subcloud evaporation in pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 table 5 fig 7 similar to the methodology of peng et al 2007 when the subcloud evaporation is important in isotopic compositions in precipitation the d excess in precipitation increases with precipitation size and local relative humidity guan et al 2013 according to the latter method the subcloud evaporation is considered minor for pattern s1 and pattern s2 and significant for pattern t1 for pattern s1 the small precipitation associated with lower relative humidity may strengthen the subcloud evaporation which would result in a low d excess in precipitation but in this pattern the maximum d excess 15 69 in precipitation occurs in a small daily rainfall size 0 p 10 mm with a relatively low relative humidity 77 8 fig 7 table 5 which is not consistent with the subcloud evaporation effect on the variation of d excess in precipitation for pattern s2 a smaller daily rainfall size 0 p 10 mm tends to have a higher d excess 4 08 than that in larger daily rainfall size 10 p 20 mm table 5 this suggests that the isotopic compositions in precipitation in this pattern are less likely influenced by subcloud evaporation the isotopic compositions in precipitation under pattern s3 are also less likely influenced by subcloud evaporation effect because mean precipitation is 27 8 mm fig a5 and no significant linear correlation exists between d excess and precipitation table 4 for pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 small subcloud evaporation may occur due to a relatively small size of precipitation under low temperature fig a5 which is consistent with previous studies in arid semi arid and monsoon regions chen et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 peng et al 2010 during the monsoon transition period pattern t1 a small daily rainfall size p 20 mm tends to have a low d excess 4 38 4 52 and high δ18o 1 99 2 41 and a large daily rainfall size p 20 mm tends to have a high d excess 13 61 and low δ18o 3 57 table 5 the d excess values in precipitation gradually decrease with a decrease in precipitation size and relative humidity equation 3 these two pieces of evidence suggest that the subcloud evaporation effect is important in precipitation processes under this pattern when the precipitation amount over 40 mm the d excess in precipitation tends to be stable approximately equivalent to 15 to 20 fig 7 b 5 3 upstream specific humidity controls the d excess in meiyu in this study area d excess in meiyu included in pattern s2 has significant negative correlation with mean specific humidity preceding the precipitation along the backward trajectories anchored at 1000 m above ground at the precipitation site fig 8 and the correlation coefficients are larger than those between d excess in precipitation and local meteorological variables temperature precipitation and relative humidity fig a14 the value of the lag correlation coefficient between d excess and mean specific humidity peaks r 0 70 p 0 001 at 4 days preceding meiyu event fig 8 implying that mositure transport process during 4 days preceding each rainy day plays a role in determining the variation of d excess in local precipitation previous studies also suggested that the mositure transport process could result in variation of d excess in downstream precipitation table 6 in this study the upstream factor and potential mechanisms accounting for the upstream factor determining the variation of d excess in downstream precipitation appear to be different from previous studies in this study a higher d excess in precipitation resulting from a lower mean 4 days specific humidity preceding the precipitation may be caused by moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway backward trajectories analyses show that precipitation producing air masses for meiyu events in the study area mainly come from the south china sea fig 11 tang et al 2015 ding 2007 we present a schematic representation of the influence of moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation on the d excess in cloud water vapor during the meiyu moisture transport process fig 13 for an initial cloud vapor with a d excess of 5 0 typical for the meiyu moisture source area pfahl and sodemann 2014 and a specific humidity of 18 0 g kg based on the ncep reanalysis data condensation of 20 of cloud vapor at an average temperature of 12 at the cloud layer 2000 m above ground can result in a d excess value of 5 7 in raindrop at cloud base 1000 m above ground according to steward model fig 13 guan et al 2013 stewart 1975 subsequently subcloud evaporation and moisture exchange with ambient moisture alter the d excess in falling raindrops evaporation of 5 at a rh of 95 in the subcloud layer may decrease d excess values from 5 7 in the raindrop at cloud base to 0 5 in surface precipitation based on the steward model fig 13 stewart 1975 this is consistent with isotopic observations at guangzhou xie et al 2011 and changsha wu et al 2015 d excess in precipitation appear with abnormally low values approximately equivalent to 0 in these stations during the meiyu period if all the evaporated moisture recycles back into the cloud layer the d excess value of cloud vapor may increase from an initial 5 0 to approximately 6 0 and the specific humidity may decrease from initial 18 g kg to approximately 14 6 g kg according to the conservation of mass fig 13 if the fraction of evaporated moisture recycles back into the cloud layer is 30 the d excess value of cloud vapor may increase to approximately 5 2 as water vapor moves inland and continuous moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation gradually increase d excess in the remaining cloud vapor this effect increases when the moisture recycling is enhanced by lower specific humidity along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway this conceptualization suggests that in addition to the influences of the meteorological variables in the moisture source areas relative humidity temperature and wind and at the local area relative humidity temperature and precipitation size the d excess values in local precipitation can be influenced by the moisture recycling processes along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway more specifically our analysis has demonstrated that moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation that takes place along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway can explain the variation of d excess in the lyr during the meiyu period thus this result contributes new insights to understanding the relationship between large scale atmospheric process and d excess in local precipitation 6 conclusions in this article we applied the kirchhofer weather systems classification method to explore the characteristics of isotopic compositions in precipitation in the lyr for different sacps seven dominant sacps are classified with three one and three sacps in the east asian winter monsoon period the monsoon transition period and the east asian summer monsoon period respectively for most sacps rainfall isotopic composition is distinguishable in either δ18o or d excess except for the eat wpsh pattern w1 and the eat mh pattern w2 and for the easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 for the eat wpsh pattern w1 the eat mh pattern w2 and the llj pattern w3 the local meteorological variables seem to play an important role in determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation for the easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 though the precipitation producing air masses come from different seas i e the south china sea for pattern s2 and the western pacific for pattern s3 neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable nevertheless the relationships between isotopic compositions and meteorological variables appear to be distinguishable between them the subcloud evaporation is minor in the eat wpsh pattern w1 the eat mh pattern w2 the llj pattern w3 the easm sw pattern s1 easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 in the wpsh sw pattern t1 the monsoon transition period the d excess in precipitation is more likely altered by subcloud evaporation and the estimation of the moisture source based on d excess information should be treated with cautions under this sacp for the easm ssw pattern s2 precipitation samples have small or negligible subcloud evaporation and d excess values in the meiyu classified in this pattern are closely related to the mean 4 days specific humidity along the backward trajectories this is likely caused by moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway credit authorship contribution statement jianfeng gou conceptualization methodology

3720,in this study the stable isotopic compositions δ18o δ2h and d excess in daily precipitation from october 2017 to may 2020 in the lower reach of the yangtze river lyr were examined to understand the relationship between stable isotopic compositions in precipitation and synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns sacps atmospheric circulations over the lyr were classified into seven patterns according to the kirchhofer method with three one and three sacps in the east asian winter monsoon period eawm the monsoon transition period and the east asian summer monsoon period easm respectively precipitation events between most sacps are distinguishable for either δ18o or d excess except for two sacps in the eawm and two sacps in the easm local meteorological variables are primary factors determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation for three sacps in the eawm though the precipitation producing air masses come from different seas under two different sacps in the easm i e the south china sea for one and the western pacific for the other neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable nevertheless the relationships between isotopic composition and meteorological variables appear to be distinguishable between these two sacps the sacp dominant in the monsoon transition tends to have higher δ18o mean value and δ2h mean value in precipitation than all other sacps the d excess in precipitation of this sacp is more likely altered by subcloud evaporation and the retrieval of moisture source d excess information should be treated with cautions similarly d excess in meiyu rain classified in one of the sacps in the easm period is very likely altered by moisture recycling along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway evident from the significant negative relationship between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity along the backward trajectories thus d exess of meiyu rain is very likely positively deviated from its oceanic moisture source overall the findings can provide valuable insights for understanding the relationship between stable isotopes in precipitation and sacps in the east asian monsoon region keywords atmospheric circulation patterns stable isotopes in precipitation deuterium excess lower reach of the yangtze river subcloud process 1 introduction precipitation occurs when a certain weather system transports atmospheric moisture from elsewhere condenses and falls to the surface thus changes and variabilities in moisture sources and their pathways associated with synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns sacps may influence precipitation in an area of interest tang et al 2017 steen larsen et al 2015 guan et al 2013 for instance a significant decrease of precipitation in north china in the late 1970 s about 11 6 is closely related to a decrease of water vapor from all moisture source areas jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b found that the enhanced water vapor transport from the indian ocean and strong local moisture recycling increase precipitation on the tibetan plateau in addition the influence of moisture transport pathways was also widely considered in general precipitation producing air masses originated from ocean tend to result in larger precipitation events liu et al 2017 tang et al 2015 furthermore the relationships between sacps and frequency and size of precipitation have also been discussed liu et al 2019 indicated that the atmospheric circulation during el niño southern oscillation enso events tends to increase the amount and frequency of precipitation over the gulf of mexico and argentina in general stable isotopic compositions in precipitation include lumped effects of conditions in moisture sources transport pathways sacps leading to the precipitation and in cloud and subcloud processes stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are commonly used as tracers to investigate the atmospheric phase of the hydrological cycle liu et al 2015 steen larsen et al 2015 sodemann et al 2008 the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are the components of water molecules and the variations of isotopic compositions are dependent on both the equilibrium and kinetic fractionations isotopic fractionation occurs during the phase transition of water so the isotopic compositions in precipitation and cloud vapor include information of the moisture sources and moisture transport paths wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 although individual stable isotopic composition in precipitation is informative the secondary isotopic parameter d excess defined by d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 is less variable by eliminating the co variation of δ2h and δ18o during the equilibrium fractionation tian et al 2018 guan et al 2013 masson delmotte et al 2008 and is widely used to explore the meteorological conditions of moisture sources and subcloud evaporation effect froehlich et al 2002 dansgaard 1964 many existing studies focus on the relationship between d excess in precipitation and local meteorological variables and meteorological conditions in moisture source areas that is because the kinetic fractionation that occurs under non equilibrium conditions e g subcloud process ocean and land evaporation is primary factor determining the variation of d excess in precipitation graf et al 2019 dansgaard 1964 previous studies indicate that the subcloud process is dependent on relative humidity temperature drop size distribution and height of cloud base graf et al 2019 wang et al 2017 managave et al 2016 guan et al 2013 guan et al 2009 stewart 1975 and the evaporation in moisture sources is dependent on local temperature and relative humidity wu et al 2015 in addition it is generally accepted that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on d excess is relatively small guan et al 2013 although local meteorological variables and meteorological conditions in moisture source regions influence the d excess values in precipitation it does not fully account for the variation of d excess in local precipitation bershaw 2018 recent studies indicate that the d excess in local precipitation is closely related to the meteorological conditions along the atmospheric moisture transport pathways sánchez murillo et al 2017 froehlich et al 2002 the moisture uptake and convection in the upstream regions have a significant effect on the d excess values in downstream precipitation krklec et al 2018 sánchez murillo et al 2017 for example in a humid region water vapor resulting from evaporation in the upstream areas tends to increase d excess values in cloud vapor gat and matsui 1991 while in an arid region the relationship is opposite crawford et al 2017 more specifically variation of moisture fluxes along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway is proven to have an influence on the variation of d excess in local precipitation wang et al 2017 relatively strong moisture flux convergence in the upstream regions leads to a lower d excess in downstream precipitation sánchez murillo et al 2017 klein et al 2015 suggested that the change of relative humidity over the open water along the trajectories may explain a sharp d excess decrease during a cyclone passing over the arctic thus the variation of d excess in local precipitation can provide information of meteorological conditions in the upstream regions and it is useful to identify how the meteorological conditions in moisture sources influence the variation of d excess in local precipitation after correction of the influence of moisture uptake and convection in the upstream regions variations in isotopic compositions in precipitation are also closely associated with sacps which potentially influence the precipitation generating processes tang et al 2017 brenčič et al 2015 burnett et al 2004 precipitation resulting from a particular atmospheric circulation pattern has isotopic characteristics which are different from other atmospheric circulation patterns and the precipitation resulting from similar atmospheric circulation patterns tends to have a similar isotopic characteristic brenčič et al 2015 thus sacp classification is a useful tool to reveal the relationship between isotopic compositions in precipitation and the atmospheric circulation efforts have been made to develop more reasonable classification approaches during the past decades lykoudis et al 2010 the subjective manual classifications are widely accepted as the common methods in meteorological research han et al 2018 brenčič et al 2015 yarnal 1984 for example the atmospheric variables previously used for classification of sacps include moisture sources tang et al 2017 air parcel backwards trajectories burnett et al 2004 or other meteorological variables to classify rainy days into several atmospheric circulation patterns such subjective classifications are difficult to repeat because the judgment of any two researchers may differ yarnal 1984 other studies grouped rainfall events into individual months or seasons in the east asian monsoon region assuming that the atmospheric circulation patterns are consistent in the same month or season zhou et al 2019 tang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yu et al 2015 wang et al 2001 these classification methods are simple but the limitations are obvious because months or seasons are defined based on sun earth relative position not on atmospheric circulation patterns the lower reach of the yangtze river lyr with a large population density is located in the subtropical coastal area in the east asian monsoon region the intensity and frequency of extreme drought and precipitation over the lyr are projected to increase significantly on the background of global warming li et al 2021 guo et al 2013 thus an understanding of mechanisms resulting in local drought and flood is urgently needed to manage the risk of potentially devastating impacts of climate change li et al 2021 qu et al 2018 recent studies have revealed the importance of meteorological conditions in local and changes in sources of moisture in controlling the seasonal variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation in the lyr sui et al 2019 ma et al 2018 dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a tang et al 2015 however how sacps are associated with seasonal variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation is not clear for this region in this study multiple year isotopic compositions in daily precipitation october 2017 to may 2020 and meteorological data are used to investigate controlling factors determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation under different sacps the objectives of this research are to 1 apply a data driven atmospheric circulation categorization method to classify rainfall events and to investigate 2 how stable isotopic compositions in precipitation vary with atmospheric circulation in the lyr 3 what factors primarily determine the variation of d excess for different sacps and 4 how the meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories impact the variation of d excess in local precipitation 2 study area the hemuqiao watershed 119 34 e 34 31 n is located in the lyr and is surrounded by low hilly terrain fig 1 the climate is controlled by the east asian monsoon with an average annual temperature of 14 the minimum mean monthly temperature 1 3 c occurs in january and maximum mean monthly temperature 25 c is in july average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration are 1580 mm and 805 mm respectively liu et al 2012 the study area has four distinct seasons each lasting for three months spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february during the study period summer precipitation accounts for 50 of the annual precipitation while autumn includes a small portion 12 of the annual precipitation table a1 in addition the maximum daily precipitation is 108 mm which occurred in august in 2018 and the longest period without precipitation lasted for 47 days in october and november in 2019 table a1 fig 2 shows the vertically integrated mean water vapor transport in different seasons from october 2017 to may 2020 the daily sea level pressure daily wind fields and daily specific humidity at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data https www psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html are used to produce vertically integrated water vapor flux field from the surface to 300 hpa fig 2 in winter and spring the study area is located at the edge of the southwesterly vapor flux belt the water vapor comes from low latitude continental areas such us southwest china bangladesh northern laos and northern thailand the moisture transport from the northwest of the study area is much weaker than the southwesterly vapor flux belt during summer there are two active rainy seasons in the lyr meiyu season june mid july and typhoon season july september chen 2004 both frequently lead to flooding the primary direction of water vapor transport to the study area changes from southwest to south the meridional vapor flux transport from the south china sea to north due to the intensity of the east asian summer monsoon in summer the integrated water vapor flux indicates that the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western pacific may be the primary moisture source areas in autumn water vapor mainly originates from the bay of bengal entering the study area through the southeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau the magnitude of vertically integrated mean water vapor transport in the southwesterly vapor flux belt in autumn is smaller than that in winter and spring 3 methods 3 1 stable isotope and meteorological data precipitation samples were collected daily over a 2 5 year period from october 1 2017 to may 31 2020 in the middle of hemuqiao watershed about 220 m sea level height and transferred into 30 ml polyethylene vials samples were filtered with 0 22 μm filter paper into 2 ml vials before the stable isotopic compositions being analyzed δ18o and δ2h were measured with thermo fisher mat253 in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in hohai university within 3 months from collection repeated analysis of every rainwater sample for 6 times and the first three results were deleted to minimize the memory of machine the arithmetic mean of the last three results was used to represent the sample isotopic composition analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 1 and 2 respectively in addition to the isotopic data of daily precipitation daily meteorological data was obtained from meteorological station at the outlet of the watershed including temperature relative humidity the precipitation amount data was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm per tip which was located at the same location as precipitation samples collector the precipitation amount temperature specific humidity and relative humidity along the backward trajectories were calculated based on the global reanalysis dataset global data assimilation system gdas1 provided by air resources laboratory arl ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 with a resolution of 1 1 in addition daily outgoing longwave radiation olr from 2017 to 2020 at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa reanalysis data http www psl noaa gov data gridded data uninterp olr html is used to assess the convective intensity 3 2 classification of sacps classification of sacps has been developed since the 1960s in order to distinguish the synoptic patterns which occur most frequently han et al 2018 lykoudis et al 2010 kalkstein et al 1987 thus the atmospheric circulation can be better revealed within a relatively small number of representative patterns the classification methods of sacps can be classified into two categories manual and automated each having its own advantages and disadvantages philipp et al 2010 detail descriptions of the classification methods are summarized by philipp et al 2010 2014 in this study the kirchhofer method a correlation based automated method is adopted to classify sacps yarnal 1984 one advantage of this method is that the subdomains the meteorological variable in each row and column are also considered in the classification process for sacps han et al 2018 another advantage is that this method is more rapidly conducted than manual method and considerably reduces although not eliminates the level of subjectivity romolo et al 2006 in the lyr previous studies have applied this classification method to explore the relationship between air pollution and sacps han et al 2018 shu et al 2017 however whether this method can be used to explore the response of isotopic characteristics in precipitation to different sacps in monsoon regions has not been studied before in this study the daily geopotential height data of 850 hpa at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 from ncep reanalysis data https www psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep html is used to classify sacps that is because the precipitation in the east asian monsoon region is closely related to the 850 hpa geopotential height field lee et al 2013 cannon and mckendry 2002 the land sea thermal contrast is the basis for the monsoon circulation formation and the 850 hpa geopotential height is sensitive to the thermal difference between land and sea huang et al 2007 as a result 850 hpa geopotential height field effectively reflects the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns the classification method mainly includes three steps firstly the daily gridded of geopotential height dataset are normalized 1 z i x i x s where zi is the normalized geopotential height value of grid i xi is the original value for grid i x and s are the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the study domain respectively the main purpose of the data normalized is to eliminate the seasonal variability in the geopotential height and to improve the comparability of different seasons secondly kirchhofer scores are calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n z ai z bi 2 where s is kirchhofer score z ai is the normalized value for grid i on day a z bi is the normalized value for grid i on day b n is the numbers of the grid points the kirchhofer scores are calculated for each row sr each column sc and the entire domain st corresponding to number of row nr column nc and the product of the two nt in this study the thresholds for sr sc and st are set to 1 8nr 1 8nc and 0 8nt han et al 2018 yarnal 1984 respectively when the sr sc and st between days a and b are less than their thresholds the sacp between day a and day b is considered similar the day with the maximum similar days is recorded as keyday1 and the keyday1 is the representative day of pattern 1 then all grid geopotential height data of keyday1 and all days similar to keyday1 are removed from the analysis we repeat the calculation to obtain the subsequent keydays until the number of unclassified days are 10 of the total number of days finally all days of the study period are classified as one of the patterns if a day is connected to to more than one keyday and then the lowest kirchhofer score determines which pattern the day belongs to as the precipitation sampling point was located in the lyr atmospheric condition over the area of 110 128 e in longitude and 20 40 n in latitude was used for sacp classification in this study 3 3 hysplit model the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model version 4 was used to calculate the trajectory of water vapor and to identify the moisture source areas rolph et al 2017 stein et al 2015 the hysplit was acquired from the arl noaa https www ready noaa gov hysplit php and has been extensively applied in air parcel trajectories in atmospheric circulation field wang et al 2017 guan et al 2013 in this study a hysplit compatible meteorological data set of gdas1 at 1 1 resolution which was downloaded though the data portal provided in the hysplit interface ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 was used to drive the backward trajectory model in this study the windows based hysplit model was used to simulate the backward trajectories of moisture and to identify the moisture source areas of air masses for each sacp as the precipitation samples collected at 8 00 in each day the 240 hr backward trajectories originating from the sampling site backward trajectory for 8 00 of every rainy day at different height 500 m 1000 m 1500 m were generated 3 4 statistical analysis an analysis of covariance ancova was used to assess the difference of linear relationship between d excess and δ18o among sacps and the mann whitney u test was used to test if any significant differences exist in the isotopic compositions d excess and δ18o in precipitation between any two sacps linear regression was used to explore linear relationship between d excess and δ18o in each sacp and that between various meteorological variables and isotopic compositions in precipitation the correlation coefficient and significance test were analyzed by pearson s correlation test and two tailed t test respectively statistical analyses were conducted in ibm spss statistics 24 4 results 4 1 isotopic characteristics in precipitation under different atmospheric circulation patterns altogether 218 precipitation samples were collected at the hemuqiao watershed during the study period table a1 the precipitation isotopic composition δ18o at the sampling point exhibits notable seasonal variability with more enriched values in spring and winter and depleted values in summer and autumn fig 3 this result shows a consistent seasonal variation pattern of precipitation isotopic composition with other sampling stations in the lyr fig 3 sui et al 2019 ma et al 2018 dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a tang et al 2015 in addition to precipitation isotopic composition analysis sacp classification was performed for each day from october 1 2017 to may 31 2020 at the beginning six dominant sacps are identified fig a1 the study area is controlled by strong east asian summer monsoon in pattern s fig a1 because of the complexity of precipitation types in this period we reclassified this pattern into two patterns pattern s2 and pattern s3 using smaller thresholds thresholds for sr sc and st are 0 6nr 0 6nc and 0 35nt respectively finally seven dominant sacps are identified in this study and the number of classified days accounts for 95 1 of the total days during the study period table 1 we designate these sacps according to the large scale weather systems and the direction of the prevailing wind under each sacp han et al 2018 their names are as follows pattern w1 the east asian trough and the western pacific subtropical high eat wpsh pattern w2 the east asian trough and the mongolian high eat mh pattern w3 the south westerly low level jet llj pattern t1 the western pacific subtropical high with south westerly wind wpsh sw pattern s1 the east asian summer monsoon with south westerly wind easm sw pattern s2 the east asian summer monsoon with strong south westerly wind easm ssw pattern s3 the east asian summer monsoon with a low pressure system in the sea easm lp the mean geopotential height and wind field at 850 hpa during rainy days under different sacps are shown in fig 4 and the temporal distribution of rainy days under different sacps are shown in fig 5 overall the temporal distribution of these patterns forms a seasonal cycle with some overlaps the representative day number of days seasonal distribution number and frequency of rainy days and isotopic compositions in precipitation of each classified sacp are summarized in table 1 the 850 hpa zonal winds averaged over the central south china sea 5 15 n 110 120 e is widely accepted as an index to identify whether the east asian monsoon region is under the control of the east asian summer monsoon easm or the east asian winter monsoon eawm wang et al 2004 the atmospheric circulation classified as pattern t1 which is the transition period between the easm and the eawm mainly occurs in april may and october fig 5 the precipitation isotopic compositions of this pattern are enriched in heavy isotopes 2 40 for δ18o and 12 56 for δ2h with the lowest standard deviation 1 14 for δ18o and 7 04 for δ2h table 1 for pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 in the eawm the central south china sea is influenced strongly by prevailing easterlies fig 4 this is also supported by the temporal distribution of rainy days in fig 5 where the rainy days appear in the eawm period the frequency of rainy days under these three sacps is in the range of 17 76 to 22 60 table 1 the isotopic compositions in precipitation in these patterns ranges from 4 65 to 6 15 for δ18o with an average of 5 10 and from 26 47 to 36 02 for δ2h with an average of 28 53 table 1 for pattern s1 pattern s2 and pattern s3 the central south china sea is influenced strongly by prevailing westerlies fig 4 and these patterns are the dominant sacps in the easm period for pattern s1 the south westerly wind field at 850 hpa is weaker than that in pattern s2 indicating that the influence of the easm on the study area in this pattern is weaker than that in pattern s2 fig 4 and the average values of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation in this pattern are slightly more enriched in heavy isotopes than those in pattern s2 table 1 for pattern s2 the frequency of rainy days is the largest 35 44 precipitation occurring under pattern s3 tends to have a low d excess value the d excess and δ18o in precipitation in different sacps are summarized in fig 6 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows significant differences p 0 001 between some patterns for each pattern in the eawm period there is no significant linear correlation between d excess and δ18o pattern w1 r 0 185 p 0 160 pattern w2 r 0 420 p 0 074 and pattern w3 r 0 222 p 0 174 in the easm period the d excess has significant negative linear relationship with δ18o for pattern s1 r 0 437 p 0 029 pattern s2 r 0 547 p 0 003 for pattern s3 the correlation coefficient is not significant r 0 458 p 0 056 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 196 among these three patterns a more significant negative linear correlation is found between d excess and δ18o r 0 638 p 0 002 in the monsoon transition period pattern t1 4 2 relationship between d excess and relative humidity and precipitation relative humidity rh and precipitation size p are considered to be two main local meteorological factors influencing the d excess values in precipitation through influencing the subcloud evaporation effect guan et al 2013 peng et al 2007 the correlations between d excess in precipitation and local relative humidity and precipitatiaon size in pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 are presented in fig 7 for pattern t1 strong positive correlations are found between d excess in precipitation and relative humidity and precipitation amount fig 7 a and b the correlation coefficients are 0 531 for d excess and relative humidity and 0 585 for d excess and precipitation amount respectively within a 0 05 significance level a multiple linear relationship is established between d excess and relative humidity and precipitation 3 d e x c e s s 0 176 p mm 0 428 r h 33 163 p v a l u e s f o r p a n d r h a r e 0 01 and 0 02 r e s p e c t i v e l y r 2 0 51 thus relative humidity and precipitation combined explains 51 of the d excess variation in pattern t1 for pattern s2 there is significant linear correlation between d excess and relative humidity r 0 445 p 0 018 however no significant correlation is observed between d excess and local meteorological variables for pattern s1 4 3 relationship between d excess and atmospheric variables along the backward trajectories the d excess values in precipitation are sensitive to the meteorological conditions in moisture source areas and can change along the backward trajectories through kinetic fractionation steen larsen et al 2015 guan et al 2013 consequently it is reasonable to study the response of variation of d excess in precipitation to meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories the correlation coefficients r and p values between d excess and cumulative precipitation mean specific humidity mean temperature and mean relative humidity at 1000 m above ground within t days preceding rainfall event in pattern s2 are summarized in fig 8 generally there are relatively strong negative correlations between the d excess in precipitation for pattern s2 and mean specific humidity and mean temperature along the backward trajectories at starting height of 1000 m fig 8 rainy days under pattern s2 are divided into two precipitation types i e meiyu and other precipitation based on the knowledge of relevant precipitation weather systems meiyu is a unique phenomenon of the east asian monsoon region it occurs during june to mid july chen 2004 the type of meiyu is determined according to official designation of the meiyu period 6 20 2018 7 9 2018 6 17 2019 7 17 2019 www cma gov cn overall twenty of the 28 rainy days under pattern s2 resulted from meiyu and the remaining eight rainy days resulted from other precipitation a composite analysis of olr was also conducted for each precipitation types fig 9 because olr data is widely accepted as an indicator for estimating deep convective processes during a precipitation event tang et al 2015 wang and xu 1997 in general areas with low olr values are more likely to result from strong convection and olr is negatively correlated with convective intensity and precipitation tang et al 2015 the average olr value in the study area during the meiyu period is lower than that of other precipitation indicating that the convective activity is stronger in the meiyu period of pattern s2 the precipitation isotopic composition analysis was also performed for the meiyu and other precipitation under pattern s2 the δ18o and d excess values of these two precipitation types in pattern s2 are plotted on a δ18o d excess diagram fig a2 and an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 732 between meiyu and other precipitation under pattern s2 however the influence of meteorological conditions along the backward trajectories on the d excess values exhibits significant differences the correlation coefficients r and p values between d excess in precipitation in different precipitation types and cumulative precipitation mean specific humidity mean temperature and mean relative humidity are calculated fig 8 b for meiyu table a2 for other precipitation strong negative correlations between d excess in meiyu under pattern s2 and mean temperature and mean specific humidity along the trajectories from 2 to 10 days anchored 1000 m above ground at the study site prior to the meiyu are found the r varies from 0 54 to 0 70 and 0 52 to 0 63 for mean specific humidity and mean temperature respectively within a 0 05 confidence limit fig 8 b furthermore the linear correlation between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity along the backward trajectories peaks around 4 days prior to a meiyu rainfall event fig 8 b fig 10 no significant correlations are observed between d excess and cumulative precipitation and relative humidity from 1 day prior to arrival to 10 days prior to arrival p 0 05 of meiyu events in addition backward trajectories analysis exhibits the moisture sources is a mixture of inland and oceanic sources fig 11 as for other precipitation no significant correlations are found between d excess and specific humidity and temperature along the backward trajectories table a2 for pattern s3 a more significantly negative correlation exists between d excess in precipitation and mean relative humidity along the trajectories from 5 to 10 days prior to precipitation and no significant correlations are observed between d excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity and mean temperature along the trajectories fig a3 rain events under pattern s3 are further divided into two precipitation types i e typhoon and other precipitation the type of typhoon is determined according to the official announcements www cma gov cn overall seven of the 18 events under pattern s3 resulted from typhoon and the remaining eleven events resulted from non typhoon type weather an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between d excess and δ18o shows insignificant differences p 0 487 between typhoon and other precipitation under pattern s3 fig a2 though the convective activity in the lyr between these precipitation types is quite different fig a4 there are no significant correlations between d excess and atmospheric variables along the backward trajectories in typhoon under pattern s3 and the d excess in other precipitation has significant negative correlation with mean relative humidity along the backward trajectories anchored 1000 m above ground at the study site from 5 to 9 days prior to the precipitation fig a3 5 discussion 5 1 sacp classification for precipitation isotopic analysis for most patterns they are distinguishable for either δ18o or d excess except for pattern w1 and pattern w2 and for pattern s2 and pattern s3 table 2 the precipitation occurring in the easm period in pattern s1 pattern s2 and pattern s3 has more depleted δ18o values and lower d excess values than those in the eawm period in pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 table 1 this result is similar to previous investigations at changsha wu et al 2015 and nanjing tang et al 2015 as for the easm period pattern s1 is characterized by a high pressure system extending westward from the western pacific subtropical high fig 4 the δ18o in precipitation resulting from pattern s1 is distinguishable from other patterns table 2 the enrichment in heavy isotopes of δ18o 5 75 in precipitation in this pattern is very likely associate with its moisture sources the moisture sources are mixed from high latitude inland and the south china sea fig 12 and the precipitation producing air masses from inland may contribute to the enriched δ18o with high d excess values in precipitation in the lyr sui et al 2019 tang et al 2017 tang et al 2015 while under other patterns in the easm the precipitation producing air masses mainly come from the ocean i e the south china sea for pattern s2 and the western pacific for pattern s3 fig 12 though the atmospheric circulation patterns of these two patterns pattern s2 and pattern s3 are different neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable in the monsoon transition period pattern t1 both δ18o and d excess in precipitation exhibit significant differences from those in other patterns table 2 more discussion on this result is included in section 5 2 in the eawm for pattern w1 and pattern w2 the study area is under the control of the different intensity of the western pacific subtropical high and the mongolian high at the 850 hpa level fig 4 but δ18o and d excess in precipitation of these patterns do not exhibit significant differences table 2 the similar local meteorological conditions are likely the main factors resulting in similar isotopic compositions in precipitation in these patterns for example the mean temperature during rainy days in pattern w1 is 7 2 and for pattern w2 is 5 5 fig a5 the mean precipitation during rainy days in pattern w1 is 9 9 mm and for pattern w2 is 10 5 mm fig a5 in addition the moisture sources and magnitude of total water vapor flux for pattern w1 and pattern w2 are similar water vapor over the lyr mainly comes from low latitude land and less affected by ocean moisture fig 12 for pattern w3 the study area is less influenced by the mongolian high and the east asian trough fig 4 and d excess in precipitation resulting from pattern w3 is distinguishable from other patterns in the eawm table 2 though the moisture sources and magnitude of total water vapor flux for pattern w3 are similar to pattern w1 and pattern w2 fig 12 the local meteorological variables are quite different the mean relative humidity during rainy days in pattern w3 is 83 4 in comparison to 86 8 for pattern w1 and 87 5 for pattern w2 this is associated with the higher mean temperature 11 9 in comparison to 7 2 for pattern w1 and 5 5 for pattern w2 during the eawm fig a5 a lower mean relative humidity associated with higher mean temperature tends to increase subcloud evaporation and moisture exchange with ambient moisture in the subcloud layer under pattern w3 this is supported by a negative relationship between temperature and d excess in pattern w3 table 4 in general the categorization of rainy days used kirchhofer method has the advantage for assessing the atmospheric circulation s effect on the isotopic compositions in precipitation than monthly or seasonal grouping of rainy days although either δ18o or d excess in precipitation in different seasons is distinguishable from each other table a3 the classification of rainy days according to season is not sufficient to capture the information contained in isotopic compositions of precipitation as for δ18o there is significantly negative relationship between δ18o and precipitation for pattern w1 and pattern w2 in the eawm from november to april but this relationship is not significant for winter and autumn when seasonal grouping applies table 3 fig a6 fig a9 as for d excess a positive relationship exists between d excess and precipitation size for pattern t1 which occurs in spring and autumn but this relationship is not significant in seasonal grouping table 4 fig a11 fig a13 when we group the rainy days into individual months both δ18o and d excess in precipitation in january and february march and april april and may june and september june and october june and november august and october september and october september and november october and november october and december november and december do not exhibit significant differences table a4 table a5 as for δ18o there is significantly negative relationship between δ18o and precipitation under pattern s1 which occurs in may june july september and october but this relationship is not significant in these months except for june table 3 fig a7 fig a8 fig a9 as for d excess there is significantly negative relationship between d excess and temperature under pattern w3 which occurs in the eawm period but this relationship is not significant from november to april table 4 fig a10 fig a11 fig a13 this is the first attempt to investigate the association of precipitation isotopic compositions with the different sacps classified by the kirchhofer method in the east asian monsoon region some limitations are noted from this study for example different thresholds for sr sc and st could affect the results of the precipitation weather classification a previous study also reported that different thresholds could result in different keydays chosen for each pattern it was found that the total number of patterns increases with a decrease in threshold values huth 1996 in this study the thresholds were adopted according to previous studies barry et al 1981 yarnal 1984 in which the thresholds were applied to investigate the relationship between sacps and air pollution in the lyr han et al 2018 when we used smaller thresholds thresholds for sr sc and st are 0 6nr 0 6nc and 0 35nt respectively to reclassify the pattern which controlled by strong east asian summer monsoon most of meiyu events 20 of the 23 rainy days are categorized into pattern s2 and most of typhoon precipitation days 7 of the 8 rainy days are categorized into pattern s3 however we could not distinguish meiyu and other precipitation 8 events under pattern s2 and typhoon and other precipitation under pattern s3 by adjusting the thresholds this situation suggests the method based on 850 hpa geopotential height field is not sufficient to classify all patterns including other meteorological variables may help to further separate sacps under pattern s2 and pattern s3 for example in this study we demonstrate that mean olr is useful to tell meiyu from other precipitation under pattern s2 5 2 subcloud evaporation during the monsoon transition period pattern t1 subcloud evaporation is expected to cause an increase of δ18o and a decrease of d excess in precipitation wu et al 2015 guan et al 2013 apparent negative correlations between d excess and δ18o in precipitation for pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 suggest that subcloud evaporation may play a role in determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation fig 6 another indicator of subcloud evaporation is the relationship between d excess and relative humidity and between d excess and precipitation size this is also used to further test the effect of subcloud evaporation in pattern t1 pattern s1 and pattern s2 table 5 fig 7 similar to the methodology of peng et al 2007 when the subcloud evaporation is important in isotopic compositions in precipitation the d excess in precipitation increases with precipitation size and local relative humidity guan et al 2013 according to the latter method the subcloud evaporation is considered minor for pattern s1 and pattern s2 and significant for pattern t1 for pattern s1 the small precipitation associated with lower relative humidity may strengthen the subcloud evaporation which would result in a low d excess in precipitation but in this pattern the maximum d excess 15 69 in precipitation occurs in a small daily rainfall size 0 p 10 mm with a relatively low relative humidity 77 8 fig 7 table 5 which is not consistent with the subcloud evaporation effect on the variation of d excess in precipitation for pattern s2 a smaller daily rainfall size 0 p 10 mm tends to have a higher d excess 4 08 than that in larger daily rainfall size 10 p 20 mm table 5 this suggests that the isotopic compositions in precipitation in this pattern are less likely influenced by subcloud evaporation the isotopic compositions in precipitation under pattern s3 are also less likely influenced by subcloud evaporation effect because mean precipitation is 27 8 mm fig a5 and no significant linear correlation exists between d excess and precipitation table 4 for pattern w1 pattern w2 and pattern w3 small subcloud evaporation may occur due to a relatively small size of precipitation under low temperature fig a5 which is consistent with previous studies in arid semi arid and monsoon regions chen et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 peng et al 2010 during the monsoon transition period pattern t1 a small daily rainfall size p 20 mm tends to have a low d excess 4 38 4 52 and high δ18o 1 99 2 41 and a large daily rainfall size p 20 mm tends to have a high d excess 13 61 and low δ18o 3 57 table 5 the d excess values in precipitation gradually decrease with a decrease in precipitation size and relative humidity equation 3 these two pieces of evidence suggest that the subcloud evaporation effect is important in precipitation processes under this pattern when the precipitation amount over 40 mm the d excess in precipitation tends to be stable approximately equivalent to 15 to 20 fig 7 b 5 3 upstream specific humidity controls the d excess in meiyu in this study area d excess in meiyu included in pattern s2 has significant negative correlation with mean specific humidity preceding the precipitation along the backward trajectories anchored at 1000 m above ground at the precipitation site fig 8 and the correlation coefficients are larger than those between d excess in precipitation and local meteorological variables temperature precipitation and relative humidity fig a14 the value of the lag correlation coefficient between d excess and mean specific humidity peaks r 0 70 p 0 001 at 4 days preceding meiyu event fig 8 implying that mositure transport process during 4 days preceding each rainy day plays a role in determining the variation of d excess in local precipitation previous studies also suggested that the mositure transport process could result in variation of d excess in downstream precipitation table 6 in this study the upstream factor and potential mechanisms accounting for the upstream factor determining the variation of d excess in downstream precipitation appear to be different from previous studies in this study a higher d excess in precipitation resulting from a lower mean 4 days specific humidity preceding the precipitation may be caused by moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway backward trajectories analyses show that precipitation producing air masses for meiyu events in the study area mainly come from the south china sea fig 11 tang et al 2015 ding 2007 we present a schematic representation of the influence of moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation on the d excess in cloud water vapor during the meiyu moisture transport process fig 13 for an initial cloud vapor with a d excess of 5 0 typical for the meiyu moisture source area pfahl and sodemann 2014 and a specific humidity of 18 0 g kg based on the ncep reanalysis data condensation of 20 of cloud vapor at an average temperature of 12 at the cloud layer 2000 m above ground can result in a d excess value of 5 7 in raindrop at cloud base 1000 m above ground according to steward model fig 13 guan et al 2013 stewart 1975 subsequently subcloud evaporation and moisture exchange with ambient moisture alter the d excess in falling raindrops evaporation of 5 at a rh of 95 in the subcloud layer may decrease d excess values from 5 7 in the raindrop at cloud base to 0 5 in surface precipitation based on the steward model fig 13 stewart 1975 this is consistent with isotopic observations at guangzhou xie et al 2011 and changsha wu et al 2015 d excess in precipitation appear with abnormally low values approximately equivalent to 0 in these stations during the meiyu period if all the evaporated moisture recycles back into the cloud layer the d excess value of cloud vapor may increase from an initial 5 0 to approximately 6 0 and the specific humidity may decrease from initial 18 g kg to approximately 14 6 g kg according to the conservation of mass fig 13 if the fraction of evaporated moisture recycles back into the cloud layer is 30 the d excess value of cloud vapor may increase to approximately 5 2 as water vapor moves inland and continuous moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation gradually increase d excess in the remaining cloud vapor this effect increases when the moisture recycling is enhanced by lower specific humidity along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway this conceptualization suggests that in addition to the influences of the meteorological variables in the moisture source areas relative humidity temperature and wind and at the local area relative humidity temperature and precipitation size the d excess values in local precipitation can be influenced by the moisture recycling processes along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway more specifically our analysis has demonstrated that moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation that takes place along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway can explain the variation of d excess in the lyr during the meiyu period thus this result contributes new insights to understanding the relationship between large scale atmospheric process and d excess in local precipitation 6 conclusions in this article we applied the kirchhofer weather systems classification method to explore the characteristics of isotopic compositions in precipitation in the lyr for different sacps seven dominant sacps are classified with three one and three sacps in the east asian winter monsoon period the monsoon transition period and the east asian summer monsoon period respectively for most sacps rainfall isotopic composition is distinguishable in either δ18o or d excess except for the eat wpsh pattern w1 and the eat mh pattern w2 and for the easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 for the eat wpsh pattern w1 the eat mh pattern w2 and the llj pattern w3 the local meteorological variables seem to play an important role in determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation for the easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 though the precipitation producing air masses come from different seas i e the south china sea for pattern s2 and the western pacific for pattern s3 neither δ18o nor d excess is distinguishable nevertheless the relationships between isotopic compositions and meteorological variables appear to be distinguishable between them the subcloud evaporation is minor in the eat wpsh pattern w1 the eat mh pattern w2 the llj pattern w3 the easm sw pattern s1 easm ssw pattern s2 and the easm lp pattern s3 in the wpsh sw pattern t1 the monsoon transition period the d excess in precipitation is more likely altered by subcloud evaporation and the estimation of the moisture source based on d excess information should be treated with cautions under this sacp for the easm ssw pattern s2 precipitation samples have small or negligible subcloud evaporation and d excess values in the meiyu classified in this pattern are closely related to the mean 4 days specific humidity along the backward trajectories this is likely caused by moisture recycling from subcloud evaporation along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway credit authorship contribution statement jianfeng gou conceptualization methodology

3721,in this study the spatial temporal variability of hydrological drought in meriç basin turkey has been examined and its relationship with global climate oscillations has been explored prior to drought analysis streamflow data gaps were filled and series homogeneity was examined the standardized streamflow index ssfi was used to detect drought periods from monthly streamflow data of nine stations well spread over the study area the hydrological drought intensity magnitude and duration were investigated using the ssfi time series the drought variability was assessed by performing trend analysis and wavelet transforms trend analysis showed an increase in drought events in the northern region and a decrease in the southern region of the basin wavelet analysis reveals that the 4 10 year scales explicate the drought series pattern the identification of climate patterns that are most associated with drought variability is performed via correlation analysis the investigation showed that distinct climate patterns simultaneously influence drought events significantly the influence of el nino southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is notable the analysis demonstrated a remarkable correlation between enso and ssfi series at the interannual scale 2 8 years the obtained phase difference suggests that the maximum dry wet conditions coincide with la nina el nino events in addition positive nao phases and negative amo phases lead to drought occurrence keywords drought variability wavelet analysis standardized streamflow index teleconnections 1 introduction elements of the water cycle such as streamflow precipitation and soil moisture exhibit high spatial and temporal variability at infrequent intervals hydrological variables display extreme behaviors wielding substantial impacts on ecosystems and may endanger human life for instance the change observed in the climate system led to the intensification of extreme hydrological events huntington 2006 bosilovich et al 2004 ipcc 2007 thus the intensified hydrological cycle has a notable global impact and a more significant impact on societies living within river watersheds huntington 2006 the occurrence of extreme events has undesirable drawbacks on human activities such as agriculture and industrial production in this context the sustainable development goals sdgs were introduced by the united nations un to ensure the lastingness of humankind s well being https sdgs un org fr goals to meet particular goals such as zero hunger good health and well being responsible consumption and production and climate action the knowledge of global and regional climate variability is vital accordingly the scientific community has been concerned about the climate system components interactions and variability at the regional and global scales on a global scale climate patterns have an orchestrated temporal and spatial variability regulated by the recurring and persistent ocean atmospheric patterns defined as teleconnections naizghi and ouarda 2017 several studies have shown that global teleconnections have a significant influence on humans as they are associated with cold and heat waves keellings and waylen 2015 floods kundzewicz et al 2019 droughts hassan and nayak 2020 cyclones xie et al 2020 agriculture ustaoglu and karaca 2014 and wildfire mariani et al 2018 consequently the strength of teleconnections influences human health food and water security and energy demands some earlier studies have demonstrated that hydroclimatological variables such as streamflow precipitation and other water balance variables are important indicators of the interaction between the hydrological components and the global climate oscillations at the regional scale according to cullen et al 2002 the north atlantic oscillation affects streamflow variability in the middle east researchers used the nao index to examine streamflow variability in middle eastern rivers from december through march it was found that the first principal component of streamflow variability reflected nao variations cullen et al 2002 demonstrated a correlation between changes in middle eastern water supply and natural variations in the climate system and variations in ssts in the eastern mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean in another study kalayci and kahya 2006 streamflow variability in turkey was examined over the period 1964 1994 using principal component analysis the study identified systematic patterns of streamflow variation over time and space the principal component scores were correlated with the large scale atmospheric circulation the obtained results indicate that the turkish streamflow climatology is sensitive to north atlantic and southern oscillations variations marti et al 2010 examined the effects of el niño and southern oscillation on streamflow characteristics in turkey the study explored how enso influenced the streamflow time series statistics analyses were conducted on hypothetical series derived from the original series under the assumption that el niño events had not occurred in the past the original and hypothetical series were compared in four different scenarios the existence of significant differences indicates that enso events significantly impact the major statistical characteristics of the studied streamflow series according to the study s findings streamflow characteristics in the west anatolian region were more influenced by enso variability in a more recent study conducted by vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 the characteristics of hydrological and agricultural droughts across the closed basin of konya kcb in turkey were examined using the standardized soil moisture index ssi trends over the kcb were detected using the modified mann kendall mmk trend method xwt was used to examine the teleconnections between large scale climate indices over a 3 month ssfi and ssi series results indicate an increase in drought duration and severity since 1999 xwt results indicate a significant relationship between large scale climate indices and ssfi ssi series for periods less than eight months this study focuses on the influences of the global teleconnection on water availability in meriç basin turkey such inquiry can be performed by studying the variability of hydro climatological data such as precipitation and streamflow and its teleconnections with climate indices canchala et al 2020a 2020b the hydro climatological data variability assessment plays an essential role in defining forecast models and predicting extreme events in addition analyzing the hydro climatological variables evolution is critical in designing hydraulic structures and managing water resources however their results may not be notable for policy and decision makers for instance linking streamflow variability to physical events such as drought and wet periods is more significant for policy makers when planning or making decisions a study by gu et al 2020a examined the relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts through the lens of hazard assessment in an effort to provide drought monitoring and management tools a general framework was proposed to characterize drought hazard propagation processes for decision makers this approach can be a valuable tool for anticipating hydrological droughts and selecting management strategies for water resources furthermore drought and wetness are concrete concepts that all segments of society can understand thus studying drought variability and sharing the results can develop an affinity for water scarcity among society s different segments with the evolution of human life demands socio economic activities witnessed significant growth along with this global growth the water demands have also increased for energy generation urban water supply industrial and agriculture activities on the other side river basins sustainability requires sufficient natural flow to preserve flora and fauna in the river environment this concern is growing increasingly as a result of global warming and the reality that more regions of the world will experience intense drought in a climate warming scenario gu et al 2020b gu et al 2020c drought is a natural hazard associated with large scale atmospheric or ocean patterns van loon 2015 in this study we focused on the assessment of hydrological drought variability and its relationship with large scale climate indices aiming to introduce an efficient approach that can be employed by researchers and water managers for drought monitoring however water managers may be unsure of putting in new methods and approaches the switch or inclusion of non conventional procedures could put managers in a demanding position in front of project stockholders as a result global teleconnections are not widely used in water resources management protocols this study aims to provide a general framework applicable to any river basin to facilitate the water managers tasks the proposed approach uses the standardized streamflow index to identify the temporal evolution of hydrological drought and extreme events magnitude in the area of interest following the analysis of drought series temporal variability by detecting trends via the mann kendall mk test and retrieving dominant periodic components via continuous wavelet analysis cwt further exploring the relationship between global teleconnections and drought series via conventional statistical methods and wavelet analysis more precisely the cross wavelet analysis xwt 2 data and study area meriç basin is located in the southeastern part of the european continent the basin is bordered by the black sea marmara sea and the aegean sea from the north southeast and southwest respectively the basin is within the borders of three different countries bulgaria greece and turkey and represents an important water source in the south balkan peninsula thus the rivers and their tributaries play an essential role in all three countries agricultural and industrial activities the basin has three main sub river basins the meriç river basin the ergene river basin and the tunca river basin while the longest river is the meriç river 550 km and has a drainage area of 52600 km2 erkal and topgül 2020 it is essential to mention that we are interested in the basin part enclosed by turkish territory within the scope of this study fig 1 the catchment area covers different topographical regions where mountains are found in northern regions and large lowlands can be found in the basin s central southern and eastern parts rivers of the study area are fed by rain and snowmelt and flow throughout the year however flow rate shifts may be observed under the influence of precipitation and temperature in southern regions the mediterranean climate is prevailing and maximum precipitations occur during winter on the other hand the continental climate has a major influence on the central and northern part of the basin and heavy rainfall comes in may june artinyan et al 2008 the daily time series of streamflow are recorded at multiple gauging stations situated in the catchment area and operated by the turkish state hydraulic works in this study the daily streamflow observations were used to compute the average monthly streamflow values and proceed with drought analysis the study area comprises 32 gauging stations with record periods spanning between the years 1958 and 2015 however to ensure the credibility of the analysis and minimize errors generated from inaccurate or corrupted data the data set was narrowed down to 9 stations table 1 the selection of gauging stations is based on several criteria first stations with daily records of less than 30 years are discarded also stations that drain catchments with considerable human intervention are eliminated finally the data set is restricted to monthly time series with less than 10 gaps and consecutive missing less than 24 months many studies in literature adopted a similar approach for streamflow time series analysis hamilton and moore 2012 giuntoli et al 2013 yerdelen and abdelkader 2021 to examine the drought relationship with the global climate oscillations large scale climate indices are used climate indices display the quantitative description of ocean dynamics or atmospheric circulations at distinct time scales generally climate indices are calculated from anomalies in air pressure sea surface temperature or solar radiation prior to data analysis previous related studies in eastern europe the mediterranean basin and turkey were examined to find out climate oscillations that may influence the local climate patterns in the study region cenk and turgay 2020 cullen et al 2002 giuntoli et al 2013 kalayci and kahya 2006 marti et al 2010 ouachani et al 2011 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 kahya 2011 for the current work enso nao amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are used to determine their influence on drought variability and assess their utility as possible drought predictors it is essential to mention that the pre analysis of this study included the investigation of the correlations between mediterranean oscillation 1 2 and drought series and no significant relations were spotted the selected climate indices reflect the concurrent variation in climate anomalies across broad geographical areas for instance enso corresponds to the interaction between ocean currents and atmospheric circulation enso indicates two phenomena the strong anomalous warming of the eastern equatorial pacific ocean s surface waters known as el niño and the alternation in the tropical pacific surface barometric pressure known as the southern oscillation enso variability is described by a quasi periodic component alternating between two and seven years ouachani et al 2011 ipcc 2007 the oscillation has two main phases a warm phase el niño and a cold phase la niña the identification of enso phases and related magnitude can be accomplished via the south oscillation index soi a standardized sea level pressure slp based index or nino 4 nino 3 nino 3 4 and nino 1 2 metrics measuring the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in defined regions between the eastern and western pacific ipcc 2007 the analysis also included a recurring pattern of ocean atmosphere climate variability over the mid latitude pacific basin known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is quantified by the standardized difference between ssts in the north central pacific and gulf of alaska mantua et al 1997 although pdo has a similar spatial climate fingerprint as el nino their temporal variability exhibits different patterns pdo has two main phases a warm phase during which the west pacific cools and part of the eastern ocean warms and a cool phase with reverse patterns the north atlantic oscillation is defined as one of the major modes of spl variation in the northern hemisphere the nao is determined by computing the difference in spl between the azores located in the tropical atlantic and iceland located in the subpolar low pressure system where an atmospheric pressure oscillation occurs rogers 1984 the nao has a remarkable impact on the northward climate and is responsible for changes in air and ocean temperature precipitation and winds ottersen et al 2001 two phases are distinguished in the nao a positive phase and a negative phase the positive phase is characterized by a high pressure anomaly across the subtropical atlantic and a low pressure anomaly over iceland and the arctic leading to strong westerlies in the mid latitudes rogers 1984 the northwestern atlantic and mediterranean regions experience clod and dry conditions during the positive phase whereas northern europe northeastern america and scandinavian regions experience warm and wet conditions on the other hand the negative nao phase is characterized by a low pressure anomaly across the subtropical atlantic and a high pressure anomaly over iceland leading to a weakening of the westerlies north atlantic and in western europe and reducing the meridional pressure gradient during the negative phase southern regions of europe have wetter conditions than usual and the northern region of europe experiences cold and dry conditions the amo index is quantified as the variation of sst in the northern parts of the atlantic ocean amo has a periodic component ranging between 60 and 80 years and each cycle alternates between a warm phase and a cool phase schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 knight et al 2006 the amo phases can last up to 20 40 years the amo is considered in this study due to its significant impacts over vast areas of the northern hemisphere for instance several studies linked air temperature and precipitation patterns to amo variability over vast regions of the northern hemisphere knight et al 2006 martin and thorncroft 2014 jones and carvalho 2018 also the amo warm phases impact the frequency and severity of drought periods at a regional scale mccabe et al 2004 lu and delworth 2005 global climate indices time series covered in this study are presented in table 2 3 methodology drought variability in the meriç basin is of vital importance for the inhabitant of the region since their main economic activities depend on agriculture and industry the approach followed in this study aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological drought in the basin further the relationship between climate indices and hydrological drought is investigated the procedure adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 estimation of missing data the quality and availability of the climatic and hydrological data are vital for assessing water resources nevertheless in situ measurements frequently exhibit missing data resulting from instruments failures recording errors and other site related issues estimating missing data can be performed via different approaches such as regression autoregressive models interpolation and machine learning based methods in this study the estimation of missing streamflow data was conducted by the non linear principal component analysis nlpca method scholz et al 2005 scholz et al 2008 recent studies used this method to estimate missing rainfall data miró et al 2017 canchala nastar et al 2019 canchala et al 2020a and missing streamflow data canchala et al 2020b the nlpca is a non linear conception of the principal component analysis pca integrating artificial neural networks ann related studies showed the efficiency of nlpca in estimating non linear and nonstationary streamflow data canchala et al 2020b scholz et al 2008 provide a detailed description of the nlpca approach the application of the method can be performed via the nlpca toolbox http www nlpca org matlab html regarding the application of nlpca different architectures were tested to decrease the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae expressed respectively as 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y m y o 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n y m y o where n is the number of observations ym represents the predicted data from the nlpca model yo is the observed flow the use of the rmse evaluation indicator effectively assesses the method s ability to track high flow values whereas the mae is an unbiased index to evaluate the relative forecasting ability of the nlpca 3 2 data homogeneity data homogeneity needs to be taken into account while analyzing hydrological time series in this study homogeneity analysis in the streamflow series is used to detect the accuracy and validity of the data for the present study the gauging stations location and the method of streamflow measurement did not change since its establishment also the gauging stations surrounding environment and physical factors have not altered over the years thus changes in the time series would reflect a change in the local climatic conditions rather than a change in the measurement s conditions data and the data set will be considered homogeneous wmo 2007 this study applied three absolute homogeneity tests to determine the streamflow time series homogeneity status pettitt s test buishand range test and standard normal homogeneity test snht the calculation procedure of pettitt s test buishand range test and snht can be found in detail in pettitt 1979 buishand 1982 and toreti et al 2011 respectively 3 3 standardized streamflow index ssfi four drought categories are distinguished meteorological drought agriculture drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought within the scope of this study hydrological drought is under investigation the hydrological drought is related to the negative anomalies in groundwater mishra and singh 2010 and streamflow smakhtin 2001 however hydrological drought can be quantified via indices based on precipitation streamflow low flows runoff groundwater levels and water balance this study uses the standardized streamflow index a streamflow based index to quantify the hydrological drought the ssfi is one of several drought indices and is widely used worldwide as introduced by modarres 2007 and suggested by the world meteorological organization and global water partnership wmo and gwp 2016 it is straightforward to use as it is calculated using monthly streamflow data it is simply the transformation of streamflow into a standard normal variable from the gamma distribution defined by 3 ssfi f i f σ fi is the monthly flow rate f and σ represent the mean and standard deviation of streamflow obtained from the whole monthly time series in the present study running series of total streamflow with 12 months are considered thus the drought propagation over a 12 month scale is illustrated and the interannual variation of the wet and dry seasons is detected van oel et al 2017 classification based on ssfi values is presented in table 3 3 4 variability analysis 3 4 1 trend analysis variability analysis is often performed by studying trends in hydro climatic series kahya and kalaycı 2004 the study of drought trends can be performed by analyzing a drought index s time series mahajan and dodamani 2015 in this study the temporal variability of hydrological drought is retrieved from the ssfi 12 series trend analysis trend detection is computed using the mk test mann kendall test is commonly used to detect monotonic trends in hydrological time series the mann kendall test statistic is calculated according to 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 5 sgn x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 the mean of s is e s 0 and the variance σ2 is 6 σ s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where p represents the number of the tied groups in the time series and tj is the number of data points in the jth tied group the statistic s is used to calculate the zmk transformation defined by 7 z mk s 1 σ s i f s 0 s 1 σ s i f s 0 if α is the test significance level and z is the standard normal variate then the null hypothesis no trend is valid for z z 1 0 5α otherwise the presence of a monotonic trend is accepted in this study the considered significance level is 95 and the alternative hypothesis is accepted for the following cases z mk 1 96 f o r u p w a r d t r e n d 1 96 f o r d o w n w a r d t r e n d 3 4 2 periodicity analysis wavelet transforms have been used to analyze hydrological and meteorological variables to determine trends and periodicity yerdelen et al 2021 naizghi and ouarda 2017 investigated long term changes in wind speed in the united arab emirates uae the wind speed dominant periodicity was confirmed through wavelet analysis and fourier transform ft it should be noted that although ft results are similar to those of the cwt they are restricted to the localization of frequency only cwt in contrast allows localization both in frequency and time chong et al 2019 conducted a study concerning the comparison between wavelet and fourier transforms using ft and cwt to examine streamflow frequency and showed the limitations of ft in an advanced series analysis it is critical to identify events of interest within a given timeframe however this cannot be retrieved from ft analysis due to the indicated drawback therefore we used the wavelet transform over ft in nonstationary time series analysis wavelet transform is a promising approach employed to analyze several hydrological and meteorological events and detect nonstationary trends and periodicity joshi et al 2016 yerdelen et al 2021 in this study drought periodicity analysis is performed using the cwt this method is a powerful tool that can provide a simultaneous display of time and frequency the cwt decomposes a time series into low periodicity events high frequency and high periodicity events low frequency thus the decomposition of series in time frequency space reveals the dominant modes of drought variability over time the cwt of a discrete sequence xn is defined as the convolution of the sequence with a scaled and translated wavelet ψ ξ ξ is a non dimensional time parameter that defines the transformed wavelet 8 w n x s n n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s the localized time index is n the wavelet scale is represented by s δt defines the sampling period n represents the time series length and asterisk designates the complex conjugate in this study ssfi 12 series are decomposed via cwt using the morlet wavelet function the morlet function is commonly used for representing hydrological signals first the morlet function shape is similar to the hydrological series more importantly the function imparts a good localization along with time and frequency for the treated signal labat 2005 the cwt results are interpreted graphically through the wavelet power spectrum wps the wps illustrates the time series variance at different periods and indicates significant historical patterns torrence and compo 1998 in this study the wps is computed for a significance level at the 5 level torrence and compo 1998 provide a detailed description of the wps significant level computation and related procedures the wps is used as a graphical tool to determine the significant ssfi 12 dominant periodic patterns moreover the time averaged periodic components are obtained from the global wavelet spectrum gws the gws is obtained by computing the average of the wavelet coefficients over time the gws provides an unbiased and compatible approximation of the power spectrum for the entire signal length thus the gws provides practical results by estimating the global signal peaks significant periodic component from local wavelet spectra torrence and compo 1998 3 5 ssfi teleconnections with climate indices the occurrence of hydrological drought is a complex process depending on both the atmospheric and hydrological processes however this study focuses on the effect of the atmospheric processes since it is considered the starting point of hydrological drought sheffield and wood 2011 van loon 2015 thus the large scale climate indices are used as an indicator of the global atmospheric mechanisms variability the influence of the global climate indices over drought series can be investigated via conventional statistical tests or wavelet analysis in this study statistical correlation tests and wavelet analysis are applied to assess the relation between climate patterns and drought variability 3 5 1 conventional correlation analysis correlation analyses quantify the relationship between two variables the strength of the relationship is described via the correlation coefficients sign and value for instance a positive correlation indicates an increasing rank of both variables a negative correlation indicates that the increasing rank of a variable corresponds to the decreasing rank of the other variable a linear parametric test pearson correlation is employed to describe the correlation between the considered climatic and drought series in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r is determined as the covariance of two variables and y with equal series length n divided by the product of their standard deviations 9 r n xy x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 the test statistic tr is calculated as follows 10 t r r n 2 1 r 2 the analysis was computed for a significance level α at 5 thus absolute values of tr within the bounds of confidence interval t 1 α 2 reject the null hypothesis the test is applied to determine the strength of association based on the patter of concordance and discordance between the ssfi 12 series and the considered climate index 3 5 2 correlation via wavelet analysis testing the linkages among time series can be performed via cross wavelet analysis the method determines the at peak coherence and the lagging between two time series the correlation results are defined at the time and the frequency extent the xwt results are restricted to identifying periodic structures characterized by common high power events present in both signals during a specific time interval grinsted et al 2004 the theoretical background of xwt and application procedure can be found in torrence and compo 1998 for a specific time and scale the xwt of two time series xn and yn with a size n is defined as 11 w n xy s w n x s w n y s w n x s and w n y s represents the continuous wavelet transformation of the series xn and yn respectively further the w n y s represents the complex conjugate of w n y s as suggested by torrence and compo 1998 the square root of the product of two chi squared distributions was employed to compute the confidence levels of the xwt the cross wavelet power spectrum is defined as wxy and can be decomposed into amplitude and phase illustrating the common periodic structures and the delay between the variables thus the significant period cross magnitude and non stationarity between the ssfi series and the climate indices can be identified this study is interested in the dependence between the ssfi series and climate indices series on the 12 month time scale the obtained xwt spectrum is a graphical tool that identifies the significant correlations consequently the significant xwt results are used to uncover the potential teleconnections in the study region and accordantly identify the role of global oscillations in the causation of hydrological drought 4 results and discussion 4 1 filling missing data this study uses a non linear and unsupervised method nlpca to estimate missing streamflow data the data is integrated into an m 9 matrix where the rows represent the monthly data within a common period and the column represents the stations numbers the procedure was conducted by applying nine iterations for each iteration 3 to 10 of the original data appertaining to each station are replaced by null values to meet each column s 10 missing value following the missing data estimation the validation and the performance criteria of the method are then computed the validation process compares the removed and the original data to meet a minimum error in the missing data in this work the nlpca is performed with different network architecture the estimated data exhibited a minimum error while employing a neural network assembling nine non linear components and 15 non linear hidden units applied to nine input variables 9 stations table 4 in addition to the network architecture evaluation the number of iteration within the neural network was also under investigation and a set of 5000 iterations showed the best results the decay weight coefficient is another parameter defined during the process and was set to the value of 0 01 as recommended by canchala nastar et al 2019 following the estimation of missing data the reconstructed monthly streamflow series were transformed into annual series and statistical features of the streamflow at each station were calculated table 5 although the simple descriptive statistics cannot provide detailed information about the streamflow variability mode it is essential to evaluate those values to detect any abnormalities in the estimated series and understand the general streamflow variation through the years the results indicated that the highest annual water yield is recorded at the e01a003 station with an average flow of 143 34 m3 s on the other hand station d01a031has the lowest annual water yield with an average flow of 0 41 m3 s thus the stations considered in this study included watercourses with both high and low flow values this variety is of vital importance for hydrological drought analysis since the obtained results are not limited to a single flow regime from the other side the highest temporal variability is seen for station d01a039 with a cv value of 79 7 e01a003 station exhibited the lowest temporal variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 4 overall the studied stations exhibited high temporal variability where most cv values exceeded 50 4 2 homogeneity analysis in this study three different homogeneity tests were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed streamflow data the homogeneity of the reconstructed series was performed at a significance level of 5 thus the relevance of change points is deduced and the related regional clustering can be performed the obtained results are presented in table 6 for the reconstructed streamflow series the obtained p values showed that most stations have significant change points this finding is valid for all applied tests pettitt buishand and snht the results obtained from pettitt s and buishand range tests showed significant change in the mid nineties for southern region stations d01a008 d01a020 and e01a006 and a significant change between the beginning and mid eighties for northern region stations d01a031 e01a001 e01a003 and e01a013 the results obtained from the snht test showed that most stations are inhomogeneous similar to pettitt s and buishand range tests however the detected change points have different occurrence times homogeneity tests may exhibit different behaviors towards the evolution and changes of continuous series for instance the snht test is sensible to breaks close to the beginning and end of the series snht results indicated that the change in stations located in the southern part of the basin d01a008 d01a020 and e01a006 occurred in 2009 a break that occurred at the end parts of the series stations d01a031 and e01a013 showed a change at the beginning of the 1970s a break that occurred in the first parts of the series stations e01a001 and e01a003 showed similar results to pettitt s and buishand range test where the break occurred in the mid eighties pettitt s buishand range and snht tests commonly showed that the stations d01a039 and d01a052 have no significant change point the results obtained from homogeneity tests were compatible and the monthly streamflow series were critical in terms of inhomogeneities however the applied tests indicated spatial and temporal similarities in the streamflow series change point since the conditions under which the observations were made did not change the data set can be divided into homogeneous regions in other words the inhomogeneity present in a single station time series can be disregarded if a station group showed a similar change point due to changes in climatic conditions 4 3 hydrological drought evolution according to the results obtained from the homogeneity tests the study area can be divided into two homogenous regions in order to explore the temporal evolution of drought the ssfi 12 series of each station is assessed fig 3 presents the ssfi 12 series of the southern region stations the graphical illustration showed that southern stations exhibited similar patterns of the ssfi 12 series in terms of alternation between wet and drought periods and corresponding periods for instance moderate hydrologic drought periods can be seen in the mid 1970s mid 1980s and mid 1990s severe drought periods are also observed at the beginning of the 1970s mid 1980s and mid 1990s all southern stations exhibited a prolonged drought period during the 1990s however after the mid 1990s it is notable that drought severity and frequency decreased in the southern region after the year 2005 wet periods were seen to be dominant in the ssfi 12 series ssfi 12 series for northern stations exhibited similar variation patterns where drought periods were observed during the second half of the 1980s and mid 1990s fig 4 severe and extreme drought events occurred during the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s contrary to the southern region stations from the northern region exhibited more frequent drought periods after the beginning of the 2000s 4 4 hydrological drought temporal variability the detection of the hydrological drought trend in the meriç basin was performed via the mk test at the 5 significance level the approach aims to determine whether there was an upward downward or no trend in the monthly ssfi 12 time series the trend is quantified by referring to the statistic z values of the mk test at the 5 significance level the z value is 1 96 all stations in the southern region d01a008 d01a020 d01a052 e01a006 showed a significant positive trend on the other hand stations situated in the northern region did not exhibit common trend behavior for instance stations d01a031 e01a001 and e01a003 showed a significant negative trend stations d01a039 and e01a013 did not display a significant trend the trend analysis results generally revealed a dominant positive trend in the southern region and a dominant negative trend in the northern region table 7 the results of the mk test indicate that the studied stations can be clustered into two major groups southern stations with upward trends and northern stations with downward trends similar grouping was obtained from the homogeneity tests results where change points were detected in the mid 1990s and mid 1980s in the southern and northern regions respectively the trend analysis findings are in good agreement with those of eroğlu 2021 who found negative positive precipitation trends in the southern northern part of the meriç basin for the period 1965 2015 an explanation for this finding could be attributed to the relatively higher water budget in the northern regions the northern part of the basin experiences both snowfall and rainfall the southern part experiences mostly seasonal precipitation as a result streamflow variations and droughts are highly influenced by precipitation variability a portion of the northern basin has high elevations and relatively high humidity close to the black sea causing orographic precipitation to feed streams even in the dry seasons 4 5 periodic features of hydrological drought to determine the periodicity of hydrological drought cwt is performed the wps and gps for each ssfi 12 series are investigated from these diagrams the periodic structure associated with significant activities can be obtained significant activities are defined as events with high energy at a certain confidence level from the wps activities at the 95 confidence level are peaks enclosed by black contour lines on the other hand 90 confidence level activities are peaks enclosed by red contour lines from the wps and gps of southern stations ssfi 12 series it can be deduced that the dry and wet periods activities occurred generally within the 3 10 year scale fig 5 it is essential to mention that all stations showed organized activities after the mid 1970s prior activities cannot be detected due to the influence of the limited series length thus the considered decomposed data falls in the cone of influence u shape in black between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s an 8 10 year periodic structure is notable for southern stations and corresponds to the organized dry wet periods alternation that occurred in that period fig 3 the period was also characterized by a prolonged drought explaining the persisting 8 10 year activities at the 95 confidence level accordingly the dominant periodic component until the mid 1990 is defined by the 8 10 year band after the mid 1990s the consecutive alternation between drought and wet periods is notable from the ssf 12 series and wps for instance the ssfi 12 series exhibited shorter drought durations and faster alternation between dry and wet phases this variability mode was accompanied by a change in the dominant periodic component so that significant period structures appeared at the 3 5 year band gwp spectra reveal two modulations first in the 3 5 year band and second in the 8 10 year band the most substantial modulation was centered on ten years scale overall the hydrological drought series appears to be organized in preferred bounds of periods and dominated by activities in the 8 10 year band until the mid 1990s and a 3 5 year band after the mid 1990s the common variability modes of southern stations ssfi 12 series indicated a change in the regional climate also it is essential to mention that the change of the drought dominant periodic structure occurred in the same period as the change point of the southern stations streamflow series from the wps and gps of northern stations ssfi 12 series it can be deduced that the wet and dry activity can be explained by the 3 10 year band fig 6 most of the stations revealed organized activities after the beginning of the 1990s expect for station d01a031 most of the activities are notable after the mid 19970s contrary to southern region stations northern stations exhibited more persistent drought activities after the mid 1995s the change in the drought variability mode is reflected in the wps since significant events at the 95 level are mainly observed between the mid 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s in general gwp revealed two modulations first at the 3 8 year band and second at the 8 10 year band significant modulation with strong fluctuations was centered on 3 5 and 8 years overall the variability of hydrological drought in northern regions can be explained by organized activities located at the 3 5 year and 8 10 year bands after the mid 1950 4 6 drought teleconnections with climate indices this section investigates the possible links between hydrological drought and climate patterns using conventional correlation and cross wavelet analyses linear correlation analysis is determined via pearson s correlation coefficient for five lag times 0 3 6 12 24 between the ssfi 12 series and the running 12 month climate indices series the investigation included the running 12 month series of soi nino1 2 nino3 4 nino4 nao amo and pdo the linear correlation results show strong correlations between the ssfi 12 series and climate indices series are further investigated via cross wavelet analysis 4 6 1 impact of climate patterns on drought at the monthly time scale the pearson s test is run at the 5 significance level the test is applied for all the stations ssfi 12 series the values of linear lag correlation of the ssfi 12 series of each station and indices of climate patterns are computed table 8 presents the lag correlation coefficients of station d01a008 ssfi 12 series and a running mean of 12 months of the considered climate indices similarly the linear correlation coefficients were obtained for the rest of the stations overall significant correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and enso nao and amo climate oscillations negative correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and nino indices with high values at a time delay of 12 months positive correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and soi indices with high values at a time delay of 12 months negative correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and nao indices with high values at a time delay of 12 and 24 months for most stations amo exhibited a positive correlation at the different time lags the climate indices with significant influence on drought series enso nao and amo are further investigated via cross wavelet analysis 4 6 2 enso related drought the correlation between enso and hydrological drought series is investigated with the enso sst indicator nino1 2 and enso slp indicator soi this relation is investigated via cross wavelet analysis for nino1 2 teleconnections fig 7 the same procedure is applied for soi teleconnections fig 8 the analysis of the xwt spectra is limited to the results bounded by the cone of influence u shape in addition significant results 95 confidence level are specified by a black contour further the phase difference between the climate index and the ssfi 12 series is determined via the directions of the vectors the xwt analysis between the ssfi 12 and nino1 2 series indicates common low power for periods less than 12 month on the other hand the xwt revealed a strong correlation pattern between nino1 2 indices and the ssfi 12 series for periods of more than 24 months for instance the period between the late 1970s to the mid 1990s exhibited a common high power at the 2 8 year scale the mentioned period corresponds to the sequence of intense el nino la nina events ouachani et al 2011 associated with strong wet drought periods in the meriç basin these findings indicate that the enso drought relationship has strong interactions during times of peak in general phase arrows display an anti phase relation and indicate that nino1 2 leads arrows pointed left down these findings are in good agreement with the results obtained from the person correlation tests soi reveals the most significant coherence in the 2 7 year band with an in phase relationship fig 8 this period is consistent with the 2 7 year period of enso torrence and webster 1998 soi displays stronger relations during the 1970s and 1990s where the two signals were in phase during the mid 1990s five stations d01a031 d01a052 e01a003 e01a006 and e01a013 exhibited a significant coherence in the 8 16 year band these results suggest that during times of peak the enso drought relationship has strong interactions it is essential to mention that the el nino la nina phase is defined by the positive negative nino1 2 values and negative positive soi values thus enso related drought analysis revealed a negative correlation with nino1 2 and a positive correlation with soi 4 6 3 nao related drought fig 9 illustrates the power spectra retrieved from the xwt for the ssfi 12 series with a running mean of 12 month nao nao reveals the most significant common power in the 2 7 year band with an opposite phase difference nao displays stronger relations during the 1980s and 1990s during the 2000s two stations e01a003and e01a013 exhibited a significant coherence in the 5 8 year band these results suggest that during times of strong nao drought relationship the two phenomena will show strong interactions since the signals displayed a negative correlation we can conclude that intense positive nao phases lead to severe or extreme drought events in the meriç basin the results of this study are in agreement with a previous study that investigated the impacts of the north atlantic oscillation on hydrological drought conditions over turkey and northern iran vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 the western and eastern parts of turkey were affected by droughts with various magnitudes during the extreme positive phases of nao in addition the positive nao phases were not only negatively correlated with the ssfi series in turkey but also tended to affect hydrological droughts on longer timescales as compared with the negative nao phases in the present study section 4 6 1 the correlation analysis indicated that the influence of nao positive phases is more evident for time lags of 12 month and 24 month 4 6 4 amo related drought fig 10 illustrates power spectra retrieved from the xwt for the ssfi 12 series with a running mean of 12 month amo the xwt analysis between the amo and ssfi 12 series illustrates common low power on periods less than 12 month and common high power on periods more than 24 month amo reveals the most significant high power in the 2 3 and 3 5 year band with an in phase relationship amo displayed stronger relations during the mid 1970s and mid 1990s where the two signals were in phase during the late 1990s two stations d01a052 and e01a013 exhibited a significant correlation in the 5 8 year band and one station e01a003 exhibited a significant coherence in the 8 10 year band these results suggest that during times of strong amo drought relationship the two phenomena show strong interactions by referring to the temporal evolution of the drought series section 4 3 we can note that dry periods are marked by the la nina years the 1970 71 and 1973 74 la nina years ouachani et al 2011 are followed by a succession of dry years 1972 73 and 1973 74 similarly the 1988 99 la nina is followed by the 1990 91 extreme drought year in general the mid 1990s presents a dry period marked by the la nina years finally la nina year 2010 11 is followed by the dry year 2011 12 on the other hand we may outline that some el nino phases are followed by wet years the 1965 66 el nino is linked to the 1966 67 wet periods the extreme el nino year of 1997 98 could be linked to the 1997 99 wet years and respectively 2002 03 with 2004 05 2009 10 with the wet period 2009 11 conversely the nao drought relationship is not stable and we may point out that the 1989 92 positive nao phase was followed by the 1991 92 extreme dry year and that the 1993 94 positive nao phase was followed by 1994 95 dry year in general the early 1990s was dominated by positive nao while extreme dry spells marked this period on the other hand the negative nao phases are generally followed by wet years the 1995 96 negative phase is linked to the 1997 98 wet periods the 2009 10 negative nao phase could be linked to the 2010 11 wet years long term positive and negative phases characterize amo during 1971 1973 the strong amo negative events trenberth et al 2021 were followed by 1972 73 and 1973 74 severe drought years in general the negative amo phase 1962 1996 is marked by frequent and prolonged drought periods on the other hand during amo positive phase wet period are more dominant in the meriç basin it is essential to mention that the extreme drought years in the basin 1990 91 and 1991 92 are seen after simultaneous occurrence of la nina event nao positive phase and amo negative phase these observations are in coherence with the linear correlation analysis and wavelet analysis enso nao and amo s combined effect on drought variability were not considered in previous studies nevertheless vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 showed that the extreme positive nao phases cause dry conditions within turkey except during summer and analysis of long term ssfi series has shown that dry conditions dominate western turkey 5 conclusion this study presents a framework for hydrological drought spatio temporal variability assessment also the relations of the climate indices and the variability of the hydrological drought at the interannual timescales are investigated the present research estimated the main variability patterns of the hydrological drought over the meriç basin turkey and their relations to the large scale climate variability in this study we attempted to assess the temporal evolution of hydrological drought using the standardized streamflow index ssfi for the period 1959 2015 the study included the estimation of missing streamflow data and analyzing the homogeneity of streamflow series moreover the mann kendall test was applied to assess the trends in the derived drought series in addition the dominant periodic component of hydrological drought is determined via wavelet analysis finally possible teleconnections between large scale climate indices over the ssfi 12 series were investigated the findings of this study are summarized as follows the estimation of the missing data of streamflow data using the non linear principal component analysis methodology gave an overall rmse and mae values of 0 16 and 0 087 respectively a 9 15 9 network architecture with 5000 iterations provided the best estimation of the missing values we tested the nlpca method in a wide range of iteration numbers and came across that better estimation of streamflow series was obtained at 5000 iterations we also realized that a further increase in the number of iterations led to a prolonged computation time without noticeable improvement in streamflow estimation furthermore these results indicate that the nlpca approach is a powerful alternative in the estimation of streamflow missing data since it considers the non linear and nonstationary features of the data the homogeneity of streamflow series was investigated via three absolute homogeneity tests were used pettitt s test buishand range test and snht test the obtained results showed that the monthly streamflow series were critical in terms of inhomogeneity however the obtained change points showed spatial and temporal similarities for instance northern and southern stations exhibited change points in the mid 1980s and mid 1990s respectively thus the detected change reflects a possible change in climatic conditions the analysis of the ssfi 12 series approved the superiority of long lasting hydrological drought occurrences over the southern region during the mid 1990s generally the ssfi 12 results belonging to the southern region contributed higher values than those obtained by the northern region until the mid 1990s however since the beginning of the 2000s the northern region has exhibited more frequent drought periods trend analysis resulted in significant increasing trends in the ssfi 12 series over the southern region of the basin on the other hand northern stations exhibited significant decreasing trends except for the trendless behavior of the stations d01a039 and e01a013 thus the results indicate a decrease in hydrological drought in southern regions and an increase in hydrological drought in northern regions eroğlu 2021 studied precipitation trends in the meriç river basin and revealed a decreasing increasing trend in the north south regions of the meriç basin as a result the obtained hydrological drought trends in this study can be explained by the precipitation variability in the study area the periodic features of the hydrological drought were extracted via the continuous wavelet analysis generally the wet and dry period s activities were seen in the 3 10 year band the combination of wps and gps revealed that the average periodic component of the ssfi 12 series is at the 4 year and 10 year scales as a result the hydrological drought has a short term periodicity of 4 years and a long term periodicity of 10 years this result is relevant for forecasting the upcoming drought periods in the meriç basin and planning and implementing strategies for sustainable use of the basin water resources the assessment of possible teleconnections between hydrological drought series and climate indices revealed a significant correlation between drought periods and enso nao and amo intense phases the xwt analysis brought more insight into the ssfi 12 and climate indices relationship the results revealed that during times of peak enso nao amo drought relationship has strong interactions for instance strong la nina events and positive nao phases are generally followed by severe or extreme drought this result is relevant to forecast the extreme hydrological drought events in the meriç basin there are significant relationships between drought variability and global climate oscillations relevant to forecasting extreme drought events as well as planning and implementing strategies for sustainable use of water resources at the regional level in addition the results obtained herein will contribute to long term hydrological forecasts in river basins in order to help better predict the future state of these water systems under climate variability scenarios it is essential to research the possible effects associated with global warming as a result this issue is beyond the scope of the current study and a future study would be necessary to evaluate adaptations hence climate modeling studies can incorporate these aspects separating natural variability from global change and analyzing the impact of

3721,in this study the spatial temporal variability of hydrological drought in meriç basin turkey has been examined and its relationship with global climate oscillations has been explored prior to drought analysis streamflow data gaps were filled and series homogeneity was examined the standardized streamflow index ssfi was used to detect drought periods from monthly streamflow data of nine stations well spread over the study area the hydrological drought intensity magnitude and duration were investigated using the ssfi time series the drought variability was assessed by performing trend analysis and wavelet transforms trend analysis showed an increase in drought events in the northern region and a decrease in the southern region of the basin wavelet analysis reveals that the 4 10 year scales explicate the drought series pattern the identification of climate patterns that are most associated with drought variability is performed via correlation analysis the investigation showed that distinct climate patterns simultaneously influence drought events significantly the influence of el nino southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is notable the analysis demonstrated a remarkable correlation between enso and ssfi series at the interannual scale 2 8 years the obtained phase difference suggests that the maximum dry wet conditions coincide with la nina el nino events in addition positive nao phases and negative amo phases lead to drought occurrence keywords drought variability wavelet analysis standardized streamflow index teleconnections 1 introduction elements of the water cycle such as streamflow precipitation and soil moisture exhibit high spatial and temporal variability at infrequent intervals hydrological variables display extreme behaviors wielding substantial impacts on ecosystems and may endanger human life for instance the change observed in the climate system led to the intensification of extreme hydrological events huntington 2006 bosilovich et al 2004 ipcc 2007 thus the intensified hydrological cycle has a notable global impact and a more significant impact on societies living within river watersheds huntington 2006 the occurrence of extreme events has undesirable drawbacks on human activities such as agriculture and industrial production in this context the sustainable development goals sdgs were introduced by the united nations un to ensure the lastingness of humankind s well being https sdgs un org fr goals to meet particular goals such as zero hunger good health and well being responsible consumption and production and climate action the knowledge of global and regional climate variability is vital accordingly the scientific community has been concerned about the climate system components interactions and variability at the regional and global scales on a global scale climate patterns have an orchestrated temporal and spatial variability regulated by the recurring and persistent ocean atmospheric patterns defined as teleconnections naizghi and ouarda 2017 several studies have shown that global teleconnections have a significant influence on humans as they are associated with cold and heat waves keellings and waylen 2015 floods kundzewicz et al 2019 droughts hassan and nayak 2020 cyclones xie et al 2020 agriculture ustaoglu and karaca 2014 and wildfire mariani et al 2018 consequently the strength of teleconnections influences human health food and water security and energy demands some earlier studies have demonstrated that hydroclimatological variables such as streamflow precipitation and other water balance variables are important indicators of the interaction between the hydrological components and the global climate oscillations at the regional scale according to cullen et al 2002 the north atlantic oscillation affects streamflow variability in the middle east researchers used the nao index to examine streamflow variability in middle eastern rivers from december through march it was found that the first principal component of streamflow variability reflected nao variations cullen et al 2002 demonstrated a correlation between changes in middle eastern water supply and natural variations in the climate system and variations in ssts in the eastern mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean in another study kalayci and kahya 2006 streamflow variability in turkey was examined over the period 1964 1994 using principal component analysis the study identified systematic patterns of streamflow variation over time and space the principal component scores were correlated with the large scale atmospheric circulation the obtained results indicate that the turkish streamflow climatology is sensitive to north atlantic and southern oscillations variations marti et al 2010 examined the effects of el niño and southern oscillation on streamflow characteristics in turkey the study explored how enso influenced the streamflow time series statistics analyses were conducted on hypothetical series derived from the original series under the assumption that el niño events had not occurred in the past the original and hypothetical series were compared in four different scenarios the existence of significant differences indicates that enso events significantly impact the major statistical characteristics of the studied streamflow series according to the study s findings streamflow characteristics in the west anatolian region were more influenced by enso variability in a more recent study conducted by vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 the characteristics of hydrological and agricultural droughts across the closed basin of konya kcb in turkey were examined using the standardized soil moisture index ssi trends over the kcb were detected using the modified mann kendall mmk trend method xwt was used to examine the teleconnections between large scale climate indices over a 3 month ssfi and ssi series results indicate an increase in drought duration and severity since 1999 xwt results indicate a significant relationship between large scale climate indices and ssfi ssi series for periods less than eight months this study focuses on the influences of the global teleconnection on water availability in meriç basin turkey such inquiry can be performed by studying the variability of hydro climatological data such as precipitation and streamflow and its teleconnections with climate indices canchala et al 2020a 2020b the hydro climatological data variability assessment plays an essential role in defining forecast models and predicting extreme events in addition analyzing the hydro climatological variables evolution is critical in designing hydraulic structures and managing water resources however their results may not be notable for policy and decision makers for instance linking streamflow variability to physical events such as drought and wet periods is more significant for policy makers when planning or making decisions a study by gu et al 2020a examined the relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts through the lens of hazard assessment in an effort to provide drought monitoring and management tools a general framework was proposed to characterize drought hazard propagation processes for decision makers this approach can be a valuable tool for anticipating hydrological droughts and selecting management strategies for water resources furthermore drought and wetness are concrete concepts that all segments of society can understand thus studying drought variability and sharing the results can develop an affinity for water scarcity among society s different segments with the evolution of human life demands socio economic activities witnessed significant growth along with this global growth the water demands have also increased for energy generation urban water supply industrial and agriculture activities on the other side river basins sustainability requires sufficient natural flow to preserve flora and fauna in the river environment this concern is growing increasingly as a result of global warming and the reality that more regions of the world will experience intense drought in a climate warming scenario gu et al 2020b gu et al 2020c drought is a natural hazard associated with large scale atmospheric or ocean patterns van loon 2015 in this study we focused on the assessment of hydrological drought variability and its relationship with large scale climate indices aiming to introduce an efficient approach that can be employed by researchers and water managers for drought monitoring however water managers may be unsure of putting in new methods and approaches the switch or inclusion of non conventional procedures could put managers in a demanding position in front of project stockholders as a result global teleconnections are not widely used in water resources management protocols this study aims to provide a general framework applicable to any river basin to facilitate the water managers tasks the proposed approach uses the standardized streamflow index to identify the temporal evolution of hydrological drought and extreme events magnitude in the area of interest following the analysis of drought series temporal variability by detecting trends via the mann kendall mk test and retrieving dominant periodic components via continuous wavelet analysis cwt further exploring the relationship between global teleconnections and drought series via conventional statistical methods and wavelet analysis more precisely the cross wavelet analysis xwt 2 data and study area meriç basin is located in the southeastern part of the european continent the basin is bordered by the black sea marmara sea and the aegean sea from the north southeast and southwest respectively the basin is within the borders of three different countries bulgaria greece and turkey and represents an important water source in the south balkan peninsula thus the rivers and their tributaries play an essential role in all three countries agricultural and industrial activities the basin has three main sub river basins the meriç river basin the ergene river basin and the tunca river basin while the longest river is the meriç river 550 km and has a drainage area of 52600 km2 erkal and topgül 2020 it is essential to mention that we are interested in the basin part enclosed by turkish territory within the scope of this study fig 1 the catchment area covers different topographical regions where mountains are found in northern regions and large lowlands can be found in the basin s central southern and eastern parts rivers of the study area are fed by rain and snowmelt and flow throughout the year however flow rate shifts may be observed under the influence of precipitation and temperature in southern regions the mediterranean climate is prevailing and maximum precipitations occur during winter on the other hand the continental climate has a major influence on the central and northern part of the basin and heavy rainfall comes in may june artinyan et al 2008 the daily time series of streamflow are recorded at multiple gauging stations situated in the catchment area and operated by the turkish state hydraulic works in this study the daily streamflow observations were used to compute the average monthly streamflow values and proceed with drought analysis the study area comprises 32 gauging stations with record periods spanning between the years 1958 and 2015 however to ensure the credibility of the analysis and minimize errors generated from inaccurate or corrupted data the data set was narrowed down to 9 stations table 1 the selection of gauging stations is based on several criteria first stations with daily records of less than 30 years are discarded also stations that drain catchments with considerable human intervention are eliminated finally the data set is restricted to monthly time series with less than 10 gaps and consecutive missing less than 24 months many studies in literature adopted a similar approach for streamflow time series analysis hamilton and moore 2012 giuntoli et al 2013 yerdelen and abdelkader 2021 to examine the drought relationship with the global climate oscillations large scale climate indices are used climate indices display the quantitative description of ocean dynamics or atmospheric circulations at distinct time scales generally climate indices are calculated from anomalies in air pressure sea surface temperature or solar radiation prior to data analysis previous related studies in eastern europe the mediterranean basin and turkey were examined to find out climate oscillations that may influence the local climate patterns in the study region cenk and turgay 2020 cullen et al 2002 giuntoli et al 2013 kalayci and kahya 2006 marti et al 2010 ouachani et al 2011 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 kahya 2011 for the current work enso nao amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are used to determine their influence on drought variability and assess their utility as possible drought predictors it is essential to mention that the pre analysis of this study included the investigation of the correlations between mediterranean oscillation 1 2 and drought series and no significant relations were spotted the selected climate indices reflect the concurrent variation in climate anomalies across broad geographical areas for instance enso corresponds to the interaction between ocean currents and atmospheric circulation enso indicates two phenomena the strong anomalous warming of the eastern equatorial pacific ocean s surface waters known as el niño and the alternation in the tropical pacific surface barometric pressure known as the southern oscillation enso variability is described by a quasi periodic component alternating between two and seven years ouachani et al 2011 ipcc 2007 the oscillation has two main phases a warm phase el niño and a cold phase la niña the identification of enso phases and related magnitude can be accomplished via the south oscillation index soi a standardized sea level pressure slp based index or nino 4 nino 3 nino 3 4 and nino 1 2 metrics measuring the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in defined regions between the eastern and western pacific ipcc 2007 the analysis also included a recurring pattern of ocean atmosphere climate variability over the mid latitude pacific basin known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is quantified by the standardized difference between ssts in the north central pacific and gulf of alaska mantua et al 1997 although pdo has a similar spatial climate fingerprint as el nino their temporal variability exhibits different patterns pdo has two main phases a warm phase during which the west pacific cools and part of the eastern ocean warms and a cool phase with reverse patterns the north atlantic oscillation is defined as one of the major modes of spl variation in the northern hemisphere the nao is determined by computing the difference in spl between the azores located in the tropical atlantic and iceland located in the subpolar low pressure system where an atmospheric pressure oscillation occurs rogers 1984 the nao has a remarkable impact on the northward climate and is responsible for changes in air and ocean temperature precipitation and winds ottersen et al 2001 two phases are distinguished in the nao a positive phase and a negative phase the positive phase is characterized by a high pressure anomaly across the subtropical atlantic and a low pressure anomaly over iceland and the arctic leading to strong westerlies in the mid latitudes rogers 1984 the northwestern atlantic and mediterranean regions experience clod and dry conditions during the positive phase whereas northern europe northeastern america and scandinavian regions experience warm and wet conditions on the other hand the negative nao phase is characterized by a low pressure anomaly across the subtropical atlantic and a high pressure anomaly over iceland leading to a weakening of the westerlies north atlantic and in western europe and reducing the meridional pressure gradient during the negative phase southern regions of europe have wetter conditions than usual and the northern region of europe experiences cold and dry conditions the amo index is quantified as the variation of sst in the northern parts of the atlantic ocean amo has a periodic component ranging between 60 and 80 years and each cycle alternates between a warm phase and a cool phase schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 knight et al 2006 the amo phases can last up to 20 40 years the amo is considered in this study due to its significant impacts over vast areas of the northern hemisphere for instance several studies linked air temperature and precipitation patterns to amo variability over vast regions of the northern hemisphere knight et al 2006 martin and thorncroft 2014 jones and carvalho 2018 also the amo warm phases impact the frequency and severity of drought periods at a regional scale mccabe et al 2004 lu and delworth 2005 global climate indices time series covered in this study are presented in table 2 3 methodology drought variability in the meriç basin is of vital importance for the inhabitant of the region since their main economic activities depend on agriculture and industry the approach followed in this study aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological drought in the basin further the relationship between climate indices and hydrological drought is investigated the procedure adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 estimation of missing data the quality and availability of the climatic and hydrological data are vital for assessing water resources nevertheless in situ measurements frequently exhibit missing data resulting from instruments failures recording errors and other site related issues estimating missing data can be performed via different approaches such as regression autoregressive models interpolation and machine learning based methods in this study the estimation of missing streamflow data was conducted by the non linear principal component analysis nlpca method scholz et al 2005 scholz et al 2008 recent studies used this method to estimate missing rainfall data miró et al 2017 canchala nastar et al 2019 canchala et al 2020a and missing streamflow data canchala et al 2020b the nlpca is a non linear conception of the principal component analysis pca integrating artificial neural networks ann related studies showed the efficiency of nlpca in estimating non linear and nonstationary streamflow data canchala et al 2020b scholz et al 2008 provide a detailed description of the nlpca approach the application of the method can be performed via the nlpca toolbox http www nlpca org matlab html regarding the application of nlpca different architectures were tested to decrease the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae expressed respectively as 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y m y o 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n y m y o where n is the number of observations ym represents the predicted data from the nlpca model yo is the observed flow the use of the rmse evaluation indicator effectively assesses the method s ability to track high flow values whereas the mae is an unbiased index to evaluate the relative forecasting ability of the nlpca 3 2 data homogeneity data homogeneity needs to be taken into account while analyzing hydrological time series in this study homogeneity analysis in the streamflow series is used to detect the accuracy and validity of the data for the present study the gauging stations location and the method of streamflow measurement did not change since its establishment also the gauging stations surrounding environment and physical factors have not altered over the years thus changes in the time series would reflect a change in the local climatic conditions rather than a change in the measurement s conditions data and the data set will be considered homogeneous wmo 2007 this study applied three absolute homogeneity tests to determine the streamflow time series homogeneity status pettitt s test buishand range test and standard normal homogeneity test snht the calculation procedure of pettitt s test buishand range test and snht can be found in detail in pettitt 1979 buishand 1982 and toreti et al 2011 respectively 3 3 standardized streamflow index ssfi four drought categories are distinguished meteorological drought agriculture drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought within the scope of this study hydrological drought is under investigation the hydrological drought is related to the negative anomalies in groundwater mishra and singh 2010 and streamflow smakhtin 2001 however hydrological drought can be quantified via indices based on precipitation streamflow low flows runoff groundwater levels and water balance this study uses the standardized streamflow index a streamflow based index to quantify the hydrological drought the ssfi is one of several drought indices and is widely used worldwide as introduced by modarres 2007 and suggested by the world meteorological organization and global water partnership wmo and gwp 2016 it is straightforward to use as it is calculated using monthly streamflow data it is simply the transformation of streamflow into a standard normal variable from the gamma distribution defined by 3 ssfi f i f σ fi is the monthly flow rate f and σ represent the mean and standard deviation of streamflow obtained from the whole monthly time series in the present study running series of total streamflow with 12 months are considered thus the drought propagation over a 12 month scale is illustrated and the interannual variation of the wet and dry seasons is detected van oel et al 2017 classification based on ssfi values is presented in table 3 3 4 variability analysis 3 4 1 trend analysis variability analysis is often performed by studying trends in hydro climatic series kahya and kalaycı 2004 the study of drought trends can be performed by analyzing a drought index s time series mahajan and dodamani 2015 in this study the temporal variability of hydrological drought is retrieved from the ssfi 12 series trend analysis trend detection is computed using the mk test mann kendall test is commonly used to detect monotonic trends in hydrological time series the mann kendall test statistic is calculated according to 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 5 sgn x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 the mean of s is e s 0 and the variance σ2 is 6 σ s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where p represents the number of the tied groups in the time series and tj is the number of data points in the jth tied group the statistic s is used to calculate the zmk transformation defined by 7 z mk s 1 σ s i f s 0 s 1 σ s i f s 0 if α is the test significance level and z is the standard normal variate then the null hypothesis no trend is valid for z z 1 0 5α otherwise the presence of a monotonic trend is accepted in this study the considered significance level is 95 and the alternative hypothesis is accepted for the following cases z mk 1 96 f o r u p w a r d t r e n d 1 96 f o r d o w n w a r d t r e n d 3 4 2 periodicity analysis wavelet transforms have been used to analyze hydrological and meteorological variables to determine trends and periodicity yerdelen et al 2021 naizghi and ouarda 2017 investigated long term changes in wind speed in the united arab emirates uae the wind speed dominant periodicity was confirmed through wavelet analysis and fourier transform ft it should be noted that although ft results are similar to those of the cwt they are restricted to the localization of frequency only cwt in contrast allows localization both in frequency and time chong et al 2019 conducted a study concerning the comparison between wavelet and fourier transforms using ft and cwt to examine streamflow frequency and showed the limitations of ft in an advanced series analysis it is critical to identify events of interest within a given timeframe however this cannot be retrieved from ft analysis due to the indicated drawback therefore we used the wavelet transform over ft in nonstationary time series analysis wavelet transform is a promising approach employed to analyze several hydrological and meteorological events and detect nonstationary trends and periodicity joshi et al 2016 yerdelen et al 2021 in this study drought periodicity analysis is performed using the cwt this method is a powerful tool that can provide a simultaneous display of time and frequency the cwt decomposes a time series into low periodicity events high frequency and high periodicity events low frequency thus the decomposition of series in time frequency space reveals the dominant modes of drought variability over time the cwt of a discrete sequence xn is defined as the convolution of the sequence with a scaled and translated wavelet ψ ξ ξ is a non dimensional time parameter that defines the transformed wavelet 8 w n x s n n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s the localized time index is n the wavelet scale is represented by s δt defines the sampling period n represents the time series length and asterisk designates the complex conjugate in this study ssfi 12 series are decomposed via cwt using the morlet wavelet function the morlet function is commonly used for representing hydrological signals first the morlet function shape is similar to the hydrological series more importantly the function imparts a good localization along with time and frequency for the treated signal labat 2005 the cwt results are interpreted graphically through the wavelet power spectrum wps the wps illustrates the time series variance at different periods and indicates significant historical patterns torrence and compo 1998 in this study the wps is computed for a significance level at the 5 level torrence and compo 1998 provide a detailed description of the wps significant level computation and related procedures the wps is used as a graphical tool to determine the significant ssfi 12 dominant periodic patterns moreover the time averaged periodic components are obtained from the global wavelet spectrum gws the gws is obtained by computing the average of the wavelet coefficients over time the gws provides an unbiased and compatible approximation of the power spectrum for the entire signal length thus the gws provides practical results by estimating the global signal peaks significant periodic component from local wavelet spectra torrence and compo 1998 3 5 ssfi teleconnections with climate indices the occurrence of hydrological drought is a complex process depending on both the atmospheric and hydrological processes however this study focuses on the effect of the atmospheric processes since it is considered the starting point of hydrological drought sheffield and wood 2011 van loon 2015 thus the large scale climate indices are used as an indicator of the global atmospheric mechanisms variability the influence of the global climate indices over drought series can be investigated via conventional statistical tests or wavelet analysis in this study statistical correlation tests and wavelet analysis are applied to assess the relation between climate patterns and drought variability 3 5 1 conventional correlation analysis correlation analyses quantify the relationship between two variables the strength of the relationship is described via the correlation coefficients sign and value for instance a positive correlation indicates an increasing rank of both variables a negative correlation indicates that the increasing rank of a variable corresponds to the decreasing rank of the other variable a linear parametric test pearson correlation is employed to describe the correlation between the considered climatic and drought series in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r is determined as the covariance of two variables and y with equal series length n divided by the product of their standard deviations 9 r n xy x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 the test statistic tr is calculated as follows 10 t r r n 2 1 r 2 the analysis was computed for a significance level α at 5 thus absolute values of tr within the bounds of confidence interval t 1 α 2 reject the null hypothesis the test is applied to determine the strength of association based on the patter of concordance and discordance between the ssfi 12 series and the considered climate index 3 5 2 correlation via wavelet analysis testing the linkages among time series can be performed via cross wavelet analysis the method determines the at peak coherence and the lagging between two time series the correlation results are defined at the time and the frequency extent the xwt results are restricted to identifying periodic structures characterized by common high power events present in both signals during a specific time interval grinsted et al 2004 the theoretical background of xwt and application procedure can be found in torrence and compo 1998 for a specific time and scale the xwt of two time series xn and yn with a size n is defined as 11 w n xy s w n x s w n y s w n x s and w n y s represents the continuous wavelet transformation of the series xn and yn respectively further the w n y s represents the complex conjugate of w n y s as suggested by torrence and compo 1998 the square root of the product of two chi squared distributions was employed to compute the confidence levels of the xwt the cross wavelet power spectrum is defined as wxy and can be decomposed into amplitude and phase illustrating the common periodic structures and the delay between the variables thus the significant period cross magnitude and non stationarity between the ssfi series and the climate indices can be identified this study is interested in the dependence between the ssfi series and climate indices series on the 12 month time scale the obtained xwt spectrum is a graphical tool that identifies the significant correlations consequently the significant xwt results are used to uncover the potential teleconnections in the study region and accordantly identify the role of global oscillations in the causation of hydrological drought 4 results and discussion 4 1 filling missing data this study uses a non linear and unsupervised method nlpca to estimate missing streamflow data the data is integrated into an m 9 matrix where the rows represent the monthly data within a common period and the column represents the stations numbers the procedure was conducted by applying nine iterations for each iteration 3 to 10 of the original data appertaining to each station are replaced by null values to meet each column s 10 missing value following the missing data estimation the validation and the performance criteria of the method are then computed the validation process compares the removed and the original data to meet a minimum error in the missing data in this work the nlpca is performed with different network architecture the estimated data exhibited a minimum error while employing a neural network assembling nine non linear components and 15 non linear hidden units applied to nine input variables 9 stations table 4 in addition to the network architecture evaluation the number of iteration within the neural network was also under investigation and a set of 5000 iterations showed the best results the decay weight coefficient is another parameter defined during the process and was set to the value of 0 01 as recommended by canchala nastar et al 2019 following the estimation of missing data the reconstructed monthly streamflow series were transformed into annual series and statistical features of the streamflow at each station were calculated table 5 although the simple descriptive statistics cannot provide detailed information about the streamflow variability mode it is essential to evaluate those values to detect any abnormalities in the estimated series and understand the general streamflow variation through the years the results indicated that the highest annual water yield is recorded at the e01a003 station with an average flow of 143 34 m3 s on the other hand station d01a031has the lowest annual water yield with an average flow of 0 41 m3 s thus the stations considered in this study included watercourses with both high and low flow values this variety is of vital importance for hydrological drought analysis since the obtained results are not limited to a single flow regime from the other side the highest temporal variability is seen for station d01a039 with a cv value of 79 7 e01a003 station exhibited the lowest temporal variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 4 overall the studied stations exhibited high temporal variability where most cv values exceeded 50 4 2 homogeneity analysis in this study three different homogeneity tests were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed streamflow data the homogeneity of the reconstructed series was performed at a significance level of 5 thus the relevance of change points is deduced and the related regional clustering can be performed the obtained results are presented in table 6 for the reconstructed streamflow series the obtained p values showed that most stations have significant change points this finding is valid for all applied tests pettitt buishand and snht the results obtained from pettitt s and buishand range tests showed significant change in the mid nineties for southern region stations d01a008 d01a020 and e01a006 and a significant change between the beginning and mid eighties for northern region stations d01a031 e01a001 e01a003 and e01a013 the results obtained from the snht test showed that most stations are inhomogeneous similar to pettitt s and buishand range tests however the detected change points have different occurrence times homogeneity tests may exhibit different behaviors towards the evolution and changes of continuous series for instance the snht test is sensible to breaks close to the beginning and end of the series snht results indicated that the change in stations located in the southern part of the basin d01a008 d01a020 and e01a006 occurred in 2009 a break that occurred at the end parts of the series stations d01a031 and e01a013 showed a change at the beginning of the 1970s a break that occurred in the first parts of the series stations e01a001 and e01a003 showed similar results to pettitt s and buishand range test where the break occurred in the mid eighties pettitt s buishand range and snht tests commonly showed that the stations d01a039 and d01a052 have no significant change point the results obtained from homogeneity tests were compatible and the monthly streamflow series were critical in terms of inhomogeneities however the applied tests indicated spatial and temporal similarities in the streamflow series change point since the conditions under which the observations were made did not change the data set can be divided into homogeneous regions in other words the inhomogeneity present in a single station time series can be disregarded if a station group showed a similar change point due to changes in climatic conditions 4 3 hydrological drought evolution according to the results obtained from the homogeneity tests the study area can be divided into two homogenous regions in order to explore the temporal evolution of drought the ssfi 12 series of each station is assessed fig 3 presents the ssfi 12 series of the southern region stations the graphical illustration showed that southern stations exhibited similar patterns of the ssfi 12 series in terms of alternation between wet and drought periods and corresponding periods for instance moderate hydrologic drought periods can be seen in the mid 1970s mid 1980s and mid 1990s severe drought periods are also observed at the beginning of the 1970s mid 1980s and mid 1990s all southern stations exhibited a prolonged drought period during the 1990s however after the mid 1990s it is notable that drought severity and frequency decreased in the southern region after the year 2005 wet periods were seen to be dominant in the ssfi 12 series ssfi 12 series for northern stations exhibited similar variation patterns where drought periods were observed during the second half of the 1980s and mid 1990s fig 4 severe and extreme drought events occurred during the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s contrary to the southern region stations from the northern region exhibited more frequent drought periods after the beginning of the 2000s 4 4 hydrological drought temporal variability the detection of the hydrological drought trend in the meriç basin was performed via the mk test at the 5 significance level the approach aims to determine whether there was an upward downward or no trend in the monthly ssfi 12 time series the trend is quantified by referring to the statistic z values of the mk test at the 5 significance level the z value is 1 96 all stations in the southern region d01a008 d01a020 d01a052 e01a006 showed a significant positive trend on the other hand stations situated in the northern region did not exhibit common trend behavior for instance stations d01a031 e01a001 and e01a003 showed a significant negative trend stations d01a039 and e01a013 did not display a significant trend the trend analysis results generally revealed a dominant positive trend in the southern region and a dominant negative trend in the northern region table 7 the results of the mk test indicate that the studied stations can be clustered into two major groups southern stations with upward trends and northern stations with downward trends similar grouping was obtained from the homogeneity tests results where change points were detected in the mid 1990s and mid 1980s in the southern and northern regions respectively the trend analysis findings are in good agreement with those of eroğlu 2021 who found negative positive precipitation trends in the southern northern part of the meriç basin for the period 1965 2015 an explanation for this finding could be attributed to the relatively higher water budget in the northern regions the northern part of the basin experiences both snowfall and rainfall the southern part experiences mostly seasonal precipitation as a result streamflow variations and droughts are highly influenced by precipitation variability a portion of the northern basin has high elevations and relatively high humidity close to the black sea causing orographic precipitation to feed streams even in the dry seasons 4 5 periodic features of hydrological drought to determine the periodicity of hydrological drought cwt is performed the wps and gps for each ssfi 12 series are investigated from these diagrams the periodic structure associated with significant activities can be obtained significant activities are defined as events with high energy at a certain confidence level from the wps activities at the 95 confidence level are peaks enclosed by black contour lines on the other hand 90 confidence level activities are peaks enclosed by red contour lines from the wps and gps of southern stations ssfi 12 series it can be deduced that the dry and wet periods activities occurred generally within the 3 10 year scale fig 5 it is essential to mention that all stations showed organized activities after the mid 1970s prior activities cannot be detected due to the influence of the limited series length thus the considered decomposed data falls in the cone of influence u shape in black between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s an 8 10 year periodic structure is notable for southern stations and corresponds to the organized dry wet periods alternation that occurred in that period fig 3 the period was also characterized by a prolonged drought explaining the persisting 8 10 year activities at the 95 confidence level accordingly the dominant periodic component until the mid 1990 is defined by the 8 10 year band after the mid 1990s the consecutive alternation between drought and wet periods is notable from the ssf 12 series and wps for instance the ssfi 12 series exhibited shorter drought durations and faster alternation between dry and wet phases this variability mode was accompanied by a change in the dominant periodic component so that significant period structures appeared at the 3 5 year band gwp spectra reveal two modulations first in the 3 5 year band and second in the 8 10 year band the most substantial modulation was centered on ten years scale overall the hydrological drought series appears to be organized in preferred bounds of periods and dominated by activities in the 8 10 year band until the mid 1990s and a 3 5 year band after the mid 1990s the common variability modes of southern stations ssfi 12 series indicated a change in the regional climate also it is essential to mention that the change of the drought dominant periodic structure occurred in the same period as the change point of the southern stations streamflow series from the wps and gps of northern stations ssfi 12 series it can be deduced that the wet and dry activity can be explained by the 3 10 year band fig 6 most of the stations revealed organized activities after the beginning of the 1990s expect for station d01a031 most of the activities are notable after the mid 19970s contrary to southern region stations northern stations exhibited more persistent drought activities after the mid 1995s the change in the drought variability mode is reflected in the wps since significant events at the 95 level are mainly observed between the mid 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s in general gwp revealed two modulations first at the 3 8 year band and second at the 8 10 year band significant modulation with strong fluctuations was centered on 3 5 and 8 years overall the variability of hydrological drought in northern regions can be explained by organized activities located at the 3 5 year and 8 10 year bands after the mid 1950 4 6 drought teleconnections with climate indices this section investigates the possible links between hydrological drought and climate patterns using conventional correlation and cross wavelet analyses linear correlation analysis is determined via pearson s correlation coefficient for five lag times 0 3 6 12 24 between the ssfi 12 series and the running 12 month climate indices series the investigation included the running 12 month series of soi nino1 2 nino3 4 nino4 nao amo and pdo the linear correlation results show strong correlations between the ssfi 12 series and climate indices series are further investigated via cross wavelet analysis 4 6 1 impact of climate patterns on drought at the monthly time scale the pearson s test is run at the 5 significance level the test is applied for all the stations ssfi 12 series the values of linear lag correlation of the ssfi 12 series of each station and indices of climate patterns are computed table 8 presents the lag correlation coefficients of station d01a008 ssfi 12 series and a running mean of 12 months of the considered climate indices similarly the linear correlation coefficients were obtained for the rest of the stations overall significant correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and enso nao and amo climate oscillations negative correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and nino indices with high values at a time delay of 12 months positive correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and soi indices with high values at a time delay of 12 months negative correlations are found between the ssfi 12 series and nao indices with high values at a time delay of 12 and 24 months for most stations amo exhibited a positive correlation at the different time lags the climate indices with significant influence on drought series enso nao and amo are further investigated via cross wavelet analysis 4 6 2 enso related drought the correlation between enso and hydrological drought series is investigated with the enso sst indicator nino1 2 and enso slp indicator soi this relation is investigated via cross wavelet analysis for nino1 2 teleconnections fig 7 the same procedure is applied for soi teleconnections fig 8 the analysis of the xwt spectra is limited to the results bounded by the cone of influence u shape in addition significant results 95 confidence level are specified by a black contour further the phase difference between the climate index and the ssfi 12 series is determined via the directions of the vectors the xwt analysis between the ssfi 12 and nino1 2 series indicates common low power for periods less than 12 month on the other hand the xwt revealed a strong correlation pattern between nino1 2 indices and the ssfi 12 series for periods of more than 24 months for instance the period between the late 1970s to the mid 1990s exhibited a common high power at the 2 8 year scale the mentioned period corresponds to the sequence of intense el nino la nina events ouachani et al 2011 associated with strong wet drought periods in the meriç basin these findings indicate that the enso drought relationship has strong interactions during times of peak in general phase arrows display an anti phase relation and indicate that nino1 2 leads arrows pointed left down these findings are in good agreement with the results obtained from the person correlation tests soi reveals the most significant coherence in the 2 7 year band with an in phase relationship fig 8 this period is consistent with the 2 7 year period of enso torrence and webster 1998 soi displays stronger relations during the 1970s and 1990s where the two signals were in phase during the mid 1990s five stations d01a031 d01a052 e01a003 e01a006 and e01a013 exhibited a significant coherence in the 8 16 year band these results suggest that during times of peak the enso drought relationship has strong interactions it is essential to mention that the el nino la nina phase is defined by the positive negative nino1 2 values and negative positive soi values thus enso related drought analysis revealed a negative correlation with nino1 2 and a positive correlation with soi 4 6 3 nao related drought fig 9 illustrates the power spectra retrieved from the xwt for the ssfi 12 series with a running mean of 12 month nao nao reveals the most significant common power in the 2 7 year band with an opposite phase difference nao displays stronger relations during the 1980s and 1990s during the 2000s two stations e01a003and e01a013 exhibited a significant coherence in the 5 8 year band these results suggest that during times of strong nao drought relationship the two phenomena will show strong interactions since the signals displayed a negative correlation we can conclude that intense positive nao phases lead to severe or extreme drought events in the meriç basin the results of this study are in agreement with a previous study that investigated the impacts of the north atlantic oscillation on hydrological drought conditions over turkey and northern iran vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 the western and eastern parts of turkey were affected by droughts with various magnitudes during the extreme positive phases of nao in addition the positive nao phases were not only negatively correlated with the ssfi series in turkey but also tended to affect hydrological droughts on longer timescales as compared with the negative nao phases in the present study section 4 6 1 the correlation analysis indicated that the influence of nao positive phases is more evident for time lags of 12 month and 24 month 4 6 4 amo related drought fig 10 illustrates power spectra retrieved from the xwt for the ssfi 12 series with a running mean of 12 month amo the xwt analysis between the amo and ssfi 12 series illustrates common low power on periods less than 12 month and common high power on periods more than 24 month amo reveals the most significant high power in the 2 3 and 3 5 year band with an in phase relationship amo displayed stronger relations during the mid 1970s and mid 1990s where the two signals were in phase during the late 1990s two stations d01a052 and e01a013 exhibited a significant correlation in the 5 8 year band and one station e01a003 exhibited a significant coherence in the 8 10 year band these results suggest that during times of strong amo drought relationship the two phenomena show strong interactions by referring to the temporal evolution of the drought series section 4 3 we can note that dry periods are marked by the la nina years the 1970 71 and 1973 74 la nina years ouachani et al 2011 are followed by a succession of dry years 1972 73 and 1973 74 similarly the 1988 99 la nina is followed by the 1990 91 extreme drought year in general the mid 1990s presents a dry period marked by the la nina years finally la nina year 2010 11 is followed by the dry year 2011 12 on the other hand we may outline that some el nino phases are followed by wet years the 1965 66 el nino is linked to the 1966 67 wet periods the extreme el nino year of 1997 98 could be linked to the 1997 99 wet years and respectively 2002 03 with 2004 05 2009 10 with the wet period 2009 11 conversely the nao drought relationship is not stable and we may point out that the 1989 92 positive nao phase was followed by the 1991 92 extreme dry year and that the 1993 94 positive nao phase was followed by 1994 95 dry year in general the early 1990s was dominated by positive nao while extreme dry spells marked this period on the other hand the negative nao phases are generally followed by wet years the 1995 96 negative phase is linked to the 1997 98 wet periods the 2009 10 negative nao phase could be linked to the 2010 11 wet years long term positive and negative phases characterize amo during 1971 1973 the strong amo negative events trenberth et al 2021 were followed by 1972 73 and 1973 74 severe drought years in general the negative amo phase 1962 1996 is marked by frequent and prolonged drought periods on the other hand during amo positive phase wet period are more dominant in the meriç basin it is essential to mention that the extreme drought years in the basin 1990 91 and 1991 92 are seen after simultaneous occurrence of la nina event nao positive phase and amo negative phase these observations are in coherence with the linear correlation analysis and wavelet analysis enso nao and amo s combined effect on drought variability were not considered in previous studies nevertheless vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 showed that the extreme positive nao phases cause dry conditions within turkey except during summer and analysis of long term ssfi series has shown that dry conditions dominate western turkey 5 conclusion this study presents a framework for hydrological drought spatio temporal variability assessment also the relations of the climate indices and the variability of the hydrological drought at the interannual timescales are investigated the present research estimated the main variability patterns of the hydrological drought over the meriç basin turkey and their relations to the large scale climate variability in this study we attempted to assess the temporal evolution of hydrological drought using the standardized streamflow index ssfi for the period 1959 2015 the study included the estimation of missing streamflow data and analyzing the homogeneity of streamflow series moreover the mann kendall test was applied to assess the trends in the derived drought series in addition the dominant periodic component of hydrological drought is determined via wavelet analysis finally possible teleconnections between large scale climate indices over the ssfi 12 series were investigated the findings of this study are summarized as follows the estimation of the missing data of streamflow data using the non linear principal component analysis methodology gave an overall rmse and mae values of 0 16 and 0 087 respectively a 9 15 9 network architecture with 5000 iterations provided the best estimation of the missing values we tested the nlpca method in a wide range of iteration numbers and came across that better estimation of streamflow series was obtained at 5000 iterations we also realized that a further increase in the number of iterations led to a prolonged computation time without noticeable improvement in streamflow estimation furthermore these results indicate that the nlpca approach is a powerful alternative in the estimation of streamflow missing data since it considers the non linear and nonstationary features of the data the homogeneity of streamflow series was investigated via three absolute homogeneity tests were used pettitt s test buishand range test and snht test the obtained results showed that the monthly streamflow series were critical in terms of inhomogeneity however the obtained change points showed spatial and temporal similarities for instance northern and southern stations exhibited change points in the mid 1980s and mid 1990s respectively thus the detected change reflects a possible change in climatic conditions the analysis of the ssfi 12 series approved the superiority of long lasting hydrological drought occurrences over the southern region during the mid 1990s generally the ssfi 12 results belonging to the southern region contributed higher values than those obtained by the northern region until the mid 1990s however since the beginning of the 2000s the northern region has exhibited more frequent drought periods trend analysis resulted in significant increasing trends in the ssfi 12 series over the southern region of the basin on the other hand northern stations exhibited significant decreasing trends except for the trendless behavior of the stations d01a039 and e01a013 thus the results indicate a decrease in hydrological drought in southern regions and an increase in hydrological drought in northern regions eroğlu 2021 studied precipitation trends in the meriç river basin and revealed a decreasing increasing trend in the north south regions of the meriç basin as a result the obtained hydrological drought trends in this study can be explained by the precipitation variability in the study area the periodic features of the hydrological drought were extracted via the continuous wavelet analysis generally the wet and dry period s activities were seen in the 3 10 year band the combination of wps and gps revealed that the average periodic component of the ssfi 12 series is at the 4 year and 10 year scales as a result the hydrological drought has a short term periodicity of 4 years and a long term periodicity of 10 years this result is relevant for forecasting the upcoming drought periods in the meriç basin and planning and implementing strategies for sustainable use of the basin water resources the assessment of possible teleconnections between hydrological drought series and climate indices revealed a significant correlation between drought periods and enso nao and amo intense phases the xwt analysis brought more insight into the ssfi 12 and climate indices relationship the results revealed that during times of peak enso nao amo drought relationship has strong interactions for instance strong la nina events and positive nao phases are generally followed by severe or extreme drought this result is relevant to forecast the extreme hydrological drought events in the meriç basin there are significant relationships between drought variability and global climate oscillations relevant to forecasting extreme drought events as well as planning and implementing strategies for sustainable use of water resources at the regional level in addition the results obtained herein will contribute to long term hydrological forecasts in river basins in order to help better predict the future state of these water systems under climate variability scenarios it is essential to research the possible effects associated with global warming as a result this issue is beyond the scope of the current study and a future study would be necessary to evaluate adaptations hence climate modeling studies can incorporate these aspects separating natural variability from global change and analyzing the impact of

3722,the optimal allocation of water resources is a critical means of resolving the supply demand paradox to optimize the allocation of regional water resources an interval numeral hierarchical planning model inhpm was established to integrate unconventional water resources into the water resource allocation system while simultaneously considering the interests of decision makers at different levels and the uncertainty in a water resource allocation system the inhpm directs conventional and unconventional water supply departments to achieve coordinated development through the objective function of the synergy degree the theory of synergy and the theory of information entropy serve as the theoretical foundations for the objective function of the synergy degree in addition the interval number was introduced to allow the inhpm to address uncertainty in a water resource allocation system the hierarchical planning model served as the primary framework for assisting decision makers in minimizing conflicts of interest among various stakeholders in a water allocation system in this paper the interval multi objective genetic algorithm imoga was established to solve the inhpm as opposed to the previous method of transforming the uncertainty model into a certainty model and solving it imoga inhpm finally using the optimal allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources in ordos northwest china as an example the results and comparison analysis of a case study demonstrate the imoga practicability inhpm s and efficiency keywords coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources hierarchical planning model stakeholders uncertainty interval multi objective genetic algorithm 1 introduction with increased population and excessive economic development the conflict between water supply and demand has widened and become one of the major impediments to the world s sustainable development hu et al 2016 li et al 2017 yue et al 2020 to alleviate the current situation of heavy water supply pressure on conventional water resources unconventional water resources must be introduced into water resource allocation systems as alternative water sources to effectively integrate conventional and unconventional water resources corresponding mechanisms to guide the coordinated allocation of these two water resources must be implemented one of the primary methods for addressing this issue is the optimal allocation of water resources xu et al 2019 the optimal allocation of water resources has the advantages of low cost and ease of operation as a non engineering measure as a result it is critical to develop a coordinated allocation model of conventional and unconventional water resources as well as a suitable solution algorithm li et al 2017 however two issues remain in research on the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources i incorporating unconventional water resources into the conventional water resource allocation system can reduce the water supply pressure on conventional water resources and effectively alleviate the current water shortage situation but there is a lack of a set of methods to guide the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources ii a reasonable solution algorithm for the multi level and multi objective uncertain programming model is still lacking this study evaluates countermeasures based on two aspects to solve the problems incorporating unconventional water resources into water resource allocation systems and uncertain programming model solving percia et al 1997 established a joint management model of conventional water resources surface water groundwater etc and unconventional water resources regional sewage which was successfully applied in the eilat region of southern israel as well as an evaluation model for the configuration results in their research on incorporating unconventional water resources into water resource allocation systems wong et al 2014 proposed a multi objective and multistage optimized management method for the joint application of multiple water sources in addition to considering conventional and unconventional water sources in water demand forecasting jin et al 2012 allocated regional water resources unconventional and conventional to effectively improve the region s overall efficiency by decreasing increasing the proportion of conventional unconventional water resources yang et al 2008 allocated water using unconventional water resources reclaimed water and rainwater and conventional water resources surface water and their findings provided a reference for regional managers han et al 2008 combined unconventional water resources seawater with conventional water resources using dalian city as a case study to discuss water resource allocation with multiple sources and multiple users the final conclusion is that allocating water resources to multiple users and sources is an effective method for achieving sustainable urban water resource use avni et al 2013 investigated the mixing of unconventional water resources desalinated seawater with other conventional water sources to meet the magnesium requirements for drinking water and irrigation water furthermore the model s output can aid in the quality control of water supply systems using tianjin as an example yu et al 2017 developed a cost benefit analysis based combined utilization model of externally transferred water and desalinated water although many scholars have investigated the comprehensive utilization of conventional and unconventional water resources their research has primarily focused on multi resource allocation and has rarely addressed the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources entropy theory and synergy theory studies in water resource allocation are insufficient and most existing studies focus on how to coordinate water demand departments from their respective perspectives li et al 2015 gan et al 2013 so far no research has been published on the coordination of unconventional and conventional water resources from the perspectives of water supply departments particularly conventional and unconventional water supply departments because conventional and unconventional water supply departments compete for limited water demand market shares the water allocation system s stability may be jeopardized if this excessive competition is not moderated as a result in order to reduce the vicious competition between conventional and unconventional water supply departments the concept of order must be established in the water supply system the study of various systems composed of a large number of subsystems is known as synergy theory a macroscopic order state is formed under certain conditions due to subsystem synergy as a result synergy is frequently used to assess the degree of order between subsystems luo et al 2014 the order degree of the system on the other hand is determined not only by the order degree of the subsystems but also by the combination of subsystems the degree of collaboration between subsystems combination form can be measured using information entropy theory and the overall system s development direction can be determined singh 2000 as a result the order degree of the entire system can be reflected on the basis of the order degree of the subsystem calculated by synergetic in conjunction with information entropy theory hence this paper constructs a synergetic goal and guides the water supply departments of conventional and unconventional water resources to achieve synergetic development by combining synergetic theory and information entropy theory intelligent optimization algorithms have already been used to solve specific engineering problems wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 but most previous studies in the field of uncertain programming model solving have transformed uncertain models into deterministic models and then solved them cai et al 2011 hou et al 2016 maqsood et al 2005 rosenberg and lund 2009 cai et al 2011 transformed and solved the uncertain nonlinear programming model the uncertain model was transformed into two sub models corresponding to the upper and lower limits of the objective function and then proposed a long term water supply strategy hou et al 2016 used the midpoint of the interval and the length of the interval to represent the interval and the uncertainty was transformed to establish an uncertain planning model for the allocation of water resources in an irrigation area the final solution may provide assistance in allocating water resources in the irrigation area maqsood et al 2005 improved the final application by transforming models according to different scenarios and calculating optimal water resource allocation plans under different scenarios however some research indicates that when compared to the solution algorithm for transforming the uncertain model directly solving the uncertain model can yield more satisfactory results in the process of transforming the uncertain programming model by the solved algorithm it is inevitable to increase the number of objective functions however increasing the number of objective functions results in high dimensional problems making solution difficult gong et al 2010 liu and liu 2020 as a result it is necessary to create an algorithm that can solve the uncertain model directly because the decision makers are organized in a hierarchy the solution algorithm must be able to deal with the model s hierarchy it is critical to note that no optimization algorithm can solve the multi objective uncertain and hierarchical model directly the interval hierarchical multi objective genetic algorithm imoga is based on nsga ii and redefines the method of nondominated sorting and the concept of crowding so that the algorithm proposed in this paper can deal with multilevel and uncertain multi objective models it should be noted that the new nondominated method primarily introduces two enhancements i a dominance relationship based on interval number is proposed which means that the ranking of individuals is determined by each interval objective function of each individual ii in the hierarchical pareto front division method the optimal front is determined first according to the upper level s objectives and then the optimal front of the lower level within the range of the upper level s optimal front is determined according to lower objectives this also gives the imoga two characteristics it can directly solve the uncertain model and divide the pareto front based on decision maker levels these two characteristics allow the imoga to avoid flaws caused by the transformation of uncertain models and to coordinate conflicts of interest among decision makers at all levels the imoga has advantages over previous intelligent optimization algorithms used to solve the uncertainty program model that are simple and intuitive when developing a model for this study the following questions are considered 1 how can an objective function be established to guide conventional and unconventional water supply sectors toward synergy while avoiding excessive competition 2 what method should be used to solve the model based on the preceding discussion this paper develops an interval number hierarchical planning model inhpm and an imoga to solve it to address the uncertainty in the inhpm interval numbers are used in contrast to a probability distribution and a fuzzy set interval numbers only need to know the bounds of the parameters and do not need to know the probability distribution or membership function of the parameters because the probability distribution or membership function requires significant data for calculation huang et al 2001 this greatly reduces the inhpm s demand for a large amount of data and is suitable for areas with less available data this paper takes economic maximization minimum chemical oxygen demand cod emissions and minimum synergetic degree as the upper objective function and maximum comprehensive benefits from conventional and unconventional water supply departments as the lower objective function the imoga is intended to directly solve the inhpm imoga inhpm an imoga is proposed by defining a new nondominated sorting method and a new crowding distance the imoga can solve the model directly avoiding the flaws caused by the transformation of uncertain models at the same time because of the unique nondominated sorting method used in this paper the optimal pareto front of the second level can only be found in the optimal pareto front of the first level ensuring that the final solutions meet the needs of decision makers at all levels meanwhile this reflects the first level s priority the imoga inhpm is validated and compared to the existing model using the optimal allocation of water resources in ordos city in northwest china as an example the findings of this paper are expected to help with the optimal allocation of water resources in other areas the following are the main contributions of this paper 1 from the standpoint of coordination between conventional and unconventional water supply departments information entropy theory and synergetic theory are used to construct the coordination objective function to guide conventional and unconventional water resources to coordination and 2 an algorithm is developed to solve multilevel and multi objective uncertain programming problems 2 methodology because conventional water resources are becoming increasingly scarce research into the coordinated allocation model of conventional and unconventional water resources is required there is uncertainty and a hierarchy of decision makers in the coordinated allocation model as a result this paper employs interval numbers to express the system s uncertainty the allocation system will generate uncertainty due to the effects of human activities climate change current prediction abilities and other factors degefu et al 2017 on the one hand it will affect the model parameters and cause them to float and on the other hand due to the limitation of the prediction level the prediction results will produce errors resulting in uncertainty about the prediction of water supply and demand to represent the hierarchy of decision makers the solution algorithm employs the hierarchical programming model and a special nondominated ranking method the system manager represents the overall interests of the water distribution system while the water supply department represents the individual interests the model is built on two levels to express both group and individual interests the system manager is at the top pursuing the best overall interests and the water supply department is at the bottom pursuing its own maximum benefits 2 1 the first level of inhpm 1 social objective function synergetic degree the synergetic degree objective function was established based on synergetic and entropy theories to guide conventional and unconventional water supply departments toward synergy the order degree is a measure of the order or chaos in a system according to the concept of the order degree in synergy as a result the concept of order degree can be introduced to measure the synergy between various subsystems and to determine the system s evolution direction there are two types of subsystems in this paper s water allocation system conventional and unconventional water supply systems as well as numerous order parameters by integrating the contributions of the order parameters to the order degree of each subsystem the contributions of the order parameters to the order degree of the system can be measured that is the overall performance of a water resource system is determined not only by the order parameter values but also by the combination form of the subsystems furthermore for conventional and unconventional water supply systems the order parameters are chosen as the two systems respective water supply volumes and the order degree of each subsystem can be expressed as follows 1 x con i 1 2 α ij x ij 2 x uncon i 3 7 α ij x ij 3 u con x con x con min x con max x con min 4 u uncon x uncon x uncon min x uncon max x uncon min 5 h s con u con 6 h s uncon u uncon where h scon and h suncon are the order degrees of the conventional and unconventional water supply departments respectively ucon and uuncon are the order degrees of the conventional and unconventional water supply systems respectively concerning the order parameters of the water supply xconmin and xconmax are the minimum and maximum critical thresholds of the order parameter xcon respectively xunconmin and xunconmax are the minimum and maximum critical thresholds of the order parameter xuncon respectively xij is the amount of water supplied from source i to user j which is the decision variable of the inhpm α ij is the water supply relationship coefficient where 0 indicates no supply and 1 indicates a water supply i 1 7 represent surface water groundwater rain karst water coal mine water brackish water and reclaimed water respectively j 1 5 represent the domestic water demand agricultural water demand industrial water demand tertiary industry water demand and ecological water demand respectively due to the limited supply of water resources competition between conventional and unconventional water supply subsystems is unavoidable and the order degrees of various subsystems cannot reach the optimal level at the same time that is an increase in the order degree of one subsystem may result in a decrease in the order degree of others a water resource allocation system s overall order degree is determined not only by the order degree of each subsystem but also by the combination of the order degrees of the subsystems as a result the order degrees of various subsystems are calculated using the following formula based on the principle of information entropy singh 2000 7 h s 1 h s con 2 log 1 h s con 2 1 h s uncon 2 log 1 h s uncon 2 in formula 7 h s is the overall synergetic degree of the system when h s is smaller the synergetic degree between the conventional and unconventional water supply systems is higher li et al 2015 therefore formula 7 can be taken as the objective function of the synergetic degree of the upper level model as shown in formula 8 8 f 1 x ij min h s a water resource system is composited with a conventional water supply department and an unconventional water supply department in this study as an open system it has the characteristics of a dissipative structure such as openness that is far from equilibrium nonlinear interaction and fluctuation phenomena the dissipative structure can be used to identify the system s evolution law that is system entropy h s can describe the evolution direction of a water resource system when a water resource system s entropy value is higher the degree of order is lower conversely when a water resource system s order degree is higher the entropy value is lower by minimizing the entropy value of the water resource system the order parameters of each subsystem can be coordinated to promote the coordination of conventional and unconventional water supply departments in a water resource allocation system the rationale for including information entropy theory is presented in the supplementary materials part i the rationale for including information entropy theory the highest degree of order occurs when x g 2 as discussed in the supplementary materials part i at the same time the conventional and unconventional water supply departments actual water supply quantities are equal at this point thus from the perspective of water allocation system managers the gap between the two departments is the smallest ideal fairness between the two departments is possible unreasonable competition between the two water supply departments is reduced and coordination between the two departments is possible many factors influence the actual water supply process making the above ideal fair state difficult to achieve including equation 8 as one of the objective functions can help to promote coordination and fairness between the two water supply departments while also preventing unreasonable competition the discussion in the supplementary materials part i also shows that equation 7 represents the degree of difference in water supply quantity between the two water supply departments when equation 7 is smaller the difference between the two water supply departments is smaller indicating that the two departments have a more equitable market share and the unreasonable competition between the two departments is reduced indicating that the degree of collaboration between the two departments is greater as a result equation 7 can be interpreted as the degree of coordination between the two water supply departments 2 economic objective function a global manager directs a water allocation system to maximize overall economic benefit by establishing the economic objective function as shown in formula 9 9 f 2 x ij max j 1 5 i 1 7 α ij x ij c ij b ij where c ij and b ij are the benefit coefficient interval and cost coefficient interval of the water supply respectively 3 ecological objective function according to wang et al 2019 the minimum cod emissions are used as the ecological objective function of the upper level model which can reflect the principle of sustainability as shown in formula 10 10 f 3 x ij min j 1 5 i 1 7 0 01 d i p i α ij x ij where dj is the concentration of cod per unit sewage discharge of the jth user in mg l pj is the sewage discharge coefficient of the jth user 2 2 the second level of inhpm the second level decision makers are made up of conventional and unconventional water supply departments and the two departments compete for the limited water demand market in the following ways the maximum comprehensive benefit objective of the water supply department can be divided into two categories namely conventional water resources with the greatest comprehensive benefit and unconventional water resources with the greatest comprehensive benefit 11 f 4 x con max x con l β conj 12 f 5 x uncon max x uncon l β uncon j where xl con and xl uncon refer to the actual amounts of water available to conventional and unconventional water supply departments under the guidance of the upper level managers which can be obtained through formulas 13 and 14 respectively 13 x con l i 1 2 α ij x ij 14 x uncon l i 3 7 α ij x ij where βconj is the comprehensive benefit coefficient of the conventional water supply which can be obtained from formula 15 zhang 2017 ahmad et al 2018 15 β con j 1 m max m j j 1 5 1 m max m j where mj is the serial number of the priority of the water supply for users mj 1 5 represent the water use serial numbers of industry tertiary industry domestic ecology and agriculture mmax 5 is the maximum order number of the department similarly the comprehensive benefit coefficient of unconventional water supply βunconj can be obtained the difference is that mj 1 5 represents industry ecology agriculture domestic and tertiary industries for unconventional water resources 2 3 constraints the main constraints include water supply water demand non negative and water quality constraints water supply constraints 16 j 1 5 α ij x ij c i 17 c i c i 1 l c i 1 l water demand constraints 18 0 5 b j i 1 7 α ij x ij b j 19 b j b i 1 l b i 1 l non negative constraints 20 0 x ij water quality constraints 21 j 1 5 i 1 7 0 01 d i p i α ij x ij d where c i is the interval of the available water supply of the ith water source ci is the available water supply of the type i water source l is the range of available water water demand which reflects the uncertainty of available water water demand and is provided by decision making based on experience b j is the interval of the water demand of the jth user and bj is the water demand of the jth user d is the upper limit of cod allowed to be discharged in the study area according to the inhpm when addressing the two types of variables i e the water supply quantity of conventional and unconventional water supply departments this paper constructs a synergetic objective to guide the two water supply departments to carry out benign competition and avoid conflict in order to realize collaboration the conflict between multi objective functions is primarily reflected in three aspects the conflict between the first and second levels of the objective function and the conflict between the two levels of the objective function this paper develops a multi objective programming model to find a pareto set for the conflicts in the first two aspects in a pareto set as long as a target value is in the dominant position the corresponding water allocation solution can be identified as a non inferior solution such that the interests represented by each decision maker can be reflected a hierarchical programming model is used to express the interest of the objective function at each level when there is a conflict in the objective function between different levels simultaneously when the imoga is used the second level optimal solution can only be found in the first level optimal solution as a result the final scheme not only meets the interests represented by each level s objective function but also reflects the priority of the first level the main cause of disagreements among water users is that their basic water requirements cannot be met as a result in order to coordinate water conflicts among water users atef et al 2019 water supply departments must do their best to meet the water needs of the water users this article employs two measures to resolve disputes between water users the first measure is to set the water supply department at the second level to maximize the comprehensive benefits as mentioned above this can reflect the interests of the water supply department however at the same time the addition of the second level can promote a larger water supply for the water use department once the water supply department provides more water the water demand of the water users will be better met as users receive more water however certain problems will still exist that is the distribution of the amount of water supplied is not uniform which will make some water users unable to obtain the minimum water supply therefore this study has set constraints on the minimum water demand of each user 18 which is also the second measure 2 4 model solution uncertainty nonlinearity non differentiability a double leveled structure and a multi objective nature characterize the inhpm this model cannot be solved using the traditional analytical or numerical calculation methods cui et al 2017 the intelligent optimization algorithm is used to solve the inhpm because it has lower requirements for the objective function and constraints nabaei et al 2018 the inhpm s objective function includes uncertain factors and the objective functions are divided into levels the problem is an interval uncertain hierarchical multi objective problem that the imoga can solve in addition the penalty function method and the probability method are used to address the inhpm s constraints the imoga algorithm is based on the nsga ii algorithm the nsga ii algorithm is first introduced to facilitate the introduction of the imoga see supplementary material part ii process of nsga ii the nsga ii algorithm s nondominated sorting method and crowding distance are primarily aimed at solving a single level deterministic model the inhpm differs from the traditional single level deterministic model in two ways the hierarchy and the uncertainty of the objective function as a result corresponding algorithms must be designed with these two characteristics in mind that is in addition to improving the nsga ii algorithm s original nondominated sorting method and crowding distance the new algorithm can solve the uncertainty hierarchical planning model 2 4 1 algorithm design for the uncertainty of the objective function previously uncertainty in multi objective problems was generally transformed into determinism this approach however has some flaws the imoga was created to address this issue the method of nondominated sorting and the calculation of the crowding distance distinguish this method from the conventional multi objective genetic algorithm e g nsga ii the interval number is used in this paper to represent uncertainty in the water allocation system thus the value of the objective function in the inhpm is an interval number however because interval numbers cannot be directly compared the magnitude of the interval number more specifically its order relation is defined for the interval an individual represents a solution in the pareto solution set numbers a a and b b let c be the maximum of a a b and b and let c be the second largest of a a b and b when d a c d a c d a c d b c is greater than 0 5 a a is greater than b b where 22 d a c a c 2 a c 2 23 d b c b c 2 b c 2 for individual a and individual b let their objective functions be a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a m a m and b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b m b m respectively a is superior to b when all of a s objective functions are less than those of b assuming that a smaller objective function is better when all of a s objective functions exceed those of b b is superior to a when neither of the preceding scenarios occurs a and b are on the same side when an individual is not dominated by other individuals the individual is at the first front and when an individual is not dominated by other individuals except for the individuals in the first front then the individual is at the second front the individuals in other fronts can be identified in a similar manner in the imoga formula 24 is used to calculate the crowding distance rdistance of individual l 2 24 r dis tan c e l 2 i s b o u n d a r y s o l u t i o n k 1 3 d f k r 1 f k r 1 d f k max f k min otherwise where fr 1 k and fr 1 k represent the kth objective function values of the r 1 th and r 1 th individuals in the sorted set respectively fmax k and fmin k represent the maximum and minimum values of the kth objective function respectively liu and liu 2020 d is the distance between objective values which can be calculated by referring to formula 22 2 4 2 algorithm design for the hierarchy of the objective function when the level of a decision maker s objective function is higher in the hierarchical multi objective planning model it must be met first however the lower level s objective function can only obtain its own optimization if the upper level s optimal objective function is optimal as a result the nondominated sorting method described below was devised ⅰ based on the objective function of the first level calculate the objective function first level value of the individual and sort the results according to the nondominated sorting method in 2 4 1 to obtain each front f1 f2 fi fe and calculate the crowding distance of each individual in the same front ⅱ taking the individuals in the first front f1 as the research object and based on the objective function of the second level calculate the objective function second level value of the individuals in f1 and sort the results according to the nondominated sorting method described in 2 4 1 to obtain the subfront f1 1 f2 1 fe1 1 under the first front the subfront f1 i f2 i fei i of any front fi can be obtained in the same way notably in fj i i represents the number of the main front and j represents the number of the subfront iii after obtaining all subfronts that correspond to the front f1 f2 fi fe sort all individuals according to the following principles individual sort position increases as the number of main fronts decreases when the number of subfronts is smaller for a given main front number the individual sort position is higher when the number of main fronts and subfronts of two individuals are equals the two individuals are sorted into the same front the above nondominant sorting and crowding distance calculation methods are replaced by the nondominant sorting and crowding distance calculation methods of the nsga ⅱ to obtain the imoga 2 4 3 constraint handling the penalty function method and the possibility degree method can be used to process the constraints in the inhpm the penalty function method searches within the feasible region while the constraint boundary functions as a wall the penalty function value is very close to the optimal value when the current solution is far from the constraint boundary otherwise the penalty function value is close to infinity please see nemati s work for more information nemati et al 2017 the possibility degree method proposes the concept of comparing interval numbers in situations where the intervals have intersecting parts and determines the relationship between the intervals under a certain degree of possibility β please see nakahara s work for more information nakahara et al 1992 the specific algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the first front of the second level can only be generated in the first front of the first level thus the final scheme can meet the interests of decision makers at both levels to the greatest extent possible while also ensuring the priority of decision makers at the first level which is also an example of coordinating conflicts of interest between the upper and lower levels 2 5 scenario setting the scenario setting method can assist the final decision maker in better understanding the optimal allocation scheme under various scenarios and in making subsequent decisions as a result this article is based on the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan s point forecast results of future water supply and demand and increases the interval radius to express the forecast s uncertainty when dealing with uncertainty in a model the modeling developer hopes to quantify the uncertainty using a specific method incorporate it into the model and then perform modeling and calculation the above method is the most ideal method and it can be implemented using probability distributions or fuzzy sets realizing the preceding process using probability distributions or fuzzy sets necessitates a large amount of data in order to build a model which is difficult to achieve in practice as a result the modeler may be unable to quantify the uncertainty to a precise value however the modeling developer can estimate a swing range such that the true value after being affected by uncertain factors falls within this interval in this article l is used to characterize the radius of change of the interval to realize estimation to the future value affected by uncertain factors such as future water supply and water demand it should be noted that this range cannot be too narrow as this could cause the true value to fall outside of the range simultaneously as l increases so does the length of the interval allowing for more cases to be considered a larger l on the other hand will result in a significant increase in configuration costs due to low probability events as a result it is also critical to select a suitable range which necessitates actual staff selecting the range based on experience multiple ranges are established to facilitate comparison and selection by the staff the range l combined with β are the scenario described in the text and the final configuration calculation is performed to provide a reference for the actual staff s decision making the possibility β represents the degree to which the model satisfies the uncertainty constraint which will also have an impact on the final water allocation result thus it must also be considered in the inhpm different scenarios were created in this paper based on the probability β of the possibility degree method and the uncertainty of water supply and demand l to seek the optimal water allocation results in each scenario and provide support for the final decision maker s decision 2 6 model evaluation 1 scheme settings the following models were used to compare the performance of the imoga inhpm the model without considering the hierarchy of the objective function the model without considering the synergetic objective function and the deterministic model the specifics are as follows most traditional models of optimal water allocation do not hierarchize the objective function xu et al 2013 the model that did not consider the hierarchy of the objective function was the same as the objective function of the imoga inhpm but the objective function was not hierarchized this model could be compared to imoga inhpm to ascertain the effect of the objective function hierarchy on overall performance without taking into account the synergetic objective function the model omitted formula 8 this model could be used to compare to imoga inhpm to ascertain the effect of incorporating a synergetic objective function on overall performance in the past the most common solution for uncertain models was to convert them into deterministic models please see jiang s work for more information on the specific procedure jiang et al 2008 the imoga inhpm does not perform this transformation which is the only difference between it and the deterministic model the deterministic model could be used as a comparison model to validate the impact of transformation on overall performance 2 evaluation method in reality decision makers represent diverse interests which frequently clash aside from that there are levels of objective functions that represent all parties interests so a good water allocation scheme can simultaneously coordinate all parties interests maximize their satisfaction and conform to the hierarchy of objective functions this idea inspired the following evaluation methods the scheme sets generated by the four models described above were evaluated and sorted using the imoga s nondominated sorting method the scheme chosen at the first front after sorting was considered the one to be evaluated in the second stage because the schemes to be evaluated in the second stage were in the first stage these evaluation schemes were most in line with the interests of upper and lower level decision makers as a result the next step was to choose the best scheme that satisfied the overall interest relationship the values of the second stage evaluation scheme s objective functions 8 and 9 12 were used as indicators different weights were assigned based on the level of the indicators and the interval topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method was used to evaluate each plan and select the best results the interval topsis method was developed by combining the concept of interval numbers with the traditional topsis method in this paper the interval topsis method s details are largely consistent with those of the traditional topsis method please see hwang s work for more information on the topsis method hwang et al 1981 the differences include the selection of the best and worst solutions as well as the calculation of the distance formula the smallest interval was identified as the optimal solution and the largest interval was identified as the worst solution by comparing the magnitudes of the intervals one by one using the method described in section 2 4 1 formula 22 was used to replace the topsis method s traditional euclidean distance with a new distance formula the rest of the procedure followed the traditional topsis method the topsis method ranks evaluation objects based on their comprehensive score the evaluation object is better when the comprehensive score is higher please consult the literature for the comprehensive score calculation method hwang et al 1981 3 application to validate the rationality of the imoga inhpm this study used ordos city in the inner mongolia autonomous region as an example ordos is located in the southwestern inner mongolia autonomous region in the hinterlands of the ordos plateau in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and has an area of 86 752 km2 fig 2 depicts a map of the research site the area suffers from a scarcity of water resources and the conventional water supply is under severe strain surface water and groundwater account for 40 3 and 55 9 of total water supply respectively with other water sources accounting for less than 4 of total supply unconventional water resources in the region have great potential yang et al 2014 and can be used to relieve pressure on the conventional water supply as a result the share of unconventional water supply can be increased to achieve synergy in the allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources the study area is in northwestern china as shown in fig 2 water resources are scarce in northwest china all year yaning 2014 so the available water supply in ordos is limited furthermore ordos has a relatively developed economy with the highest per capita gdp of any chinese city a high water demand and significant water supply pressure because industry is still developing in the study area the potential for unconventional water resources is significant unconventional water resources can be used as alternative source to relieve pressure on the traditional water supply 3 1 parameter determination the benefits and costs of water supply were calculated using zhang s work zhang 2017 and the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan as shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively tables 3 and 4 show the water supply and demand for ordos in 2025 based on the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan table 5 also shows the relationship coefficient between water resources and water use departments the water supply relationship coefficient based on water quality and the needs of each water user table 6 displays the cod concentration and sewage discharge coefficient table 7 shows the total benefit coefficients of conventional and unconventional water supplies as shown in table 7 the overall benefits of unconventional water resources are the same for each sector this is due to the fact that the primary goal of establishing this parameter is to reflect that unconventional water resources will supply water to high yield water use departments through competition this study assumed that as long as each unconventional water resource wins more shares of high yield water departments the overall benefits of such water sources will be greater because the ranking of their outputs is fixed for the five water departments in this paper the comprehensive benefit coefficient of unconventional water resources for each water use sector is the same at the same time many studies show that different water supply departments have the same water supply order zhang 2017 ahmad et al 2018 in this study β and l were set to 0 4 0 1 0 4 0 15 0 4 0 2 0 5 0 15 0 5 0 2 0 5 0 15 0 5 0 2 0 6 0 1 0 6 0 15 and 0 6 0 2 3 2 calculation of the results the inhpm was calculated using the data and equations 1 21 and the imoga was used to solve the problem the results are depicted in figs 3 4 5 and 6 the objective function values of each scheme were normalized to better illustrate the regularity of the data the curves in figs 3 4 5 and 6 show that the imoga solution set was close to the pareto solution set given the influence of the lower level model the solution set was not an exact pareto solution set but rather the result of a mutual compromise between the objective functions of each level 3 3 model comparison to evaluate the performance of the imoga inhpm the model described in section 2 6 1 was used for comparison and the algorithm s nondominated sort method was used formulas 8 and 9 12 were taken as the objective functions to perform nondominated sorting of the scheme set the scheme chosen at the first front after sorting was considered the one to be evaluated in the second stage fig 7 depicts the scheme to be evaluated in the second stage notably the objective function values in the figure are all normalized and represented as interval midpoints the data in fig 7 were used for statistical analysis in fig 7 the number of scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm exceeded those provided by the other three models which indicates that the imoga inhpm can provide a relatively high quality scheme set and offer decision makers a better choice of schemes at the same time for the first front scheme sets in the 9 scenarios the average rms values of all the objective function values of all the schemes provided by the imoga inhpm were 0 651 0 632 0 648 0 633 0 622 0 664 0 682 0 625 0 660 respectively the average rms values of all objective function values of all schemes provided by all comparison models the model without considering the hierarchy of the objective function the model without considering the synergetic objective function and the deterministic model were 0 656 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front 0 651 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front 1 931 0 672 0 683 and 0 633 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front after comparison it was clear that in some scenarios the schemes provided by the comparison model were not chosen in the first round indicating that the relative comparison model was unable to provide a better configuration scheme in terms of rms the rms of the model in this paper was less than that of the comparison model as a result the objective function associated with the configuration scheme provided by the model in this paper was in general low as a result when compared to the comparison model the model presented in this paper is reasonable the above scheme set was chosen to be evaluated in the second stage with the values of formulas 8 and 9 12 serving as the evaluation index and the scheme set was optimized using the interval topsis method table 8 shows the optimal model for each scenario and fig 8 and supplementary fig 1 show the specific water allocation in each plan table 8 shows that the imoga inhpm was the best model for each scenario and weight all of the best schemes selected using the interval topsis method were provided by the imoga inhpm demonstrating that the imoga inhpm has some advantages over the other models furthermore agriculture was the sector with the greatest water shortage among all water demand sections according to the statistics in fig 8 and supplementary fig 1 because the benefits of agriculture are low thus agricultural water is frequently restricted because agriculture is not the main industry in ordos the results are consistent with the city s actual situation ecological water had the lowest water shortage rate of any water demand section which is consistent with the city s efforts to improve the poor ecological environment in general the overall water withdrawal rate was around 28 according to the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan the total water shortage rate in 2025 is also 28 percent according to the comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin the overall water shortage rate in inner mongolia is also 25 which is similar to the calculation results in this paper this demonstrates that the imoga inhpm meets the requirements of the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan at the same time because the water shortage rate calculated in this paper is relative to the midpoint of the water supply and demand interval if measures such as water saving irrigation industrial process transformation and increased water saving awareness can be implemented to strengthen water conservation the actual water demand in the planned year will be reduced as a result the actual water demand in the planned year can be reduced to near the lower limit of the water demand interval and an approximate balance between supply and demand can be achieved in short the imoga inhpm has certain applicability 4 discussion the rms values of the five functions of the scheme set all schemes provided by the imoga inhpm in the nine scenarios were 0 424 0 426 0 431 0 403 0 419 0 432 0 421 0 450 and 0 416 the model s corresponding values without considering the objective function s hierarchy were 0 548 0 552 0 542 0 541 0 534 0 540 0 542 0 586 and 0 529 the comparison shows that the mean value of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm in each situation was lower than the mean value of the model without taking the objective function hierarchy into account for the convenience of illustration the smaller the objective function the better the main reason was that because the objective function is not hierarchized according to the traditional nondominated sorting method as long as a certain part of the objective is dominant the scheme is a non inferior solution but this does not guarantee that the objective function is a non inferior solution at all levels however in the process of solving the imoga inhpm divides the objective function into two levels uses the non inferior scheme of the first level as the basic scheme and selects the non inferior scheme of the second level so that the final scheme is non inferior at all levels as a result the imoga inhpm scheme can account for the objective functions of all levels coordinate upper and lower decision makers and shift the overall trend toward the best outcome the bias values of the second level objective function of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm in the nine scenarios were 0 042 0 061 0 106 0 021 0 043 0 105 0 044 0 149 and 0 041 without taking into account the synergetic objective function the model s corresponding bias values were 0 198 0 065 0 072 0 057 0 083 0 100 0 373 0 296 and 0 109 under various scenarios the second level function bias of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm was lower than that of the model without taking the synergetic objective function into account the main reason for this is that the imoga inhpm considers the synergetic objective at the highest level when the water supply of the conventional and unconventional departments reaches the same level the value of the synergetic objective function reaches its lowest point as a result adding this objective function can make the water supplies of the two departments similar which also means that the overall benefits of the two departments tend to be the same thus the bias of the second level function of the imoga inhpm is minimal due to the need to transform the objective function the number of objective functions will increase resulting in high dimensionality problems that are not conducive to solving multi objective genetic algorithms fellow et al 2014 this finding is also supported by the lower proportion of the scheme set in fig 7 from the deterministic model in nine scenarios the proportion of the scheme set from the deterministic model did not exceed 15 however the imoga does not require the objective function to be transformed does not increase the number of objective functions and does not suffer from high dimensionality issues thus the imoga has distinct advantages given that ordos can be divided into an inner flow area non yellow river basin and an outer flow area yellow river basin the q value of the available water in these two areas is 0 493 indicating that the available water exhibits spatial hierarchical heterogeneity spatial hierarchical heterogeneity is heterogeneity and complexity of the spatial distribution and natural processes and patterns zhang et al 2016 in these two areas as a result the allocation of water resources to these two areas must be optimized the model proposed in this paper was used to study the optimal allocation of water resources in the two sub regions of ordos after dividing it into an inner flow zone and an outer flow zone fig 9 depicts the comparison of the first objective function entropy value of the nine scenarios in the un partitioned and partitioned scenarios after calculation fig 9 shows that spatial elements affect entropy to some extent but whether or not partitioning based on hierarchical heterogeneity is performed has little effect on the first objective function entropy of the model proposed in this study although the water resource allocation schemes developed with and without partitioning have their own advantages and disadvantages the schemes provided by the two account for roughly half of the total in the nine scenarios the lowest proportion of the scheme provided by considering the partition was also 48 8 to some extent this demonstrates that stratification heterogeneity will have no effect on the model proposed in this study which will provide decision makers with high quality water distribution schemes at the same time in the case of partitioning the water obtained in the outflow area is greater than that obtained in the inner flow area which is consistent with the trend that the industry in the ordos outflow area is more developed than that in the inner flow area and requires a large water supply a geographic detector was used to calculate the q value of the water quantity before and after water resource allocation taking partitioning into account a geographic detector is a statistical method for detecting spatial heterogeneity and explaining its cause the calculated result q is frequently used to characterize spatial heterogeneity zhang et al 2016 after comparison it was discovered that water resource allocation reduced the spatial stratification heterogeneity of the water quantities in the inner flow area and outer flow area indicating that water resources allocation can reduce the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of water resources 5 conclusion the research area in this study was ordos city and a synergetic objective function was introduced to reduce competition between conventional and unconventional water supply departments furthermore the objective function was divided into two levels in order to coordinate conflicts of interest between upper and lower decision makers to address the uncertainty of the water allocation system the interval number method was used and an imoga was designed to solve the inhpm to validate the performance the imoga inhpm was compared to models that did not consider the hierarchy of the objective function models that did not consider the synergetic objective function and models that did not consider the deterministic objective function the optimal schemes were all derived from the imoga inhpm under different scenarios and weights indicating that the imoga inhpm has some applicability to the allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources while taking various stakeholders and uncertainties into account although this study provides useful information the imoga inhpm has only been validated in arid northern china ordos is in northern china and has not been validated in southern china where water resources are plentiful the imoga inhpm will be validated in humid regions of china and other countries around the world in future research spatial factors are important factors that affect allocation results in the process of water resource allocation especially when there is spatial hierarchical heterogeneity in the water resource allocation elements however the spatial stratification heterogeneity of water allocation elements is rarely calculated in current research on the optimal allocation of water resources furthermore data collection work in some areas of northwest china was completed late resulting in a relative lack of data in some areas of northwest china work on collecting sub regional water resource data in particular was completed late despite the fact that this study investigated spatial hierarchical heterogeneity it is still in the preliminary exploration stage in the future we plan to collect more zoning data refine the model subdivide the study area further and investigate the spatial hierarchical heterogeneity of related water distribution elements credit

3722,the optimal allocation of water resources is a critical means of resolving the supply demand paradox to optimize the allocation of regional water resources an interval numeral hierarchical planning model inhpm was established to integrate unconventional water resources into the water resource allocation system while simultaneously considering the interests of decision makers at different levels and the uncertainty in a water resource allocation system the inhpm directs conventional and unconventional water supply departments to achieve coordinated development through the objective function of the synergy degree the theory of synergy and the theory of information entropy serve as the theoretical foundations for the objective function of the synergy degree in addition the interval number was introduced to allow the inhpm to address uncertainty in a water resource allocation system the hierarchical planning model served as the primary framework for assisting decision makers in minimizing conflicts of interest among various stakeholders in a water allocation system in this paper the interval multi objective genetic algorithm imoga was established to solve the inhpm as opposed to the previous method of transforming the uncertainty model into a certainty model and solving it imoga inhpm finally using the optimal allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources in ordos northwest china as an example the results and comparison analysis of a case study demonstrate the imoga practicability inhpm s and efficiency keywords coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources hierarchical planning model stakeholders uncertainty interval multi objective genetic algorithm 1 introduction with increased population and excessive economic development the conflict between water supply and demand has widened and become one of the major impediments to the world s sustainable development hu et al 2016 li et al 2017 yue et al 2020 to alleviate the current situation of heavy water supply pressure on conventional water resources unconventional water resources must be introduced into water resource allocation systems as alternative water sources to effectively integrate conventional and unconventional water resources corresponding mechanisms to guide the coordinated allocation of these two water resources must be implemented one of the primary methods for addressing this issue is the optimal allocation of water resources xu et al 2019 the optimal allocation of water resources has the advantages of low cost and ease of operation as a non engineering measure as a result it is critical to develop a coordinated allocation model of conventional and unconventional water resources as well as a suitable solution algorithm li et al 2017 however two issues remain in research on the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources i incorporating unconventional water resources into the conventional water resource allocation system can reduce the water supply pressure on conventional water resources and effectively alleviate the current water shortage situation but there is a lack of a set of methods to guide the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources ii a reasonable solution algorithm for the multi level and multi objective uncertain programming model is still lacking this study evaluates countermeasures based on two aspects to solve the problems incorporating unconventional water resources into water resource allocation systems and uncertain programming model solving percia et al 1997 established a joint management model of conventional water resources surface water groundwater etc and unconventional water resources regional sewage which was successfully applied in the eilat region of southern israel as well as an evaluation model for the configuration results in their research on incorporating unconventional water resources into water resource allocation systems wong et al 2014 proposed a multi objective and multistage optimized management method for the joint application of multiple water sources in addition to considering conventional and unconventional water sources in water demand forecasting jin et al 2012 allocated regional water resources unconventional and conventional to effectively improve the region s overall efficiency by decreasing increasing the proportion of conventional unconventional water resources yang et al 2008 allocated water using unconventional water resources reclaimed water and rainwater and conventional water resources surface water and their findings provided a reference for regional managers han et al 2008 combined unconventional water resources seawater with conventional water resources using dalian city as a case study to discuss water resource allocation with multiple sources and multiple users the final conclusion is that allocating water resources to multiple users and sources is an effective method for achieving sustainable urban water resource use avni et al 2013 investigated the mixing of unconventional water resources desalinated seawater with other conventional water sources to meet the magnesium requirements for drinking water and irrigation water furthermore the model s output can aid in the quality control of water supply systems using tianjin as an example yu et al 2017 developed a cost benefit analysis based combined utilization model of externally transferred water and desalinated water although many scholars have investigated the comprehensive utilization of conventional and unconventional water resources their research has primarily focused on multi resource allocation and has rarely addressed the coordinated allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources entropy theory and synergy theory studies in water resource allocation are insufficient and most existing studies focus on how to coordinate water demand departments from their respective perspectives li et al 2015 gan et al 2013 so far no research has been published on the coordination of unconventional and conventional water resources from the perspectives of water supply departments particularly conventional and unconventional water supply departments because conventional and unconventional water supply departments compete for limited water demand market shares the water allocation system s stability may be jeopardized if this excessive competition is not moderated as a result in order to reduce the vicious competition between conventional and unconventional water supply departments the concept of order must be established in the water supply system the study of various systems composed of a large number of subsystems is known as synergy theory a macroscopic order state is formed under certain conditions due to subsystem synergy as a result synergy is frequently used to assess the degree of order between subsystems luo et al 2014 the order degree of the system on the other hand is determined not only by the order degree of the subsystems but also by the combination of subsystems the degree of collaboration between subsystems combination form can be measured using information entropy theory and the overall system s development direction can be determined singh 2000 as a result the order degree of the entire system can be reflected on the basis of the order degree of the subsystem calculated by synergetic in conjunction with information entropy theory hence this paper constructs a synergetic goal and guides the water supply departments of conventional and unconventional water resources to achieve synergetic development by combining synergetic theory and information entropy theory intelligent optimization algorithms have already been used to solve specific engineering problems wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 but most previous studies in the field of uncertain programming model solving have transformed uncertain models into deterministic models and then solved them cai et al 2011 hou et al 2016 maqsood et al 2005 rosenberg and lund 2009 cai et al 2011 transformed and solved the uncertain nonlinear programming model the uncertain model was transformed into two sub models corresponding to the upper and lower limits of the objective function and then proposed a long term water supply strategy hou et al 2016 used the midpoint of the interval and the length of the interval to represent the interval and the uncertainty was transformed to establish an uncertain planning model for the allocation of water resources in an irrigation area the final solution may provide assistance in allocating water resources in the irrigation area maqsood et al 2005 improved the final application by transforming models according to different scenarios and calculating optimal water resource allocation plans under different scenarios however some research indicates that when compared to the solution algorithm for transforming the uncertain model directly solving the uncertain model can yield more satisfactory results in the process of transforming the uncertain programming model by the solved algorithm it is inevitable to increase the number of objective functions however increasing the number of objective functions results in high dimensional problems making solution difficult gong et al 2010 liu and liu 2020 as a result it is necessary to create an algorithm that can solve the uncertain model directly because the decision makers are organized in a hierarchy the solution algorithm must be able to deal with the model s hierarchy it is critical to note that no optimization algorithm can solve the multi objective uncertain and hierarchical model directly the interval hierarchical multi objective genetic algorithm imoga is based on nsga ii and redefines the method of nondominated sorting and the concept of crowding so that the algorithm proposed in this paper can deal with multilevel and uncertain multi objective models it should be noted that the new nondominated method primarily introduces two enhancements i a dominance relationship based on interval number is proposed which means that the ranking of individuals is determined by each interval objective function of each individual ii in the hierarchical pareto front division method the optimal front is determined first according to the upper level s objectives and then the optimal front of the lower level within the range of the upper level s optimal front is determined according to lower objectives this also gives the imoga two characteristics it can directly solve the uncertain model and divide the pareto front based on decision maker levels these two characteristics allow the imoga to avoid flaws caused by the transformation of uncertain models and to coordinate conflicts of interest among decision makers at all levels the imoga has advantages over previous intelligent optimization algorithms used to solve the uncertainty program model that are simple and intuitive when developing a model for this study the following questions are considered 1 how can an objective function be established to guide conventional and unconventional water supply sectors toward synergy while avoiding excessive competition 2 what method should be used to solve the model based on the preceding discussion this paper develops an interval number hierarchical planning model inhpm and an imoga to solve it to address the uncertainty in the inhpm interval numbers are used in contrast to a probability distribution and a fuzzy set interval numbers only need to know the bounds of the parameters and do not need to know the probability distribution or membership function of the parameters because the probability distribution or membership function requires significant data for calculation huang et al 2001 this greatly reduces the inhpm s demand for a large amount of data and is suitable for areas with less available data this paper takes economic maximization minimum chemical oxygen demand cod emissions and minimum synergetic degree as the upper objective function and maximum comprehensive benefits from conventional and unconventional water supply departments as the lower objective function the imoga is intended to directly solve the inhpm imoga inhpm an imoga is proposed by defining a new nondominated sorting method and a new crowding distance the imoga can solve the model directly avoiding the flaws caused by the transformation of uncertain models at the same time because of the unique nondominated sorting method used in this paper the optimal pareto front of the second level can only be found in the optimal pareto front of the first level ensuring that the final solutions meet the needs of decision makers at all levels meanwhile this reflects the first level s priority the imoga inhpm is validated and compared to the existing model using the optimal allocation of water resources in ordos city in northwest china as an example the findings of this paper are expected to help with the optimal allocation of water resources in other areas the following are the main contributions of this paper 1 from the standpoint of coordination between conventional and unconventional water supply departments information entropy theory and synergetic theory are used to construct the coordination objective function to guide conventional and unconventional water resources to coordination and 2 an algorithm is developed to solve multilevel and multi objective uncertain programming problems 2 methodology because conventional water resources are becoming increasingly scarce research into the coordinated allocation model of conventional and unconventional water resources is required there is uncertainty and a hierarchy of decision makers in the coordinated allocation model as a result this paper employs interval numbers to express the system s uncertainty the allocation system will generate uncertainty due to the effects of human activities climate change current prediction abilities and other factors degefu et al 2017 on the one hand it will affect the model parameters and cause them to float and on the other hand due to the limitation of the prediction level the prediction results will produce errors resulting in uncertainty about the prediction of water supply and demand to represent the hierarchy of decision makers the solution algorithm employs the hierarchical programming model and a special nondominated ranking method the system manager represents the overall interests of the water distribution system while the water supply department represents the individual interests the model is built on two levels to express both group and individual interests the system manager is at the top pursuing the best overall interests and the water supply department is at the bottom pursuing its own maximum benefits 2 1 the first level of inhpm 1 social objective function synergetic degree the synergetic degree objective function was established based on synergetic and entropy theories to guide conventional and unconventional water supply departments toward synergy the order degree is a measure of the order or chaos in a system according to the concept of the order degree in synergy as a result the concept of order degree can be introduced to measure the synergy between various subsystems and to determine the system s evolution direction there are two types of subsystems in this paper s water allocation system conventional and unconventional water supply systems as well as numerous order parameters by integrating the contributions of the order parameters to the order degree of each subsystem the contributions of the order parameters to the order degree of the system can be measured that is the overall performance of a water resource system is determined not only by the order parameter values but also by the combination form of the subsystems furthermore for conventional and unconventional water supply systems the order parameters are chosen as the two systems respective water supply volumes and the order degree of each subsystem can be expressed as follows 1 x con i 1 2 α ij x ij 2 x uncon i 3 7 α ij x ij 3 u con x con x con min x con max x con min 4 u uncon x uncon x uncon min x uncon max x uncon min 5 h s con u con 6 h s uncon u uncon where h scon and h suncon are the order degrees of the conventional and unconventional water supply departments respectively ucon and uuncon are the order degrees of the conventional and unconventional water supply systems respectively concerning the order parameters of the water supply xconmin and xconmax are the minimum and maximum critical thresholds of the order parameter xcon respectively xunconmin and xunconmax are the minimum and maximum critical thresholds of the order parameter xuncon respectively xij is the amount of water supplied from source i to user j which is the decision variable of the inhpm α ij is the water supply relationship coefficient where 0 indicates no supply and 1 indicates a water supply i 1 7 represent surface water groundwater rain karst water coal mine water brackish water and reclaimed water respectively j 1 5 represent the domestic water demand agricultural water demand industrial water demand tertiary industry water demand and ecological water demand respectively due to the limited supply of water resources competition between conventional and unconventional water supply subsystems is unavoidable and the order degrees of various subsystems cannot reach the optimal level at the same time that is an increase in the order degree of one subsystem may result in a decrease in the order degree of others a water resource allocation system s overall order degree is determined not only by the order degree of each subsystem but also by the combination of the order degrees of the subsystems as a result the order degrees of various subsystems are calculated using the following formula based on the principle of information entropy singh 2000 7 h s 1 h s con 2 log 1 h s con 2 1 h s uncon 2 log 1 h s uncon 2 in formula 7 h s is the overall synergetic degree of the system when h s is smaller the synergetic degree between the conventional and unconventional water supply systems is higher li et al 2015 therefore formula 7 can be taken as the objective function of the synergetic degree of the upper level model as shown in formula 8 8 f 1 x ij min h s a water resource system is composited with a conventional water supply department and an unconventional water supply department in this study as an open system it has the characteristics of a dissipative structure such as openness that is far from equilibrium nonlinear interaction and fluctuation phenomena the dissipative structure can be used to identify the system s evolution law that is system entropy h s can describe the evolution direction of a water resource system when a water resource system s entropy value is higher the degree of order is lower conversely when a water resource system s order degree is higher the entropy value is lower by minimizing the entropy value of the water resource system the order parameters of each subsystem can be coordinated to promote the coordination of conventional and unconventional water supply departments in a water resource allocation system the rationale for including information entropy theory is presented in the supplementary materials part i the rationale for including information entropy theory the highest degree of order occurs when x g 2 as discussed in the supplementary materials part i at the same time the conventional and unconventional water supply departments actual water supply quantities are equal at this point thus from the perspective of water allocation system managers the gap between the two departments is the smallest ideal fairness between the two departments is possible unreasonable competition between the two water supply departments is reduced and coordination between the two departments is possible many factors influence the actual water supply process making the above ideal fair state difficult to achieve including equation 8 as one of the objective functions can help to promote coordination and fairness between the two water supply departments while also preventing unreasonable competition the discussion in the supplementary materials part i also shows that equation 7 represents the degree of difference in water supply quantity between the two water supply departments when equation 7 is smaller the difference between the two water supply departments is smaller indicating that the two departments have a more equitable market share and the unreasonable competition between the two departments is reduced indicating that the degree of collaboration between the two departments is greater as a result equation 7 can be interpreted as the degree of coordination between the two water supply departments 2 economic objective function a global manager directs a water allocation system to maximize overall economic benefit by establishing the economic objective function as shown in formula 9 9 f 2 x ij max j 1 5 i 1 7 α ij x ij c ij b ij where c ij and b ij are the benefit coefficient interval and cost coefficient interval of the water supply respectively 3 ecological objective function according to wang et al 2019 the minimum cod emissions are used as the ecological objective function of the upper level model which can reflect the principle of sustainability as shown in formula 10 10 f 3 x ij min j 1 5 i 1 7 0 01 d i p i α ij x ij where dj is the concentration of cod per unit sewage discharge of the jth user in mg l pj is the sewage discharge coefficient of the jth user 2 2 the second level of inhpm the second level decision makers are made up of conventional and unconventional water supply departments and the two departments compete for the limited water demand market in the following ways the maximum comprehensive benefit objective of the water supply department can be divided into two categories namely conventional water resources with the greatest comprehensive benefit and unconventional water resources with the greatest comprehensive benefit 11 f 4 x con max x con l β conj 12 f 5 x uncon max x uncon l β uncon j where xl con and xl uncon refer to the actual amounts of water available to conventional and unconventional water supply departments under the guidance of the upper level managers which can be obtained through formulas 13 and 14 respectively 13 x con l i 1 2 α ij x ij 14 x uncon l i 3 7 α ij x ij where βconj is the comprehensive benefit coefficient of the conventional water supply which can be obtained from formula 15 zhang 2017 ahmad et al 2018 15 β con j 1 m max m j j 1 5 1 m max m j where mj is the serial number of the priority of the water supply for users mj 1 5 represent the water use serial numbers of industry tertiary industry domestic ecology and agriculture mmax 5 is the maximum order number of the department similarly the comprehensive benefit coefficient of unconventional water supply βunconj can be obtained the difference is that mj 1 5 represents industry ecology agriculture domestic and tertiary industries for unconventional water resources 2 3 constraints the main constraints include water supply water demand non negative and water quality constraints water supply constraints 16 j 1 5 α ij x ij c i 17 c i c i 1 l c i 1 l water demand constraints 18 0 5 b j i 1 7 α ij x ij b j 19 b j b i 1 l b i 1 l non negative constraints 20 0 x ij water quality constraints 21 j 1 5 i 1 7 0 01 d i p i α ij x ij d where c i is the interval of the available water supply of the ith water source ci is the available water supply of the type i water source l is the range of available water water demand which reflects the uncertainty of available water water demand and is provided by decision making based on experience b j is the interval of the water demand of the jth user and bj is the water demand of the jth user d is the upper limit of cod allowed to be discharged in the study area according to the inhpm when addressing the two types of variables i e the water supply quantity of conventional and unconventional water supply departments this paper constructs a synergetic objective to guide the two water supply departments to carry out benign competition and avoid conflict in order to realize collaboration the conflict between multi objective functions is primarily reflected in three aspects the conflict between the first and second levels of the objective function and the conflict between the two levels of the objective function this paper develops a multi objective programming model to find a pareto set for the conflicts in the first two aspects in a pareto set as long as a target value is in the dominant position the corresponding water allocation solution can be identified as a non inferior solution such that the interests represented by each decision maker can be reflected a hierarchical programming model is used to express the interest of the objective function at each level when there is a conflict in the objective function between different levels simultaneously when the imoga is used the second level optimal solution can only be found in the first level optimal solution as a result the final scheme not only meets the interests represented by each level s objective function but also reflects the priority of the first level the main cause of disagreements among water users is that their basic water requirements cannot be met as a result in order to coordinate water conflicts among water users atef et al 2019 water supply departments must do their best to meet the water needs of the water users this article employs two measures to resolve disputes between water users the first measure is to set the water supply department at the second level to maximize the comprehensive benefits as mentioned above this can reflect the interests of the water supply department however at the same time the addition of the second level can promote a larger water supply for the water use department once the water supply department provides more water the water demand of the water users will be better met as users receive more water however certain problems will still exist that is the distribution of the amount of water supplied is not uniform which will make some water users unable to obtain the minimum water supply therefore this study has set constraints on the minimum water demand of each user 18 which is also the second measure 2 4 model solution uncertainty nonlinearity non differentiability a double leveled structure and a multi objective nature characterize the inhpm this model cannot be solved using the traditional analytical or numerical calculation methods cui et al 2017 the intelligent optimization algorithm is used to solve the inhpm because it has lower requirements for the objective function and constraints nabaei et al 2018 the inhpm s objective function includes uncertain factors and the objective functions are divided into levels the problem is an interval uncertain hierarchical multi objective problem that the imoga can solve in addition the penalty function method and the probability method are used to address the inhpm s constraints the imoga algorithm is based on the nsga ii algorithm the nsga ii algorithm is first introduced to facilitate the introduction of the imoga see supplementary material part ii process of nsga ii the nsga ii algorithm s nondominated sorting method and crowding distance are primarily aimed at solving a single level deterministic model the inhpm differs from the traditional single level deterministic model in two ways the hierarchy and the uncertainty of the objective function as a result corresponding algorithms must be designed with these two characteristics in mind that is in addition to improving the nsga ii algorithm s original nondominated sorting method and crowding distance the new algorithm can solve the uncertainty hierarchical planning model 2 4 1 algorithm design for the uncertainty of the objective function previously uncertainty in multi objective problems was generally transformed into determinism this approach however has some flaws the imoga was created to address this issue the method of nondominated sorting and the calculation of the crowding distance distinguish this method from the conventional multi objective genetic algorithm e g nsga ii the interval number is used in this paper to represent uncertainty in the water allocation system thus the value of the objective function in the inhpm is an interval number however because interval numbers cannot be directly compared the magnitude of the interval number more specifically its order relation is defined for the interval an individual represents a solution in the pareto solution set numbers a a and b b let c be the maximum of a a b and b and let c be the second largest of a a b and b when d a c d a c d a c d b c is greater than 0 5 a a is greater than b b where 22 d a c a c 2 a c 2 23 d b c b c 2 b c 2 for individual a and individual b let their objective functions be a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a m a m and b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b m b m respectively a is superior to b when all of a s objective functions are less than those of b assuming that a smaller objective function is better when all of a s objective functions exceed those of b b is superior to a when neither of the preceding scenarios occurs a and b are on the same side when an individual is not dominated by other individuals the individual is at the first front and when an individual is not dominated by other individuals except for the individuals in the first front then the individual is at the second front the individuals in other fronts can be identified in a similar manner in the imoga formula 24 is used to calculate the crowding distance rdistance of individual l 2 24 r dis tan c e l 2 i s b o u n d a r y s o l u t i o n k 1 3 d f k r 1 f k r 1 d f k max f k min otherwise where fr 1 k and fr 1 k represent the kth objective function values of the r 1 th and r 1 th individuals in the sorted set respectively fmax k and fmin k represent the maximum and minimum values of the kth objective function respectively liu and liu 2020 d is the distance between objective values which can be calculated by referring to formula 22 2 4 2 algorithm design for the hierarchy of the objective function when the level of a decision maker s objective function is higher in the hierarchical multi objective planning model it must be met first however the lower level s objective function can only obtain its own optimization if the upper level s optimal objective function is optimal as a result the nondominated sorting method described below was devised ⅰ based on the objective function of the first level calculate the objective function first level value of the individual and sort the results according to the nondominated sorting method in 2 4 1 to obtain each front f1 f2 fi fe and calculate the crowding distance of each individual in the same front ⅱ taking the individuals in the first front f1 as the research object and based on the objective function of the second level calculate the objective function second level value of the individuals in f1 and sort the results according to the nondominated sorting method described in 2 4 1 to obtain the subfront f1 1 f2 1 fe1 1 under the first front the subfront f1 i f2 i fei i of any front fi can be obtained in the same way notably in fj i i represents the number of the main front and j represents the number of the subfront iii after obtaining all subfronts that correspond to the front f1 f2 fi fe sort all individuals according to the following principles individual sort position increases as the number of main fronts decreases when the number of subfronts is smaller for a given main front number the individual sort position is higher when the number of main fronts and subfronts of two individuals are equals the two individuals are sorted into the same front the above nondominant sorting and crowding distance calculation methods are replaced by the nondominant sorting and crowding distance calculation methods of the nsga ⅱ to obtain the imoga 2 4 3 constraint handling the penalty function method and the possibility degree method can be used to process the constraints in the inhpm the penalty function method searches within the feasible region while the constraint boundary functions as a wall the penalty function value is very close to the optimal value when the current solution is far from the constraint boundary otherwise the penalty function value is close to infinity please see nemati s work for more information nemati et al 2017 the possibility degree method proposes the concept of comparing interval numbers in situations where the intervals have intersecting parts and determines the relationship between the intervals under a certain degree of possibility β please see nakahara s work for more information nakahara et al 1992 the specific algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the first front of the second level can only be generated in the first front of the first level thus the final scheme can meet the interests of decision makers at both levels to the greatest extent possible while also ensuring the priority of decision makers at the first level which is also an example of coordinating conflicts of interest between the upper and lower levels 2 5 scenario setting the scenario setting method can assist the final decision maker in better understanding the optimal allocation scheme under various scenarios and in making subsequent decisions as a result this article is based on the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan s point forecast results of future water supply and demand and increases the interval radius to express the forecast s uncertainty when dealing with uncertainty in a model the modeling developer hopes to quantify the uncertainty using a specific method incorporate it into the model and then perform modeling and calculation the above method is the most ideal method and it can be implemented using probability distributions or fuzzy sets realizing the preceding process using probability distributions or fuzzy sets necessitates a large amount of data in order to build a model which is difficult to achieve in practice as a result the modeler may be unable to quantify the uncertainty to a precise value however the modeling developer can estimate a swing range such that the true value after being affected by uncertain factors falls within this interval in this article l is used to characterize the radius of change of the interval to realize estimation to the future value affected by uncertain factors such as future water supply and water demand it should be noted that this range cannot be too narrow as this could cause the true value to fall outside of the range simultaneously as l increases so does the length of the interval allowing for more cases to be considered a larger l on the other hand will result in a significant increase in configuration costs due to low probability events as a result it is also critical to select a suitable range which necessitates actual staff selecting the range based on experience multiple ranges are established to facilitate comparison and selection by the staff the range l combined with β are the scenario described in the text and the final configuration calculation is performed to provide a reference for the actual staff s decision making the possibility β represents the degree to which the model satisfies the uncertainty constraint which will also have an impact on the final water allocation result thus it must also be considered in the inhpm different scenarios were created in this paper based on the probability β of the possibility degree method and the uncertainty of water supply and demand l to seek the optimal water allocation results in each scenario and provide support for the final decision maker s decision 2 6 model evaluation 1 scheme settings the following models were used to compare the performance of the imoga inhpm the model without considering the hierarchy of the objective function the model without considering the synergetic objective function and the deterministic model the specifics are as follows most traditional models of optimal water allocation do not hierarchize the objective function xu et al 2013 the model that did not consider the hierarchy of the objective function was the same as the objective function of the imoga inhpm but the objective function was not hierarchized this model could be compared to imoga inhpm to ascertain the effect of the objective function hierarchy on overall performance without taking into account the synergetic objective function the model omitted formula 8 this model could be used to compare to imoga inhpm to ascertain the effect of incorporating a synergetic objective function on overall performance in the past the most common solution for uncertain models was to convert them into deterministic models please see jiang s work for more information on the specific procedure jiang et al 2008 the imoga inhpm does not perform this transformation which is the only difference between it and the deterministic model the deterministic model could be used as a comparison model to validate the impact of transformation on overall performance 2 evaluation method in reality decision makers represent diverse interests which frequently clash aside from that there are levels of objective functions that represent all parties interests so a good water allocation scheme can simultaneously coordinate all parties interests maximize their satisfaction and conform to the hierarchy of objective functions this idea inspired the following evaluation methods the scheme sets generated by the four models described above were evaluated and sorted using the imoga s nondominated sorting method the scheme chosen at the first front after sorting was considered the one to be evaluated in the second stage because the schemes to be evaluated in the second stage were in the first stage these evaluation schemes were most in line with the interests of upper and lower level decision makers as a result the next step was to choose the best scheme that satisfied the overall interest relationship the values of the second stage evaluation scheme s objective functions 8 and 9 12 were used as indicators different weights were assigned based on the level of the indicators and the interval topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method was used to evaluate each plan and select the best results the interval topsis method was developed by combining the concept of interval numbers with the traditional topsis method in this paper the interval topsis method s details are largely consistent with those of the traditional topsis method please see hwang s work for more information on the topsis method hwang et al 1981 the differences include the selection of the best and worst solutions as well as the calculation of the distance formula the smallest interval was identified as the optimal solution and the largest interval was identified as the worst solution by comparing the magnitudes of the intervals one by one using the method described in section 2 4 1 formula 22 was used to replace the topsis method s traditional euclidean distance with a new distance formula the rest of the procedure followed the traditional topsis method the topsis method ranks evaluation objects based on their comprehensive score the evaluation object is better when the comprehensive score is higher please consult the literature for the comprehensive score calculation method hwang et al 1981 3 application to validate the rationality of the imoga inhpm this study used ordos city in the inner mongolia autonomous region as an example ordos is located in the southwestern inner mongolia autonomous region in the hinterlands of the ordos plateau in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and has an area of 86 752 km2 fig 2 depicts a map of the research site the area suffers from a scarcity of water resources and the conventional water supply is under severe strain surface water and groundwater account for 40 3 and 55 9 of total water supply respectively with other water sources accounting for less than 4 of total supply unconventional water resources in the region have great potential yang et al 2014 and can be used to relieve pressure on the conventional water supply as a result the share of unconventional water supply can be increased to achieve synergy in the allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources the study area is in northwestern china as shown in fig 2 water resources are scarce in northwest china all year yaning 2014 so the available water supply in ordos is limited furthermore ordos has a relatively developed economy with the highest per capita gdp of any chinese city a high water demand and significant water supply pressure because industry is still developing in the study area the potential for unconventional water resources is significant unconventional water resources can be used as alternative source to relieve pressure on the traditional water supply 3 1 parameter determination the benefits and costs of water supply were calculated using zhang s work zhang 2017 and the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan as shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively tables 3 and 4 show the water supply and demand for ordos in 2025 based on the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan table 5 also shows the relationship coefficient between water resources and water use departments the water supply relationship coefficient based on water quality and the needs of each water user table 6 displays the cod concentration and sewage discharge coefficient table 7 shows the total benefit coefficients of conventional and unconventional water supplies as shown in table 7 the overall benefits of unconventional water resources are the same for each sector this is due to the fact that the primary goal of establishing this parameter is to reflect that unconventional water resources will supply water to high yield water use departments through competition this study assumed that as long as each unconventional water resource wins more shares of high yield water departments the overall benefits of such water sources will be greater because the ranking of their outputs is fixed for the five water departments in this paper the comprehensive benefit coefficient of unconventional water resources for each water use sector is the same at the same time many studies show that different water supply departments have the same water supply order zhang 2017 ahmad et al 2018 in this study β and l were set to 0 4 0 1 0 4 0 15 0 4 0 2 0 5 0 15 0 5 0 2 0 5 0 15 0 5 0 2 0 6 0 1 0 6 0 15 and 0 6 0 2 3 2 calculation of the results the inhpm was calculated using the data and equations 1 21 and the imoga was used to solve the problem the results are depicted in figs 3 4 5 and 6 the objective function values of each scheme were normalized to better illustrate the regularity of the data the curves in figs 3 4 5 and 6 show that the imoga solution set was close to the pareto solution set given the influence of the lower level model the solution set was not an exact pareto solution set but rather the result of a mutual compromise between the objective functions of each level 3 3 model comparison to evaluate the performance of the imoga inhpm the model described in section 2 6 1 was used for comparison and the algorithm s nondominated sort method was used formulas 8 and 9 12 were taken as the objective functions to perform nondominated sorting of the scheme set the scheme chosen at the first front after sorting was considered the one to be evaluated in the second stage fig 7 depicts the scheme to be evaluated in the second stage notably the objective function values in the figure are all normalized and represented as interval midpoints the data in fig 7 were used for statistical analysis in fig 7 the number of scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm exceeded those provided by the other three models which indicates that the imoga inhpm can provide a relatively high quality scheme set and offer decision makers a better choice of schemes at the same time for the first front scheme sets in the 9 scenarios the average rms values of all the objective function values of all the schemes provided by the imoga inhpm were 0 651 0 632 0 648 0 633 0 622 0 664 0 682 0 625 0 660 respectively the average rms values of all objective function values of all schemes provided by all comparison models the model without considering the hierarchy of the objective function the model without considering the synergetic objective function and the deterministic model were 0 656 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front 0 651 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front 1 931 0 672 0 683 and 0 633 with all schemes provided by the comparison model not selected in the first front after comparison it was clear that in some scenarios the schemes provided by the comparison model were not chosen in the first round indicating that the relative comparison model was unable to provide a better configuration scheme in terms of rms the rms of the model in this paper was less than that of the comparison model as a result the objective function associated with the configuration scheme provided by the model in this paper was in general low as a result when compared to the comparison model the model presented in this paper is reasonable the above scheme set was chosen to be evaluated in the second stage with the values of formulas 8 and 9 12 serving as the evaluation index and the scheme set was optimized using the interval topsis method table 8 shows the optimal model for each scenario and fig 8 and supplementary fig 1 show the specific water allocation in each plan table 8 shows that the imoga inhpm was the best model for each scenario and weight all of the best schemes selected using the interval topsis method were provided by the imoga inhpm demonstrating that the imoga inhpm has some advantages over the other models furthermore agriculture was the sector with the greatest water shortage among all water demand sections according to the statistics in fig 8 and supplementary fig 1 because the benefits of agriculture are low thus agricultural water is frequently restricted because agriculture is not the main industry in ordos the results are consistent with the city s actual situation ecological water had the lowest water shortage rate of any water demand section which is consistent with the city s efforts to improve the poor ecological environment in general the overall water withdrawal rate was around 28 according to the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan the total water shortage rate in 2025 is also 28 percent according to the comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin the overall water shortage rate in inner mongolia is also 25 which is similar to the calculation results in this paper this demonstrates that the imoga inhpm meets the requirements of the ordos city water resources sustainable utilization plan at the same time because the water shortage rate calculated in this paper is relative to the midpoint of the water supply and demand interval if measures such as water saving irrigation industrial process transformation and increased water saving awareness can be implemented to strengthen water conservation the actual water demand in the planned year will be reduced as a result the actual water demand in the planned year can be reduced to near the lower limit of the water demand interval and an approximate balance between supply and demand can be achieved in short the imoga inhpm has certain applicability 4 discussion the rms values of the five functions of the scheme set all schemes provided by the imoga inhpm in the nine scenarios were 0 424 0 426 0 431 0 403 0 419 0 432 0 421 0 450 and 0 416 the model s corresponding values without considering the objective function s hierarchy were 0 548 0 552 0 542 0 541 0 534 0 540 0 542 0 586 and 0 529 the comparison shows that the mean value of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm in each situation was lower than the mean value of the model without taking the objective function hierarchy into account for the convenience of illustration the smaller the objective function the better the main reason was that because the objective function is not hierarchized according to the traditional nondominated sorting method as long as a certain part of the objective is dominant the scheme is a non inferior solution but this does not guarantee that the objective function is a non inferior solution at all levels however in the process of solving the imoga inhpm divides the objective function into two levels uses the non inferior scheme of the first level as the basic scheme and selects the non inferior scheme of the second level so that the final scheme is non inferior at all levels as a result the imoga inhpm scheme can account for the objective functions of all levels coordinate upper and lower decision makers and shift the overall trend toward the best outcome the bias values of the second level objective function of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm in the nine scenarios were 0 042 0 061 0 106 0 021 0 043 0 105 0 044 0 149 and 0 041 without taking into account the synergetic objective function the model s corresponding bias values were 0 198 0 065 0 072 0 057 0 083 0 100 0 373 0 296 and 0 109 under various scenarios the second level function bias of the scheme set provided by the imoga inhpm was lower than that of the model without taking the synergetic objective function into account the main reason for this is that the imoga inhpm considers the synergetic objective at the highest level when the water supply of the conventional and unconventional departments reaches the same level the value of the synergetic objective function reaches its lowest point as a result adding this objective function can make the water supplies of the two departments similar which also means that the overall benefits of the two departments tend to be the same thus the bias of the second level function of the imoga inhpm is minimal due to the need to transform the objective function the number of objective functions will increase resulting in high dimensionality problems that are not conducive to solving multi objective genetic algorithms fellow et al 2014 this finding is also supported by the lower proportion of the scheme set in fig 7 from the deterministic model in nine scenarios the proportion of the scheme set from the deterministic model did not exceed 15 however the imoga does not require the objective function to be transformed does not increase the number of objective functions and does not suffer from high dimensionality issues thus the imoga has distinct advantages given that ordos can be divided into an inner flow area non yellow river basin and an outer flow area yellow river basin the q value of the available water in these two areas is 0 493 indicating that the available water exhibits spatial hierarchical heterogeneity spatial hierarchical heterogeneity is heterogeneity and complexity of the spatial distribution and natural processes and patterns zhang et al 2016 in these two areas as a result the allocation of water resources to these two areas must be optimized the model proposed in this paper was used to study the optimal allocation of water resources in the two sub regions of ordos after dividing it into an inner flow zone and an outer flow zone fig 9 depicts the comparison of the first objective function entropy value of the nine scenarios in the un partitioned and partitioned scenarios after calculation fig 9 shows that spatial elements affect entropy to some extent but whether or not partitioning based on hierarchical heterogeneity is performed has little effect on the first objective function entropy of the model proposed in this study although the water resource allocation schemes developed with and without partitioning have their own advantages and disadvantages the schemes provided by the two account for roughly half of the total in the nine scenarios the lowest proportion of the scheme provided by considering the partition was also 48 8 to some extent this demonstrates that stratification heterogeneity will have no effect on the model proposed in this study which will provide decision makers with high quality water distribution schemes at the same time in the case of partitioning the water obtained in the outflow area is greater than that obtained in the inner flow area which is consistent with the trend that the industry in the ordos outflow area is more developed than that in the inner flow area and requires a large water supply a geographic detector was used to calculate the q value of the water quantity before and after water resource allocation taking partitioning into account a geographic detector is a statistical method for detecting spatial heterogeneity and explaining its cause the calculated result q is frequently used to characterize spatial heterogeneity zhang et al 2016 after comparison it was discovered that water resource allocation reduced the spatial stratification heterogeneity of the water quantities in the inner flow area and outer flow area indicating that water resources allocation can reduce the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of water resources 5 conclusion the research area in this study was ordos city and a synergetic objective function was introduced to reduce competition between conventional and unconventional water supply departments furthermore the objective function was divided into two levels in order to coordinate conflicts of interest between upper and lower decision makers to address the uncertainty of the water allocation system the interval number method was used and an imoga was designed to solve the inhpm to validate the performance the imoga inhpm was compared to models that did not consider the hierarchy of the objective function models that did not consider the synergetic objective function and models that did not consider the deterministic objective function the optimal schemes were all derived from the imoga inhpm under different scenarios and weights indicating that the imoga inhpm has some applicability to the allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources while taking various stakeholders and uncertainties into account although this study provides useful information the imoga inhpm has only been validated in arid northern china ordos is in northern china and has not been validated in southern china where water resources are plentiful the imoga inhpm will be validated in humid regions of china and other countries around the world in future research spatial factors are important factors that affect allocation results in the process of water resource allocation especially when there is spatial hierarchical heterogeneity in the water resource allocation elements however the spatial stratification heterogeneity of water allocation elements is rarely calculated in current research on the optimal allocation of water resources furthermore data collection work in some areas of northwest china was completed late resulting in a relative lack of data in some areas of northwest china work on collecting sub regional water resource data in particular was completed late despite the fact that this study investigated spatial hierarchical heterogeneity it is still in the preliminary exploration stage in the future we plan to collect more zoning data refine the model subdivide the study area further and investigate the spatial hierarchical heterogeneity of related water distribution elements credit

environmental pollution water resources shortage water ecological damage water disaster risk problems caused by urbanization it is a new topic of urban water management to build a scientific system of urban water cycle with the development concept of sponge city on the macro scale sponge city involves the protection of life community such as mountain water forest field lake grass and the optimization of land ecological spatial pattern on the medium scale we should build and improve the urban flood control and drainage water pollution control water ecological restoration and other key projects on the micro scale we need to adjust the runoff organization mode through concave green space green roof permeable pavement and other source facilities so as to realize the source reduction process control system governance of sponge city construction concept green infrastructure gi is broadly defined as the interconnected network of natural and semi natural elements that provide multiple functions and ecosystem services including tree canopy green open spaces green roofs and vertical greenery systems which has been used extensively worldwide and applied in lid koc et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 gi lid often intertwine with a very large number of hydro environmental and socio economic considerations and constraints the combination of artificial neural networks and numerical model such as hydrus 2d 3d are effective tools for modeling non linear systems both planning and optimization can lead to more systematic and strategic approaches to address this multi scale multi parameter problem of practice allocation zhang and chui 2018 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021a b the principle behind gi lid concept connotation involves simulating the natural water cycle to promote the natural accumulation infiltration and purification of urban stormwater thus producing a sustainable urban hydrological cycle goulden et al 2018 the typical lid facilities such as the bioretention rain garden green roof grassed swale etc and the performance of the system is affected by stormwater intensity pollutant types and concentrations mulch media characteristics structural layer parameters and other factors there is a relative lack of research on the fragmentation of regional optimal allocation and the coupling effect of surface water soil and groundwater taghizadeh et al 2021 locatelli et al 2017 how to systematically consider the infiltration interception storage purification reuse and discharge of rainfall runoff and its associated pollutants to achieve integrated stormwater management is the focus of current research most of the studies focused on media configuration structural optimization and simulation evaluation of lid facilities li et al 2021 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 this review provides the authors perspectives on the current state of knowledge highlights the key knowledge gaps in bioretention research which put forward the idea of water soil plant system for rainfall vertical connection more emphasis is placed on systematic research and the sustainability of facility operation 2 urbanization and low impact development technology 2 1 eco hydrological effect of urbanization the development of urbanization has led to changes in hydrological mechanisms including the reduction of groundwater recharge and changes in surface runoff in terms of flow frequency duration and water quality cai et al 2019 due to changes in hydrological mechanisms topography landforms and riverbed morphology have changed not only have river channels narrowed and become shorter but river networks have gradually decreased river runoff regime also affects the biological composition and function of the river ecosystem the influences include changing the environmental factors of habitat and then affecting the distribution and abundance of species and the composition and diversity of aquatic communities arthington et al 2010 the population structure of river species are affected it also affects the flow of material and energy in the river and eventually causes serious deterioration of the river ecology the operation efficiency and stability of the facility are closely related to the hydrological characteristics of the study area for both temperature and precipitation extremes the urban and rural areas exhibit remarkably distinct changes and demonstrate significant urbanization effect which also varies across different climate backgrounds lin et al 2020 the effects of urbanization on climate hydrology and ecological environment are mainly manifested in the impacts of urbanization on rainfall evapotranspiration runoff aquatic ecosystem and water resources zhang et al 2014 the causes of the main influencing factors and their environmental responses are shown in table 1 in the process of natural circulation of precipitation confluence generation and infiltration human beings constantly use the underground water and surface runoff to meet the needs of life and production activities resulting in social water cycle that is the process of water supply drainage and utilization of reclaimed water in industry agriculture domestic ecology and other departments social and natural water cycle are interdependent and influence each other chen et al 2014 under the background of sponge city construction a variety of decentralized technical measures are adopted at the source to storage retention infiltration purification and reuse so as to achieve the purpose of local consumption and reduce runoff generation on the basis of midway transfer and terminal storage therefore the urban water cycle also has a new model fig 1 in terms of runoff volume extreme precipitation is the most direct driving factor of urban flood events and climate change directly leads to the change of global and regional precipitation in order to study the driving factors and disaster mechanism of urban flood disaster under changing environment it is necessary to consider the comprehensive influencing factors which including the city environment that caused the disaster climate change urbanization disaster causing factors flood extreme weather river regulation vegetation damage impervious surface increase inadequate flood control and drainage capacity low lying terrain original river occupation urban disaster carrier people s lives safety people s property security infrastructure etc xu et al 2020 the waterlogging prevention and control system of sponge city construction is composed of three systems including source control system rainwater pipe system excessive rainfall storage drainage system liu et al 2020 based on the statistical method based on 2h window slice expansion of rain pattern and the principle of water balance taking tongzhou beijing as an example under the scenario of 339 85 mm 24 h precipitation with 50 year recurrence interval the precipitation undertaken by those three systems are 34 00 mm 130 70 mm and 175 15 mm respectively in terms of runoff pollution main pollutants include nutrients nitrogen phosphorus etc heavy metals cu zn pb cd cr biodegradable organic matter bod5 cod organic micro pollutants pahs pcbs mtbes endocrine disrupting chemicals pathogenic microorganisms total coliforms escherichia coli barbosa et al 2012 among them nitrogen forms were mainly divided into particulate organic nitrogen pon ammonia nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and dissolved organic nitrogen don phosphorus is mainly in the form of particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp and dp is mainly in the form of soluble reactive phosphorus srp and organic phosphorus dop persistent organic pollutants pops and heavy metals hms in surface runoff are characterized by bioaccumulation persistence and long distance migration at the same time various new toxic organic pollutants have been found in rainfall runoff and surface water especially the increasing number of new organic pollutants and their metabolites which has attracted more and more attention the micropollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs nonylphenols nps octylphenol op which tracked over a 1 year period were detected and quantified in stormwater bressy et al 2012 except for pcbs of solely atmospheric origin the atmospheric contributions only account for less than 10 38 of all micropollutant contamination which suggests the presence of major sources at the catchment level urban pesticide use has a direct impact on surface water quality statewide samples were analyzed for up to 64 pesticides or degradates in california ensminger et al 2013 in water samples all of the bifenthrin malathion fipronil permethrin and λ cyhalothrin detections and most of the fipronil sulfone and cyfluthrin detections were above their lowest us epa aquatic benchmark based on the number of pesticides and exceedances of aquatic benchmarks or the high number of sediment toxicity units pesticides are abundant in california surface waters burant et al 2018 analysis included comparisons of detections number and concentrations of 81 organic contaminants between the residential and commercial sites and within the same site there were 30 organic contaminants that had greater than 50 detections in at least one of the sites meanwhile microplastics plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter are emerging contaminants and their presence in water and soil ecosystems has recently drawn considerable attention because they pose a great threat to entire ecosystems guo et al 2020 the sources of microplastics are mainly classified as primary and secondary microplastics primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured for specific applications which include cosmetic abrasives drug vectors and industrial and engineering applications secondary microplastics originate from larger plastics as they are progressively fragmented into smaller pieces by multiple complex environmental conditions such as wind waves temperature and uv light with the change of runoff organization mode rainfall runoff and its associated pollutants first pass through the source of low impact development facilities environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 and soil environmental quality risk control standard for soil contamination of development land gb 36600 2018 should be considered systematically in the new urban water cycle mode in addition the impervious area is the main source of regional runoff pollutants initial erosion phenomenon which describes that the initial runoff contains the largest amount of pollutants in one precipitation events typical lid facility area calculation methods include 12 7 mm storage method composite cn method scs runoff depth method darcy runoff frequency spectrum method etc sun 2011 most of the designs are based on the initial scour phenomenon and take the water quality control as the main purpose but the initial scour phenomenon may not be significant due to the influence of underlying surface conditions pollutant types and rainfall conditions how to reasonably optimize the design of lid facilities also restricts the implementation of the concept of sponge city 2 2 construction of water soil plant rainwater vertical connection system the hydrological cycle is divided into global hydrological cycle watershed regional hydrological cycle and water soil plant system hydrological cycle the water soil plant system is an interactive system composed of soil plant and moisture movement after entering the system runoff will be intercepted filled infiltration evaporation and discharged under the action of solar energy gravity and the force field generated by soil and plant roots in this study the water soil plant continuum wspc system were established from the perspective of surface runoff and pollutant scour soil infiltration and pollutant transport groundwater recharge and response fig 2 wspc is an interactive system composed of soil vegetation and runoff after entering this system precipitation will intercept low lying land water storage infiltration evaporation discharge and runoff under the action of solar energy earth gravity and the force field generated by soil and vegetation roots and maintain the life process of vegetation the knowledge on characteristics of plants and their corresponding mechanisms in various functions such as plantmicroorganism interactions and relative performance over different functions in bioretention bisides stormwater interception retention infiltration media clogging prevention evapotranspiration and phytoremediation mehmood et al 2021 ni et al 2018a developed an improved hydrological model that can determine the water infiltration rate and suction responses under both single and mixed species one tree and one grass species condition considering accumulation leaching plant uptake and microbial transformation of pollutants in the bioretention media the mass of plant uptake gas volatilization for nitrogen between the start and end of study were estimated jiang et al 2019 taking soil samples and analyzed the changes of pollutants from top to bottom three layers in the bioretention media and the inflow outflow and overflow pollutants during the tests period were calculated based on the material balance typical gi lid facilities consists of aquifer mulch vegetation media gravel drainage layer and its ancillary facilities perforated drainage pipe overflow rainfall grate etc from top to bottom according to the hydrological conditions such as rainfall frequency duration pollutant types and levels in different study areas and considering the regional differences such as soil texture and plant species it is necessary to reasonably design the ponding depth plant collocation mulch types media types and combination of facilities the three emphases of the system are as follows i the randomness and uncertainty of inflow process pollutant types and loads which lead to the conventional and persistent pollution ii in order to optimize the process of water infiltration pollutant degradation and transformation it is necessary to further develop new type media and reasonable combination for economic and lasting operation iii the vertical connection and coupling simulation of water soil plant system are used to study the environmental response for facility media and groundwater 3 lid runoff control mechanism and parameter optimization 3 1 mechanism of decomposition of litter and mulch organic and inorganic materials are used as coverings for lid facilities the commonly used mulches are ceramsite rubber fragments bark and degradable hardwood leaf compost and other organic mulches zhang et al 2019 the main functions of mulch can be summarized as follows 1 to conserve soil moisture and reduce direct transpiration 2 to inhibit the growth of weeds 3 to maintain a more balanced temperature with slow heat conduction so as to keep cool in summer and keep warm in winter 4 to prevent hardening on the surface of media improve water absorption and infiltration and reduce soil erosion 5 to improve the quality of media and the organic mulch can be used as fertilizer supplement after decomposition 6 to improve the landscape ecology in the lid system the organic carbon cycle process and its influencing factors are shown in fig 3 on the one hand co2 released by mulch and litter decomposition is an important part of global carbon cycle on the other hand decomposition products of mulch and litter are also the main source of soil organic matter the decomposition process of different types of mulch and litter such as leaf and fine root litter is affected by their own chemical properties and there are different response behaviors to the changes of environmental factors in addition the different precipitation change patterns decrease increase seasonal distribution rainfall size and frequency are also one of the factors leading to the different decomposition response of mulch and litter how the coupling of multiple environmental factors affects litter decomposition synergistic antagonistic or no interaction is still a lack of in depth and systematic research glassman et al 2018 tan and shen 2020 the decomposition process of coverings and letter affects the media environment organic matter clay minerals ph etc thus affecting plant uptake and respiration microbial decomposition organic matter leaching etc phospholipid fatty acid plfa and molecular biology technology can identify the number and types of microbial functional genes involved in specific metabolic pathways but cannot truly reflect the metabolic pathways of microorganisms nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to study the changes of main chemical components during litter decomposition it has been found that the change of molecular structure during leaf litter decomposition is closely related to the succession of microbial community xia et al 2017 bonanomi et al 2019 therefore the combination of organic chemistry and molecular biology can further explore the relationship between the changes of chemical components of mulch and litter in lid system and the dynamics of microbial community so as to more comprehensively understand the response of decomposition process to environmental changes and the potential biochemical mechanism 3 2 media modification the modification of bioretention media is mainly based on the principles of strong adsorption capacity low desorption rate strong water holding capacity low cost and local easy access in order to increase the infiltration capacity specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the bioretention soil media the modifiers such as biochar peat soil coconut bran vermiculite slag ceramsite fly ash water treatment residues wtrs montmorillonite and other materials are mixed or layered on the basis of the traditional bioretention media at the same time compost paper sawdust wheat straw and wood chips can be used as carbon source in order to promote the denitrification function gao 2014 tian et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 for example because biochar has a highly porous structure and large specific surface area it can affect the soil structure and porosity by changing the pore size distribution body surface area and soil volume weight the increase of porosity and surface functional groups may increase the effective water in the soil thus affecting the soil hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic conductivity therefore biochar is very effective in maintaining high water retention capacity and relatively low soil hydraulic conductivity which can effectively control runoff and stormwater chen et al 2016 ni et al 2018b ni et al 2020 in addition because of its large porosity and high carboxylic acid esterification and aromatization structure it can reduce the leaching of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and adsorb nutrient elements in runoff biochar amended biofiltration systems efficiently remove diverse pollutants such as total nitrogen 32 61 total phosphorus 45 94 heavy metals 27 100 organics 54 100 and microbial pollutants log10 removal 0 78 4 23 from urban runoff biswal et al 2022 it is of great significance for the sustainable development of resources and environment to follow the principles of clean production comprehensive utilization and proper control considering from two aspects of runoff control and pollutant purification general description and testing requirements of media were shown in fig 4 the modification of media is mainly considered from two aspects infiltration capacity hydraulic conductivity ponding depth and surface area and purification capacity basic characteristics of media background content of pollutants biodiversity the hydraulic conductivity is affected by particle size distribution of filter media layer transition layer drainage layer in terms of purification capacity it is necessary to consider the adsorption and interception during rainfall and the plant uptake and biodegradation during rainfall interval in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the energy and resource reuse of solid waste the principles followed mainly include i the recycling value of available materials especially the solid waste residue of industrial and mining enterprises ii the resource utilization of organic solid waste such as composting and biogas production iii avoiding secondary pollution and meeting the requirements of hygiene and bacteriology as the main product of urban demolition construction construction waste not only occupies a lot of land resources but also brings great pollution risk to soil air and water bodies considering the adsorption capacity mechanical properties shrinkage durability and other properties it is used in rainfall infiltration facilities to provide a new way for the recycling of construction waste ng et al 2019 the strength of construction waste is inversely proportional to porosity and aggregate size at the same time cement hydration generates ca oh 2 which increases the alkalinity of concrete selecting suitable alkali resistant plants solving the contradiction between porosity and strength of concrete are the key problems to be solved in the greening application of recycled aggregate from construction waste li 2011 it has been proved that the traditional bioretention media mixed with different proportions of wtrs hardwood bark mulch hbm leaf waste compost lc and river sand have good adsorption effect on phosphorus o neill and davis 2012a o neill and davis 2012b combined with the regional characteristics the preparation of biochar and compost from waste biomass can not only improve the utilization and management of waste biomass help to solve the environmental problems such as waste biomass disposal incineration random emission and greenhouse effect but also be applied to the bioretention media improve the economy of facility construction and strengthen the regulation ability of stormwater runoff in addition researches have adopted loamy sand and sandy loam with high infiltration rate as the best media on this basis in order to increase the water holding capacity and adsorption capacity of media improve the microbial abundance plant growth environment and the improvement and configuration optimization of bioretention tank media have become a research hotspot however the bioretention cell is impacted by intermittent storm runoff and the hydraulic pollution load has strong temporal and spatial variability the improvement of infiltration rate and long term operation of media also increase the risk of pollutant leaching and system clogging therefore quantifying the variation of the function of the bioretention system under the conditions of environmental change and media modification is the key problems to establish an improved bioretention runoff control model and formulate the optimal management measures 3 3 optimization of structural layer parameters lid technology includes a number of different forms of lid facilities such as permeable pavement green roof bioretention cell sunken green space rainfall wetland infiltration pond infiltration well wet pond dry pond reservoir regulating pond grass planting ditch infiltration pipe channel vegetation filter belt initial rainfall disposal facilities etc mohurd 2014 the lid module of stormwater management model swmm provides seven kinds of scattered rainfall disposal technologies including bioretention rain garden green roof permeable pavement permeable channel rainwater bucket and grass planting ditch the structure layers of various facilities include one or more parts of surface layer pavement layer soil layer water storage layer drainage mat drain pipe tao et al 2018 taking the bioretention system as an example the main design parameters affecting its operation efficiency include the kinds of media types and these combination inflow concentration recurrence interval discharge ratio submerged zone height ponding depth infiltration rate emptying time etc based on the soil physical model hydrus 1d for sensitivity parameters identification and media thickness simulation the result showed that media thickness hm empirical parameters n saturated water content θs and saturated conductivity ks are the sensitive parameters that affect water transport and inflow volume v inflow concentration c media thickness hm media isothermal adsorption constant kd are the sensitive parameters for pollutant transport jiang 2020 typical rainfall infrastructure and its key parameters are shown in table 2 there are too many function and form involved in the lid technology the design parameters and calculation methods required by various lid facilities are also different jiang et al 2021 in general on the basis of media improvement appropriate facility surface area scale optimization appropriate aquifer depth regulation and storage capacity optimization media combination mode layered media type thickness optimization and appropriate outlet height of drainage pipe aquifer height optimization to improve denitrification are also the focus of research field scale rain gardens were constructed using a novel biphasic concept involving water movement from a saturated to an unsaturated zone in sequence for increasing retention time of runoff and improving bioremediation the created biphasic rain gardens were highly effective in removing nitrate 91 phosphate 99 atrazine 90 dicamba 92 glyphosate 99 and 2 4 d 90 under high levels of pollution loading with simulated runoff events yang et al 2013 fan et al 2019 designed u type and w type bioretention systems to study the effect on nitrogen purification mechanism each column had a 20 cm ponding depth 40 cm soil layer 20 cm media layer composed of 20 local red soil and 80 fine sand and 20 cm submerged layer however the effect of structure on the purification effect is not significant some scholars also use the form of facilities combination to improve the comprehensive effect of lid facilities tirpak et al 2019 made suspended pavement systems multi functional by designing them to act as subsurface bioretention practices in ultra urban areas by transmitting surface loads to a compacted subbase suspended pavement systems create a matrix of uncompacted soil that promotes tree health through increased root access to oxygen water and nutrients when green roof and sunken lawn were applied in series green roof runoff discharged into sunken lawn compared with discharging stormwater separately the peak flow reduction and retention effect were more significant and with the increasing of rainfall frequency the advantages of discharging stormwater in series were increasingly obvious 4 sustainability of lid facility operation 4 1 lid system clogging clogging is defined as the process of reducing the porosity and permeability of the system due to physical biological and chemical processes which may lead to more frequent overflow events prolonged ponding time weakened runoff control ability and other problems in the green infrastructure system which may affect the landscape and public safety langergraber et al 2003 combined with the research results of facility for advancing water biofiltration fawb 2009 the formation mechanism of system clogging process hydraulic conductivity range and potential issues were shown in fig 5 bioretention is the commonly used lid measure in cluster analysis and it is used both individually and in conjunction with other lids such as permeable pavement green roof swale etc islam et al 2021 experts and scholars optimize the configuration of bioretention cell vegetation type media type and combination form etc to maximize the regulation of runoff and purification of runoff pollutants so as to improve the regulation efficiency and sustainability of bioretention system however with the long term operation of the bioretention system the characteristics of media may change followed by the reduction of water conductivity and treatment effect the vegetation and extent of bioretention cells have an important impact on hydraulic conductivity which also affects the proportion of annual runoff treated by bioretention cell the own scale of system is relatively smaller than the catchment area and the system impacted by high pollution load is more likely to be blocked at the same time plants with well developed roots can limit the decline of hydraulic conductivity caused by blockage therefore appropriate scale design and plant selection are the key factors to limit blockage le coustumer et al 2012 the selection of plants shall meet the following requirements ① select local common greening plants as far as possible and mainly perennial plants in four seasons ② drought resistance and short term flood resistance and the water resistance time shall be greater than two days 3 plants have strong purification ability and pollution resistance and have high nutrient removal rate 4 for xi an area ophiopogon japonicus ryegrass thunbergia alata marigold buxus sinica ligustrum lucidum rosa chinensis jacq etc are suitable the bioremediation methods such as replacing the media adding chemicals inoculating alien microorganisms or transferring into genetic engineering bacteria are costly technically difficult and have certain ecological risks therefore process optimization pretreatment media modification facility configuration and plant design operation management flood season cleaning plant harvesting natural screening and domestication of indigenous microorganisms become economic and feasible technical means weng 2020 however there is a lack of quantitative research on the coupling relationship between the key parameters of the bioretention system and the multiple resistance control technology the comprehensive effects of rainfall conditions operation times and media environment on the clogging of bioretention system need to be further explored the united states environmental protection agency epa and new zealand require that the permeability coefficient of bioretention cell should be above 12 5 mm h 3 47 10 6 m s austria and australia requires that the permeability coefficient should be 36 360 mm h 1 10 5 1 10 4 m s and 50 200 mm h 1 38 10 5 5 55 10 5 m s respectively le coustumer et al 2009 the horton philip and kostiakov infiltration models were selected to compare their accuracy when using for describe the infiltration characteristics of bioretention and the experimental results showed that horton model is fitting well and flexible under different experiment conditions wang et al 2021 for the system with large initial hydraulic conductivity k 200 mm h the infiltration coefficient of the bioretention system decreases obviously with the passage of time which may be caused by sediment deposition and hydraulic compaction on the surface of the system hatt et al 2007 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 it is found that the average infiltration rate of the bioretention soil column decreases to 30 8 of the initial value after about 50 weeks of operation and appropriate particle size distribution is an effective measure to ensure the effectiveness of permeable pores meng et al 2013 in the initial stage of facility operation the bioretention cell needs to meet the design goal of infiltration water holding capacity and pollutant purification capacity with the extension of the operation time it is necessary to further study the particle size distribution of the media the organic inorganic solid content in the pores the adsorption desorption characteristics biological processes microbial degradation plant and animal absorption etc these factors will lead to the variation of facility functions therefore based on the target value of design infiltration rate the design standard should be appropriately improved huang et al 2021 assessed the effects of low infiltration underlying soil and precipitation characteristics on the hydraulic performance of a bioretention cell using swmm the result showed that in order to simultaneously achieve expected reduction goal of both peak flow and runoff volume and make the best comprehensive performance for the bioretention cell under condition of low infiltration underlying soil and heavy storms it requires not only a maintenance action to increase the hydraulic conductivity of soil medium layer but also a drain pipe to be added in the storage layer and meanwhile other lid practices should be combined it is of great significance to study the time varying characteristics of the runoff control efficiency for clarifying the multiple control mechanism of leaching and clogging in the modified media bioretention system 4 2 cumulative effect of runoff pollutants although most of the pollutants in stormwater runoff can be effectively removed by the lid system the removal is mainly due to the adsorption and interception of pollutants in the system hwang et al 2021 with the increase of pollutant accumulation in the system the habitat of the media environmental will change which may cause new pollution therefore it is of great significance to systematically study the accumulation of pollutants and ecological environment risk for the sustainability of facility operation the types and forms of runoff pollutants years of facility operation and the ecological environment of media system determine the speed of facility performance attenuation among them heavy metal pollution sources include automobile exhaust combustion of fossil fuels smoke and dust from metallurgical enterprises wear and tear of tires and brake pads and accumulation of rainfall pipeline deposits heavy metals are difficult to degrade in the environment easy to accumulate in organisms with the characteristics of long lasting pollution wide range of areas and difficult to control therefore heavy metals have a strong harmful effect on the environment and ecosystem which has become one of the hot issues at home and abroad the representative methods applied to soil heavy metal pollution evaluation include single factor index evaluation method nemerow comprehensive pollution index method geoaccumulation index method and ecological hazard index method in addition there are standardization method of introducing enrichment factor fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method combined with fuzzy mathematics theory and modified gray clustering method guan et al 2013 at the same time it was found that 88 97 of the heavy metals imported into bioretention system were captured by soil medium and 2 11 6 could not be captured compared with the heavy metals intercepted by soil the heavy metals enriched in plants accounted for only 0 5 3 3 sun and davis 2007 at present there is a lack of systematic research on the accumulation migration and release of heavy metals in the lid facilities which limits the wide application of these technologies in the field of rainfall resource reuse and groundwater recharge soil enzymes control the material cycle and energy flow of ecosystem which have been widely studied in wetland system forest soil system and farmland soil system however there are few studies on the correlation among enzyme activity modified media species and pollutant contents in bioretention system cui et al 2013 fatemi et al 2016 in the bioretention system pollutant removal is mainly achieved through the physical chemical and biological synergistic effects of media microorganisms and plants during the interval of rainfall events the biological function is the key factor to purify the runoff pollutants the removal of organic matter in the system is mainly through the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter into small molecular inorganic matter by microorganisms and soil enzymes the enzyme activities can directly reflect the microbial activity so soil enzymes and microorganisms promote the material transformation together plants microorganisms and a small number of animals in the system can accelerate the transformation of biodegradable pollutants by secreting specific catalytic enzymes and make them enter the biological nutrition cycle therefore the enzyme activity in bioretention media is an important index to evaluate its purification effect on runoff pollutants at the same time the effect of soil physical and chemical properties on soil enzyme activity is very complex soil physical properties affecting enzyme activity include particle gradation soil moisture air and heat status chemical properties including acidity and alkalinity organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus heavy metals and trace elements the addition of exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus will change the element content in the media and the soil physical and chemical properties ph cation content etc the components of the modified media bioretention system are complex coupled with the impact of intermittent rainfall runoff which can significantly affect soil biomass microbial community composition and microbial activity directly or indirectly affect soil enzyme activity and rainfall runoff regulation efficiency the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen is mainly driven by microorganisms nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification ammoniation and anammox are all important processes in which microorganisms participate in the nitrogen cycle by detecting the abundance of nitrogen functional genes in the system the effects of soil microbial ecosystem on nitrogen removal and transformation were identified anaerobic zone can improve denitrification conditions and retain runoff volume for plant growth but increase the risk of biofilm adhesion and pollutant accumulation in this area it is necessary to study the effect of anaerobic zone on the long term operation of the system by combining the effective porosity and the characteristics of longitudinal moisture content change of media for phosphorus pollutants the mechanism of polyphosphate bacteria on phosphorus was mainly studied under anaerobic aerobic conditions in the internal storage area of bioretention system van der heijden et al 2008 point out that soil microorganisms play an important role in soil organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling organic carbon sequestration and other ecosystem processes they are also important drivers of plant diversity productivity and sustainable land use in terrestrial ecosystems microbial biomass and activity are influenced by climatic factors vegetation organic matter ph and humidity plant and soil samples from eighteen plots of six sites in a wetland were collected to determine the community structure of bacteria and fungi plant functional groups and soil characteristics the results showed that bacterial and fungal diversity at the 0 20 cm soil depth were significantly negatively and positively related to ph respectively kang et al 2021 xia et al 2020 showed that the effect of soil texture on the structure and function of soil microbial community was probably caused by the distribution of organic matter at pore and particle scale soil texture is the second most important factor after soil ph value in the construction of microbial community structure and composition herold et al 2014 studied the effects of soil properties on total phospholipid fatty acid plfa biomass microbial community composition plfa profile and enzyme activities related c n p cycle it was found that the biomass composition and activity of microbial community were strongly affected by soil properties differences in soil properties explained 60 of variation in plfa data and 81 of variation in enzyme activities across regions and land use intensities 5 coupling simulation of runoff soil groundwater 5 1 simulation for runoff soil groundwater behaviours there are many models available in literature that can simulate the runoff soil groundwater behaviors tang et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 the strengths and weaknesses of those hydrological modes are highlighted and compared in table 3 in particular several coupling models have been developed to simulate runoff soil groundwater behaviors mike flood model can be directly coupled with urban storm water network model mike urban urban water system model mike 11 and regional overflow model mike 21 this coupled model can simultaneously simulate water quantity and quality at various scales which can simulate two dimensional surface inundation and more accurately express regional surface water accumulation and flood velocity song 2020 the operation of mike flood is more complicated than swmm model more data input is required and the code cannot be modified for secondary development and upgrading swmm hydrus couples swmm and hydrus model baek et al 2020 swmm simulates the rainfall and surface runoff in the sub catchment which is the input of the lid module in hydrus hydrus is used to simulate the flow of water in the lid soil medium this model can consider not only the moisture content of the soil but also the water pressure and flux in the soil and can simulate lid with a minimum time step of one minute however the soil moisture in the simulation should not be lower than the initial soil moisture in simulation hydrus modflow couples hydrus and modflow which use groundwater level changes as a link a numerical model of soil water was established using hydrus 1d and groundwater model was established using pmwin by combined with the water balance method which can simulate the combination of soil water groundwater and surface groundwater lin 2020 however modflow uses rectangular mesh for subdivision which has deficiencies in the simulation of three dimensional seepage fields of groundwater in complex geological bodies rectangular meshing is not as flexible as finite element triangulation and is not suitable for unsaturated flow problems swmm modflow simulates the surface runoff of lid facilities through swmm to obtain the net permeability the net permeability import the modflow to calculate the groundwater replenishment rate to realize the impact of lid facilities on groundwater huang 2019 swmm modflow can simulate surface hydrological processes and characterize lid facilities but its temporal and spatial matching is not coordinated the potential research topics such as i to consider the indexes of infiltration capacity adsorption capacity and biodiversity comprehensively for media modification ii to further clarify the cumulative effect ecological risk and biodiversity response in the condition of long term operation iii to clarify the runoff regulation mechanism of lid facilities and establish the empirical and mechanism model of water pollutants transport under changing conditions iv to carry out life cycle cost benefit analysis of the whole process of lid facility construction v to build a multi objective optimization urban stormwater management model which considering the coupling of single and regional scale models 5 2 surface runoff and confluence process the surface runoff is mainly characterized by the flow hydrograph of the rainfall outlet which mainly includes the process of surface runoff generation and confluence the former is to calculate the net rainfall process after deducting the surface evaporation and transpiration plant interception water storage and soil infiltration kostiakov model horton model green ampt model etc the latter is to calculate the inflow process when the runoff of each basin is collected to the rainfall outlet the commonly used surface runoff models include comprehensive runoff coefficient method full storage runoff method exponential or parabolic infiltration curve method time variant gain model tvgm etc hu et al 2021 ji et al 2017 the calculation methods of surface confluence include instantaneous unit hydrograph method isochron method nonlinear reservoir algorithm etc the velocity and depth of flow in the pipeline are calculated by saint venant equations the principle of runoff generation and confluence process were shown in the table 4 it is an important subject of infiltration theory to deduce the concrete expression form of infiltration curve at present the infiltration curve can be determined by three ways unsaturated infiltration theory saturated infiltration theory and empirical infiltration curve based on infiltration test more impacts need to be considered under natural conditions infiltration ① relationship between infiltration f0 fc and rainfall intensity i is there a temporal change in rainfall intensity ② infiltration in heterogeneous soils vertical distribution of coarse and fine soils 3 permafrost infiltration is impermeable layer formed 4 slope infiltration the actual rainfall intensity becomes icosα at the same time colloid in soil chemical and biological effects ground cover temperature soil gas content and contaminant concentration etc are also important factors affecting infiltration in the green infrastructure the infiltration process becomes more complicated due to the influence of media combination and facility structure 5 3 migration and fate process of media pollutants it is of great significance to simulate the migration and transformation process of pollutants in soil accurately for soil groundwater pollution control and long term operation of lid facilities sheng et al 2020 constructed a multi microbial degradation kinetic model of single pollutant based on the growth and degradation kinetic mechanism of microorganisms the model described the degradation process of pollutants in soil closer to the real situation and had strong practicability in view of the heterogeneity of soil groundwater strata the complexity of compound pollutant reaction the variability of boundary conditions in typical contaminated sites based on the risk theory multi scale experimental data and big data mining technology a coupling model of mass transfer process at the interface of compound pollutants was constructed combining parallel super computing technology and zero space monte carlo method to quickly solve the coupled model and carry out risk assessment of mass transfer process is the focus of future research teng et al 2020 due to the influence of rainfall conditions operation times and configuration parameters the interaction of influencing factors and the process of compound pollution in the modified media environment of lid facilities are not clear the formation process of pollutant leaching system clogging and its resistance control mechanism operation life risk assessment become the bottleneck of the application of lid technologies the leaching factor is defined as the ratio of the predicted concentration of pollutants in groundwater to that in the upper soil chen et al 2017 when the bioretention system with different modified media is saturated it is assumed that the process of pollutants leaching from soil into groundwater can be divided into three transfer steps ①the distribution equilibrium of pollutants between soil solid phase and infiltration liquid phase ②the pollutants enter deep clean soil with leaching solution and reach the solid liquid distribution equilibrium again 3 when the leaching solution is mixed with the groundwater the pollutants enter the groundwater system and diffuse and dilute considering the media types hydraulic and pollution load impact measuring the saturated hydraulic conductivity of modified media the characteristics of blocking materials at different heights particle size distribution and analyzing the quantitative relationship among infiltration rate hydraulic retention time media effective porosity are effective means to evaluate the life decay process of facilities quantitatively 5 4 groundwater response simulation at present several groundwater numerical model software are widely used including visual modflow feflow gms mt3d visual groundwater etc the numerical simulation of soil and groundwater has achieved mature research methods and supporting software but the coupling numerical simulation of soil groundwater pollutant transport at the interface of soil and groundwater are not clear relatively hpm hydrus package for modflow as a mature coupling module of soil and groundwater flow and solute transport simulation the unsaturated zone hydrus module is associated with the saturated zone modflow model in the coupling process hydrus takes the groundwater depth h calculated in the previous period of modflow as the bottom boundary condition in the next period while modflow takes the bottom seepage calculated by hydrus in this period is taken as the recharge in the next period beegum et al 2018 2019 a large number of researches have been conducted with a major focus on strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater table and environments the distance between the bottom of lid facility and the groundwater table media types and the design of underdrain pipe are the main issues that have be considered zhang and chui 2019 proposed that more tracer studies and variably saturated modeling could be conducted to better understand the flow and solute transport paths inside and beneath lid facility 6 conclusions and research needs climate change rapid urbanization and ecological concerns are all driving the need for innovative stormwater management techniques to mitigate these impacts with the change of runoff organization mode and eco hydrological effect of urbanization water soil plant system for rainfall vertical connection is proposed future research directions were pointed out to make further advances in sponge city construction including the process of mulch litter decomposition and plant growth for lid facilities modified media preparation high adsorption capacity hydraulic conductivity wate holding capacity microbial ecology plant growth support locally accessible the clogging mechanism and pollutant accumulation effect for sustainability of operation coupling simulation of runoff soil groundwater in terms of operation mechanism the combination of organic chemistry and molecular biology can further explore the relationship between the changes of chemical components of mulch litter in media profile and the microbial community dynamics more tracer studies and refined simulation could be conducted to better understand the cumulative effect and risk of pollutants in soil media groundwater recharge and its possible pollution source response in terms of operation persistence considering the characteristics of inflow pollutants and the comprehensive role of plants media and microorganisms the formation process and resistance control mechanism of pollutant leaching and system clogging in the bioretention system should be clarified in addition the operation lifespan and soil groundwater risk assessment should be researched deeply in terms of model simulation on the basis of regional optimal allocation which considering the location area and number of facilities the runoff and confluence model pollutant transport model soil physical model and biodegradation model and groundwater numerical simulation model should be coupled to build stormwater vertical connection system of runoff soil groundwater declaration of competing interest the

3723,the green infrastructure gi low impact development lid facilities aim to control the runoff and its associated pollutants in the context of climate change and accelerated urbanization so as to make the urban development areas as close as possible to the natural hydrological cycle compared with the fragmented facilities construction and research the large scale lid planning require deep going understanding of the impact of lid spatial allocation on surface subsurface hydrologic dynamics and the stability of performance for these facilities with the extension of operation time based on the analysis of eco hydrological effects brought by urbanization the water soil plant continuum wspc system for rainfall runoff under the concept of sponge city is proposed current technical challenges about parameter optimization continuous operation coupling simulation for bioretention facilities are identified and recommendations to overcome them are provided this new concept points out that source form and species of non point source pollutants nsp in particular heavy metals persistent organic pollutants pops and micro plastics in runoff and their risks to bioretention soil media bsm in addition mulch litter and their decomposition process under the influence of weather and rainfall conditions media modification technologies based on solid waste recycling cumulative effects of pollutants and its ecological risks to soil and groundwater simulation and optimization of the structural parameters according to local conditions these four aspects are the bottlenecks of the application for such facilities the current review critically points out future research directions about the attenuation process for infiltration function ecological risk for pollutant accumulation surface soil underground coupling simulation among them the runoff soil groundwater vertical coupling simulation consists of the following three parts surface runoff and confluence model soil pollutant migration and fate model groundwater simulation model and their water balance and energy balance this study will contribute to a greater understanding and key knowledge gaps in the optimization and long term operation for gi lid system keywords sponge city low impact development vertical connection long term operation coupled simulation 1 introduction in the face of water environmental pollution water resources shortage water ecological damage water disaster risk problems caused by urbanization it is a new topic of urban water management to build a scientific system of urban water cycle with the development concept of sponge city on the macro scale sponge city involves the protection of life community such as mountain water forest field lake grass and the optimization of land ecological spatial pattern on the medium scale we should build and improve the urban flood control and drainage water pollution control water ecological restoration and other key projects on the micro scale we need to adjust the runoff organization mode through concave green space green roof permeable pavement and other source facilities so as to realize the source reduction process control system governance of sponge city construction concept green infrastructure gi is broadly defined as the interconnected network of natural and semi natural elements that provide multiple functions and ecosystem services including tree canopy green open spaces green roofs and vertical greenery systems which has been used extensively worldwide and applied in lid koc et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 gi lid often intertwine with a very large number of hydro environmental and socio economic considerations and constraints the combination of artificial neural networks and numerical model such as hydrus 2d 3d are effective tools for modeling non linear systems both planning and optimization can lead to more systematic and strategic approaches to address this multi scale multi parameter problem of practice allocation zhang and chui 2018 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021a b the principle behind gi lid concept connotation involves simulating the natural water cycle to promote the natural accumulation infiltration and purification of urban stormwater thus producing a sustainable urban hydrological cycle goulden et al 2018 the typical lid facilities such as the bioretention rain garden green roof grassed swale etc and the performance of the system is affected by stormwater intensity pollutant types and concentrations mulch media characteristics structural layer parameters and other factors there is a relative lack of research on the fragmentation of regional optimal allocation and the coupling effect of surface water soil and groundwater taghizadeh et al 2021 locatelli et al 2017 how to systematically consider the infiltration interception storage purification reuse and discharge of rainfall runoff and its associated pollutants to achieve integrated stormwater management is the focus of current research most of the studies focused on media configuration structural optimization and simulation evaluation of lid facilities li et al 2021 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 this review provides the authors perspectives on the current state of knowledge highlights the key knowledge gaps in bioretention research which put forward the idea of water soil plant system for rainfall vertical connection more emphasis is placed on systematic research and the sustainability of facility operation 2 urbanization and low impact development technology 2 1 eco hydrological effect of urbanization the development of urbanization has led to changes in hydrological mechanisms including the reduction of groundwater recharge and changes in surface runoff in terms of flow frequency duration and water quality cai et al 2019 due to changes in hydrological mechanisms topography landforms and riverbed morphology have changed not only have river channels narrowed and become shorter but river networks have gradually decreased river runoff regime also affects the biological composition and function of the river ecosystem the influences include changing the environmental factors of habitat and then affecting the distribution and abundance of species and the composition and diversity of aquatic communities arthington et al 2010 the population structure of river species are affected it also affects the flow of material and energy in the river and eventually causes serious deterioration of the river ecology the operation efficiency and stability of the facility are closely related to the hydrological characteristics of the study area for both temperature and precipitation extremes the urban and rural areas exhibit remarkably distinct changes and demonstrate significant urbanization effect which also varies across different climate backgrounds lin et al 2020 the effects of urbanization on climate hydrology and ecological environment are mainly manifested in the impacts of urbanization on rainfall evapotranspiration runoff aquatic ecosystem and water resources zhang et al 2014 the causes of the main influencing factors and their environmental responses are shown in table 1 in the process of natural circulation of precipitation confluence generation and infiltration human beings constantly use the underground water and surface runoff to meet the needs of life and production activities resulting in social water cycle that is the process of water supply drainage and utilization of reclaimed water in industry agriculture domestic ecology and other departments social and natural water cycle are interdependent and influence each other chen et al 2014 under the background of sponge city construction a variety of decentralized technical measures are adopted at the source to storage retention infiltration purification and reuse so as to achieve the purpose of local consumption and reduce runoff generation on the basis of midway transfer and terminal storage therefore the urban water cycle also has a new model fig 1 in terms of runoff volume extreme precipitation is the most direct driving factor of urban flood events and climate change directly leads to the change of global and regional precipitation in order to study the driving factors and disaster mechanism of urban flood disaster under changing environment it is necessary to consider the comprehensive influencing factors which including the city environment that caused the disaster climate change urbanization disaster causing factors flood extreme weather river regulation vegetation damage impervious surface increase inadequate flood control and drainage capacity low lying terrain original river occupation urban disaster carrier people s lives safety people s property security infrastructure etc xu et al 2020 the waterlogging prevention and control system of sponge city construction is composed of three systems including source control system rainwater pipe system excessive rainfall storage drainage system liu et al 2020 based on the statistical method based on 2h window slice expansion of rain pattern and the principle of water balance taking tongzhou beijing as an example under the scenario of 339 85 mm 24 h precipitation with 50 year recurrence interval the precipitation undertaken by those three systems are 34 00 mm 130 70 mm and 175 15 mm respectively in terms of runoff pollution main pollutants include nutrients nitrogen phosphorus etc heavy metals cu zn pb cd cr biodegradable organic matter bod5 cod organic micro pollutants pahs pcbs mtbes endocrine disrupting chemicals pathogenic microorganisms total coliforms escherichia coli barbosa et al 2012 among them nitrogen forms were mainly divided into particulate organic nitrogen pon ammonia nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and dissolved organic nitrogen don phosphorus is mainly in the form of particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp and dp is mainly in the form of soluble reactive phosphorus srp and organic phosphorus dop persistent organic pollutants pops and heavy metals hms in surface runoff are characterized by bioaccumulation persistence and long distance migration at the same time various new toxic organic pollutants have been found in rainfall runoff and surface water especially the increasing number of new organic pollutants and their metabolites which has attracted more and more attention the micropollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs nonylphenols nps octylphenol op which tracked over a 1 year period were detected and quantified in stormwater bressy et al 2012 except for pcbs of solely atmospheric origin the atmospheric contributions only account for less than 10 38 of all micropollutant contamination which suggests the presence of major sources at the catchment level urban pesticide use has a direct impact on surface water quality statewide samples were analyzed for up to 64 pesticides or degradates in california ensminger et al 2013 in water samples all of the bifenthrin malathion fipronil permethrin and λ cyhalothrin detections and most of the fipronil sulfone and cyfluthrin detections were above their lowest us epa aquatic benchmark based on the number of pesticides and exceedances of aquatic benchmarks or the high number of sediment toxicity units pesticides are abundant in california surface waters burant et al 2018 analysis included comparisons of detections number and concentrations of 81 organic contaminants between the residential and commercial sites and within the same site there were 30 organic contaminants that had greater than 50 detections in at least one of the sites meanwhile microplastics plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter are emerging contaminants and their presence in water and soil ecosystems has recently drawn considerable attention because they pose a great threat to entire ecosystems guo et al 2020 the sources of microplastics are mainly classified as primary and secondary microplastics primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured for specific applications which include cosmetic abrasives drug vectors and industrial and engineering applications secondary microplastics originate from larger plastics as they are progressively fragmented into smaller pieces by multiple complex environmental conditions such as wind waves temperature and uv light with the change of runoff organization mode rainfall runoff and its associated pollutants first pass through the source of low impact development facilities environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 and soil environmental quality risk control standard for soil contamination of development land gb 36600 2018 should be considered systematically in the new urban water cycle mode in addition the impervious area is the main source of regional runoff pollutants initial erosion phenomenon which describes that the initial runoff contains the largest amount of pollutants in one precipitation events typical lid facility area calculation methods include 12 7 mm storage method composite cn method scs runoff depth method darcy runoff frequency spectrum method etc sun 2011 most of the designs are based on the initial scour phenomenon and take the water quality control as the main purpose but the initial scour phenomenon may not be significant due to the influence of underlying surface conditions pollutant types and rainfall conditions how to reasonably optimize the design of lid facilities also restricts the implementation of the concept of sponge city 2 2 construction of water soil plant rainwater vertical connection system the hydrological cycle is divided into global hydrological cycle watershed regional hydrological cycle and water soil plant system hydrological cycle the water soil plant system is an interactive system composed of soil plant and moisture movement after entering the system runoff will be intercepted filled infiltration evaporation and discharged under the action of solar energy gravity and the force field generated by soil and plant roots in this study the water soil plant continuum wspc system were established from the perspective of surface runoff and pollutant scour soil infiltration and pollutant transport groundwater recharge and response fig 2 wspc is an interactive system composed of soil vegetation and runoff after entering this system precipitation will intercept low lying land water storage infiltration evaporation discharge and runoff under the action of solar energy earth gravity and the force field generated by soil and vegetation roots and maintain the life process of vegetation the knowledge on characteristics of plants and their corresponding mechanisms in various functions such as plantmicroorganism interactions and relative performance over different functions in bioretention bisides stormwater interception retention infiltration media clogging prevention evapotranspiration and phytoremediation mehmood et al 2021 ni et al 2018a developed an improved hydrological model that can determine the water infiltration rate and suction responses under both single and mixed species one tree and one grass species condition considering accumulation leaching plant uptake and microbial transformation of pollutants in the bioretention media the mass of plant uptake gas volatilization for nitrogen between the start and end of study were estimated jiang et al 2019 taking soil samples and analyzed the changes of pollutants from top to bottom three layers in the bioretention media and the inflow outflow and overflow pollutants during the tests period were calculated based on the material balance typical gi lid facilities consists of aquifer mulch vegetation media gravel drainage layer and its ancillary facilities perforated drainage pipe overflow rainfall grate etc from top to bottom according to the hydrological conditions such as rainfall frequency duration pollutant types and levels in different study areas and considering the regional differences such as soil texture and plant species it is necessary to reasonably design the ponding depth plant collocation mulch types media types and combination of facilities the three emphases of the system are as follows i the randomness and uncertainty of inflow process pollutant types and loads which lead to the conventional and persistent pollution ii in order to optimize the process of water infiltration pollutant degradation and transformation it is necessary to further develop new type media and reasonable combination for economic and lasting operation iii the vertical connection and coupling simulation of water soil plant system are used to study the environmental response for facility media and groundwater 3 lid runoff control mechanism and parameter optimization 3 1 mechanism of decomposition of litter and mulch organic and inorganic materials are used as coverings for lid facilities the commonly used mulches are ceramsite rubber fragments bark and degradable hardwood leaf compost and other organic mulches zhang et al 2019 the main functions of mulch can be summarized as follows 1 to conserve soil moisture and reduce direct transpiration 2 to inhibit the growth of weeds 3 to maintain a more balanced temperature with slow heat conduction so as to keep cool in summer and keep warm in winter 4 to prevent hardening on the surface of media improve water absorption and infiltration and reduce soil erosion 5 to improve the quality of media and the organic mulch can be used as fertilizer supplement after decomposition 6 to improve the landscape ecology in the lid system the organic carbon cycle process and its influencing factors are shown in fig 3 on the one hand co2 released by mulch and litter decomposition is an important part of global carbon cycle on the other hand decomposition products of mulch and litter are also the main source of soil organic matter the decomposition process of different types of mulch and litter such as leaf and fine root litter is affected by their own chemical properties and there are different response behaviors to the changes of environmental factors in addition the different precipitation change patterns decrease increase seasonal distribution rainfall size and frequency are also one of the factors leading to the different decomposition response of mulch and litter how the coupling of multiple environmental factors affects litter decomposition synergistic antagonistic or no interaction is still a lack of in depth and systematic research glassman et al 2018 tan and shen 2020 the decomposition process of coverings and letter affects the media environment organic matter clay minerals ph etc thus affecting plant uptake and respiration microbial decomposition organic matter leaching etc phospholipid fatty acid plfa and molecular biology technology can identify the number and types of microbial functional genes involved in specific metabolic pathways but cannot truly reflect the metabolic pathways of microorganisms nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to study the changes of main chemical components during litter decomposition it has been found that the change of molecular structure during leaf litter decomposition is closely related to the succession of microbial community xia et al 2017 bonanomi et al 2019 therefore the combination of organic chemistry and molecular biology can further explore the relationship between the changes of chemical components of mulch and litter in lid system and the dynamics of microbial community so as to more comprehensively understand the response of decomposition process to environmental changes and the potential biochemical mechanism 3 2 media modification the modification of bioretention media is mainly based on the principles of strong adsorption capacity low desorption rate strong water holding capacity low cost and local easy access in order to increase the infiltration capacity specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the bioretention soil media the modifiers such as biochar peat soil coconut bran vermiculite slag ceramsite fly ash water treatment residues wtrs montmorillonite and other materials are mixed or layered on the basis of the traditional bioretention media at the same time compost paper sawdust wheat straw and wood chips can be used as carbon source in order to promote the denitrification function gao 2014 tian et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 for example because biochar has a highly porous structure and large specific surface area it can affect the soil structure and porosity by changing the pore size distribution body surface area and soil volume weight the increase of porosity and surface functional groups may increase the effective water in the soil thus affecting the soil hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic conductivity therefore biochar is very effective in maintaining high water retention capacity and relatively low soil hydraulic conductivity which can effectively control runoff and stormwater chen et al 2016 ni et al 2018b ni et al 2020 in addition because of its large porosity and high carboxylic acid esterification and aromatization structure it can reduce the leaching of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and adsorb nutrient elements in runoff biochar amended biofiltration systems efficiently remove diverse pollutants such as total nitrogen 32 61 total phosphorus 45 94 heavy metals 27 100 organics 54 100 and microbial pollutants log10 removal 0 78 4 23 from urban runoff biswal et al 2022 it is of great significance for the sustainable development of resources and environment to follow the principles of clean production comprehensive utilization and proper control considering from two aspects of runoff control and pollutant purification general description and testing requirements of media were shown in fig 4 the modification of media is mainly considered from two aspects infiltration capacity hydraulic conductivity ponding depth and surface area and purification capacity basic characteristics of media background content of pollutants biodiversity the hydraulic conductivity is affected by particle size distribution of filter media layer transition layer drainage layer in terms of purification capacity it is necessary to consider the adsorption and interception during rainfall and the plant uptake and biodegradation during rainfall interval in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the energy and resource reuse of solid waste the principles followed mainly include i the recycling value of available materials especially the solid waste residue of industrial and mining enterprises ii the resource utilization of organic solid waste such as composting and biogas production iii avoiding secondary pollution and meeting the requirements of hygiene and bacteriology as the main product of urban demolition construction construction waste not only occupies a lot of land resources but also brings great pollution risk to soil air and water bodies considering the adsorption capacity mechanical properties shrinkage durability and other properties it is used in rainfall infiltration facilities to provide a new way for the recycling of construction waste ng et al 2019 the strength of construction waste is inversely proportional to porosity and aggregate size at the same time cement hydration generates ca oh 2 which increases the alkalinity of concrete selecting suitable alkali resistant plants solving the contradiction between porosity and strength of concrete are the key problems to be solved in the greening application of recycled aggregate from construction waste li 2011 it has been proved that the traditional bioretention media mixed with different proportions of wtrs hardwood bark mulch hbm leaf waste compost lc and river sand have good adsorption effect on phosphorus o neill and davis 2012a o neill and davis 2012b combined with the regional characteristics the preparation of biochar and compost from waste biomass can not only improve the utilization and management of waste biomass help to solve the environmental problems such as waste biomass disposal incineration random emission and greenhouse effect but also be applied to the bioretention media improve the economy of facility construction and strengthen the regulation ability of stormwater runoff in addition researches have adopted loamy sand and sandy loam with high infiltration rate as the best media on this basis in order to increase the water holding capacity and adsorption capacity of media improve the microbial abundance plant growth environment and the improvement and configuration optimization of bioretention tank media have become a research hotspot however the bioretention cell is impacted by intermittent storm runoff and the hydraulic pollution load has strong temporal and spatial variability the improvement of infiltration rate and long term operation of media also increase the risk of pollutant leaching and system clogging therefore quantifying the variation of the function of the bioretention system under the conditions of environmental change and media modification is the key problems to establish an improved bioretention runoff control model and formulate the optimal management measures 3 3 optimization of structural layer parameters lid technology includes a number of different forms of lid facilities such as permeable pavement green roof bioretention cell sunken green space rainfall wetland infiltration pond infiltration well wet pond dry pond reservoir regulating pond grass planting ditch infiltration pipe channel vegetation filter belt initial rainfall disposal facilities etc mohurd 2014 the lid module of stormwater management model swmm provides seven kinds of scattered rainfall disposal technologies including bioretention rain garden green roof permeable pavement permeable channel rainwater bucket and grass planting ditch the structure layers of various facilities include one or more parts of surface layer pavement layer soil layer water storage layer drainage mat drain pipe tao et al 2018 taking the bioretention system as an example the main design parameters affecting its operation efficiency include the kinds of media types and these combination inflow concentration recurrence interval discharge ratio submerged zone height ponding depth infiltration rate emptying time etc based on the soil physical model hydrus 1d for sensitivity parameters identification and media thickness simulation the result showed that media thickness hm empirical parameters n saturated water content θs and saturated conductivity ks are the sensitive parameters that affect water transport and inflow volume v inflow concentration c media thickness hm media isothermal adsorption constant kd are the sensitive parameters for pollutant transport jiang 2020 typical rainfall infrastructure and its key parameters are shown in table 2 there are too many function and form involved in the lid technology the design parameters and calculation methods required by various lid facilities are also different jiang et al 2021 in general on the basis of media improvement appropriate facility surface area scale optimization appropriate aquifer depth regulation and storage capacity optimization media combination mode layered media type thickness optimization and appropriate outlet height of drainage pipe aquifer height optimization to improve denitrification are also the focus of research field scale rain gardens were constructed using a novel biphasic concept involving water movement from a saturated to an unsaturated zone in sequence for increasing retention time of runoff and improving bioremediation the created biphasic rain gardens were highly effective in removing nitrate 91 phosphate 99 atrazine 90 dicamba 92 glyphosate 99 and 2 4 d 90 under high levels of pollution loading with simulated runoff events yang et al 2013 fan et al 2019 designed u type and w type bioretention systems to study the effect on nitrogen purification mechanism each column had a 20 cm ponding depth 40 cm soil layer 20 cm media layer composed of 20 local red soil and 80 fine sand and 20 cm submerged layer however the effect of structure on the purification effect is not significant some scholars also use the form of facilities combination to improve the comprehensive effect of lid facilities tirpak et al 2019 made suspended pavement systems multi functional by designing them to act as subsurface bioretention practices in ultra urban areas by transmitting surface loads to a compacted subbase suspended pavement systems create a matrix of uncompacted soil that promotes tree health through increased root access to oxygen water and nutrients when green roof and sunken lawn were applied in series green roof runoff discharged into sunken lawn compared with discharging stormwater separately the peak flow reduction and retention effect were more significant and with the increasing of rainfall frequency the advantages of discharging stormwater in series were increasingly obvious 4 sustainability of lid facility operation 4 1 lid system clogging clogging is defined as the process of reducing the porosity and permeability of the system due to physical biological and chemical processes which may lead to more frequent overflow events prolonged ponding time weakened runoff control ability and other problems in the green infrastructure system which may affect the landscape and public safety langergraber et al 2003 combined with the research results of facility for advancing water biofiltration fawb 2009 the formation mechanism of system clogging process hydraulic conductivity range and potential issues were shown in fig 5 bioretention is the commonly used lid measure in cluster analysis and it is used both individually and in conjunction with other lids such as permeable pavement green roof swale etc islam et al 2021 experts and scholars optimize the configuration of bioretention cell vegetation type media type and combination form etc to maximize the regulation of runoff and purification of runoff pollutants so as to improve the regulation efficiency and sustainability of bioretention system however with the long term operation of the bioretention system the characteristics of media may change followed by the reduction of water conductivity and treatment effect the vegetation and extent of bioretention cells have an important impact on hydraulic conductivity which also affects the proportion of annual runoff treated by bioretention cell the own scale of system is relatively smaller than the catchment area and the system impacted by high pollution load is more likely to be blocked at the same time plants with well developed roots can limit the decline of hydraulic conductivity caused by blockage therefore appropriate scale design and plant selection are the key factors to limit blockage le coustumer et al 2012 the selection of plants shall meet the following requirements ① select local common greening plants as far as possible and mainly perennial plants in four seasons ② drought resistance and short term flood resistance and the water resistance time shall be greater than two days 3 plants have strong purification ability and pollution resistance and have high nutrient removal rate 4 for xi an area ophiopogon japonicus ryegrass thunbergia alata marigold buxus sinica ligustrum lucidum rosa chinensis jacq etc are suitable the bioremediation methods such as replacing the media adding chemicals inoculating alien microorganisms or transferring into genetic engineering bacteria are costly technically difficult and have certain ecological risks therefore process optimization pretreatment media modification facility configuration and plant design operation management flood season cleaning plant harvesting natural screening and domestication of indigenous microorganisms become economic and feasible technical means weng 2020 however there is a lack of quantitative research on the coupling relationship between the key parameters of the bioretention system and the multiple resistance control technology the comprehensive effects of rainfall conditions operation times and media environment on the clogging of bioretention system need to be further explored the united states environmental protection agency epa and new zealand require that the permeability coefficient of bioretention cell should be above 12 5 mm h 3 47 10 6 m s austria and australia requires that the permeability coefficient should be 36 360 mm h 1 10 5 1 10 4 m s and 50 200 mm h 1 38 10 5 5 55 10 5 m s respectively le coustumer et al 2009 the horton philip and kostiakov infiltration models were selected to compare their accuracy when using for describe the infiltration characteristics of bioretention and the experimental results showed that horton model is fitting well and flexible under different experiment conditions wang et al 2021 for the system with large initial hydraulic conductivity k 200 mm h the infiltration coefficient of the bioretention system decreases obviously with the passage of time which may be caused by sediment deposition and hydraulic compaction on the surface of the system hatt et al 2007 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 it is found that the average infiltration rate of the bioretention soil column decreases to 30 8 of the initial value after about 50 weeks of operation and appropriate particle size distribution is an effective measure to ensure the effectiveness of permeable pores meng et al 2013 in the initial stage of facility operation the bioretention cell needs to meet the design goal of infiltration water holding capacity and pollutant purification capacity with the extension of the operation time it is necessary to further study the particle size distribution of the media the organic inorganic solid content in the pores the adsorption desorption characteristics biological processes microbial degradation plant and animal absorption etc these factors will lead to the variation of facility functions therefore based on the target value of design infiltration rate the design standard should be appropriately improved huang et al 2021 assessed the effects of low infiltration underlying soil and precipitation characteristics on the hydraulic performance of a bioretention cell using swmm the result showed that in order to simultaneously achieve expected reduction goal of both peak flow and runoff volume and make the best comprehensive performance for the bioretention cell under condition of low infiltration underlying soil and heavy storms it requires not only a maintenance action to increase the hydraulic conductivity of soil medium layer but also a drain pipe to be added in the storage layer and meanwhile other lid practices should be combined it is of great significance to study the time varying characteristics of the runoff control efficiency for clarifying the multiple control mechanism of leaching and clogging in the modified media bioretention system 4 2 cumulative effect of runoff pollutants although most of the pollutants in stormwater runoff can be effectively removed by the lid system the removal is mainly due to the adsorption and interception of pollutants in the system hwang et al 2021 with the increase of pollutant accumulation in the system the habitat of the media environmental will change which may cause new pollution therefore it is of great significance to systematically study the accumulation of pollutants and ecological environment risk for the sustainability of facility operation the types and forms of runoff pollutants years of facility operation and the ecological environment of media system determine the speed of facility performance attenuation among them heavy metal pollution sources include automobile exhaust combustion of fossil fuels smoke and dust from metallurgical enterprises wear and tear of tires and brake pads and accumulation of rainfall pipeline deposits heavy metals are difficult to degrade in the environment easy to accumulate in organisms with the characteristics of long lasting pollution wide range of areas and difficult to control therefore heavy metals have a strong harmful effect on the environment and ecosystem which has become one of the hot issues at home and abroad the representative methods applied to soil heavy metal pollution evaluation include single factor index evaluation method nemerow comprehensive pollution index method geoaccumulation index method and ecological hazard index method in addition there are standardization method of introducing enrichment factor fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method combined with fuzzy mathematics theory and modified gray clustering method guan et al 2013 at the same time it was found that 88 97 of the heavy metals imported into bioretention system were captured by soil medium and 2 11 6 could not be captured compared with the heavy metals intercepted by soil the heavy metals enriched in plants accounted for only 0 5 3 3 sun and davis 2007 at present there is a lack of systematic research on the accumulation migration and release of heavy metals in the lid facilities which limits the wide application of these technologies in the field of rainfall resource reuse and groundwater recharge soil enzymes control the material cycle and energy flow of ecosystem which have been widely studied in wetland system forest soil system and farmland soil system however there are few studies on the correlation among enzyme activity modified media species and pollutant contents in bioretention system cui et al 2013 fatemi et al 2016 in the bioretention system pollutant removal is mainly achieved through the physical chemical and biological synergistic effects of media microorganisms and plants during the interval of rainfall events the biological function is the key factor to purify the runoff pollutants the removal of organic matter in the system is mainly through the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter into small molecular inorganic matter by microorganisms and soil enzymes the enzyme activities can directly reflect the microbial activity so soil enzymes and microorganisms promote the material transformation together plants microorganisms and a small number of animals in the system can accelerate the transformation of biodegradable pollutants by secreting specific catalytic enzymes and make them enter the biological nutrition cycle therefore the enzyme activity in bioretention media is an important index to evaluate its purification effect on runoff pollutants at the same time the effect of soil physical and chemical properties on soil enzyme activity is very complex soil physical properties affecting enzyme activity include particle gradation soil moisture air and heat status chemical properties including acidity and alkalinity organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus heavy metals and trace elements the addition of exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus will change the element content in the media and the soil physical and chemical properties ph cation content etc the components of the modified media bioretention system are complex coupled with the impact of intermittent rainfall runoff which can significantly affect soil biomass microbial community composition and microbial activity directly or indirectly affect soil enzyme activity and rainfall runoff regulation efficiency the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen is mainly driven by microorganisms nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification ammoniation and anammox are all important processes in which microorganisms participate in the nitrogen cycle by detecting the abundance of nitrogen functional genes in the system the effects of soil microbial ecosystem on nitrogen removal and transformation were identified anaerobic zone can improve denitrification conditions and retain runoff volume for plant growth but increase the risk of biofilm adhesion and pollutant accumulation in this area it is necessary to study the effect of anaerobic zone on the long term operation of the system by combining the effective porosity and the characteristics of longitudinal moisture content change of media for phosphorus pollutants the mechanism of polyphosphate bacteria on phosphorus was mainly studied under anaerobic aerobic conditions in the internal storage area of bioretention system van der heijden et al 2008 point out that soil microorganisms play an important role in soil organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling organic carbon sequestration and other ecosystem processes they are also important drivers of plant diversity productivity and sustainable land use in terrestrial ecosystems microbial biomass and activity are influenced by climatic factors vegetation organic matter ph and humidity plant and soil samples from eighteen plots of six sites in a wetland were collected to determine the community structure of bacteria and fungi plant functional groups and soil characteristics the results showed that bacterial and fungal diversity at the 0 20 cm soil depth were significantly negatively and positively related to ph respectively kang et al 2021 xia et al 2020 showed that the effect of soil texture on the structure and function of soil microbial community was probably caused by the distribution of organic matter at pore and particle scale soil texture is the second most important factor after soil ph value in the construction of microbial community structure and composition herold et al 2014 studied the effects of soil properties on total phospholipid fatty acid plfa biomass microbial community composition plfa profile and enzyme activities related c n p cycle it was found that the biomass composition and activity of microbial community were strongly affected by soil properties differences in soil properties explained 60 of variation in plfa data and 81 of variation in enzyme activities across regions and land use intensities 5 coupling simulation of runoff soil groundwater 5 1 simulation for runoff soil groundwater behaviours there are many models available in literature that can simulate the runoff soil groundwater behaviors tang et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 the strengths and weaknesses of those hydrological modes are highlighted and compared in table 3 in particular several coupling models have been developed to simulate runoff soil groundwater behaviors mike flood model can be directly coupled with urban storm water network model mike urban urban water system model mike 11 and regional overflow model mike 21 this coupled model can simultaneously simulate water quantity and quality at various scales which can simulate two dimensional surface inundation and more accurately express regional surface water accumulation and flood velocity song 2020 the operation of mike flood is more complicated than swmm model more data input is required and the code cannot be modified for secondary development and upgrading swmm hydrus couples swmm and hydrus model baek et al 2020 swmm simulates the rainfall and surface runoff in the sub catchment which is the input of the lid module in hydrus hydrus is used to simulate the flow of water in the lid soil medium this model can consider not only the moisture content of the soil but also the water pressure and flux in the soil and can simulate lid with a minimum time step of one minute however the soil moisture in the simulation should not be lower than the initial soil moisture in simulation hydrus modflow couples hydrus and modflow which use groundwater level changes as a link a numerical model of soil water was established using hydrus 1d and groundwater model was established using pmwin by combined with the water balance method which can simulate the combination of soil water groundwater and surface groundwater lin 2020 however modflow uses rectangular mesh for subdivision which has deficiencies in the simulation of three dimensional seepage fields of groundwater in complex geological bodies rectangular meshing is not as flexible as finite element triangulation and is not suitable for unsaturated flow problems swmm modflow simulates the surface runoff of lid facilities through swmm to obtain the net permeability the net permeability import the modflow to calculate the groundwater replenishment rate to realize the impact of lid facilities on groundwater huang 2019 swmm modflow can simulate surface hydrological processes and characterize lid facilities but its temporal and spatial matching is not coordinated the potential research topics such as i to consider the indexes of infiltration capacity adsorption capacity and biodiversity comprehensively for media modification ii to further clarify the cumulative effect ecological risk and biodiversity response in the condition of long term operation iii to clarify the runoff regulation mechanism of lid facilities and establish the empirical and mechanism model of water pollutants transport under changing conditions iv to carry out life cycle cost benefit analysis of the whole process of lid facility construction v to build a multi objective optimization urban stormwater management model which considering the coupling of single and regional scale models 5 2 surface runoff and confluence process the surface runoff is mainly characterized by the flow hydrograph of the rainfall outlet which mainly includes the process of surface runoff generation and confluence the former is to calculate the net rainfall process after deducting the surface evaporation and transpiration plant interception water storage and soil infiltration kostiakov model horton model green ampt model etc the latter is to calculate the inflow process when the runoff of each basin is collected to the rainfall outlet the commonly used surface runoff models include comprehensive runoff coefficient method full storage runoff method exponential or parabolic infiltration curve method time variant gain model tvgm etc hu et al 2021 ji et al 2017 the calculation methods of surface confluence include instantaneous unit hydrograph method isochron method nonlinear reservoir algorithm etc the velocity and depth of flow in the pipeline are calculated by saint venant equations the principle of runoff generation and confluence process were shown in the table 4 it is an important subject of infiltration theory to deduce the concrete expression form of infiltration curve at present the infiltration curve can be determined by three ways unsaturated infiltration theory saturated infiltration theory and empirical infiltration curve based on infiltration test more impacts need to be considered under natural conditions infiltration ① relationship between infiltration f0 fc and rainfall intensity i is there a temporal change in rainfall intensity ② infiltration in heterogeneous soils vertical distribution of coarse and fine soils 3 permafrost infiltration is impermeable layer formed 4 slope infiltration the actual rainfall intensity becomes icosα at the same time colloid in soil chemical and biological effects ground cover temperature soil gas content and contaminant concentration etc are also important factors affecting infiltration in the green infrastructure the infiltration process becomes more complicated due to the influence of media combination and facility structure 5 3 migration and fate process of media pollutants it is of great significance to simulate the migration and transformation process of pollutants in soil accurately for soil groundwater pollution control and long term operation of lid facilities sheng et al 2020 constructed a multi microbial degradation kinetic model of single pollutant based on the growth and degradation kinetic mechanism of microorganisms the model described the degradation process of pollutants in soil closer to the real situation and had strong practicability in view of the heterogeneity of soil groundwater strata the complexity of compound pollutant reaction the variability of boundary conditions in typical contaminated sites based on the risk theory multi scale experimental data and big data mining technology a coupling model of mass transfer process at the interface of compound pollutants was constructed combining parallel super computing technology and zero space monte carlo method to quickly solve the coupled model and carry out risk assessment of mass transfer process is the focus of future research teng et al 2020 due to the influence of rainfall conditions operation times and configuration parameters the interaction of influencing factors and the process of compound pollution in the modified media environment of lid facilities are not clear the formation process of pollutant leaching system clogging and its resistance control mechanism operation life risk assessment become the bottleneck of the application of lid technologies the leaching factor is defined as the ratio of the predicted concentration of pollutants in groundwater to that in the upper soil chen et al 2017 when the bioretention system with different modified media is saturated it is assumed that the process of pollutants leaching from soil into groundwater can be divided into three transfer steps ①the distribution equilibrium of pollutants between soil solid phase and infiltration liquid phase ②the pollutants enter deep clean soil with leaching solution and reach the solid liquid distribution equilibrium again 3 when the leaching solution is mixed with the groundwater the pollutants enter the groundwater system and diffuse and dilute considering the media types hydraulic and pollution load impact measuring the saturated hydraulic conductivity of modified media the characteristics of blocking materials at different heights particle size distribution and analyzing the quantitative relationship among infiltration rate hydraulic retention time media effective porosity are effective means to evaluate the life decay process of facilities quantitatively 5 4 groundwater response simulation at present several groundwater numerical model software are widely used including visual modflow feflow gms mt3d visual groundwater etc the numerical simulation of soil and groundwater has achieved mature research methods and supporting software but the coupling numerical simulation of soil groundwater pollutant transport at the interface of soil and groundwater are not clear relatively hpm hydrus package for modflow as a mature coupling module of soil and groundwater flow and solute transport simulation the unsaturated zone hydrus module is associated with the saturated zone modflow model in the coupling process hydrus takes the groundwater depth h calculated in the previous period of modflow as the bottom boundary condition in the next period while modflow takes the bottom seepage calculated by hydrus in this period is taken as the recharge in the next period beegum et al 2018 2019 a large number of researches have been conducted with a major focus on strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater table and environments the distance between the bottom of lid facility and the groundwater table media types and the design of underdrain pipe are the main issues that have be considered zhang and chui 2019 proposed that more tracer studies and variably saturated modeling could be conducted to better understand the flow and solute transport paths inside and beneath lid facility 6 conclusions and research needs climate change rapid urbanization and ecological concerns are all driving the need for innovative stormwater management techniques to mitigate these impacts with the change of runoff organization mode and eco hydrological effect of urbanization water soil plant system for rainfall vertical connection is proposed future research directions were pointed out to make further advances in sponge city construction including the process of mulch litter decomposition and plant growth for lid facilities modified media preparation high adsorption capacity hydraulic conductivity wate holding capacity microbial ecology plant growth support locally accessible the clogging mechanism and pollutant accumulation effect for sustainability of operation coupling simulation of runoff soil groundwater in terms of operation mechanism the combination of organic chemistry and molecular biology can further explore the relationship between the changes of chemical components of mulch litter in media profile and the microbial community dynamics more tracer studies and refined simulation could be conducted to better understand the cumulative effect and risk of pollutants in soil media groundwater recharge and its possible pollution source response in terms of operation persistence considering the characteristics of inflow pollutants and the comprehensive role of plants media and microorganisms the formation process and resistance control mechanism of pollutant leaching and system clogging in the bioretention system should be clarified in addition the operation lifespan and soil groundwater risk assessment should be researched deeply in terms of model simulation on the basis of regional optimal allocation which considering the location area and number of facilities the runoff and confluence model pollutant transport model soil physical model and biodegradation model and groundwater numerical simulation model should be coupled to build stormwater vertical connection system of runoff soil groundwater declaration of competing interest the

3724,mountain forests affect spatial and temporal variability of snow processes through snow interception and by modifying the energy balance of snowpack the high sensitivity of snow cover to seasonal temperatures in mid latitude mountains is well known and is of particular interest with regard to a future warmer climate the snowpack in the pyrenees is expected to be the most impacted by climate change in the mediterranean mountains where future climate trends project rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation this study analyzes how changes in temperature and precipitation can affect current forest snow interactions in four forests located near each other but under contrasting topographic settings in the spanish pyrenees this understanding will allow us to anticipate the future hydrological responses of pyrenean forested mountain basins the research was accomplished by performing a sensitivity analysis using simulations from the cold regions hydrological model crhm and by comparing forest canopy sites f vs openings o the crhm platform focuses on the incorporation of physically based descriptions of snow dominated regions hydrological processes it was found that forest cover induced different snowpack sensibility to climatic change conditions in the studied forests delayed onset of snow accumulation f 13 days c 1 o 5 days c 1 and reduced snowpack duration f 28 c 1 o 23 c 1 under warmer temperatures were more intense in areas beneath the forest canopy compared to openings a lower annual peak of snow water equivalent swe f 81 mm c 1 o 129 mm c 1 earlier melt out date f 8 days c 1 o 10 days c 1 and slower melting rates f 0 4 mm day 1 c 1 o 0 5 mm day 1 c 1 with increasing temperatures were more intense in forest openings the forest driven reduction in snowpack duration 40 was significantly enhanced with warming 10 per c lower precipitation 20 precipitation reduction could increase the response of this forest effect to warming 32 while higher precipitation 20 precipitation increment could reduce it 26 there was relevant topographic variability in the forest snow interactions in response to climate change among the study stands despite their proximity keywords cold regions hydrological model crhm snow processes snowpack mountain forest warming snow water equivalent swe 1 introduction the importance of snow in mountains ranges from its role as an essential eco hydrological resource to the economic activities associated with it mid latitude mountain snowpacks represent a natural freshwater reservoir by storing solid water in winter and releasing it as snowmelt runoff in spring summer when human activity demands are usually highest barnett et al 2005 additionally snowpack variability affects ecological processes such as forest growth vaganov et al 1999 plant phenology asam et al 2018 soil water stress harpold 2016 and wildfire activity westerling 2016 seasonal snowpack is affected by complex interactions between meteorological conditions topography and vegetation bednorz 2004 ellis et al 2013 huerta et al 2019 lundquist and cayan 2007 snow processes are heavily influenced by forest cover since mid and high elevation forests co exist across a large range of altitudes with mountain snow broxton et al 2020 tree leaves and branches intercept snow during winter which affects under canopy snow accumulation varhola et al 2010 canopy interception generally leads to shallower snowpacks in forested areas relative to open areas because a significant proportion of the snow stored in the canopy sublimates or melts molotch et al 2007 storck et al 2002 trees shelter the surface from wind which modifies snow transport by wind and thus snow accumulation patterns compared to open areas hiemstra et al 2002 additionally mountain forests alter the energy balance of the snowpack and thus condition snowmelt in different and complex ways sicart et al 2004 for example forest litter deposited over the under canopy snowpack reduces snow albedo and increases shortwave absorption by the snowpack hardy et al 2000 forest cover can diminish melting rates by reducing shortwave radiation reaching the snowpack surface i e shading effect ellis et al 2011 musselman et al 2015 on the other hand longwave radiation can be enhanced in forested areas as a result of shortwave absorption by trees and consequent heating during the day the forest canopy generally has a higher thermal emissivity than the clear sky during the night i e heating effect which can compensate for shortwave reduction by the shade effect with consequent increase of melt rate essery et al 2008 lundquist et al 2013 sicart et al 2006 the balance between reduced accumulation and diminished or enhanced melting determines snowpack duration in forests which can be shortened or extended relative to open areas dickerson lange et al 2017 the nature and extent of forest influences on snowpack rely on forest structure topography orientation elevation seasonality and regional climate among others currier and lundquist 2018 jost et al 2007 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 moeser et al 2016 pomeroy et al 2002 roth and nolin 2017 many studies have investigated the impacts of current climate change on snow processes and related effects on stream flows in the main mid latitude mountain ranges such as reductions in snow accumulation and accelerated rain on snow processes which are expected to induce a shift to earlier snowmelt onset and melt out e g adam et al 2009 beniston 2012 fang and pomeroy 2020 marshall et al 2019 morán tejeda et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2015 rasouli et al 2015 sun et al 2016 however the sensitivity of snow processes to climate change may differ depending on regional climates and the physiographic characteristics of different mountain ranges evan and eisenman 2021 lópez moreno et al 2017 marshall et al 2019 shrestha et al 2021 this issue is especially relevant in mediterranean climate mountains as they are considered hot spots for climate change impacts and the consequences may seriously affect the ecosystems hydrological resources and the economy of these regions giorgi and lionello 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 the future climate trends projected for mediterranean mountains indicate rising temperatures between 1 6 c and 8 3 c for 2085 as well as a reduction of precipitation between 4 8 and 17 for 2085 nogués bravo et al 2008 previous research determined that mediterranean snowpacks are very sensitive to temperature increases lópez moreno et al 2017 although the extent of the change varied among mountain ranges the spanish pyrenees is expected to be the european mountain range most impacted by climate change in terms of mean swe and snowpack duration lópez moreno et al 2017 understanding how forest cover can affect the sensitivity of snowpack to changes in climate will allow us to anticipate future hydrological responses of pyrenean forested mountain basins under climate change conditions ellis et al 2013 fang and pomeroy 2020 lópez moreno et al 2020 rasouli et al 2019 tennant et al 2017 research regarding the interactions between forest and snow in the spanish pyrenees e g lópez moreno and latron 2008 revuelto et al 2015 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 observed that snow accumulation was 40 50 lower in areas beneath the forest canopy compared to forest openings while the overall melting rate was reduced by 25 in forested areas the forest cover reduced the annual peaks of snow accumulation by 50 and the snowpack duration by more than two weeks the relative earlier snow disappearance in forested areas was mainly explained by greater forest driven reduction of accumulation rate in combination with occasional forest driven enhancement of melting rate however the magnitude and timing of these forest snow interactions had significant spatial and temporal variations based on these observations and on related previous research a series of hypotheses h1 to h4 were raised on how forest effects on snow may respond to climate change conditions in the pyrenees since climate mediates forest snow interactions involving snow accumulation currier and lundquist 2018 and melting processes dickerson lange et al 2017 h1 it was expected that snowpacks in areas beneath forest canopy and in forest openings might respond differently to a changing climate previous work has attributed higher canopy interception efficiency to warmer temperatures friesen et al 2015 and to a lower amount of snowfall revuelto et al 2015 thus h2 it was expected that forest effects on snow accumulation processes might be enhanced under warming climate conditions especially in a scenario that has less precipitation in a warmer climate the main melt season is projected to occur earlier and thus to shorten to a period of lower available energy to melt musselman et al 2017 as the melt period shifts earlier in the year away from the summer solstice the forest shading effect might be weaker because of the lower solar zenith angle lundquist et al 2013 in a snowmelt scenario of lower energy the forest heating effect might be smaller due to lower penetration of solar radiation into the forest i e lower shortwave absorption by trees and the subsequent lower thermal emissivity lundquist et al 2013 in addition the shift in melt timing with warming also decreased net longwave radiation as melt period air temperatures decreased because the shift of snowmelt timing can have a greater effect on air temperatures than the induced warming jennings and molotch 2020 this might contribute to diminishing the forest heating effect on melting thus h3 it was expected that both forest effects shading and heating on snow melting processes might be diminished with warming it has been previously observed that the magnitude and timing of the forest effects on snow processes varied significantly among forest stands despite their proximity sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 topography elevation and forest structure are relevant factors among others that explained why the forest snow interactions vary spatially jenicek et al 2018a musselman et al 2012 roth and nolin 2017 thus h4 it was expected that the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to climate change might show significant spatial variability in nearby areas this study investigates how forest cover can affect the snowpack response to changes in climate in four nearby sub alpine conifer forests in the pyrenees for this purpose a sensitive analysis was done by simulating the shifts in snow water equivalent swe and snowpack energy balance seb at each forest stand under various degrees of climate forcing comparing areas beneath forest canopy f and forest openings o during four snow seasons 2016 17 2019 20 simulations were done using the forest snow process modules in the cold regions hydrological model crhm which were evaluated against field observations crhm is particularly well suited to the aim of this study and the study area since this model has focused on the incorporation of physically based descriptions of cold regions hydrological processes such as forest canopy snow interception drip and unloading blowing snow canopy influence on radiation energy balance snowmelt or long wave radiation in complex terrain pomeroy et al 2007 the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to estimate how forest cover affects the sensitivity of snowpack to changes in climate 2 to evaluate whether forest driven effects on snow processes were enhanced or reduced under changing climate conditions and 3 to explore spatial variability in the sensitivity of forest effects on snowpack to changing climate conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study sites the study was performed in the

flexible and physically based modeling system created to simulate a range of hydrological processes in mountainous and cold regions the full description of crhm is provided by pomeroy et al 2007 and the software is available for downloading at https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling crhm php download crhm has been applied to diverse environments including artic alpine and subalpine areas debeer and pomeroy 2010 ellis et al 2010 fang and pomeroy 2020 krogh et al 2015 lópez moreno et al 2020 rasouli et al 2015 the crhm platform has a modular structure that can address the wide range of processes typical of regions where snow has a key role in the cycle e g snow redistribution by wind snow interception by forest canopies snow sublimation or snow melting users can construct their own model by selecting modules from the platform library based on input data availability the predictive variable of interest and research scale it can be used to forecast diagnose and understand hydrological processes due to its heavy reliance on physically based process parameterizations crhm was applied at each study plot which were divided in two hydrological response units hrus on the basis of forest cover i e forest openings o and areas beneath forest canopy f selection of the crhm modules was based on the characteristics of the study plots and the available climate data as presented in table a1 parameters have been adapted to each study plot based on field measurements or by estimation based on other similar snow dominated areas table a2 climate data for the period 2016 17 2019 20 were used as the input to the crhm platform the climate database was converted into crhm observations using the crhmr r package shook 2016 outputs of interest include hourly values of swe and seb components net all wave radiation net longwave radiation net shortwave radiation net latent heat turbulent flux net sensible heat turbulent flux energy from rainfall advection net ground heat flux and the change in internal energy of snow for each hru during the period 2016 17 2019 20 4 snow seasons crhm resolves the snow energy balance as the sum of irradiative turbulent advective and conductive energy fluxes ellis et al 2010 swe series and energy fluxes were outputs from the snobalcrhm module the exception was the net long and shortwave radiation fluxes which were outputs from the canopyclearinggap module crhm output databases were post processed using the crhmr r package shook 2016 hourly series were converted into daily data by taking the maximum value reached each day in the case of swe series and the mean value of each day in the case of energy fluxes the studied snow seasons were representative of a wider range of local snow conditions daily maximum swe series from 2008 to 2019 were obtained from a near tele snow gauge operated by saih che n0004 bachimaña values of peak swe seasonal average swe and snowpack duration of analyzed snow seasons were within the range of percentiles 20 35 of the whole series 2 3 2 evaluation of model performance observed swe daily series at each plot and hru during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 snow seasons were compared to the model outputs to evaluate model performance in terms of the ability to represent a the variation in peak swe and snowpack duration between hrus the peak swe is the maximum annual amount of swe recorded at each hru while the duration of the snowpack was calculated as the number of days per year having a swe 5 mm lópez moreno et al 2020 b the magnitude of daily swe at individual sites for a and b above model performance was assessed by the following three measures described in ellis et al 2010 the model bias index mb the model efficiency index me and the root mean square error rmse the mb index compares the total simulation output to the total of observations the me index gives an indication of model performance compared to the mean of the observations and the rmse index quantifies the absolute unit error between simulations and observations correlations using the spearman coefficient rho were calculated between modeled and observed swe variables this non parametric method was used since analyzed variables had not normal distributions shapiro wilk test p value 0 05 swe estimates showed general good agreement with observed swe during both analyzed snow seasons fig 2 mb 1 01 a slight overestimation of daily swe in areas beneath forest canopy in plots 1 and 4 during 2016 17 snow season was observed table a3 this could point to an underestimation of the interception effect by forest on the other hand certain snow accumulation events were underestimated e g april 2017 in plot 4 estimates represented pretty well the inter plot variability in general me 0 94 although the model s efficiency is reduced in areas beneath forest canopy the rmse value for all sites was 49 mm of daily swe greater absolute errors were found in forest openings a high positive correlation was found between modeled and observed daily swe data fig a1 when all areas beneath forest canopy rho 0 91 p value 0 001 were considered and all forest openings rho 0 95 p value 0 001 certain inter plot variability was observed in the correlation between modeled and observed daily swe data but in all cases it was statistically significant rho 0 87 in all cases the percentage of total variance of the modeled swe explained by the regression was higher than 78 fig a1 apparently overestimation errors happened more frequently when low daily swe values occurred in forested areas especially in plots 1 and 4 fig a2 similarly underestimation errors in forested areas were more frequent when greater daily swe occurred especially above 400 mm no evident relationship between model errors and the observed magnitude of swe in forest openings was found simulations showed minor underestimation of peak swe mb 0 94 fig 2 this strong correspondence occurred in both forest openings and areas beneath forest canopy estimates also represented well the peak swe variability among plots based on the me index value me 0 94 although the model efficiency was reduced in areas beneath forest canopy the rmse of peak swe 78 mm in areas beneath the forest canopy was slightly greater than that found in forest openings in general terms the simulation of snow duration was accurate mb 0 99 despite swe being slightly overestimated in areas beneath the forest canopy and slightly underestimated in forest openings fig 2 model efficiency in snow duration me 0 80 was higher in areas beneath the forest canopy than in forest openings the rmse of snow duration was 17 days for all sites and areas in forest openings it was 7 days higher than in areas beneath forest canopy summarizing the crhm model performed sufficiently well in capturing the snow accumulation and ablation magnitude and timing to be used for sensitivity analysis to climate in the four study sites and f o areas estimates did not show systematic errors that might interfere with conclusions drawn from subsequent climate analysis 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the response of forest effect on snow processes to changing climate conditions for this purpose swe and energy fluxes were simulated under scenarios of combined temperature and precipitation departs from the control period 2016 17 2019 20 air temperature and precipitation were modified in the observation module of the crhm platform temperature was forced to increase from 1 c to 4 c and precipitation was considered to change from 20 to 20 yielding a total of 14 scenarios of perturbed climate the 20 value approximates the uncertainty of precipitation simulated in climate models for the mediterranean region knutti and sedláček 2013 relative humidity was assumed to be constant under temperature forcing climate forced crhm outputs were again postprocessed using the crhmr r package shook 2016 hourly series were converted into daily data by taking the maximum value reached each day in the case of the swe series and the mean value of each day in the case of energy fluxes from the modeled daily swe series several snow indices were derived for each hru at each plot for further analysis i the snow accumulation onset date of first day having swe 5 mm ii the melt out date last date having swe 5 mm iii the snow duration number of days annually having swe 5 mm lópez moreno et al 2020 iv the peak swe the maximum annual amount of swe and v the date of peak swe daily melting series were calculated by performing a first order differencing day by day from the modeled daily swe series only those days when melting mm day 1 0 occurred at both hrus were considered and when the melting rate value was higher than 1 mm day 1 from daily melting series another snow index was derived vi the melting rate median value for each hru at each plot sensitivity of snow indices magnitude to combined temperature and precipitation changes was calculated for each hru at each plot the relative change of snow indices under combined temperature and precipitation perturbed scenarios with respect to observed conditions was calculated for each hru at each plot forest effects on snow processes were calculated as a percentage increase or decrease in snow indices magnitude for each hru at each plot the wilcoxon test was used to detect the significance of differences between hrus in the snow indices magnitude and in percentage of change under the different climate variations this non parametric method was used since none of the calculated indices had normal distributions shapiro wilk normality test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 sensitivity of snow processes to climate perturbation in f and o areas under increasing temperatures the modeled seasonal snowpack experienced a decrease in magnitude and duration fig 3 in scenarios that combined increased temperatures and diminished precipitation these effects were exacerbated fig a3 to better discriminate the effects of climate perturbation on forest snow interactions hereafter this study focuses on snow index responses in f and o areas increasing temperatures induced a shorter snow accumulation period more noticeable in f areas due to the delayed timing of snow accumulation onset and to an earlier timing of peak swe table 2 increasing temperature also induced a shorter melting period slightly more pronounced in o areas due to an earlier timing of melt out overall increasing temperatures induced 30 days shorter snowpack duration per c of warming in both o and f areas which was driven by later snow accumulation onset in f areas and by earlier snow depletion in o areas snowpack duration in f areas was significantly more sensitive to increasing temperatures than in o areas table a4 sensitivity of snow duration to warming showed low spatial variability f cv 0 1 o cv 0 2 nevertheless plot 4 showed the largest sensitivity values in both f and o areas followed by plot 2 while plot 3 showed the smallest sensitivity table a5 plots 4 and 2 presented the longest lasting snowpacks while plots 3 and 1 presented the most ephemeral snowpacks a 20 precipitation reduction aggravated snow duration sensitivity to warming in a similar way in both f and o areas 22 on average while a 20 precipitation increment reduced it 19 on average fig 4 increasing temperatures reduced peak swe values in absolute terms especially in o areas table 2 in relative terms the percentage of change of peak swe with warming did not significantly differ between o and f areas table a4 all plots showed similar peak swe sensitivity to warming f cv 0 1 o cv 0 1 nevertheless plot 4 showed the largest sensitivity values in both f and o areas while plot 3 showed the lowest sensitivity table a5 plot 4 presented the largest peak swe and plot 3 presented the smallest peak swe values the sensitivity of peak swe to warming was intensified with 20 precipitation reduction especially in o areas f 23 o 29 while 20 precipitation increment reduced it f 27 o 35 fig 4 melting rates experienced an overall slowdown with increasing temperature more pronounced in o areas in absolute terms table 2 in relative terms the percentage of change of melting rates with warming did not significantly differ between o and f areas table a4 the response of melting rates to warming was not linear since at lower degrees of warming a slight increase in melting rates occurred in most cases large spatial variability was found in the sensitivity of melting rates to warmer temperatures f cv 0 9 o cv 3 6 melting rates were reduced with warming in plots 2 and 4 conversely melting rates were increased under warmer conditions in plot 1 only in o areas and plot 3 plot 4 showed the highest sensitivity to warming in snow melting in absolute and relative terms followed by plot 2 while plots 3 and 1 showed the lowest sensitivity table a5 plots 4 and 2 experienced the largest melting rates while plots 1 and 3 experienced the lowest the overall reduction in melting rates with warming was intensified in a similar way in both f and o areas when a 20 precipitation reduction was considered 188 on average while with a 20 precipitation increment it was reduced 114 fig 4 3 2 sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes under different climate perturbations under observed climate conditions statistically significant forest effects on snow were found table a4 a delayed snow accumulation onset 4 days on average an earlier date of snowmelt 12 days on average and a peak swe reduction 40 on average in f areas with respect to o areas other effects under observed climate were reduction in snowpack duration 17 on average and an overall reduction in melting rates 14 on average however two different forest effects over melting rates could be discerned depending on the individual sites i forest cover enhanced the melting rates compared to o areas in plots 1 and 3 1 and 12 on average which present the most ephemeral snowpacks ii melting rates were reduced in plots 2 and 4 33 and 36 on average where the longer lasting snowpacks occurred under warming scenarios the forest effect driving delay in snow accumulation onset was enhanced 7 days per c on average fig 5 this forest effect on snow remained statistically significant under most warming climate scenarios table a4 conversely the effect of forest driving earlier snowpack melt out was reduced with warming 2 days per c on average as a result this forest effect ceased to be statistically significant under perturbed climate conditions table a4 all in all the forest driven reduction on snow duration was enhanced 10 per c warming on average thus this forest effect was statistically significant under all warming scenarios table a4 the sensitivity of the forest effect on snow duration to warming showed some spatial variability cv 0 4 plot 2 showed the largest sensitivity values for this forest effect while plot 3 showed the smallest under combined temperature increase and 20 precipitation reduction the forest driven reduction on snow duration was aggravated 32 on average while 20 precipitation increment reduced it 26 on average under increasing temperatures the forest driven reduction of peak swe did not show a substantial response 1 increased per c on average fig 5 nevertheless this forest effect remained statistically significant under most climate perturbation scenarios table a4 large spatial variability was found in the sensitivity of the forest effect on peak swe to warming cv 1 81 in plots 1 and 4 the forest driven reduction of peak swe showed small enhancement values per c in plots 2 and 3 it did not show a clear response with 20 precipitation reduction and no warming forest driven reduction of peak swe was enhanced 14 but under combined temperature increase and precipitation change the forest effect on peak swe did not show a clear response the overall forest driven reduction of melting rates became lower under increasing temperatures 2 per c on average fig 5 but the response was not linear and varied highly among sites cv 4 3 in plots 1 and 3 it was observed an enhancement of melting rates by forest under non disturbed climate conditions however under warmer conditions the forest effect shifted and a reduction of melting was observed on the contrary the forest driven reduction in melting observed under current climate in plots 2 and 4 became lower under warming conditions precipitation changes did not produce a clear response in the effects of forest on melting rates 3 3 sensitivity of snow energy balance to increasing temperatures under observed climate conditions snowpacks beneath forest canopy had 42 lower seasonal stored energy than snowpacks in forest openings on average net all wave radiation was 70 lower in f areas than in o areas on average this is because the higher net longwave radiation in the forest did not compensate for the lower net shortwave radiation fig a7 net all wave radiation contributed the most to the seasonal snow energy balance seb 69 in o areas followed by ground heat 36 on average fig a8 the ground heat was 67 higher in f areas than in o areas on average this energy flux was the most relevant component of seasonal seb in f areas 101 followed by net all wave radiation 35 on average latent heat was a negative component in both areas but in f areas its magnitude was higher than in o areas and it was much more relevant to the seb f 61 o 10 on average sensible heat was only a relevant component of seasonal seb in f areas f 22 o 3 on average advected heat from precipitation was not a relevant component of seasonal seb in f or o areas f 3 o 2 on average plot 4 showed the greatest values of net all wave radiation turbulent fluxes and advected heat from precipitation in both f and o areas and the smallest values of ground heat plot 4 also presented the lowest compensation between the higher net longwave radiation in the forest and the lower net shortwave radiation this plot located at the highest elevation presented longer lasting snowpacks that were exposed to a higher insolation time of the year late spring early summer fig a7 conversely plot 3 showed the greatest magnitude of ground heat flux in both f and o areas and presented the greatest compensation between the higher net longwave radiation in the forest and the lower net shortwave radiation this plot located at the lowest elevation was the warmest presented the densest forest and experienced the most ephemeral snowpacks under increasing temperature scenarios the average seasonal energy stored in the snowpack experienced an overall decrease more pronounced in o areas in absolute terms table 3 however in relative terms seasonal energy stored in the snowpack was relatively more sensitive to increasing temperatures in f areas net all wave radiation experienced a reduction with warming more pronounced in o areas but f areas were relatively more sensitive and its contribution to seasonal seb was also reduced f 5 per c o 9 per c on average fig 6 differences in net shortwave and net longwave radiation between f and o areas were reduced under warmer conditions 3 w m 2 24 per c and 2 w m 2 51 per c respectively and on average fig a8 thus the higher longwave radiation in the forest tended to compensate for the lower shortwave radiation with increasing temperatures ground heat was reduced under warmer temperatures much more pronounced in f areas in absolute and relative terms but its contribution to seasonal seb was enhanced f 41 per c o 9 per c on average the sensitivity of turbulent fluxes to warming was much more pronounced in f areas in absolute and relative terms where latent heat was increased and sensible heat was reduced the contribution of both turbulent fluxes to seasonal seb experienced a reduction with warming 29 and 8 per c respectively in f areas on average with almost no change in o areas in absolute terms plot 4 showed the largest reductions in net all wave radiation and turbulent fluxes while it presented the smallest reductions of ground heat table a6 however in relative terms plot 4 was the least sensitive to changes in the most relevant energy flux components to the seb net all wave radiation and ground flux while plot 3 was the most sensitive 4 discussion this study confirms the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to perturbed climate conditions increasing temperature and varying precipitation in subalpine forest stands of the spanish pyrenees and highlights how it varies spatially even among close sites understanding the relationship between mountain forests and snow processes under changing climate conditions will benefit future water and forest management objectives in similar mid latitude mountains and related lowland regions overall our results show that the crhm model sufficiently represented the quantity and timing of snow accumulation and ablation beneath forest cover and in forest openings e g in all cases the percentage of total variance of the modeled swe explained by the regression was higher than 78 and the spearman correlation coefficient between the modeled and observed swe variables was higher than 0 87 the model was able to capture the differences in snow processes in forest stands with varying microclimate conditions topography and forest structure this supports the statement of ellis et al 2010 claiming that the crhm model is a useful analytic and predictive tool for snow processes in coniferous forest environments since crhm considers the full array of physical processes involved in snow redistribution snowmelt dynamics and runoff generation as well as the main processes that mediates in the interaction between snow and canopy we think that obtained findings should not be affected by model selection the presence of forest cover affected the snowpack response to climate perturbations as expected h1 which is consistent with tennant et al 2017 some other factors that have been reported to induce variability in the response of snowpacks to a changing climate are elevation slope and aspect lópez moreno et al 2014 pierce and cayan 2013 it was observed that forest effects on snow accumulation processes were highly sensitive to warming temperatures as a consequence the forest driven reduction in snowpack duration was significantly enhanced with warming in general the forest effects on snow melting processes were diminished with warming 4 1 sensitivity of forest effects on snow accumulation processes to climate perturbations we expected to find that forest effects on snow accumulation processes were enhanced with warming climate conditions especially in a scenario with lower precipitation h2 however our hypothesis can be only partially confirmed forest driven reductions on snow accumulation were clearly enhanced with warmer climate conditions during the beginning of the snow season nevertheless the forest driven reduction in maximum accumulation was more sensitive to changes in precipitation more detail about each of these arguments is provided in the paragraphs that follow forest effects on snow accumulation were mostly enhanced with warming climate during the beginning of the snow season when the first snowfalls begin to form the snowpack first snowfalls occurred in late autumn in the study site when temperatures are still relatively warm previous studies related these conditions lower amount of snowfall and warm temperatures to more effective snow interception by forest canopy friesen et al 2015 revuelto et al 2015 under increasing temperatures it has been reported that the snowfall fraction of precipitation is reduced mote et al 2005 consequently snow interception by forest canopies was promoted it has been previously reported that interception is inversely related to snowfall magnitude sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 since trees have a limited capacity of snow interception revuelto et al 2015 dickerson lange et al 2017 described another reason why accumulation rates between o and f areas could differ in warmer climates under warmer temperatures the dominant mechanism for loss of snow stored in the canopy is melting rather than sublimation while wind unloading of snow and subsequent redistribution under the forest canopy are expected to be lower due to the higher cohesion of warm snow kobayashi 1987 shidei 1952 this could explain the increasing differences in accumulated snow at the beginning of the season between f and o areas simulated under warming conditions as well as the 7 per c enhancement of the forest driven delaying of snow accumulation the enhancement of the forest driven reduction of snow accumulation processes under warmer conditions was not markedly reflected in the peak swe values the forest driven reduction in peak swe remained significant under warmer conditions but it was not significantly enhanced by warming 1 per c this forest effect was more sensitive to precipitation changes than to temperature warming as 20 reduction in precipitation and no warming induced 15 enhancement of the forest driven reduction in peak swe greater declines of peak swe were found in forest openings compared to under forest canopies for every c of warming according to fang and pomeroy 2020 projections in relative terms peak swe decreased 29 per c across all sites which corresponds to the 20 decrease per c sensitivity values of mean swe to warming that have been reported in previous studies developed in the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2013 2017 4 2 sensitivity of forest effects on snow melting processes to climate perturbations warming can accelerate the initiation of snowmelt rasouli et al 2015 thus it was observed that the date of peak swe occurred earlier under warming conditions although the main period of snowmelt shifted forward into a lower solar irradiance period the melt out date occurred earlier as temperatures increased rasouli et al 2015 in o areas this response was more pronounced due to the greater decline of peak swe with warming compared to forest areas roth and nolin 2017 observed how the effects of reduced solar inputs in forests become secondary and the efficiency of the canopy interception is the main factor controlling the melt out date therefore differences between f and o areas in the timing of melt out significantly decreased with warming and the effect of forest driving earlier snowpack melt out was reduced 2 days per c on average the overall forest shading effect on melting that takes place in our study area was diminished under warmer conditions 2 per c conversely no clear influence of precipitation changes was found in that response as previously mentioned the melt season occurred earlier with increasing temperatures thus it shortened to a period of lower available energy this means that in a warmer world much less snow cover will be exposed to high energy fluxes sufficient to drive moderate to high snowmelt rates musselman et al 2017 for this reason an overall reduction in melting rates with warming 0 4 mm day 1 per c was observed this melting slow down under warmer temperatures was more pronounced in o areas they experienced a greater shortening of the period of higher energy because of a larger advancement to earlier melt out dates as a consequence o areas showed larger reductions in the available energy to melt therefore the overall differences between f and o areas in the available energy to melt and thus in melting rates decreased with warming and the overall forest driven reduction of melting rates was reduced in addition this forest effect over melting rates may be undermined under an earlier snowmelt scenario because the solar angle will be lower and the amount of incoming radiation blocked by the forest canopy will therefore be smaller lundquist et al 2013 4 3 different seasonal seb responses to climate perturbation in forested and open areas some differences arose in seasonal seb and its sensitivity to warming between f and o areas most studies that have focused on both measuring and modeling the snow cover energy balance reported that radiation and turbulent fluxes are the main energy sources for melting e g ellis et al 2010 gelfan et al 2004 hardy et al 1998 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 hotovy and jenicek 2020 lópez moreno et al 2017 sicart et al 2004 our results partially agree with their findings because net all wave radiation and ground heat followed by latent heat dominated the seasonal seb ground heat generally represents a relatively minor component in seasonal sebs hotovy and jenicek 2020 nevertheless in this study ground heat flux became especially important in f areas maybe due to better radiance transmission to the soil in these partially snow covered areas lund et al 2017 turbulent energy fluxes were found to be more relevant contributions to seasonal seb in f areas relative to o areas contrary to marks et al 1998 observations advected heat from precipitation adds rather negligible additional energy to the seasonal seb in any of the studied sites similar to that reported by other studies hotovy and jenicek 2020 in a warmer climate the importance of rain heat input into the snowpack is expected to increase as more precipitation will fall as rain than as snow jenicek et al 2018b musselman et al 2018 but a relevant increase of rain advected heat contribution to seasonal seb was not observed it is known that forest cover attenuates the transmittance of shortwave radiation and enhances longwave irradiance to the snow surface ellis et al 2011 essery et al 2008 lundquist et al 2013 musselman et al 2008 shortwave energy reduction was the dominant effect in the study area hence net all wave radiation and melting were reduced in f areas as previously reported dickerson lange et al 2017 link and marks 1999 musselman et al 2012 sicart et al 2004 under warmer conditions net radiative fluxes decreased as a result of earlier snowmelt timing especially in o areas this decline is mainly caused by reduced shortwave radiation leading the melt period to shift earlier in the year towards lower solar zenith angles and shorter daylight lengths jennings and molotch 2020 lundquist et al 2013 additionally overall longwave radiation decreased with warming because of the earlier melt period jennings and molotch 2020 observed that the advance of snowmelt timing decreased melting period air temperatures and resultant incoming longwave radiation which has a greater effect than the applied melting 4 4 spatial variability of forest snow interactions under a changing climate in a previous study it was observed that the magnitude and timing of the forest effects on snow processes varied significantly among closely located stands in the study area sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 in the current study deeper and more persistent snowpacks were found in forest stands with more snow accumulation and lower rates of ablation promoted by a more efficient forest shading effect plots 2 and 4 whereas shallower snow conditions were found in forest stands with lower snow accumulation and higher rates of ablation promoted by a more efficient forest heating effect plots 1 and 3 broxton et al 2020 attributed the differences in accumulation and ablation under forest cover to the prevailing aspect north or south of the slopes our results indicate differential behavior of snow accumulation and ablation under forest canopy in the sites more exposed to sunlight west and south faced slopes i e plots 3 and 1 with respect to north and east faced slopes plots 4 and 2 however the small number of experimental plots does not allow to statistically attribute the observed differences to the slope dependent response of snowpack to forest cover observed by broxton et al 2020 it has been reported that a regional increase in temperature may have different effects on snow processes at the local scale depending on elevation topography and exposure to wind and solar radiation lópez moreno et al 2013 in accordance with this and confirming h4 it also was found that sensitivity of forest snow interactions to perturbed climate conditions largely varied among neighboring forest stands higher and slightly colder sites have been reported to be less sensitive to the effects of climate warming on snow accumulation snow energy balance and snowmelt harpold et al 2012 kapnick and hall 2012 lópez moreno et al 2017 mote et al 2018 musselman et al 2017 rasouli et al 2019 our results cannot confirm these observations probably because of the local scale of our study the coldest and highest site analyzed in this study plot 4 showed the largest reductions in snow accumulation and energy available for melting and thus the largest reductions in melting rates with warming the reported increased efficiency in snow interception with warming temperatures friesen et al 2015 and subsequent enhanced forest driven reduction in snow accumulation revuelto et al 2015 could be more pronounced in plots with higher lai values hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 varhola et al 2010 this may explain the observed enhanced forest driven reduction in snowpack duration with warming especially in plot 2 while the warmest and lowest site with the lowest lai values plot 3 showed the least sensitivity it is known that conifer forests modify the snowpack energy balance by reducing the total amount of shortwave radiation and enhancing total longwave exchange with that emitted by trees which results in both shading and heating effects respectively sicart et al 2004 in this study one forest effect prevailed over the other during the snow season depending on the analyzed forest stand in plots 2 and 4 the forest driven reduction in melting rates shading effect was more pronounced than in plots 1 and 3 plots 2 and 4 presented longer lasting snowpacks than plots 1 and 3 mainly due to higher snow accumulation more ephemeral snowpacks did not resist long enough into the late spring to benefit from the forest shading effect lundquist et al 2013 roth and nolin 2017 sicart et al 2004 thus in plots 1 and 3 there was more marked forest driven increment in melting rates heating effect in these stands the higher longwave radiation by trees compensated the lower shortwave radiation under warmer conditions both heating and shading forest effects were reduced in the studied forest stands as expected h3 it was found that under an earlier snowmelt i e lower incoming energy scenario melting rates beneath the forest canopy became similar to those in open areas because differences in net shortwave and net longwave radiation between f and o areas were reduced under warmer conditions thus the higher longwave radiation in the forest tended to compensate for the lower shortwave radiation with increasing temperatures therefore in those sites where the forest shading effect was prevalent plots 2 and 4 the high melt rate period experienced a greater constriction i e high energy period and thus a higher reduction of melting rates was observed the undermined shading effect of forest over snowpack under an earlier snowmelt scenario was especially pronounced in plot 2 the forest heating effect was reduced in those sites where it was prevalent plots 1 and 3 may be because of the lower tree absorption of solar radiation and subsequent lower thermal emissivity that occurs earlier in the year lundquist et al 2013 in addition the shift in melt timing with warming also decreased net longwave radiation as melt period air temperatures decreased because a shift of snowmelt timing can have a greater effect on air temperatures than induced warming jennings and molotch 2020 and might contribute to diminishing the forest heating effect on melting the undermined warming effect of forest over snowpack under an earlier snowmelt scenario was especially pronounced in plot 3 our simulations of snow forest interactions were restricted to four forest stands each of them showing particular environmental characteristics this represents certain limitation for identifying the different roles of climate topography and forest structure on the observed variability in forest effects on snow processes and energy balance under climate change conditions our simulations were validated with manual and semi automated measurements making it difficult to increase the number of study sites due to the significant manual labor and time required for fieldwork in such environments 5 conclusions forest snow interactions showed large sensitivity to perturbed climate conditions in the studied mountain forests forest driven reductions on snow accumulation were clearly enhanced with warmer climate conditions during the beginning of the snow season nevertheless the forest driven reduction in maximum accumulation was more sensitive to changes in precipitation on the other hand an increase in temperature reduced the heating and shading effects of the forest on snowmelt it was found a significant enhancement of forest driven reduction in snowpack duration under warming conditions 10 per c in a drier and warmer climate scenario the forest effects on snow accumulation processes could be enhanced while greater precipitation could partially mask these effects under warmer conditions both shading and heating forest effects could be reduced but no clear responses were found under combined temperature and precipitation perturbations the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to perturbed climate conditions varied among nearby stands sites with higher canopy interception showed higher warming sensitivity in forest effects on snow accumulation processes while the duration of the snowpack seemed to determine the prevailing effect of the forest on melting processes shading or heating and thus its response to warming the ability to identify the different roles of climate topography and forest structure is however limited by the low

3724,mountain forests affect spatial and temporal variability of snow processes through snow interception and by modifying the energy balance of snowpack the high sensitivity of snow cover to seasonal temperatures in mid latitude mountains is well known and is of particular interest with regard to a future warmer climate the snowpack in the pyrenees is expected to be the most impacted by climate change in the mediterranean mountains where future climate trends project rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation this study analyzes how changes in temperature and precipitation can affect current forest snow interactions in four forests located near each other but under contrasting topographic settings in the spanish pyrenees this understanding will allow us to anticipate the future hydrological responses of pyrenean forested mountain basins the research was accomplished by performing a sensitivity analysis using simulations from the cold regions hydrological model crhm and by comparing forest canopy sites f vs openings o the crhm platform focuses on the incorporation of physically based descriptions of snow dominated regions hydrological processes it was found that forest cover induced different snowpack sensibility to climatic change conditions in the studied forests delayed onset of snow accumulation f 13 days c 1 o 5 days c 1 and reduced snowpack duration f 28 c 1 o

20 precipitation increment could reduce it 26 there was relevant topographic variability in the forest snow interactions in response to climate change among the study stands despite their proximity keywords cold regions hydrological model crhm snow processes snowpack mountain forest warming snow water equivalent swe 1 introduction the importance of snow in mountains ranges from its role as an essential eco hydrological resource to the economic activities associated with it mid latitude mountain snowpacks represent a natural freshwater reservoir by storing solid water in winter and releasing it as snowmelt runoff in spring summer when human activity demands are usually highest barnett et al 2005 additionally snowpack variability affects ecological processes such as forest growth vaganov et al 1999 plant phenology asam et al 2018 soil water stress harpold 2016 and wildfire activity westerling 2016 seasonal snowpack is affected by complex interactions between meteorological conditions topography and vegetation bednorz 2004 ellis et al 2013 huerta et al 2019 lundquist and cayan 2007 snow processes are heavily influenced by forest cover since mid and high elevation forests co exist across a large range of altitudes with mountain snow broxton et al 2020 tree leaves and branches intercept snow during winter which affects under canopy snow accumulation varhola et al 2010 canopy interception generally leads to shallower snowpacks in forested areas relative to open areas because a significant proportion of the snow stored in the canopy sublimates or melts molotch et al 2007 storck et al 2002 trees shelter the surface from wind which modifies snow transport by wind and thus snow accumulation patterns compared to open areas hiemstra et al 2002 additionally mountain forests alter the energy balance of the snowpack and thus condition snowmelt in different and complex ways sicart et al 2004 for example forest litter deposited over the under canopy snowpack reduces snow albedo and increases shortwave absorption by the snowpack hardy et al 2000 forest cover can diminish melting rates by reducing shortwave radiation reaching the snowpack surface i e shading effect ellis et al 2011 musselman et al 2015 on the other hand longwave radiation can be enhanced in forested areas as a result of shortwave absorption by trees and consequent heating during the day the forest canopy generally has a higher thermal emissivity than the clear sky during the night i e heating effect which can compensate for shortwave reduction by the shade effect with consequent increase of melt rate essery et al 2008 lundquist et al 2013 sicart et al 2006 the balance between reduced accumulation and diminished or enhanced melting determines snowpack duration in forests which can be shortened or extended relative to open areas dickerson lange et al 2017 the nature and extent of forest influences on snowpack rely on forest structure topography orientation elevation seasonality and regional climate among others currier and lundquist 2018 jost et al 2007 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 moeser et al 2016 pomeroy et al 2002 roth and nolin 2017 many studies have investigated the impacts of current climate change on snow processes and related effects on stream flows in the main mid latitude mountain ranges such as reductions in snow accumulation and accelerated rain on snow processes which are expected to induce a shift to earlier snowmelt onset and melt out e g adam et al 2009 beniston 2012 fang and pomeroy 2020 marshall et al 2019 morán tejeda et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2015 rasouli et al 2015 sun et al 2016 however the sensitivity of snow processes to climate change may differ depending on regional climates and the physiographic characteristics of different mountain ranges evan and eisenman 2021 lópez moreno et al 2017 marshall et al 2019 shrestha et al 2021 this issue is especially relevant in mediterranean climate mountains as they are considered hot spots for climate change impacts and the consequences may seriously affect the ecosystems hydrological resources and the economy of these regions giorgi and lionello 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 the future climate trends projected for mediterranean mountains indicate rising temperatures between 1 6 c and 8 3 c for 2085 as well as a reduction of precipitation between 4 8 and 17 for 2085 nogués bravo et al 2008 previous research determined that mediterranean snowpacks are very sensitive to temperature increases lópez moreno et al 2017 although the extent of the change varied among mountain ranges the spanish pyrenees is expected to be the european mountain range most impacted by climate change in terms of mean swe and snowpack duration lópez moreno et al 2017 understanding how forest cover can affect the sensitivity of snowpack to changes in climate will allow us to anticipate future hydrological responses of pyrenean forested mountain basins under climate change conditions ellis et al 2013 fang and pomeroy 2020 lópez moreno et al 2020 rasouli et al 2019 tennant et al 2017 research regarding the interactions between forest and snow in the spanish pyrenees e g lópez moreno and latron 2008 revuelto et al 2015 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 observed that snow accumulation was 40 50 lower in areas beneath the forest canopy compared to forest openings while the overall melting rate was reduced by 25 in forested areas the forest cover reduced the annual peaks of snow accumulation by 50 and the snowpack duration by more than two weeks the relative earlier snow disappearance in forested areas was mainly explained by greater forest driven reduction of accumulation rate in combination with occasional forest driven enhancement of melting rate however the magnitude and timing of these forest snow interactions had significant spatial and temporal variations based on these observations and on related previous research a series of hypotheses h1 to h4 were raised on how forest effects on snow may respond to climate change conditions in the pyrenees since climate mediates forest snow interactions involving snow accumulation currier and lundquist 2018 and melting processes dickerson lange et al 2017 h1 it was expected that snowpacks in areas beneath forest canopy and in forest openings might respond differently to a changing climate previous work has attributed higher canopy interception efficiency to warmer temperatures friesen et al 2015 and to a lower amount of snowfall revuelto et al 2015 thus h2 it was expected that forest effects on snow accumulation processes might be enhanced under warming climate conditions especially in a scenario that has less precipitation in a warmer climate the main melt season is projected to occur earlier and thus to shorten to a period of lower available energy to melt musselman et al 2017 as the melt period shifts earlier in the year away from the summer solstice the forest shading effect might be weaker because of the lower solar zenith angle lundquist et al 2013 in a snowmelt scenario of lower energy the forest heating effect might be smaller due to lower penetration of solar radiation into the forest i e lower shortwave absorption by trees and the subsequent lower thermal emissivity lundquist et al 2013 in addition the shift in melt timing with warming also decreased net longwave radiation as melt period air temperatures decreased because the shift of snowmelt timing can have a greater effect on air temperatures than the induced warming jennings and molotch 2020 this might contribute to diminishing the forest heating effect on melting thus h3 it was expected that both forest effects shading and heating on snow melting processes might be diminished with warming it has been previously observed that the magnitude and timing of the forest effects on snow processes varied significantly among forest stands despite their proximity sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 topography elevation and forest structure are relevant factors among others that explained why the forest snow interactions vary spatially jenicek et al 2018a musselman et al 2012 roth and nolin 2017 thus h4 it was expected that the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to climate change might show significant spatial variability in nearby areas this study investigates how forest cover can affect the snowpack response to changes in climate in four nearby sub alpine conifer forests in the pyrenees for this purpose a sensitive analysis was done by simulating the shifts in snow water equivalent swe and snowpack energy balance seb at each forest stand under various degrees of climate forcing comparing areas beneath forest canopy f and forest openings o during four snow seasons 2016 17 2019 20 simulations were done using the forest snow process modules in the cold regions hydrological model crhm which were evaluated against field observations crhm is particularly well suited to the aim of this study and the study area since this model has focused on the incorporation of physically based descriptions of cold regions hydrological processes such as forest canopy snow interception drip and unloading blowing snow canopy influence on radiation energy balance snowmelt or long wave radiation in complex terrain pomeroy et al 2007 the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to estimate how forest cover affects the sensitivity of snowpack to changes in climate 2 to evaluate whether forest driven effects on snow processes were enhanced or reduced under changing climate conditions and 3 to explore spatial variability in the sensitivity of forest effects on snowpack to changing climate conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study sites the study was performed in the central spanish pyrenees in the northeastern iberian peninsula fig 1 this mountain range is located in the transition area of the temperate continental atlantic eurosiberian and mild dry mediterranean climates del barrio et al 1990 the experimental setting comprised four forest stands located in the balneario de panticosa valley which constitutes the headwater of the caldarés river a pyrenean tributary of the ebro river basin in each forest an experimental plot of approximately 450 m2 was designed the plots were labeled plot 1 plot 2 plot 3 and plot 4 based on their locations in the valley

rather small plot 1 was also the steepest plot and mostly faced southward it also had the lowest wind speed values plot 2 had a relatively dense forest its exposure was mostly eastward and its winter temperatures and snow accumulation were similar to those of plot 1 plot 3 had the lowest elevation was the flattest plot and faced westward this plot had a relatively high canopy cover and received a relatively high irradiance plot 3 also had the warmest winter temperatures the largest irradiance and lower snow accumulation plot 4 had the highest elevation and faced northeastward this plot had the lowest tree density and canopy cover the greatest wind speeds the coldest winter temperatures and the deepest snowpacks 2 2 data sources from october 2016 to may 2020 2016 17 2017 18 2018 19 and 2019

at each plot three poles were placed in a forest opening o and five were placed beneath the forest canopy f at each plot photographs were processed using imagej software rasband 1997 to manually obtain a daily snow depth series for the set of poles at each experimental plot snow water equivalent was manually surveyed every 10 to 15 days using a snow cylinder and scale eth core sampler swiss federal institute of technology zurich at snow pits dug at two single locations in each plot one in a forest opening and one below the forest canopy two replicates per location were collected snow

flexible and physically based modeling system created to simulate a range of hydrological processes in mountainous and cold regions the full description of crhm is provided by pomeroy et al 2007 and the software is available for downloading at https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling crhm php download crhm has been applied to diverse environments including artic alpine and subalpine areas debeer and pomeroy 2010 ellis et al 2010 fang and pomeroy 2020 krogh et al 2015 lópez moreno et al 2020 rasouli et al 2015 the crhm platform has a modular structure that can address the wide range of processes typical of regions where snow has a key role in the cycle e g snow redistribution by wind snow interception by forest canopies snow sublimation or snow melting users can construct their own model by selecting modules from the platform library based on input data availability the predictive variable of interest and research scale it can be used to forecast diagnose and understand hydrological processes due to its heavy reliance on physically based process parameterizations crhm was applied at each study plot which were divided in two hydrological response units hrus on the basis of forest cover i e forest openings o and areas beneath forest canopy f selection of the crhm modules was based on the characteristics of the study plots and the available climate data as presented in table a1 parameters have been adapted to each study plot based on field measurements or by estimation based on other similar snow dominated areas table a2 climate data for the period 2016 17 2019 20 were used as the input to the crhm platform the climate database was converted into crhm observations using the crhmr r package shook 2016 outputs of interest include hourly values of swe and seb components net all wave radiation net longwave radiation net shortwave radiation net latent heat turbulent flux net sensible heat turbulent flux energy from rainfall advection net ground heat flux and the change in internal energy of snow for each hru during the period 2016 17 2019 20 4 snow seasons crhm resolves the snow energy balance as the sum of irradiative turbulent advective and conductive energy fluxes ellis et al 2010 swe series and energy fluxes were outputs from the snobalcrhm module the exception was the net long and shortwave radiation fluxes which were outputs from the canopyclearinggap module crhm output databases were post processed using the crhmr r package shook 2016 hourly series were converted into daily data by taking the maximum value reached each day in the case of swe series and the mean value of each day in the case of energy fluxes the studied snow seasons were representative of a wider range of local snow conditions daily maximum swe series from 2008 to 2019 were obtained from a near tele snow gauge operated by saih che n0004 bachimaña values of peak swe seasonal average swe and snowpack duration of analyzed snow seasons were within the range of percentiles 20 35 of the whole series 2 3 2 evaluation of model performance observed swe daily series at each plot and hru during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 snow seasons were compared to the model outputs to evaluate model performance in terms of the ability to represent a the variation in peak swe and snowpack duration between hrus the peak swe is the maximum annual amount of swe recorded at each hru while the duration of the snowpack was calculated as the number of days per year having a swe 5 mm lópez moreno et al 2020 b the magnitude of daily swe at individual sites for a and b above model performance was assessed by the following three measures described in ellis et al 2010 the model bias index mb the model efficiency index me and the root mean square error rmse the mb index compares the total simulation output to the total of observations the me index gives an indication of model performance compared to the mean of the observations and the rmse index quantifies the absolute unit error between simulations and observations correlations using the spearman coefficient rho were calculated between modeled and observed swe variables this non parametric method was used since analyzed variables had not normal distributions shapiro wilk test p value 0 05 swe estimates showed general good agreement with observed swe during both analyzed snow seasons fig 2 mb 1 01 a slight overestimation of daily swe in areas beneath forest canopy in plots 1 and 4 during 2016 17 snow season was observed table a3 this could point to an underestimation of the interception effect by forest on the other hand certain snow accumulation events were underestimated e g april 2017 in plot 4 estimates represented pretty well the inter plot variability in general me 0 94 although the model s efficiency is reduced in areas beneath forest canopy the rmse value for all sites was 49 mm of daily swe greater absolute errors were found in forest openings a high positive correlation was found between modeled and observed daily swe data fig a1 when all areas beneath forest canopy rho 0 91 p value 0 001 were considered and all forest openings rho 0 95 p value 0 001 certain inter plot variability was observed in the correlation between modeled and observed daily swe data but in all cases it was statistically significant rho 0 87 in all cases the percentage of total variance of the modeled swe explained by the regression was higher than 78 fig a1 apparently overestimation errors happened more frequently when low daily swe values occurred in forested areas especially in plots 1 and 4 fig a2 similarly underestimation errors in forested areas were more frequent when greater daily swe occurred especially above 400 mm no evident relationship between model errors and the observed magnitude of swe in forest openings was found simulations showed minor underestimation of peak swe mb 0 94 fig 2 this strong correspondence occurred in both forest openings and areas beneath forest canopy estimates also represented well the peak swe variability among plots based on the me index value me 0 94 although the model efficiency was reduced in areas beneath forest canopy the rmse of peak swe 78 mm in areas beneath the forest canopy was slightly greater than that found in forest openings in general terms the simulation of snow duration was accurate mb 0 99 despite swe being slightly overestimated in areas beneath the forest canopy and slightly underestimated in forest openings fig 2 model efficiency in snow duration me 0 80 was higher in areas beneath the forest canopy than in forest openings the rmse of snow duration was 17 days for all sites and areas in forest openings it was 7 days higher than in areas beneath forest canopy summarizing the crhm model performed sufficiently well in capturing the snow accumulation and ablation magnitude and timing to be used for sensitivity analysis to climate in the four study sites and f o areas estimates did not show systematic errors that might interfere with conclusions drawn from subsequent climate analysis 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the response of forest effect on snow processes to changing climate conditions for this purpose swe and energy fluxes were simulated under scenarios of combined temperature and precipitation departs from the control period 2016 17 2019 20 air temperature and precipitation were modified in the observation module of the crhm platform temperature was forced to increase from 1 c to 4 c and precipitation was considered to change from 20 to 20 yielding a total of 14 scenarios of perturbed climate the 20 value approximates the uncertainty of precipitation simulated in climate models for the mediterranean region knutti and sedláček 2013 relative humidity was assumed to be constant under temperature forcing climate forced crhm outputs were again postprocessed using the crhmr r package shook 2016 hourly series were converted into daily data by taking the maximum value reached each day in the case of the swe series and the mean value of each day in the case of energy fluxes from the modeled daily swe series several snow indices were derived for each hru at each plot for further analysis i the snow accumulation onset date of first day having swe 5 mm ii the melt out date last date having swe 5 mm iii the snow duration number of days annually having swe 5 mm lópez moreno et al 2020 iv the peak swe the maximum annual amount of swe and v the date of peak swe daily melting series were calculated by performing a first order differencing day by day from the modeled daily swe series only those days when melting mm day 1 0 occurred at both hrus were considered and when the melting rate value was higher than 1 mm day 1 from daily melting series another snow index was derived vi the melting rate median value for each hru at each plot sensitivity of snow indices magnitude to combined temperature and precipitation changes was calculated for each hru at each plot the relative change of snow indices under combined temperature and precipitation perturbed scenarios with respect to observed conditions was calculated for each hru at each plot forest effects on snow processes were calculated as a percentage increase or decrease in snow indices magnitude for each hru at each plot the wilcoxon test was used to detect the significance of differences between hrus in the snow indices magnitude and in percentage of change under the different climate variations this non parametric method was used since none of the calculated indices had normal distributions shapiro wilk normality test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 sensitivity of snow processes to climate perturbation in f and o areas under increasing temperatures the modeled seasonal snowpack experienced a decrease in magnitude and duration fig 3 in scenarios that combined increased temperatures and diminished precipitation these effects were exacerbated fig a3 to better discriminate the effects of climate perturbation on forest snow interactions hereafter this study focuses on snow index responses in f and o areas increasing temperatures induced a shorter snow accumulation period more noticeable in f areas due to the delayed timing of snow accumulation onset and to an earlier timing of peak swe table 2 increasing temperature also induced a shorter melting period slightly more pronounced in o areas due to an earlier timing of melt out overall increasing temperatures induced 30 days shorter snowpack duration per c of warming in both o and f areas which was driven by later snow accumulation onset in f areas and by earlier snow depletion in o areas snowpack duration in f areas was significantly more sensitive to increasing temperatures than in o areas table a4 sensitivity of snow duration to warming showed low spatial variability f cv 0 1 o cv 0 2 nevertheless plot 4 showed the largest sensitivity values in both f and o areas followed by plot 2 while plot 3 showed the smallest sensitivity table a5 plots 4 and 2 presented the longest lasting snowpacks while plots 3 and 1 presented the most ephemeral snowpacks a 20 precipitation reduction aggravated snow duration sensitivity to warming in a similar way in both f and o areas 22 on average while a 20 precipitation increment reduced it 19 on average fig 4 increasing temperatures reduced peak swe values in absolute terms especially in o areas table 2 in relative terms the percentage of change of peak swe with warming did not significantly differ between o and f areas table a4 all plots showed similar peak swe sensitivity to warming f cv 0 1 o cv 0 1 nevertheless plot 4 showed the largest sensitivity values in both f and o areas while plot 3 showed the lowest sensitivity table a5 plot 4 presented the largest peak swe and plot 3 presented the smallest peak swe values the sensitivity of peak swe to warming was intensified with 20 precipitation reduction especially in o areas f 23 o 29 while 20 precipitation increment reduced it f 27 o 35 fig 4 melting rates experienced an overall slowdown with increasing temperature more pronounced in o areas in absolute terms table 2 in relative terms the percentage of change of melting rates with warming did not significantly differ between o and f areas table a4 the response of melting rates to warming was not linear since at lower degrees of warming a slight increase in melting rates occurred in most cases large spatial variability was found in the sensitivity of melting rates to warmer temperatures f cv 0 9 o cv 3 6 melting rates were reduced with warming in plots 2 and 4 conversely melting rates were increased under warmer conditions in plot 1 only in o areas and plot 3 plot 4 showed the highest sensitivity to warming in snow melting in absolute and relative terms followed by plot 2 while plots 3 and 1 showed the lowest sensitivity table a5 plots 4 and 2 experienced the largest melting rates while plots 1 and 3 experienced the lowest the overall reduction in melting rates with warming was intensified in a similar way in both f and o areas when a 20 precipitation reduction was considered 188 on average while with a 20 precipitation increment it was reduced 114 fig 4 3 2 sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes under different climate perturbations under observed climate conditions statistically significant forest effects on snow were found table a4 a delayed snow accumulation onset 4 days on average an earlier date of snowmelt 12 days on average and a peak swe reduction 40 on average in f areas with respect to o areas other effects under observed climate were reduction in snowpack duration 17 on average and an overall reduction in melting rates 14 on average however two different forest effects over melting rates could be discerned depending on the individual sites i forest cover enhanced the melting rates compared to o areas in plots 1 and 3 1 and 12 on average which present the most ephemeral snowpacks ii melting rates were reduced in plots 2 and 4 33 and 36 on average where the longer lasting snowpacks occurred under warming scenarios the forest effect driving delay in snow accumulation onset was enhanced 7 days per c on average fig 5 this forest effect on snow remained statistically significant under most warming climate scenarios table a4 conversely the effect of forest driving earlier snowpack melt out was reduced with warming 2 days per c on average as a result this forest effect ceased to be statistically significant under perturbed climate conditions table a4 all in all the forest driven reduction on snow duration was enhanced 10 per c warming on average thus this forest effect was statistically significant under all warming scenarios table a4 the sensitivity of the forest effect on snow duration to warming showed some spatial variability cv 0 4 plot 2 showed the largest sensitivity values for this forest effect while plot 3 showed the smallest under combined temperature increase and 20 precipitation reduction the forest driven reduction on snow duration was aggravated 32 on average while 20 precipitation increment reduced it 26 on average under increasing temperatures the forest driven reduction of peak swe did not show a substantial response 1 increased per c on average fig 5 nevertheless this forest effect remained statistically significant under most climate perturbation scenarios table a4 large spatial variability was found in the sensitivity of the forest effect on peak swe to warming cv 1 81 in plots 1 and 4 the forest driven reduction of peak swe showed small enhancement values per c in plots 2 and 3 it did not show a clear response with 20 precipitation reduction and no warming forest driven reduction of peak swe was enhanced 14 but under combined temperature increase and precipitation change the forest effect on peak swe did not show a clear response the overall forest driven reduction of melting rates became lower under increasing temperatures 2 per c on average fig 5 but the response was not linear and varied highly among sites cv 4 3 in plots 1 and 3 it was observed an enhancement of melting rates by forest under non disturbed climate conditions however under warmer conditions the forest effect shifted and a reduction of melting was observed on the contrary the forest driven reduction in melting observed under current climate in plots 2 and 4 became lower under warming conditions precipitation changes did not produce a clear response in the effects of forest on melting rates 3 3 sensitivity of snow energy balance to increasing temperatures under observed climate conditions snowpacks beneath forest canopy had 42 lower seasonal stored energy than snowpacks in forest openings on average net all wave radiation was 70 lower in f areas than in o areas on average this is because the higher net longwave radiation in the forest did not compensate for the lower net shortwave radiation fig a7 net all wave radiation contributed the most to the seasonal snow energy balance seb 69 in o areas followed by ground heat 36 on average fig a8 the ground heat was 67 higher in f areas than in o areas on average this energy flux was the most relevant component of seasonal seb in f areas 101 followed by net all wave radiation 35 on average latent heat was a negative component in both areas but in f areas its magnitude was higher than in o areas and it was much more relevant to the seb f 61 o 10 on average sensible heat was only a relevant component of seasonal seb in f areas f 22 o 3 on average advected heat from precipitation was not a relevant component of seasonal seb in f or o areas f 3 o 2 on average plot 4 showed the greatest values of net all wave radiation turbulent fluxes and advected heat from precipitation in both f and o areas and the smallest values of ground heat plot 4 also presented the lowest compensation between the higher net longwave radiation in the forest and the lower net shortwave radiation this plot located at the highest elevation presented longer lasting snowpacks that were exposed to a higher insolation time of the year late spring early summer fig a7 conversely plot 3 showed the greatest magnitude of ground heat flux in both f and o areas and presented the greatest compensation between the higher net longwave radiation in the forest and the lower net shortwave radiation this plot located at the lowest elevation was the warmest presented the densest forest and experienced the most ephemeral snowpacks under increasing temperature scenarios the average seasonal energy stored in the snowpack experienced an overall decrease more pronounced in o areas in absolute terms table 3 however in relative terms seasonal energy stored in the snowpack was relatively more sensitive to increasing temperatures in f areas net all wave radiation experienced a reduction with warming more pronounced in o areas but f areas were relatively more sensitive and its contribution to seasonal seb was also reduced f 5 per c o 9 per c on average fig 6 differences in net shortwave and net longwave radiation between f and o areas were reduced under warmer conditions 3 w m 2 24 per c and 2 w m 2 51 per c respectively and on average fig a8 thus the higher longwave radiation in the forest tended to compensate for the lower shortwave radiation with increasing temperatures ground heat was reduced under warmer temperatures much more pronounced in f areas in absolute and relative terms but its contribution to seasonal seb was enhanced f 41 per c o 9 per c on average the sensitivity of turbulent fluxes to warming was much more pronounced in f areas in absolute and relative terms where latent heat was increased and sensible heat was reduced the contribution of both turbulent fluxes to seasonal seb experienced a reduction with warming 29 and 8 per c respectively in f areas on average with almost no change in o areas in absolute terms plot 4 showed the largest reductions in net all wave radiation and turbulent fluxes while it presented the smallest reductions of ground heat table a6 however in relative terms plot 4 was the least sensitive to changes in the most relevant energy flux components to the seb net all wave radiation and ground flux while plot 3 was the most sensitive 4 discussion this study confirms the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to perturbed climate conditions increasing temperature and varying precipitation in subalpine forest stands of the spanish pyrenees and highlights how it varies spatially even among close sites understanding the relationship between mountain forests and snow processes under changing climate conditions will benefit future water and forest management objectives in similar mid latitude mountains and related lowland regions overall our results show that the crhm model sufficiently represented the quantity and timing of snow accumulation and ablation beneath forest cover and in forest openings e g in all cases the percentage of total variance of the modeled swe explained by the regression was higher than 78 and the spearman correlation coefficient between the modeled and observed swe variables was higher than 0 87 the model was able to capture the differences in snow processes in forest stands with varying microclimate conditions topography and forest structure this supports the statement of ellis et al 2010 claiming that the crhm model is a useful analytic and predictive tool for snow processes in coniferous forest environments since crhm considers the full array of physical processes involved in snow redistribution snowmelt dynamics and runoff generation as well as the main processes that mediates in the interaction between snow and canopy we think that obtained findings should not be affected by model selection the presence of forest cover affected the snowpack response to climate perturbations as expected h1 which is consistent with tennant et al 2017 some other factors that have been reported to induce variability in the response of snowpacks to a changing climate are elevation slope and aspect lópez moreno et al 2014 pierce and cayan 2013 it was observed that forest effects on snow accumulation processes were highly sensitive to warming temperatures as a consequence the forest driven reduction in snowpack duration was significantly enhanced with warming in general the forest effects on snow melting processes were diminished with warming 4 1 sensitivity of forest effects on snow accumulation processes to climate perturbations we expected to find that forest effects on snow accumulation processes were enhanced with warming climate conditions especially in a scenario with lower precipitation h2 however our hypothesis can be only partially confirmed forest driven reductions on snow accumulation were clearly enhanced with warmer climate conditions during the beginning of the snow season nevertheless the forest driven reduction in maximum accumulation was more sensitive to changes in precipitation more detail about each of these arguments is provided in the paragraphs that follow forest effects on snow accumulation were mostly enhanced with warming climate during the beginning of the snow season when the first snowfalls begin to form the snowpack first snowfalls occurred in late autumn in the study site when temperatures are still relatively warm previous studies related these conditions lower amount of snowfall and warm temperatures to more effective snow interception by forest canopy friesen et al 2015 revuelto et al 2015 under increasing temperatures it has been reported that the snowfall fraction of precipitation is reduced mote et al 2005 consequently snow interception by forest canopies was promoted it has been previously reported that interception is inversely related to snowfall magnitude sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 since trees have a limited capacity of snow interception revuelto et al 2015 dickerson lange et al 2017 described another reason why accumulation rates between o and f areas could differ in warmer climates under warmer temperatures the dominant mechanism for loss of snow stored in the canopy is melting rather than sublimation while wind unloading of snow and subsequent redistribution under the forest canopy are expected to be lower due to the higher cohesion of warm snow kobayashi 1987 shidei 1952 this could explain the increasing differences in accumulated snow at the beginning of the season between f and o areas simulated under warming conditions as well as the 7 per c enhancement of the forest driven delaying of snow accumulation the enhancement of the forest driven reduction of snow accumulation processes under warmer conditions was not markedly reflected in the peak swe values the forest driven reduction in peak swe remained significant under warmer conditions but it was not significantly enhanced by warming 1 per c this forest effect was more sensitive to precipitation changes than to temperature warming as 20 reduction in precipitation and no warming induced 15 enhancement of the forest driven reduction in peak swe greater declines of peak swe were found in forest openings compared to under forest canopies for every c of warming according to fang and pomeroy 2020 projections in relative terms peak swe decreased 29 per c across all sites which corresponds to the 20 decrease per c sensitivity values of mean swe to warming that have been reported in previous studies developed in the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2013 2017 4 2 sensitivity of forest effects on snow melting processes to climate perturbations warming can accelerate the initiation of snowmelt rasouli et al 2015 thus it was observed that the date of peak swe occurred earlier under warming conditions although the main period of snowmelt shifted forward into a lower solar irradiance period the melt out date occurred earlier as temperatures increased rasouli et al 2015 in o areas this response was more pronounced due to the greater decline of peak swe with warming compared to forest areas roth and nolin 2017 observed how the effects of reduced solar inputs in forests become secondary and the efficiency of the canopy interception is the main factor controlling the melt out date therefore differences between f and o areas in the timing of melt out significantly decreased with warming and the effect of forest driving earlier snowpack melt out was reduced 2 days per c on average the overall forest shading effect on melting that takes place in our study area was diminished under warmer conditions 2 per c conversely no clear influence of precipitation changes was found in that response as previously mentioned the melt season occurred earlier with increasing temperatures thus it shortened to a period of lower available energy this means that in a warmer world much less snow cover will be exposed to high energy fluxes sufficient to drive moderate to high snowmelt rates musselman et al 2017 for this reason an overall reduction in melting rates with warming 0 4 mm day 1 per c was observed this melting slow down under warmer temperatures was more pronounced in o areas they experienced a greater shortening of the period of higher energy because of a larger advancement to earlier melt out dates as a consequence o areas showed larger reductions in the available energy to melt therefore the overall differences between f and o areas in the available energy to melt and thus in melting rates decreased with warming and the overall forest driven reduction of melting rates was reduced in addition this forest effect over melting rates may be undermined under an earlier snowmelt scenario because the solar angle will be lower and the amount of incoming radiation blocked by the forest canopy will therefore be smaller lundquist et al 2013 4 3 different seasonal seb responses to climate perturbation in forested and open areas some differences arose in seasonal seb and its sensitivity to warming between f and o areas most studies that have focused on both measuring and modeling the snow cover energy balance reported that radiation and turbulent fluxes are the main energy sources for melting e g ellis et al 2010 gelfan et al 2004 hardy et al 1998 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 hotovy and jenicek 2020 lópez moreno et al 2017 sicart et al 2004 our results partially agree with their findings because net all wave radiation and ground heat followed by latent heat dominated the seasonal seb ground heat generally represents a relatively minor component in seasonal sebs hotovy and jenicek 2020 nevertheless in this study ground heat flux became especially important in f areas maybe due to better radiance transmission to the soil in these partially snow covered areas lund et al 2017 turbulent energy fluxes were found to be more relevant contributions to seasonal seb in f areas relative to o areas contrary to marks et al 1998 observations advected heat from precipitation adds rather negligible additional energy to the seasonal seb in any of the studied sites similar to that reported by other studies hotovy and jenicek 2020 in a warmer climate the importance of rain heat input into the snowpack is expected to increase as more precipitation will fall as rain than as snow jenicek et al 2018b musselman et al 2018 but a relevant increase of rain advected heat contribution to seasonal seb was not observed it is known that forest cover attenuates the transmittance of shortwave radiation and enhances longwave irradiance to the snow surface ellis et al 2011 essery et al 2008 lundquist et al 2013 musselman et al 2008 shortwave energy reduction was the dominant effect in the study area hence net all wave radiation and melting were reduced in f areas as previously reported dickerson lange et al 2017 link and marks 1999 musselman et al 2012 sicart et al 2004 under warmer conditions net radiative fluxes decreased as a result of earlier snowmelt timing especially in o areas this decline is mainly caused by reduced shortwave radiation leading the melt period to shift earlier in the year towards lower solar zenith angles and shorter daylight lengths jennings and molotch 2020 lundquist et al 2013 additionally overall longwave radiation decreased with warming because of the earlier melt period jennings and molotch 2020 observed that the advance of snowmelt timing decreased melting period air temperatures and resultant incoming longwave radiation which has a greater effect than the applied melting 4 4 spatial variability of forest snow interactions under a changing climate in a previous study it was observed that the magnitude and timing of the forest effects on snow processes varied significantly among closely located stands in the study area sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 in the current study deeper and more persistent snowpacks were found in forest stands with more snow accumulation and lower rates of ablation promoted by a more efficient forest shading effect plots 2 and 4 whereas shallower snow conditions were found in forest stands with lower snow accumulation and higher rates of ablation promoted by a more efficient forest heating effect plots 1 and 3 broxton et al 2020 attributed the differences in accumulation and ablation under forest cover to the prevailing aspect north or south of the slopes our results indicate differential behavior of snow accumulation and ablation under forest canopy in the sites more exposed to sunlight west and south faced slopes i e plots 3 and 1 with respect to north and east faced slopes plots 4 and 2 however the small number of experimental plots does not allow to statistically attribute the observed differences to the slope dependent response of snowpack to forest cover observed by broxton et al 2020 it has been reported that a regional increase in temperature may have different effects on snow processes at the local scale depending on elevation topography and exposure to wind and solar radiation lópez moreno et al 2013 in accordance with this and confirming h4 it also was found that sensitivity of forest snow interactions to perturbed climate conditions largely varied among neighboring forest stands higher and slightly colder sites have been reported to be less sensitive to the effects of climate warming on snow accumulation snow energy balance and snowmelt harpold et al 2012 kapnick and hall 2012 lópez moreno et al 2017 mote et al 2018 musselman et al 2017 rasouli et al 2019 our results cannot confirm these observations probably because of the local scale of our study the coldest and highest site analyzed in this study plot 4 showed the largest reductions in snow accumulation and energy available for melting and thus the largest reductions in melting rates with warming the reported increased efficiency in snow interception with warming temperatures friesen et al 2015 and subsequent enhanced forest driven reduction in snow accumulation revuelto et al 2015 could be more pronounced in plots with higher lai values hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 varhola et al 2010 this may explain the observed enhanced forest driven reduction in snowpack duration with warming especially in plot 2 while the warmest and lowest site with the lowest lai values plot 3 showed the least sensitivity it is known that conifer forests modify the snowpack energy balance by reducing the total amount of shortwave radiation and enhancing total longwave exchange with that emitted by trees which results in both shading and heating effects respectively sicart et al 2004 in this study one forest effect prevailed over the other during the snow season depending on the analyzed forest stand in plots 2 and 4 the forest driven reduction in melting rates shading effect was more pronounced than in plots 1 and 3 plots 2 and 4 presented longer lasting snowpacks than plots 1 and 3 mainly due to higher snow accumulation more ephemeral snowpacks did not resist long enough into the late spring to benefit from the forest shading effect lundquist et al 2013 roth and nolin 2017 sicart et al 2004 thus in plots 1 and 3 there was more marked forest driven increment in melting rates heating effect in these stands the higher longwave radiation by trees compensated the lower shortwave radiation under warmer conditions both heating and shading forest effects were reduced in the studied forest stands as expected h3 it was found that under an earlier snowmelt i e lower incoming energy scenario melting rates beneath the forest canopy became similar to those in open areas because differences in net shortwave and net longwave radiation between f and o areas were reduced under warmer conditions thus the higher longwave radiation in the forest tended to compensate for the lower shortwave radiation with increasing temperatures therefore in those sites where the forest shading effect was prevalent plots 2 and 4 the high melt rate period experienced a greater constriction i e high energy period and thus a higher reduction of melting rates was observed the undermined shading effect of forest over snowpack under an earlier snowmelt scenario was especially pronounced in plot 2 the forest heating effect was reduced in those sites where it was prevalent plots 1 and 3 may be because of the lower tree absorption of solar radiation and subsequent lower thermal emissivity that occurs earlier in the year lundquist et al 2013 in addition the shift in melt timing with warming also decreased net longwave radiation as melt period air temperatures decreased because a shift of snowmelt timing can have a greater effect on air temperatures than induced warming jennings and molotch 2020 and might contribute to diminishing the forest heating effect on melting the undermined warming effect of forest over snowpack under an earlier snowmelt scenario was especially pronounced in plot 3 our simulations of snow forest interactions were restricted to four forest stands each of them showing particular environmental characteristics this represents certain limitation for identifying the different roles of climate topography and forest structure on the observed variability in forest effects on snow processes and energy balance under climate change conditions our simulations were validated with manual and semi automated measurements making it difficult to increase the number of study sites due to the significant manual labor and time required for fieldwork in such environments 5 conclusions forest snow interactions showed large sensitivity to perturbed climate conditions in the studied mountain forests forest driven reductions on snow accumulation were clearly enhanced with warmer climate conditions during the beginning of the snow season nevertheless the forest driven reduction in maximum accumulation was more sensitive to changes in precipitation on the other hand an increase in temperature reduced the heating and shading effects of the forest on snowmelt it was found a significant enhancement of forest driven reduction in snowpack duration under warming conditions 10 per c in a drier and warmer climate scenario the forest effects on snow accumulation processes could be enhanced while greater precipitation could partially mask these effects under warmer conditions both shading and heating forest effects could be reduced but no clear responses were found under combined temperature and precipitation perturbations the sensitivity of forest effects on snow processes to perturbed climate conditions varied among nearby stands sites with higher canopy interception showed higher warming sensitivity in forest effects on snow accumulation processes while the duration of the snowpack seemed to determine the prevailing effect of the forest on melting processes shading or heating and thus its response to warming the ability to identify the different roles of climate topography and forest structure is however limited by the low number of forest stands considered in the simulations funding this study was supported by the projects bosque nieve y recursos hídricos en el pirineo ante el cambio global funded by fundación
