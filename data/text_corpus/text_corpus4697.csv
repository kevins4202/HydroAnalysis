23485,the influence of small scale cylinders is always ignored in classical models for hydrodynamic calculations of truss spar platforms and other large scale structures in published research this study is focused on this influence on the motion response under the wave action so that the response can be forecast more accurately a numerical model is proposed to calculate the wave body interactions under the second order frame by utilizing the time domain higher order boundary element method the wave loads on small scale cylinders are calculated by the morison formula in which the wave field disturbed by a large scale structure is taken into account three dimensional elastic rod theory is chosen to analyze the cable force to a platform and the motion equation for the mooring system and hull are solved simultaneously using the newmark β method a moored truss spar platform is modelled and the numerical results demonstrate that the existence of small scale cylinders may lead to a decrease of the motion response of the platform while the natural frequency will move to a lower frequency this phenomenon explains why small scale cylinders which can be modelled as truss spar play an important role in damping and change the added mass of the platform therefore in order to get more accurate results for motion response the wave loads of small scale components cannot be ignored keywords small scale cylinders truss spar platform morison formula motion response 1 introduction due to the variability of the direction of waves the cross sectional shape of marine engineering structures is mostly circular in order to accommodate the different directions of waves and maintain a small body resistance factor such as the body of a spar platform and the column of a tlp tension leg platform li and teng 2015 these structures can be divided into large scale structures and small scale cylinders via the ratio of their cross sectional dimension to the incident wave wavelength because the effects of different scales of structures on the wave field are different different theories should be used to calculate the wave load for the large scale structure it is necessary to calculate the wave loads using diffraction radiation theory since the coupling effect of the structure and the wave field must to be considered teng and eatock taylor 1995 on the other hand because the impact of small scale cylinders on the wave field is negligible small the morison formula is always applied to calculate the wave load morison et al 1950 on small scale cylinders as a second generation spar platform the truss spar platform improves up on the main structure of the first generation of classic spar platforms it uses a truss structure instead of the middle section of the classical spar platform which reduces the steel consumption significantly and the heave plates can offer added mass and damping which can reduce the heave motion of the platform now the truss spar platform is the main form of spar platform in use today many scholars have carried out studies on the truss spar platform chen et al 2007 applied the morison formula to consider the truss structure only under the incident wave field however they did not take into account how the body changed the overall wave field geng et al 2011 used the morison formula to model the small scale cylinders and considered the influence of the structure on the wave field in the time domain in their study only the first order hydrodynamic problem was considered and the structures were fixed in the computational domain li and ou 2009 estimated the contribution of heave plates to the heave hydrodynamic force of truss spar and predicted the heave response in extreme ocean conditions quickly and effectively by the combination of experimental and numerical results shen et al 2012 applied ittc two parameter wave spectrum numerically and studied the heave motion of truss spar structure in random seas considering the diffraction effect prislin et al 1998 found that the added mass of heave plates on the truss spar platform was related to the plate spacing and when h l was greater than 1 5 h the plate spacing l the plate width the added mass was constant most of these studies focused on the effect of the heave plate on the overall performance of the structure but the effect of the truss structure on the overall performance was negligible sadeghi et al 2004 found that the truss structure of the truss spar platform affected the radiation damping and added mass and thus affected its motion response subsequently scholars studied the truss spar platform with a mooring system kim et al 2001 calculated the nonlinear coupling dynamic interaction between truss spar platform and a mooring system under wave wind and current yang et al 2012 2014 applied potential flow theory in the time domain to study the motion response of mooring truss spar platform in both regular and random waves however most of the studies ignored the existence of small scale cylinders on the structure although the small scale cylinders have a little effect on the overall force of the structure the mooring offshore structure may move with a large amplitude at low frequency small scale cylinders may have an effect on the low frequency motion and it is necessary to study it based on the second order perturbation expansion method this paper uses high order boundary element to solve the interaction between waves and large scale structures compared with the previous scholars researches when the wave force on small scale cylinder is calculated this paper not only considers the diffraction effect of large scale structure on the wave field but also considers the radiation effect on the wave field when the large scale structure moves and the calculation accuracy is improved to second order moreover the effect of small scale cylinder of truss spar platform on its low frequency slow drift motion is studied in the present paper in section 2 the mathematical formulation of the method is discussed in section 3 a model test is carried out to validate the numerical model in section 4 a serious of examples with small scale cylinders are evaluated and compared to those without small scale cylinders section 5 concludes this work 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 numerical method for modelling waves and a large scale structure diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 is adapted for large scale structures two right handed cartesian coordinate systems fig 1 are defined in the computation one is a space fixed coordinate system oxyz with its origin at the still water surface in which x and y are measured horizontally and z vertically upward the other is a body fixed coordinate system o x y z when the body is at its equilibrium position the two sets of coordinate systems coincide under the assumption of ideal fluid there exists a velocity potential ϕ which satisfies the laplace equation within the fluid domain and it is subjected to the corresponding boundary conditions the nonlinear free surface condition and the body surface boundary condition are satisfied at the still water and mean body surfaces using the taylor series expansions following the stokes expansion procedure the velocity potential wave elevation and the body motion are expanded into perturbation series the corresponding second order governing equation and boundary conditions have been described in previous research bai and teng 2013 a rankine source and its image about the seabed are applied as green s function 1 g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 r 1 where x r0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and x x y z are the source point and the field point respectively and 2 r x x r 0 2 y y r 0 2 z z r 0 2 r 1 x x r 0 2 y y r 0 2 z z r 0 2 d 2 by applying green s second theorem to the scattered potential and green function the above boundary value problem can be converted to the following boundary integral equation 3 α ϕ s k x 0 s ϕ s k x g x x 0 n g x x 0 ϕ s k x n d s where α is a solid angle coefficient which depends on the surface shape of the structure because both the rankine source and its image about the seabed are used as the green function and the scattered waves are absorbed by the damping layer the integration on the seabed and the outer boundary are not required the integration is only needed on the boundary s containing the wetted body s b and the static water surface s f a higher order boundary element method is used to solve the boundary element integration equation and 8 node elements are used to discretize the boundaries after obtaining the velocity potential and applying the taylor approximation the wave forces on a moving body can be calculated by integrating the fluid pressure over the mean body surface the total force can be divided into several terms via the order of ε 4 f f 0 ε f e 1 f r 1 ε 2 f e 2 f r 2 f i 2 f i i 2 f w 2 the zero order force f 0 is just the buoyant force the first order force contains two parts one is the exciting force given as 5 f e 1 ρ s b ϕ t 1 n d s from the integration of dynamic pressure over the body surface and the other is called the restoring force given as 6 f r 1 ρ g a w p ξ 3 1 ξ 4 1 y f y 0 ξ 5 1 x f x 0 k due to the body motion where a wp is the area of the mean water plane x f y f are the coordinates of the center of the mean water plane when a body is at rest and k is the unit vector in the z direction the second order components are f e 2 the component due to the second order potential 7 f e 2 ρ s b ϕ t 2 n d s f r 2 is the component due to second order body movement 8 f r 2 ρ g a w p ξ 3 2 ξ 4 2 y f y 0 ξ 5 2 x f x 0 k f i 2 is the component due to the contribution from the first order potential and the first order body movement 9 f i 2 ρ s b n 1 2 ϕ 1 2 ϕ t 1 ξ 1 α 1 x x 0 α 1 n ϕ t 1 d s f i i 2 is the second order force due to the contribution from the first order body movement components

at the water line 11 f w 2 1 2 ρ g c b n η 1 2 2 η 1 ξ 3 2 ξ 4 2 y y 0 ξ 5 2 x x 0 d l 2 2 wave force on small scale cylinder the wave forces on small scale cylinder are calculated by the morison formula morison formula is a semi empirical semi theoretical formula which includes inertia and velocity forces therefore the wave force on the unit height is 12 f s k f i k f d k where f i k indicates the inertia force whose form is the same as the solution of the non viscous fluid based on wave theory and f d k represents the velocity force whose form is similar to the resistance on the body surface in steady flow the formulas for the forces acting on vertical cylinders are 13 f i k c m ρ π d 2 4 a k 14 f d k c d ρ 2 d u k u k where c m and c d are the coefficients of inertia force and velocity force respectively ρ is the water density d is the cylinder diameter u k is the velocity of a water particle and a k is the acceleration of water particle due to the effect of large scale structure on the wave field the velocity and acceleration of water are composed of incident and scattered waves respectively the parts induced by incident wave can be easily obtained through an analytical expression however the parts induced by scattered wave must be solved by wave diffraction theory the kth order velocity of a water particle produced by diffraction potential can be obtained by eq 18 and is given as 15 u s x k ϕ s k x 0 x 0 s 2 g x x 0 n x 0 ϕ s k x ϕ s k x n g x x 0 x 0 d s then the kth order acceleration of a water particle can be calculated by the time difference 16 a s x k u s x k t u s x k t u s x k t 1 δ t since the body moves under the action of waves the velocity and acceleration can be calculated by solving the first and second order body motion equation which are defined as u b k and a b k therefore the relative velocity and acceleration can be written as u r k u k u b k and a r k a k a b k respectively for this reason the first and second order wave forces on a vertical small scale cylinder for a unit of height can be written as 17 f i k c m ρ π d 2 4 a r k f d k c d ρ 2 d u r k u r k from eq 17 it can be seen that when the velocity and acceleration of body and the relative velocity and acceleration are in the same direction the wave force on a small scale cylinder will increase the motion response of the body otherwise the wave force will decrease the body motion response through damping for the truss spar platform the small scale cylinders between the hard and soft tank are located in deep water so the velocity and acceleration of water particles are very slow which is opposite to the relative velocity and acceleration for this reason the small scale cylinders play a role in damping and will decrease the motion response 2 3 force on the mooring and riser system in this study a three dimensional elastic slender rod theory garrett 1982 was proposed to simulate mooring lines and risers considering the linear tension and bending behavior the finite element method was used to solve the problem assuming that there is no torque and applied external moment on a mooring line tendon riser a linear momentum conservation equation with respect to a position vector r s t which is a function of arc length s and time t and the unit cut vector is r 18 f m i q ρ r 19 λ t e i κ 2 where f mi is the internal force q is the external force per unit length ρ is the mass per length the point above the vector r indicates the derivative of the time ei is the bending stiffness t is the local tension κ the local curvature the scalar variable λ can be regarded as a lagrange multiplier if the rod is considered stretchable and the stretch is linear and small the following extensible condition has to be satisfied 20 1 2 r r 1 t a e λ a e eqs 18 and 20 are the basic governing equations for the mooring cable riser finite element analysis 2 4 motion response according to the theory of momentum conservation the first and second order motion responses for a body can be obtained as follows 21 m ξ 1 b ξ 1 c ξ 1 f e 1 f s 1 f m 1 22 m ξ 2 b ξ 2 c ξ 2 f e 2 f s 2 f i 2 f i i 2 f w 2 f m 2 m h x c x 0 0 m 0 ξ 1 α 1 x c x 0 α 1 x c x 0 ξ 1 0 i b α 1 α 1 e 0 h x c x 0 n 3 m g where m is the body mass matrix b is the viscous damping matrix c is the restoring force matrix f s k is the kth order wave force on small scale cylinders f m k is the kth order mooring force of cables or risers x c x c y c z c are the coordinates of the mass center and e ρ v x x 0 h x x 0 d v 3 model validation to evaluate this numerical model a second order stokes wave interaction with a fixed composite structure is modelled as shown in fig 2 the structure is composed of an upper large scale cylinder with radius a and draft t a 2 0 and several small cylinders with d a 0 2 length l 0 a 2 0 and lp a 0 8 in which d is the diameter of a small cylinder l 0 is the length of a small cylinder and l p is the distance between the axis of a small cylinder and the z axis the water depth can be calculated from d a 4 0 for this case the computational mesh shown in fig 3 includes 861 points and 300 elements on the body surface 1840 points and 600 elements on the free water surface the second order stokes wave is chosen as the incident wave condition and the incident regular wave with amplitude a a 0 1 and wave number ka 2 0 is considered in the following case for the first order diffraction problem fig 4 shows a comparison between the results of the present model and those from a previous study conducted by geng et al 2011 for u s x 1 and a s x 1 at the point 0 8a 0 0a 3 0a since geng et al 2011 did not carry on the second order diffraction problem calculation and lacked the contract data fig 5 shows a comparison between time domain and frequency domain cong et al 2012 results for the second order diffraction potential ϕ d 2 and velocity u s x 2 at the same point under the second order wave with the wave amplitude a a 0 4 wave number ka 0 5 it can be seen that the first and second order results coincide well with the published results which illustrate the accuracy and stability of the time domain numerical model in this study 4 numerical calculation in the design of floating platforms in order to reduce the motion response of the platform the natural frequency of the structure is usually designed outside the frequency range of the waves in the service area however for the irregular waves the difference frequency and sum frequency will be generated by interaction between each frequency of the wave components in which the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the floating platform in the horizontal direction therefore a large amplitude motion of the floating platform in the horizontal direction can occur in this section the numerical model is applied to study the influence of small scale cylinders on the motion response when it oscillates with large amplitude at a low frequency 4 1 parameters of a truss spar platform the classic truss spar platform is composed of an upper structure platform body hard tank soft tank and heave plate and a mooring system whose simplified model is shown in fig 6 and main parameters are in table 1 the mooring system for truss spar is made up of 12 chain wire rope chain lines in which they are grouped into three bundles and each bundle has four mooring lines the centerlines of the mooring groups are approximately 120 apart the mooring configuration and coordinate system used for the global performance analysis are in fig 7 the detailed mooring properties and fairlead location are summarized in tables 2 and 3 the natural frequency in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction ω 0x and ω 0z of the platform which are calculated by a free decay simulation are about 0 037 rad s and 0 290 rad s respectively the current selection of c d and c m under wave action are always based on prototype observations and experiments however there is no relevant research on the complicated truss spar platform according to previous scholars studies the selection of c d and c m under wave action depends on the re reynolds number and kc keulegan carpenter number the difference between the first and second order water particle velocities and frequencies leads to a great difference between the re number and the kc number based on sarpkaya et al 1981 the first order c d and c m are about 0 62 and 1 80 respectively the second order c d and c m are about 1 2 and 2 0 respectively 4 2 numerical results and discussions waves are mostly irregular in actual sea conditions and bichromatic waves are the simplest form of irregular waves the study of bichromatic waves action on a truss spar platform will be suitable for a comparison between the situation with and without small scale cylinders a series of bichromatic waves with the same amplitude a 1 a 2 4 0 m the same sum frequencies ω 1 ω 2 1 256 rad s but different difference frequencies δω are chosen as the incident waves which propagate in the x direction the specific parameters of the bichromatic waves are shown in table 4 since there are many examples some of the examples are listed here fig 8 and fig 9 show the calculation results when the difference frequency of the bichromatic waves δω 0 016 rad s it can be seen from fig 8 that the platform has a large drift motion in the horizontal direction but there is no significant movement for the heave motion when the platform moves significantly it can be found that the small scale cylinders have a great influence on the motion response due to the presence of small scale cylinders the amplitude of the motion response in the horizontal direction becomes smaller the amplitude spectrum of the motion response can be obtained by fourier transform as shown in fig 9 for the sake of comparison the motion response amplitude spectrum is divided into the low frequency part and the wave frequency part as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively fig 9 a shows that there are two obvious peaks in the low frequency part which are induced by the wave difference frequency and structure natural frequency at this time the difference frequency of the bichromatic wave is far from the structure natural frequency and the existence of the small scale cylinders has little effect on the peak frequency caused by the wave difference frequency fig 9 b indicates that the small scale cylinders have a little influence on the motion response caused by the wave frequency and the motion response caused by the wave frequency is slightly smaller when the small scale cylinders are considered next the motion response and responding amplitude spectrum in the case of ω 1 ω 2 1 256 rad s and δω 0 048 rad s are contrasted as shown in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows that the time history curves in the case of δω 0 048 rad s are similar to those in the case of δω 0 016 rad s because of the occurrence of a large amplitude drift motion in the horizontal direction the small scale cylinders play an important role in the calculation of the results however the existence of the small scale cylinders has little effect on the motion response in the vertical direction since the difference frequency is far away from the natural frequency in the heave motion for the motion response amplitude spectrum at low frequency and wave frequency in the horizontal direction the existence of small scale cylinders has a great influence on the low frequency results but little influence on the wave frequency results as shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the displacement spectra that the results with small scale cylinders have smaller amplitude than those without small scale cylinders in particular for the amplitude spectrum at low frequency fig 11 a at this time the difference between the difference frequency of waves and the natural frequency of the structure is not obvious so the results are a certain degree of difference the peak values of the motion response amplitude spectra in the horizontal direction at wave frequency ω 1 and ω 2 and difference frequency δω of the bichromatic waves are plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively fig 12 shows that the amplitude of the motion response at wave frequency when considering small scale cylinders is less than the amplitude without the small scale cylinders this indicates that the small scale cylinders play a role in damping their existence reduces the wave force so that the motion response is reduced fig 13 shows that in addition to their role in damping the existence of small scale cylinders changes the added mass of the platform thus the natural frequency is changed and moves to a lower frequency for the low frequency motion induced by the difference frequency δω of the bichromatic waves if the small scale cylinders are not considered the motion response happens to be largest at the natural frequency if the small scale cylinders are considered the natural frequency will move to a lower frequency and the amplitude is much less than that without the small scale cylinders due to their damping role it can be seen that the small scale cylinders of the platform have an influence on the wave frequency low frequency motion and the natural frequency of the structure for the low frequency motion in particular their influence cannot be neglected 5 conclusions a second order wave body interaction numerical model in the time domain was established based on the laplace equation the wave force on small scale cylinders was calculated by the morison formula while considering of the scattering effect of a large scale structures the first and second order motion equations take into account the effect of large scale structures and small scale cylinders the large amplitude slow drift motion of a truss spar platform under bichromatic waves is simulated by this numerical model the results show that because the small scale cylinders are in deep water the velocity and acceleration of water particles are opposite to the relative velocity and acceleration and the wave force on the small scale cylinders contrasts with the wave force of the platform small scale cylinders play a role in damping at the same time the existence of small scale cylinders increases the added mass of the platform and thus the natural frequency is changed and moves to a lower frequency which affects the large amplitude slow drift motion of the structure it can be seen that the existence of small scale cylinders has a great influence on the platform in order to calculate hydrodynamic forces on platforms accurately it is proposed that small scale cylinders should be modelled in the calculation acknowledgments the present

s x k u s x k t u s x k t u s x k t 1 δ t since the body moves under the action of waves the velocity and acceleration can be calculated by solving the first and second order body motion equation which are defined as u b k and a b k therefore the relative velocity and acceleration can be written as u r k u k u b k and a r k a k a b k respectively for this reason the first and second order wave forces on a vertical small scale cylinder for a unit of height can be written as 17 f i k c m ρ π d 2 4 a r k f d k c d ρ 2 d u r k u r k from eq 17 it can be seen that when the velocity and acceleration of body and the relative velocity and acceleration are in the same direction the wave force on a small scale cylinder will increase the motion response of the body otherwise the wave force will decrease the body motion response through damping for the truss spar platform the small scale cylinders between the hard and soft tank are located in deep water so the velocity and acceleration of water particles are very slow which is opposite to the relative velocity and acceleration for this reason the small scale cylinders play a role in damping and will decrease the motion response 2 3 force on the mooring and riser system in this study a three dimensional elastic slender rod theory garrett 1982 was proposed to simulate mooring lines and risers considering the linear tension and bending behavior the finite element method was used to solve the problem assuming that there is no torque and applied external moment on a mooring line tendon riser a linear momentum conservation equation with respect to a position vector r s t which is a function of arc length s and time t and the unit cut vector is r 18 f m i q ρ r 19 λ t e i κ 2 where f mi is the internal force q is the external force per unit length ρ is the mass per length the point above the vector r indicates the derivative of the time ei is the bending stiffness t is the local tension κ the local curvature the scalar variable λ can be regarded as a lagrange multiplier if the rod is considered stretchable and the stretch is linear and small the following extensible condition has to be satisfied 20 1 2 r r 1 t a e λ a e eqs 18 and 20 are the basic governing equations for the mooring cable riser finite element analysis 2 4 motion response according to the theory of momentum conservation the first and second order motion responses for a body can be obtained as follows 21 m ξ 1 b ξ 1 c ξ 1 f e 1 f s 1 f m 1 22 m ξ 2 b ξ 2 c ξ 2 f e 2 f s 2 f i 2 f i i 2 f w 2 f m 2 m h x c x 0 0 m 0 ξ 1 α

scale cylinders f m k is the kth order mooring force of cables or risers x c x c y c z c are the coordinates of the mass center and e ρ v x x 0 h x x 0 d v 3 model validation to evaluate this numerical model a second order stokes wave interaction with a fixed composite structure is modelled as shown in fig 2 the structure is composed of an upper large scale cylinder with radius a and draft t a 2 0 and several small cylinders with d a 0 2 length l 0 a 2 0 and lp a 0 8 in which d is the diameter of a small cylinder l 0 is the length of a small cylinder and l p is the distance between the axis of a small cylinder and the z axis the water depth can be calculated from d a 4 0 for this case the computational mesh shown in fig 3 includes 861 points and 300 elements on the body surface 1840 points and 600 elements on the free water surface the second order stokes wave is chosen as the incident wave condition and the incident regular wave with amplitude a a 0 1 and wave number ka 2 0 is considered in the following case for the first order diffraction problem fig 4 shows a comparison between the results of the present model and those from a previous study conducted by geng et al 2011 for u s x 1 and a s x 1 at the point 0 8a 0 0a 3 0a since geng et al 2011 did not carry on the second order diffraction problem calculation and lacked the contract data fig 5 shows a comparison between time domain and frequency domain cong et al 2012 results for the second order diffraction potential ϕ d 2 and velocity u s x 2 at the same point under the second order wave with the wave amplitude a a 0 4 wave number ka 0 5 it can be seen that the first and second order results coincide well with the published results which illustrate the accuracy and stability of the time domain numerical model in this study 4 numerical calculation in the design of floating platforms in order to reduce the motion response of the platform the natural frequency of the structure is usually designed outside the frequency range of the waves in the service area however for the irregular waves the difference frequency and sum frequency will be generated by interaction between each frequency of the wave components in which the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the floating platform in the horizontal direction therefore a large amplitude motion of the floating platform in the horizontal direction can occur in this section the numerical model is applied to study the influence of small scale cylinders on the motion response when it oscillates with large amplitude at a low frequency 4 1 parameters of a truss spar platform the classic truss spar platform is composed of an upper structure platform body hard tank soft tank and heave plate and a mooring system whose simplified model is shown in fig 6 and main parameters are in table 1 the mooring system for truss spar is made up of 12 chain wire rope chain lines in which they are grouped into three bundles and each bundle has four mooring lines the centerlines of the mooring groups are approximately 120 apart the mooring configuration and coordinate system used for the global performance analysis are in fig 7 the detailed mooring properties and fairlead location are summarized in tables 2 and 3 the natural frequency in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction ω 0x and ω 0z of the platform which are calculated by a free decay simulation are about 0 037 rad s and 0 290 rad s respectively the current selection of c d and c m under wave action are always based on prototype observations and experiments however there is no relevant research on the complicated truss spar platform according to previous scholars studies the selection of c d and c m under wave action depends on the re reynolds number and kc keulegan carpenter number the difference between the first and second order water particle velocities and frequencies leads to a great difference between the re number and the kc number based on sarpkaya et al 1981 the first order c d and c m are about 0 62 and 1 80 respectively the second order c d and c m are about 1 2 and 2 0 respectively 4 2 numerical results and discussions waves are mostly irregular in actual sea conditions and bichromatic waves are the simplest form of irregular waves the study of bichromatic waves action on a truss spar platform will be suitable for a comparison between the situation with and without small scale cylinders a series of bichromatic waves with the same amplitude a 1 a 2 4 0 m the same sum frequencies ω 1 ω 2 1 256 rad s but different difference frequencies δω are chosen as the incident waves which propagate in the x direction the specific parameters of the bichromatic waves are shown in table 4 since there are many examples some of the examples are listed here fig 8 and fig 9 show the calculation results when the difference frequency of the bichromatic waves δω 0 016 rad s it can be seen from fig 8 that the platform has a large drift motion in the horizontal direction but there is no significant movement for the heave motion when the platform moves significantly it can be found that the small scale cylinders have a great influence on the motion response due to the presence of small scale cylinders the amplitude of the motion response in the horizontal direction becomes smaller the amplitude spectrum of the motion response can be obtained by fourier transform as shown in fig 9 for the sake of comparison the motion response amplitude spectrum is divided into the low frequency part and the wave frequency part as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively fig 9 a shows that there are two obvious peaks in the low frequency part which are induced by the wave difference frequency and structure natural frequency at this time the difference frequency of the bichromatic wave is far from the structure natural frequency and the existence of the small scale cylinders has little effect on the peak frequency caused by the wave difference frequency fig 9 b indicates that the small scale cylinders have a little influence on the motion response caused by the wave frequency and the motion response caused by the wave frequency is slightly smaller when the small scale cylinders are considered next the motion response and responding amplitude spectrum in the case of ω 1 ω 2 1 256 rad s and δω 0 048 rad s are contrasted as shown in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows that the time history curves in the case of δω 0 048 rad s are similar to those in the case of δω 0 016 rad s because of the occurrence of a large amplitude drift motion in the horizontal direction the small scale cylinders play an important role in the calculation of the results however the existence of the small scale cylinders has little effect on the motion response in the vertical direction since the difference frequency is far away from the natural frequency in the heave motion for the motion response amplitude spectrum at low frequency and wave frequency in the horizontal direction the existence of small scale cylinders has a great influence on the low frequency results but little influence on the wave frequency results as shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the displacement spectra that the results with small scale cylinders have smaller amplitude than those without small scale cylinders in particular for the amplitude spectrum at low frequency fig 11 a at this time the difference between the difference frequency of waves and the natural frequency of the structure is not obvious so the results are a certain degree of difference the peak values of the motion response amplitude spectra in the horizontal direction at wave frequency ω 1 and ω 2 and difference frequency δω of the bichromatic waves are plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively fig 12 shows that the amplitude of the motion response at wave frequency when considering small scale cylinders is less than the amplitude without the small scale cylinders this indicates that the small scale cylinders play a role in damping their existence reduces the wave force so that the motion response is reduced fig 13 shows that in addition to their role in damping the existence of small scale cylinders changes the added mass of the platform thus the natural frequency is changed and moves to a lower frequency for the low frequency motion induced by the difference frequency δω of the bichromatic waves if the small scale cylinders are not considered the motion response happens to be largest at the natural frequency if the small scale cylinders are considered the natural frequency will move to a lower frequency and the amplitude is much less than that without the small scale cylinders due to their damping role it can be seen that the small scale cylinders of the platform have an influence on the wave frequency low frequency motion and the natural frequency of the structure for the low frequency motion in particular their influence cannot be neglected 5 conclusions a second order wave body interaction numerical model in the time domain was established based on the laplace equation the wave force on small scale cylinders was calculated by the morison formula while considering of the scattering effect of a large scale structures the first and second order motion equations take into account the effect of large scale structures and small scale cylinders the large amplitude slow drift motion of a truss spar platform under bichromatic waves is simulated by this numerical model the results show that because the small scale cylinders are in deep water the velocity and acceleration of water particles are opposite to the relative velocity and acceleration and the wave force on the small scale cylinders contrasts with the wave force of the platform small scale cylinders play a role in damping at the same time the existence of small scale cylinders increases the added mass of the platform and thus the natural frequency is changed and moves to a lower frequency which affects the large amplitude slow drift motion of the structure it can be seen that the existence of small scale cylinders has a great influence on the platform in order to calculate hydrodynamic forces on platforms accurately it is proposed that small scale cylinders should be modelled in the calculation acknowledgments the present

23486,the increasing trend of offshore wind turbines in deeper waters has necessitated the usage of alternative foundations such as the bucket foundation including monopod and tripod to investigate and compare the lateral monotonic and cyclic behaviour of the monopod and tripod a series of centrifuge tests were carried out in medium dense sand which were fabricated with an identical amount of material the monotonic centrifuge tests were back analysed using an advanced hypoplastic model to offer further insights into the test results under a monotonic lateral loading the tripod exhibits a 78 higher initial lateral stiffness than the monopod but it yields at a 71 4 smaller rotation suggesting a more brittle response while subjected to lateral cycling the rotation of the monopod increases with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate following a power function similarly the dynamic stiffness of the monopod also increases with number of cycles differing from the monopod the tripod exhibited a self healing behaviour both the rotation and dynamic stiffness increases during the first few hundreds of cycling but decreases thereafter leading to little variation this unique feature in cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of the tripod makes it superior to the monopod keywords centrifuge modelling medium dense sand bucket foundations bearing capacity cyclic loading dynamic stiffness 1 introduction the cost of foundations for offshore wind farm developments is a significant fraction of the overall installation cost current estimates suggest between 15 and 40 which plays an important role in financial viability of offshore wind turbine farm projects houlsby and byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2003 ewea 2016 as summarized by ewea 2016 most existing offshore wind turbines are constructed in a water depth less than 50 m while the monopile is widely adopted for current wind turbine foundation design the bucket foundation has been considered as a promising option for its easier installation reusable and economy in deeper water depth byrne and houlsby 2006 achmus et al 2013 houlsby et al 2005a randolph and gourvenec 2011 tjelta 2015 the bucket foundations are commonly designed in the forms of monopod houlsby et al 2005a ibsen and liingaard 2005 guo et al 2015 and tripod ehrmann et al 2016 basically the monopod bucket foundation is believed to be suitable for water depth up to 40 m deb siingh 2016 while the tripod is well suited for offshore sites with water depth ranging from 20 to 50 m kim and oh 2014 to meet the serviceability of an offshore wind turbine which is a slender structure subjected to various cyclic offshore environmental loadings two principal aspects governing the foundation design are cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of the foundation because any misalignment and resonance of the turbine structure could significantly reduce the design life of the various structural elements in the turbine for these reasons the cumulative rotation of the slender structure is limited to 0 25 in service peire et al 2009 det norske veritas 2002 while the modal frequencies are required to differ by 10 to those of the periodic wind wave current and vortex loads det norske veritas 2002 fig 1 presents a summary of typical loading frequency applied to the offshore wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 in the figure the 1p and 3p denotes the rotational frequency of the turbine and the blade passing frequency respectively to avoid any resonance the natural frequency of the system should be designed to be lower than 1p i e soft soft between 1p and 3p i e soft stiff or larger than 3p i e stiff stiff regions typically the initial natural frequency of most offshore wind turbines is designed to be soft stiff accounting for the cost and design feasibility yu et al 2015 however the variation of the dynamic foundation stiffness under long term cyclic loading may shift the natural frequency to approach one of the excitation frequency i e 1p or 3p leading to resonance bhattacharya et al 2013 despite the significance of cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness little track record of long term performance is available for monopod and tripod which are new types of foundation to support offshore wind turbine the current understandings of the cyclic behaviour i e cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of a laterally loaded monopod in sand were mainly obtained through small scale tests at 1g byrne 2000 foglia and ibsen 2014 villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2012 2014 large scale field trials houlsby et al 2006 and centrifuge model tests zhang et al 2007 cox et al 2014 it was found that under the fully drained condition the cumulative rotation of a laterally loaded model pod generally increased with number of cycles which can be fitted by a power relationship zhu et al 2012 cox et al 2014 on the other hand the evolution of the unloading stiffness with the loading cycles may broadly follow a logarithmic relationship cox et al 2014 comparing with the monopod cyclic response of a laterally loaded tripod foundation in sand are rarely investigated the existing studies mainly focused on vertical cyclic behaviour of a monopod which was intended to mimic the behaviour of one pod in a laterally loaded tripod byrne and houlsby 2004 houlsby et al 2005b kelly et al 2006 gao et al 2013 this simplification was made by assuming that a lateral load imposed to a tripod was thoroughly transformed into either vertical tensile or compressive loadings to the suction buckets senders and randolph 2009 although the studies based on this simplification have shed insights into the cyclic vertical behaviour that may be exhibited by one suction bucket in a tripod the cumulative rotation and variation of dynamic stiffness of a tripod foundation cannot be directly obtained the validity of the simplification also remained to be justified kim et al 2014 is probably one of the first to directly investigate the lateral cyclic response of a tripod displacement controlled centrifuge model tests were performed to simulate a tripod under limited numbers of lateral cycling in silt sand for engineering purpose the cyclic behaviour including cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of a tripod may be more realistically obtained by performing load controlled long term cyclic load tests in addition it is vital to understand the different characteristics of cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness between the monopod and the tripod through a systematic comparative study to optimise the bucket foundation design for offshore wind turbine in view of the aforementioned issues a series of centrifuge model tests were carried out in this study to directly compare the monotonic and cyclic lateral behaviour of a monopod and a tripod foundation which were fabricated with the same amount of material the measured data was interpreted with attentions specifically paid to the push over bearing capacity cyclic accumulation of rotation and evolution of dynamic stiffness of the two types of foundation moreover preliminary finite element analysis was performed to back analyse the monotonic lateral behaviour of the monopod and the tripod with the principal objectives to verify the push pull mechanism of the tripod and to de couple foundation stiffness under the combined loading of horizontal force and overturning moment 2 centrifuge modelling all of the centrifuge model tests reported in this paper were carried out at the geotechnical centrifuge facility of zhejiang university china the beam centrifuge which has a rotation arm of 4 5 m and a maximum payload of 400 gt can be operated up to 150 g chen et al 2010 scaling factors relevant to the centrifuge tests reported herein are summarized in table 1 taylor 2003 2 1 test programme the experimental programme consists of four centrifuge tests including one monotonic loading test and one multi stage cyclic loading test for each of the two model foundations i e monopod and tripod all the centrifuge tests were carried out in medium dense dry sand at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g firstly two monotonic lateral loading tests m1 and t1 were performed on the monopod and the tripod bucket foundations to compare their moment rotation response including the initial stiffness the evolution of rotation centre and the ultimate lateral capacity f u two load controlled multi stage cyclic tests m2 and t2 were then carried out to investigate the cumulative behaviour including the accumulated rotation and the change of dynamic stiffness of the monopod and tripod only one way cycling was imposed in each cyclic loading test because it was shown to produce a larger cumulative pile head displacement than the two way cycling haiderali et al 2015 he et al 2017 details on the performed cyclic loading regimes are summarized in table 2 including the cyclic load magnitude and cycles for each loading package 2 2 centrifuge model package fig 2 a shows the elevation view of a typical centrifuge model package the bucket foundations were jacketed to designed depth at 1 g a load cell and a laser displacement sensor were attached to the actuator rod to record the applied load and lateral displacement at the loading height additional displacement sensors were also instrumented to measure the lateral and vertical displacements at different locations for offshore structures most loads from wave current and wind are loaded at certain height for a typical 2 mw 5 mw offshore wind turbines the horizontal load can vary from 4 6 mn to 16 mn with the corresponding over turning moment ranging from 95 mnm to 562 mnm leading to a loading height of 20 35 m houlsby et al 2005a villalobos jara 2006 abadie 2015 therefore the height of the lateral load applied in the turbine tower in each test was determined as 315 mm 31 5 m in prototype above the seabed floor it is recognised that the typical loading direction may be either perpendicular or parallel to the centreline between any two buckets of the tripod foundation stergiou et al 2015 found that the former configuration would exhibit a lower bearing capacity than the latter based on a series of three dimensional finite element analyses to simulate the worst case scenario the former configuration i e with the typical loading perpendicular to the centre line of two buckets was therefore adopted in this experimental study the loading direction was oriented in such a way that only one rear pod was under tension while two front pods were subjected to compression the monotonic and cyclic loads were applied by a servo controlled cyclic loading system as illustrated in the figure fig 2 b shows the plan view of the centrifuge model package as illustrated the monopod and tripod buckets were placed in the middle of the model container which has a plane area of 1200 950 mm 120 95 m in prototype the distance from outer boundary of the monopod bucket to the closet boundary of the model container is larger than 2d monopod as for tripod bucket foundation the outer boundary of the front buckets is also positioned at a distance exceeding 1 5d tripod from the closest lateral boundary of the model box the centre to centre distance of monopod bucket and tension bucket is more than 2d monopod the numerical back analyses of the monotonic centrifuge tests in following sections suggest that the major influence zones in terms of displacement vectors and mobilized friction angle in the soil around the bucket foundations are both developed within the given boundary of the model box 2 3 model soil dry silica fujian sand was used in all the tests reported herein the grain size distribution of the sand is illustrated in fig 3 it has a mean particle diameter of 0 17 mm with a coefficient of uniformity u c of 1 57 the maximum and minimum void ratios of the sand are 0 952 and 0 607 respectively some selected properties of fujian sand are summarized in table 3 two boxes of sand with equal height were produced with one prepared for the monotonic test series m1 and t1 see table 2 while the other for the cyclic test series m2 and t2 see table 2 each box of sand was prepared following the air pluvial deposition method during the sample preparation the falling height of the dry sand was maintained as a constant i e 565 mm which was determined based on the prior calibration with the aim to achieve a relative density of about 60 the sand bed was prepared in five layers with the thickness of each layer roughly equal to 90 mm after the formation of each layer the surface of the sand bed was levelled by a soft brush relative density of the layer can then be estimated based on its measured weight and thickness fig 4 shows the calculated distribution of relative density with depth within a depth of 200 mm below the surface which governs the lateral response of the monopod and the tripod see section 3 2 4 the relatively density of the sand beds in the two model boxes fell into a narrow range between 57 and 60 2 4 model caissons the dimensions of the tripod in this study were determined by referring to the first successfully installed tripod bucket foundation at the wind farm borkum riffgrund 1 ehrmann et al 2016 in which the diameter and height of each pod are 8 m with a total weight of 850 t accordingly the diameter d tripod and aspect ratio l d of the tripod bucket is 80 mm 8 m in prototype and 1 respectively the model tripod bucket foundation was made of aluminium alloy with an elastic modulus of 72 gpa and a poisson s ratio of 0 3 for a typical bucket foundation made of steel or concrete the wall thickness can vary from 12 mm to 0 5 m tjelta et al 1986 1994 1995 villalobos jara 2006 ding et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 you et al 2015 considering the fabrication limit and local bucking issue the thickness of bucket skirt was chosen to be 2 mm 0 2 m in prototype the centre to centre distance between each pod is 300 mm 30 m in prototype dimensions of the monopod were designed in a specific way to ensure its weight to be identical to that of the tripod i e an identical amount of material is consumed to fabricate the two types of model foundations following this way the bucket foundation with a skirt thickness of 4 mm 0 4 m in prototype has a diameter d monopod and aspect ratio l d of 150 mm 15 m in prototype and 1 respectively the prototype thickness of the model bucket i e 0 4 m is relatively larger than that adopted in the practical design for a steel bucket i e 0 1 0 2 m byrne 2000 senders 2008 villalobos jara 2006 this should have not jeopardized the validity of the experimental findings reported herein because the lateral response of a bucket foundation is mainly governed by the lateral soil resistance and partially contributed by the friction at the soil bucket interface achmus et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 thieken et al 2014 neither of which is sensitive to a slightly altered skirt thickness considering that this comparative study focused on the foundation response each loading tower was designed to be almost rigid while subjected to the lateral loadings applied in this study the outer diameter and plate thickness of each model tower were set to be 50 mm and 5 mm 5 m and 0 5 m in prototype respectively additional reinforcement stiffeners were also rigidly welded to the connections between the caisson cap and loading tower details of the model foundations are summarized in table 4 3 a preliminary numerical analysis the objectives of the numerical analyses are to reveal the displacement mechanisms of the monopod and tripod foundations and to de couple the three components of their foundation stiffness under the monotonic combined loading of horizontal force and overturning moment in each analysis the sand behaviour was described by a user defined hypoplastic soil model considering non linearity of stiffness at small strains which was incorporated in a commercial finite element program abaqus hibbitt 2008 with the open source implementation available for free download on the web gudehus et al 2008 3 1 finite element model and numerical modelling procedure fig 5 a and b show the three dimensional finite element model used to analyse the monotonically loaded monopod and tripod bucket foundations respectively for the sake of simplicity the monopod and tripod bucket foundations were modelled with separate meshes in each model only half of the model foundation was simulated because of symmetry the lateral boundaries of each model were constrained by roller supports while the bottom boundary of the model was fixed by pin supports dimensions and mechanical parameters of the model buckets in each numerical analysis are identical to those adopted in centrifuge tests the mechanical behaviour at the interface between the bucket and the soil is modelled using a classical coulomb model where the tangential frictional stress is linearly proportional to the normal stress the contact interface can open and close in the coulomb model the interface friction coefficient and limiting relative soil pile movement were set to be 2 3 tan φ c and 2 mm hong et al 2015 respectively in each analysis a gravitational acceleration of 100 g is imposed to the entire fe model both sand and bucket are modelled using eight node linear brick elements with full integration 2 2 2 integration points in each element the suitability of the mesh size as shown in fig 5 is justified by halving the current size of mesh and running one more analysis the computed moment rotation response from the analyses with the two mesh sizes differs by no more than 3 justifying the validity of the mesh size adopted in the present study as centrifuge tests were carried out in dry sand drained effective stress analysis was adopted in the numerical modelling each numerical analysis mainly consists of three steps as follows 1 setting up the initial stress conditions of the soil and activating the bucket foundation as wished in place at 1 g 2 increasing the gravitational acceleration of the entire model to 100g 3 applying a monotonic lateral loading to the bucket foundation till reaching the magnitude defined in each corresponding centrifuge test 3 2 constitutive model and model parameters a hypoplastic sand constitutive model considering strain and path dependency of soil stiffness at small strains was used to model the fujian sand the first version of the hypoplastic constitutive law was proposed by kolymbas 1985 followed by a series of developments to incorporate the critical state theory and state dependent characteristics of sand kolymbas 1991 wu and bauer 1994 gudehus 1996 von wolffersdorff 1996 mašín 2012a 2012b niemunis and herle 1997 further improved the hypoplastic model proposed by von wolffersdorff 1996 for sand to account for strain and path dependent stiffness at small strains by introducing an intergranular strain concept the improved version of the hypoplastic model was adopted in the present numerical analyses to describe the non linearity of shear stiffness at small strains and the state dependent dilatancy of fujian sand the hypoplastic constitutive model is characterized by the following formulation which established the relationship between the stress rate and the strain rate 1 σ f b f e l σ e ε f d n σ e ε where σ is a stress rate tensor ε is a strain rate tensor l is a fourth order tensor n is a second order tensor f b is barotropy factor considering the influence of soil state f d and f e are pyknotropy factors considering the influence of relative density the details of the equation can be found in the von wolffersdorff 1996 and niemunis and herle 1997 the hypoplastic constitutive model has eight basic material parameters and additional five parameters accounting for strain and stress dependent stiffness at small strains detailed calibration procedure of the model parameters has been presented by herle and gudehus 1999 3 3 calibration of the hypoplastic sand model to provide data for model calibration four stress paths controlled drained triaxial tests were performed on the fujian silica sand using the gds advanced dynamic triaxial testing system dyntts equipped with gds lvdt local strain transducers each sample was prepared to a relative density of approximate 60 which is comparable to that in the centrifuge tests the designed testing stress paths were illustrated in table 5 different recent stress paths were imposed in the four tests prior to a drained shearing at a constant p along an identical effective stress path by doing so the reversals in the direction of stress path prior to shearing in p q space are 0 90 90 and 180 the path and strain dependent shear stiffness at small strains can then be obtained and numerically calibrated fig 6 compares the measured and computed stress strain relationship for the soil sample under four different recent stress histories as shown in the figure the measured path and strain dependent stiffness degradation curves of the fujian sand were reasonably replicated using the advanced hypoplastic sand model the computed results captured the stress history effects on the soil stiffness all the calibrated model parameters were summarized in table 6 4 interpretation of the measured and computed results in the following sections all the results are interpreted in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 4 1 monotonic loading response 4 1 1 measured moment rotation response fig 7 compares the monotonic moment rotation response of the monopod and the tripod the moment and the rotation were both calculated with respect to a reference point locating at the centre of each foundation at the seabed level as shown in the figure the monopod bucket foundation exhibited a continuous hardening response without showing an obvious yield point suggesting a ductile response comparatively a bilinear response was observed on the tripod with a clear yield capacity implying a brittle response similar observations were also made from the centrifuge tests that investigated the monotonic response of monopod and tripod in silt kim et al 2014 prior to the yielding the tripod showed a much stiffer response as compared with the monopod at a typical rotation of 0 25 i e the limiting rotation of an offshore wind turbine the tripod carried a 78 higher moment than that taken by the monopod to quantify the ultimate capacity of the two bucket foundations which would be used for determining the loading amplitude in the cyclic tests the method proposed by villalobos jara 2006 was adopted it is suggested to determine the yield as the intersection of the two straight lines that fit the moment rotation curve at the beginning and at the end of the curve following villalobos jara 2006 s method the yield moments of the monopod and the tripod were determined as 400 mn m and 420 mn m respectively despite the similar yield moments yielding of the tripod occurred at a much smaller rotation i e 0 5 than that i e 1 75 of the monopod 4 1 2 measured evolution of rotation centre with lateral loading the moment rotation response as discussed in the preceding section may be predicted analytically given the instantaneous rotation centres of the bucket foundation is well established for this reason this section aims to study and compare the trajectories of instantaneous rotation centres in the monopod and the tripod subjected to the monotonic lateral loading the position of instantaneous rotation centre can be deduced based on the two vertical displacement measurements at the lid of the caisson and the two horizontal displacement measurements at the loading tower as shown in fig 8 the horizontal coordinate of the instantaneous rotation centre of the monopod and the tripod can be calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 while the vertical coordinate of the rotation centre for both foundations can be deduced using eq 4 as follows 2 x 0 l 2 s v 1 s v 2 s v 1 s v 2 3 x 0 l s v 1 s v 1 s v 2 s 4 z 0 l s h s v 1 s v 2 h where x 0 the horizontal distance from the centre line of the monopod or tripod z 0 depth with respect to the ground surface l horizontal distance between the two vertical laser displacement transducers h height of the horizontal laser displacement transducer s distance from the centre of tension bucket to the centre of the tripod tower details of the notation are illustrated in fig 8 fig 9 shows the trajectories of the instantaneous rotation centre of the monopod and the tripod in the figure the published data zhu et al 2014 based on a series of 1g model tests on laterally loaded monopods with different aspect ratios in sand silt are also included for comparison as shown in the insets of the figure a cartesian coordination system was defined with its origin located at the centre of each bucket foundation at the seabed level the horizontal coordination of the instantaneous rotation centre was normalized by monopod bucket diameter d and distance from the centre of pulled bucket to the centre of the tripod tower s while the vertical was normalized by the bucket height l with the commencement of the lateral loading the initial position of the rotation centre of the monopod foundation is located at 0 45d on the left of its vertical centre line and 2 5l below the ground surface with the increase of the lateral loading the rotation centre moved towards the vertical centre line of the monopod until reaching it indicating that a translational movement of the monopod dominated under the subsequently increasing lateral loading the rotation centre moved upwards along the vertical centre line and stabilized at 0 7l in the end suggesting that the rotational movement prevailed during this process zhu et al 2014 also observed that the final positions of rotation centre in their 1g model tests were all within 0 7 0 8l however the trajectories of the rotation centre of the monopod in the 1g model tests only showed an upward movement along the vertical centreline without the initial horizontal movement as occurred in the centrifuge model test reported herein the difference may be relevant to the different aspect ratio of model caisson and state of the sand i e a combination of relative density and stress level adopted in the centrifuge and the 1g model tests as far as the position of the rotation centre of the tripod is concerned it was initially positioned right underneath the rear bucket while subjected to the lateral loading the trajectory of the rotation centre moved horizontally along the loading direction accompanied with a downward movement in the vertical direction at the end of the loading stage the rotation centre was shifted to a position underneath the front pod during the entire loading stage the position of the rotation centre showed a single trend of movement i e translational movement dominated and remained to stay outside the tripod this is distinctively different from the monopod in which the trajectory of the rotation centre shown a two stage response and it eventually moved to a position within the foundation these differences can be explained by the soil deformation mechanisms around the monopod and the tripod as discussed in the following section 4 1 3 comparison between the measured and computed monotonic loading response the measured and computed monotonic moment rotation curves of the monopod and the tripod were illustrated in fig 7 for both foundations the initial stiffness was well captured by the computed results based on the hypoplastic model considering non linearity of stiffness at small strains as shown in the figure the yield moment is overestimated by the numerical analysis with the largest percentage differences of 8 3 and 7 7 for the monopod and tripod respectively considering that the bucket foundations are modelled as wish in place in this study the disturbance of 1 g installation is not accounted for which might lead to the smaller bearing capacity of centrifuge tests klinkvort 2013 despite some discrepancy the agreements between the measured and the computed response give confidence in the computed deformation mechanisms and foundations stiffness as presented in the following two sections 4 1 4 computed displacement mechanism of the bucket foundations fig 10 shows the displacement mechanism of the monopod at typical loading stages accompanied with the deformation mechanism and mobilized friction angle of the soil during the correspondingly stages at an initial loading stage 25 f u the monopod mainly exhibited a translational movement leading to a formation of an active wedge behind the pod as the lateral load increased the displacement of monopod consists of both translational movement as well as a rotation with the rotation centre eventually stabilizing at a depth of 0 7 0 8l below the ground surface particularly the skirt tip on the passive side of the monopod exhibited a kicked off behaviour like a short rigid pile as computed by hong et al 2017 based on an advanced hypoplastic soil model differing from the monopod the lateral behaviour of a tripod is usually assumed to be governed by the tensile response of the rear buckets and the compressive response of the front pods i e push pull mechanism senders 2008 houlsby 2016 this assumption appears to be only valid at a relatively small lateral loading e g 25 f u as shown in fig 11 a with a further increase of the lateral load from 50 f u to 100 f u however the buckets experienced not only the vertical movement but also horizontal translation and even rotation of the compression bucket as shown in fig 11 b c and d similar to the monopod an active soil wedge was produced at a relatively small loading 25 f u for both the rear and the front buckets in the subsequent loading stages i e 50 75 100 f u the movement of the rear buckets is a combination of horizontal translation and vertical lift which progressively produced a passive wedge in front of the buckets comparatively the front bucket exhibited a rotational displacement mechanism like the monopod with the rotation centre located at 0 5l beneath the lid of the bucket therefore it can be concluded that assumption of the push pull mechanism of the tripod response was mainly applicable when a relatively small lateral loading is applied less than 25 f u in this paper this practically implies that the coupling effect of horizontal force and over turning moment should be simultaneously taken into consideration for the estimation of bearing capacity of the tripod bucket foundation 4 1 5 computed foundation stiffness at the seabed level considering the significance of the coupling effect between the horizontal force and the over turning moment four additional numerical analyses were performed to simulate the monopod and tripod bucket foundation under displacement controlled pure translation and rotation by doing so the coefficients of horizontal stiffness k h rotational stiffness k m and the coupling stiffness k m h as formulated in eq 5 can be explicitly decoupled 5 h γ d 3 m γ d 4 k h k m h k m h k m u d θ as shown in eq 5 the lateral load h and moment m and displacement u were all presented in dimensionless terms to enable a direct comparison between the stiffness of the monopod and tripod in the above calculations the reference point was set at the centre of each bucket foundation at the seabed level fig 12 presents the degradation of stiffness coefficient i e representing normalized stiffness with foundation rotation and deflection for both the monopod and the tripod bucket foundations as shown in the figure the normalized stiffness coefficients follow a similar degradation pattern it can be seen that the three components of the foundation stiffness i e horizontal stiffness kh rotational stiffness km and the coupling stiffness khm at the seabed level dramatically degrade with the rotation quantitatively a rotation of 0 25 i e allowable rotation of an offshore wind turbine has led to a reduction of foundation stiffness by almost one order of magnitude this suggests that any dynamic modal analysis based on the initial foundation stiffness which can be estimated based on existing elastic solutions doherty and deeks 2003 doherty et al 2005 may significantly overestimate the natural frequency of a slightly titled offshore wind turbine this will mislead the subsequent assessment of the resonance potential of the offshore wind turbine to obtain more reliable foundation stiffness for dynamic modal analysis it is recommended to perform loading unloading experiment or numerical simulation with the applied load comparable to real load magnitude 4 2 accumulated rotation due to cyclic loading fig 13 a shows the developments of the measured rotation of the monopod with number of loading cycles at different amplitudes at each given cyclic amplitude the rotation of the monopod increased continuously with loading cycles at a decreasing rate moreover the majority of the rotation was produced within the first few hundred cycles similar trends were observed from a series of centrifuge tests simulating cyclically loaded monopod in dry dense sand cox et al 2014 on completion of the multi stage cycling the accumulated total rotation reached about 0 6 which had exceeded the limiting rotation i e 0 25 for an offshore wind turbine fig 13 b illustrates the development of tripod rotation at various stages of the lateral cycling at each given cyclic amplitude the rotation of the tripod increased during the first few hundreds of cycling and subsequently turned to a decrease in rotation i e tilted backward with respect to the loading direction during the remaining numbers of cycling after each stage of cycling the cumulative residual rotation was almost zero in other words the cyclically loaded tripod exhibited a favourable feature of self healing in accumulated rotation the potential of self healing in accumulated ration of a foundation consisting of multiple caissons was hypothesised by houlsby 2016 this is probably attributed to the fact that the fabric of soil adjacent to the rear buckets subjected to two way cycling should have experienced more damage than that near the front caisson subjected to one way cycling causing the former to settle more than the latter and therefore a backward titling of the multiple caissons this unique feature of self healing in cumulative rotation make the tripod distinguish with monopod which exhibited a continuously accumulated rotation under a constant amplitude of lateral cycling a comparison between fig 13 a and b shows that after experiencing 5 000 numbers of cycling with equal amplitudes the cumulative rotation of the tripod 0 1 was only 17 that of the monopod 0 6 although the same amount of material was used to fabricate the two bucket foundations this comparative study implies that with a given amount of steel a foundation consisting of multiple caissons with relatively small dimensions would be much less susceptible to cyclic accumulation of ration than a monopod with larger dimensions to generalize the cumulative trend the cyclic residual and peak rotation is normalized as θ r n θ r 0 θ r 0 and θ p n θ p 0 θ p 0 the definition of θ r 0 θ r n θ p 0 θ p n and ζ b are illustrated in a schematic diagram as shown in fig 14 fig 15 a and b presents the normalized accumulated peak and residual rotation of the monopod respectively an attempt was made to fit the measured data using both power and logarithmic functions which were commonly used for generating the cumulative trends of rotation of caissons zhu et al 2012 and monopiles lin and liao 1999 leblanc et al 2010a leblanc et al 2010b the power and logarithmic functions for curve fitting are formulated by eqs 6 and 7 as follows 6 θ n θ 0 θ 0 t n α 7 θ n θ 0 θ 0 b l n n as shown in the figure the power function yields a better prediction for both accumulated peak and residual rotations as compared with the logarithmic function the fitted coefficients of the power function i e t and α are compared with those reported in the literature as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively it is worth noting that leblanc et al 2010a and zhu et al 2012 simulated cyclically loaded monopod in loose sand in model tests at a low stress level i e 1g with an intention to mimic the dilatancy that would have been exhibited in a medium dense or dense sand at a high stress level i e in the field or in a centrifuge as illustrated in fig 16 the parameter t obtained from the centrifuge tests in medium dense sand this study does not seem to be a function of cyclic amplitude on the other hand the values of t deduced from the 1g model tests in loose sand leblanc et al 2010a zhu et al 2012 shown an obvious increase with cyclic amplitude the parameter α as shown in fig 17 appears to decrease with relative density of sand regardless of the stress level adopted in the model tests based the limited experimental data reported in the literature the suitability of extrapolating the cumulative trend of rotation obtained from 1g test results to that under a prototype stress condition remains inconclusive to convert a series of multi amplitude cyclic loadings to an equivalent constant amplitude cycling the miner s rule based super position method can be used as an approximation leblanc et al 2010a lin and liao 1999 peralta 2010 stewart 1986 the basic concept of the miner s rule is illustrated in fig 18 considering a foundation being subjected to a large number n a of loading cycles with a constant amplitude a and followed by the application of n b cycles of loading with an amplitude b the equivalent number of cycles n a eq b can be determined when the accumulated response induced by n b cycles of load amplitude b is equal to that induced by n a eq b cycles with load amplitude a then the accumulated rotation due to the multi stage cycling can be simply calculated by imposing the equivalent constant amplitude cyclic loading fig 19 shows the measured cumulative rotation of the monopod accompanying with the fitting results and the results calculated based on miner s rule as shown in the figure the fitting results following the power function coincides with the measured results while the fitting results using the logarithmic function underestimated the cumulative rotation at each episode of cycling in addition results calculated by miner s rule shown reasonably agreement with the measured data proving the applicability of miner s rule in predicting cumulative rotation of a monopod subjected to lateral cycling fig 20 a and b show the normalized cumulative peak and residual rotation of the tripod at a typical cyclic loading stage cyclic magnitude 40 f u since the cumulative rotation of the tripod shown a two stage response with a self healing after the cycling the power and logarithmic functions that can fit cumulative rotation of a monopod become invalid for the tripod instead the two stage response of a tripod may be fitted by a distorted gaussian curve as presented in the figure the distorted gaussian curve can well capture the developing pattern of tripod foundation rotation under cyclic loading considering the limited number of test performed further tests on the tripod foundation are necessary to verify the applicability of the distorted gaussian curve on fitting cyclic rotation developing pattern of the tripod 4 3 dynamic stiffness as the offshore wind turbine is a kind of dynamic loading sensitive structure the foundation stiffness changes during the lifetime will decrease or increase the first natural frequency of the structure which will shift the natural frequency to 1p or 3p frequency respectively one common way of defining the foundation stiffness is to take the secant modulus along the unloading path of a moment rotation plot as defined in fig 14 in the figure the parameters k 1 and k n represent the dynamic foundation stiffness on completion of the 1st and the nth cycling respectively fig 21 a and b show the evolution of the normalized dynamic stiffness of the monopod and the tripod with number of loading cycles respectively for the monopod bucket foundation the dynamic stiffness degraded with an increase in the cyclic magnitude as expected for each given cyclic magnitude the dynamic stiffness increases with number of cycles implying a stiffening foundation response and hence an increase in the natural frequency of the wind turbine system as illustrated in the figure the evolutional trend of the monopod stiffness at each cyclic magnitude broadly follow a logarithmic relationship which has been shown to reasonably fit the changing stiffness of monopiles subjected to lateral cycling leblanc et al 2010a li et al 2010 differing from the evolutional trend of monopod stiffness the dynamic stiffness of the tripod exhibited a two stage response i e the stiffness increased during the first few hundreds of cycling followed by a decrease thereafter the decrease in the foundation stiffness is probably because the rear bucket imposed a two way cycling to its surrounding soil resulting from the pull force which could have damaged the fabric of the soil and led to an overall weakening of the tripod foundation a quantitative comparison between fig 21 a and b suggests that for a given cyclic lateral load the tripod foundation is at least five times stiffer than that of the monopod foundation the tripod is therefore much less deformable than the monopod see fig 7 which was produced with a similar amount of steel material suggesting the resilience of the tripod against extreme environmental loadings of low frequency 5 summary and conclusions given the lack of track records on the long term field performance of bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine a series of centrifuge model tests were carried out to investigate and compare the lateral monotonic and cyclic behaviour of a monopod and a tripod for comparative purpose the two foundations were fabricated using the same amount of material the monotonic centrifuge tests were also back analysed using an advanced hypoplastic model considering non linearity of soil stiffness at small strains primarily aiming to decouple their foundation stiffness due to the combined loadings i e horizontal force and moment at the seabed level the distinctive differences of the push over bearing capacity cyclic accumulated rotation and dynamic stiffness of the monopod and the tripod were identified and interpreted key conclusions from this study are summarized below a the moment rotation relationship of the monopod shows a continuous hardening response while the tripod exhibits a bilinear response although the tripod has a significantly higher percentage increase 78 initial lateral stiffness than the monopod it yields at a much smaller percentage reduction 71 4 rotation suggesting a more brittle response of the former b under the combined loading i e horizontal force and moment at the seabed level the motion of the monopod experiences a two stage response namely an initial translation and a subsequent rotation the final position of the rotation centre is located at a depth of 0 7l l depth of the monopod within the monopod on the other hand the motion of the tripod subjected to the combined loading is dominated by a translational movement implying that the commonly assumed push pull mechanism for a tripod should be treated with caution the rotation centre is finally located outside the tripod i e at a depth of 1 5l underneath the front pod c the computed results reveal that the three components of the foundation stiffness i e horizontal stiffness kh rotational stiffness km and the coupling stiffness khm at the seabed level dramatically degrade with the rotation quantitatively the stiffness reduces by approximately one order of magnitude when the rotation reaches 0 25 this suggests that the usage of the initial stiffness for dynamic modal analysis may lead to a significant overestimation of the natural frequency of offshore wind turbine under the environmental loading d at each given magnitude of lateral cycling the cumulative rotation of the monopod increases with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate this trend can be well fitted by a power function comparison between this study and the database in the literature suggests that the fitting coefficients for the power function appear to be dependent on the stress level and relative density of the sand by converting the multi amplitude cyclic loadings to an equivalent constant amplitude cycling with the miner s rule and using the fitted power function the calculated cumulative rotation reasonably agrees with the measured data proving the applicability of the miner s rule e differing from the monopod the cumulative rotation of the tripod under each given cyclic magnitude increases during the first few hundreds of cycling but turned to a decrease during the remaining numbers of cycling this trend can be reasonably fitted by a distorted gaussian curve after each episode of cycling including 1 000 constant magnitude cycling the cumulative residual rotation was almost zero in other words the cyclically loaded tripod exhibited a favourable feature of self healing in accumulated rotation this unique feature of the tripod makes it distinguish with the monopod and is particularly preferred in the design of offshore wind turbine against various long term cyclic loadings f the dynamic stiffness of the monopod under each episode of lateral cycling increases with the cycle number with the trend following a logarithm function on the other hand the dynamic stiffness of the tripod subjected to each episode of lateral cycling exhibits a two stage response namely an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease consequently the dynamic stiffness of the tripod was barely altered after each episode of cycling including 1 000 loading cycles meaning that the natural frequency of the turbine system supported by a tripod foundation would roughly remain constant under the long term cyclic loading this is another preferable feature that makes the tripod superior to the monopod acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by international science

23486,the increasing trend of offshore wind turbines in deeper waters has necessitated the usage of alternative foundations such as the bucket foundation including monopod and tripod to investigate and compare the lateral monotonic and cyclic behaviour of the monopod and tripod a series of centrifuge tests were carried out in medium dense sand which were fabricated with an identical amount of material the monotonic centrifuge tests were back analysed using an advanced hypoplastic model to offer further insights into the test results under a monotonic lateral loading the tripod exhibits a 78 higher initial lateral stiffness than the monopod but it yields at a 71 4 smaller rotation suggesting a more brittle response while subjected to lateral cycling the rotation of the monopod increases with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate following a power function similarly the dynamic stiffness of the monopod also increases with number of cycles differing from the monopod the tripod exhibited a self healing behaviour both the rotation and dynamic stiffness increases during the first few hundreds of cycling but decreases thereafter leading to little variation this unique feature in cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of the tripod makes it superior to the monopod keywords centrifuge modelling medium dense sand bucket foundations bearing capacity cyclic loading dynamic stiffness 1 introduction the cost of foundations for offshore wind farm developments is a significant fraction of the overall installation cost current estimates suggest between 15 and 40 which plays an important role in financial viability of offshore wind turbine farm projects houlsby and byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2003 ewea 2016 as summarized by ewea 2016 most existing offshore wind turbines are constructed in a water depth less than 50 m while the monopile is widely adopted for current wind turbine foundation design the bucket foundation has been considered as a promising option for its easier installation reusable and economy in deeper water depth byrne and houlsby 2006 achmus et al 2013 houlsby et al 2005a randolph and gourvenec 2011 tjelta 2015 the bucket foundations are commonly designed in the forms of monopod houlsby et al 2005a ibsen and liingaard 2005 guo et al 2015 and tripod ehrmann et al 2016 basically the monopod bucket foundation is believed to be suitable for water depth up to 40 m deb siingh 2016 while the tripod is well suited for offshore sites with water depth ranging from 20 to 50 m kim and oh 2014 to meet the serviceability of an offshore wind turbine which is a slender structure subjected to various cyclic offshore environmental loadings two principal aspects governing the foundation design are cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of the foundation because any misalignment and resonance of the turbine structure could significantly reduce the design life of the various structural elements in the turbine for these reasons the cumulative rotation of the slender structure is limited to 0 25 in service peire et al 2009 det norske veritas 2002 while the modal frequencies are required to differ by 10 to those of the periodic wind wave current and vortex loads det norske veritas 2002 fig 1 presents a summary of typical loading frequency applied to the offshore wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 in the figure the 1p and 3p denotes the rotational frequency of the turbine and the blade passing frequency respectively to avoid any resonance the natural frequency of the system should be designed to be lower than 1p i e soft soft between 1p and 3p i e soft stiff or larger than 3p i e stiff stiff regions typically the initial natural frequency of most offshore wind turbines is designed to be soft stiff accounting for the cost and design feasibility yu et al 2015 however the variation of the dynamic foundation stiffness under long term cyclic loading may shift the natural frequency to approach one of the excitation frequency i e 1p or 3p leading to resonance bhattacharya et al 2013 despite the significance of cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness little track record of long term performance is available for monopod and tripod which are new types of foundation to support offshore wind turbine the current understandings of the cyclic behaviour i e cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of a laterally loaded monopod in sand were mainly obtained through small scale tests at 1g byrne 2000 foglia and ibsen 2014 villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2012 2014 large scale field trials houlsby et al 2006 and centrifuge model tests zhang et al 2007 cox et al 2014 it was found that under the fully drained condition the cumulative rotation of a laterally loaded model pod generally increased with number of cycles which can be fitted by a power relationship zhu et al 2012 cox et al 2014 on the other hand the evolution of the unloading stiffness with the loading cycles may broadly follow a logarithmic relationship cox et al 2014 comparing with the monopod cyclic response of a laterally loaded tripod foundation in sand are rarely investigated the existing studies mainly focused on vertical cyclic behaviour of a monopod which was intended to mimic the behaviour of one pod in a laterally loaded tripod byrne and houlsby 2004 houlsby et al 2005b kelly et al 2006 gao et al 2013 this simplification was made by assuming that a lateral load imposed to a tripod was thoroughly transformed into either vertical tensile or compressive loadings to the suction buckets senders and randolph 2009 although the studies based on this simplification have shed insights into the cyclic vertical behaviour that may be exhibited by one suction bucket in a tripod the cumulative rotation and variation of dynamic stiffness of a tripod foundation cannot be directly obtained the validity of the simplification also remained to be justified kim et al 2014 is probably one of the first to directly investigate the lateral cyclic response of a tripod displacement controlled centrifuge model tests were performed to simulate a tripod under limited numbers of lateral cycling in silt sand for engineering purpose the cyclic behaviour including cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness of a tripod may be more realistically obtained by performing load controlled long term cyclic load tests in addition it is vital to understand the different characteristics of cumulative rotation and dynamic stiffness between the monopod and the tripod through a systematic comparative study to optimise the bucket foundation design for offshore wind turbine in view of the aforementioned issues a series of centrifuge model tests were carried out in this study to directly compare the monotonic and cyclic lateral behaviour of a monopod and a tripod foundation which were fabricated with the same amount of material the measured data was interpreted with attentions specifically paid to the push over bearing capacity cyclic accumulation of rotation and evolution of dynamic stiffness of the two types of foundation moreover preliminary finite element analysis was performed to back analyse the monotonic lateral behaviour of the monopod and the tripod with the principal objectives to verify the push pull mechanism of the tripod and to de couple foundation stiffness under the combined loading of horizontal force and overturning moment 2 centrifuge modelling all of the centrifuge model tests reported in this paper were carried out at the geotechnical centrifuge facility of zhejiang university china the beam centrifuge which has a rotation arm of 4 5 m and a maximum payload of 400 gt can be operated up to 150 g chen et al 2010 scaling factors relevant to the centrifuge tests reported herein are summarized in table 1 taylor 2003 2 1 test programme the experimental programme consists of four centrifuge tests including one monotonic loading test and one multi stage cyclic loading test for each of the two model foundations i e monopod and tripod all the centrifuge tests were carried out in medium dense dry sand at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g firstly two monotonic lateral loading tests m1 and t1 were performed on the monopod and the tripod bucket foundations to compare their moment rotation response including the initial stiffness the evolution of rotation centre and the ultimate lateral capacity f u two load controlled multi stage cyclic tests m2 and t2 were then carried out to investigate the cumulative behaviour including the accumulated rotation and the change of dynamic stiffness of the monopod and tripod only one way cycling was imposed in each cyclic loading test because it was shown to produce a larger cumulative pile head displacement than the two way cycling haiderali et al 2015 he et al 2017 details on the performed cyclic loading regimes are summarized in table 2 including the cyclic load magnitude and cycles for each loading package 2 2 centrifuge model package fig 2 a shows the elevation view of a typical centrifuge model package the bucket foundations were jacketed to designed depth at 1 g a load cell and a laser displacement sensor were attached to the actuator rod to record the applied load and lateral displacement at the loading height additional displacement sensors were also instrumented to measure the lateral and vertical displacements at different locations for offshore structures most loads from wave current and wind are loaded at certain height for a typical 2 mw 5 mw offshore wind turbines the horizontal load can vary from 4 6 mn to 16 mn with the corresponding over turning moment ranging from 95 mnm to 562 mnm leading to a loading height of 20 35 m houlsby et al 2005a villalobos jara 2006 abadie 2015 therefore the height of the lateral load applied in the turbine tower in each test was determined as 315 mm 31 5 m in prototype above the seabed floor it is recognised that the typical loading direction may be either perpendicular or parallel to the centreline between any two buckets of the tripod foundation stergiou et al 2015 found that the former configuration would exhibit a lower bearing capacity than the latter based on a series of three dimensional finite element analyses to simulate the worst case scenario the former configuration i e with the typical loading perpendicular to the centre line of two buckets was therefore adopted in this experimental study the loading direction was oriented in such a way that only one rear pod was under tension while two front pods were subjected to compression the monotonic and cyclic loads were applied by a servo controlled cyclic loading system as illustrated in the figure fig 2 b shows the plan view of the centrifuge model package as illustrated the monopod and tripod buckets were placed in the middle of the model container which has a plane area of 1200 950 mm 120 95 m in prototype the distance from outer boundary of the monopod bucket to the closet boundary of the model container is larger than 2d monopod as for tripod bucket foundation the outer boundary of the front buckets is also positioned at a distance exceeding 1 5d tripod from the closest lateral boundary of the model box the centre to centre distance of monopod bucket and tension bucket is more than 2d monopod the numerical back analyses of the monotonic centrifuge tests in following sections suggest that the major influence zones in terms of displacement vectors and mobilized friction angle in the soil around the bucket foundations are both developed within the given boundary of the model box 2 3 model soil dry silica fujian sand was used in all the tests reported herein the grain size distribution of the sand is illustrated in fig 3 it has a mean particle diameter of 0 17 mm with a coefficient of uniformity u c of 1 57 the maximum and minimum void ratios of the sand are 0 952 and 0 607 respectively some selected properties of fujian sand are summarized in table 3 two boxes of sand with equal height were produced with one prepared for the monotonic test series m1 and t1 see table 2 while the other for the cyclic test series m2 and t2 see table 2 each box of sand was prepared following the air pluvial deposition method during the sample preparation the falling height of the dry sand was maintained as a constant i e 565 mm which was determined based on the prior calibration with the aim to achieve a relative density of about 60 the sand bed was prepared in five layers with the thickness of each layer roughly equal to 90 mm after the formation of each layer the surface of the sand bed was levelled by a soft brush relative density of the layer can then be estimated based on its measured weight and thickness fig 4 shows the calculated distribution of relative density with depth within a depth of 200 mm below the surface which governs the lateral response of the monopod and the tripod see section 3 2 4 the relatively density of the sand beds in the two model boxes fell into a narrow range between 57 and 60 2 4 model caissons the dimensions of the tripod in this study were determined by referring to the first successfully installed tripod bucket foundation at the wind farm borkum riffgrund 1 ehrmann et al 2016 in which the diameter and height of each pod are 8 m with a total weight of 850 t accordingly the diameter d tripod and aspect ratio l d of the tripod bucket is 80 mm 8 m in prototype and 1 respectively the model tripod bucket foundation was made of aluminium alloy with an elastic modulus of 72 gpa and a poisson s ratio of 0 3 for a typical bucket foundation made of steel or concrete the wall thickness can vary from 12 mm to 0 5 m tjelta et al 1986 1994 1995 villalobos jara 2006 ding et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 you et al 2015 considering the fabrication limit and local bucking issue the thickness of bucket skirt was chosen to be 2 mm 0 2 m in prototype the centre to centre distance between each pod is 300 mm 30 m in prototype dimensions of the monopod were designed in a specific way to ensure its weight to be identical to that of the tripod i e an identical amount of material is consumed to fabricate the two types of model foundations following this way the bucket foundation with a skirt thickness of 4 mm 0 4 m in prototype has a diameter d monopod and aspect ratio l d of 150 mm 15 m in prototype and 1 respectively the prototype thickness of the model bucket i e 0 4 m is relatively larger than that adopted in the practical design for a steel bucket i e 0 1 0 2 m byrne 2000 senders 2008 villalobos jara 2006 this should have not jeopardized the validity of the experimental findings reported herein because the lateral response of a bucket foundation is mainly governed by the lateral soil resistance and partially contributed by the friction at the soil bucket interface achmus et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 thieken et al 2014 neither of which is sensitive to a slightly altered skirt thickness considering that this comparative study focused on the foundation response each loading tower was designed to be almost rigid while subjected to the lateral loadings applied in this study the outer diameter and plate thickness of each model tower were set to be 50 mm and 5 mm 5 m and 0 5 m in prototype respectively additional reinforcement stiffeners were also rigidly welded to the connections between the caisson cap and loading tower details of the model foundations are summarized in table 4 3 a preliminary numerical analysis the objectives of the numerical analyses are to reveal the displacement mechanisms of the monopod and tripod foundations and to de couple the three components of their foundation stiffness under the monotonic combined loading of horizontal force and overturning moment in each analysis the sand behaviour was described by a user defined hypoplastic soil model considering non linearity of stiffness at small strains which was incorporated in a commercial finite element program abaqus hibbitt 2008 with the open source implementation available for free download on the web gudehus et al 2008 3 1 finite element model and numerical modelling procedure fig 5 a and b show the three dimensional finite element model used to analyse the monotonically loaded monopod and tripod bucket foundations respectively for the sake of simplicity the monopod and tripod bucket foundations were modelled with separate meshes in each model only half of the model foundation was simulated because of symmetry the lateral boundaries of each model were constrained by roller supports while the bottom boundary of the model was fixed by pin supports dimensions and mechanical parameters of the model buckets in each numerical analysis are identical to those adopted in centrifuge tests the mechanical behaviour at the interface between the bucket and the soil is modelled using a classical coulomb model where the tangential frictional stress is linearly proportional to the normal stress the contact interface can open and close in the coulomb model the interface friction coefficient and limiting relative soil pile movement were set to be 2 3 tan φ c and 2 mm hong et al 2015 respectively in each analysis a gravitational acceleration of 100 g is imposed to the entire fe model both sand and bucket are modelled using eight node linear brick elements with full integration 2 2 2 integration points in each element the suitability of the mesh size as shown in fig 5 is justified by halving the current size of mesh and running one more analysis the computed moment rotation response from the analyses with the two mesh sizes differs by no more than 3 justifying the validity of the mesh size adopted in the present study as centrifuge tests were carried out in dry sand drained effective stress analysis was adopted in the numerical modelling each numerical analysis mainly consists of three steps as follows 1 setting up the initial stress conditions of the soil and activating the bucket foundation as wished in place at 1 g 2 increasing the gravitational acceleration of the entire model to 100g 3 applying a monotonic lateral loading to the bucket foundation till reaching the magnitude defined in each corresponding centrifuge test 3 2 constitutive model and model parameters a hypoplastic sand constitutive model considering strain and path dependency of soil stiffness at small strains was used to model the fujian sand the first version of the hypoplastic constitutive law was proposed by kolymbas 1985 followed by a series of developments to incorporate the critical state theory and state dependent characteristics of sand kolymbas 1991 wu and bauer 1994 gudehus 1996 von wolffersdorff 1996 mašín 2012a 2012b niemunis and herle 1997 further improved the hypoplastic model proposed by von wolffersdorff 1996 for sand to account for strain and path dependent stiffness at small strains by introducing an intergranular strain concept the improved version of the hypoplastic model was adopted in the present numerical analyses to describe the non linearity of shear stiffness at small strains and the state dependent dilatancy of fujian sand the hypoplastic constitutive model is characterized by the following formulation which established the relationship between the stress rate and the strain rate 1 σ f b f e l σ e ε f d n σ e ε where σ is a stress rate tensor ε is a strain rate tensor l is a fourth order tensor n is a second order tensor f b is barotropy factor considering the influence of soil state f d and f e are pyknotropy factors considering the influence of relative density the details of the equation can be found in the von wolffersdorff 1996 and niemunis and herle 1997 the hypoplastic constitutive model has eight basic material parameters and additional five parameters accounting for strain and stress dependent stiffness at small strains detailed calibration procedure of the model parameters has been presented by herle and gudehus 1999 3 3 calibration of the hypoplastic sand model to provide data for model calibration four stress paths controlled drained triaxial tests were performed on the fujian silica sand using the gds advanced dynamic triaxial testing system dyntts equipped with gds lvdt local strain transducers each sample was prepared to a relative density of approximate 60 which is comparable to that in the centrifuge tests the designed testing stress paths were illustrated in table 5 different recent stress paths were imposed in the four tests prior to a drained shearing at a constant p along an identical effective stress path by doing so the reversals in the direction of stress path prior to shearing in p q space are 0 90 90 and 180 the path and strain dependent shear stiffness at small strains can then be obtained and numerically calibrated fig 6 compares the measured and computed stress strain relationship for the soil sample under four different recent stress histories as shown in the figure the measured path and strain dependent stiffness degradation curves of the fujian sand were reasonably replicated using the advanced hypoplastic sand model the computed results captured the stress history effects on the soil stiffness all the calibrated model parameters were summarized in table 6 4 interpretation of the measured and computed results in the following sections all the results are interpreted in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 4 1 monotonic loading response 4 1 1 measured moment rotation response fig 7 compares the monotonic moment rotation response of the monopod and the tripod the moment and the rotation were both calculated with respect to a reference point locating at the centre of each foundation at the seabed level as shown in the figure the monopod bucket foundation exhibited a continuous hardening response without showing an obvious yield point suggesting a ductile response comparatively a bilinear response was observed on the tripod with a clear yield capacity implying a brittle response similar observations were also made from the centrifuge tests that investigated the monotonic response of monopod and tripod in silt kim et al 2014 prior to the yielding the tripod showed a much stiffer response as compared with the monopod at a typical rotation of 0 25 i e the limiting rotation of an offshore wind turbine the tripod carried a 78 higher moment than that taken by the monopod to quantify the ultimate capacity of the two bucket foundations which would be used for determining the loading amplitude in the cyclic tests the method proposed by villalobos jara 2006 was adopted it is suggested to determine the yield as the intersection of the two straight lines that fit the moment rotation curve at the beginning and at the end of the curve following villalobos jara 2006 s method the yield moments of the monopod and the tripod were determined as 400 mn m and 420 mn m respectively despite the similar yield moments yielding of the tripod occurred at a much smaller rotation i e 0 5 than that i e 1 75 of the monopod 4 1 2 measured evolution of rotation centre with lateral loading the moment rotation response as discussed in the preceding section may be predicted analytically given the instantaneous rotation centres of the bucket foundation is well established for this reason this section aims to study and compare the trajectories of instantaneous rotation centres in the monopod and the tripod subjected to the monotonic lateral loading the position of instantaneous rotation centre can be deduced based on the two vertical displacement measurements at the lid of the caisson and the two horizontal displacement measurements at the loading tower as shown in fig 8 the horizontal coordinate of the instantaneous rotation centre of the monopod and the tripod can be calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 while the vertical coordinate of the rotation centre for both foundations can be deduced using eq 4 as follows 2 x 0 l 2 s v 1 s v 2 s v 1 s v 2 3 x 0 l s v 1 s v 1 s v 2 s 4 z 0 l s h s v 1 s v 2 h where x 0 the horizontal distance from the centre line of the monopod or tripod z 0 depth with respect to the ground surface l horizontal distance between the two vertical laser displacement transducers h height of the horizontal laser displacement transducer s distance from the centre of tension bucket to the centre of the tripod tower details of the notation are illustrated in fig 8 fig 9 shows the trajectories of the instantaneous rotation centre of the monopod and the tripod in the figure the published data zhu et al 2014 based on a series of 1g model tests on laterally loaded monopods with different aspect ratios in sand silt are also included for comparison as shown in the insets of the figure a cartesian coordination system was defined with its origin located at the centre of each bucket foundation at the seabed level the horizontal coordination of the instantaneous rotation centre was normalized by monopod bucket diameter d and distance from the centre of pulled bucket to the centre of the tripod tower s while the vertical was normalized by the bucket height l with the commencement of the lateral loading the initial position of the rotation centre of the monopod foundation is located at 0 45d on the left of its vertical centre line and 2 5l below the ground surface with the increase of the lateral loading the rotation centre moved towards the vertical centre line of the monopod until reaching it indicating that a translational movement of the monopod dominated under the subsequently increasing lateral loading the rotation centre moved upwards along the vertical centre line and stabilized at 0 7l in the end suggesting that the rotational movement prevailed during this process zhu et al 2014 also observed that the final positions of rotation centre in their 1g model tests were all within 0 7 0 8l however the trajectories of the rotation centre of the monopod in the 1g model tests only showed an upward movement along the vertical centreline without the initial horizontal movement as occurred in the centrifuge model test reported herein the difference may be relevant to the different aspect ratio of model caisson and state of the sand i e a combination of relative density and stress level adopted in the centrifuge and the 1g model tests as far as the position of the rotation centre of the tripod is concerned it was initially positioned right underneath the rear bucket while subjected to the lateral loading the trajectory of the rotation centre moved horizontally along the loading direction accompanied with a downward movement in the vertical direction at the end of the loading stage the rotation centre was shifted to a position underneath the front pod during the entire loading stage the position of the rotation centre showed a single trend of movement i e translational movement dominated and remained to stay outside the tripod this is distinctively different from the monopod in which the trajectory of the rotation centre shown a two stage response and it eventually moved to a position within the foundation these differences can be explained by the soil deformation mechanisms around the monopod and the tripod as discussed in the following section 4 1 3 comparison between the measured and computed monotonic loading response the measured and computed monotonic moment rotation curves of the monopod and the tripod were illustrated in fig 7 for both foundations the initial stiffness was well captured by the computed results based on the hypoplastic model considering non linearity of stiffness at small strains as shown in the figure the yield moment is overestimated by the numerical analysis with the largest percentage differences of 8 3 and 7 7 for the monopod and tripod respectively considering that the bucket foundations are modelled as wish in place in this study the disturbance of 1 g installation is not accounted for which might lead to the smaller bearing capacity of centrifuge tests klinkvort 2013 despite some discrepancy the agreements between the measured and the computed response give confidence in the computed deformation mechanisms and foundations stiffness as presented in the following two sections 4 1 4 computed displacement mechanism of the bucket foundations fig 10 shows the displacement mechanism of the monopod at typical loading stages accompanied with the deformation mechanism and mobilized friction angle of the soil during the correspondingly stages at an initial loading stage 25 f u the monopod mainly exhibited a translational movement leading to a formation of an active wedge behind the pod as the lateral load increased the displacement of monopod consists of both translational movement as well as a rotation with the rotation centre eventually stabilizing at a depth of 0 7 0 8l below the ground surface particularly the skirt tip on the passive side of the monopod exhibited a kicked off behaviour like a short rigid pile as computed by hong et al 2017 based on an advanced hypoplastic soil model differing from the monopod the lateral behaviour of a tripod is usually assumed to be governed by the tensile response of the rear buckets and the compressive response of the front pods i e push pull mechanism senders 2008 houlsby 2016 this assumption appears to be only valid at a relatively small lateral loading e g 25 f u as shown in fig 11 a with a further increase of the lateral load from 50 f u to 100 f u however the buckets experienced not only the vertical movement but also horizontal translation and even rotation of the compression bucket as shown in fig 11 b c and d similar to the monopod an active soil wedge was produced at a relatively small loading 25 f u for both the rear and the front buckets in the subsequent loading stages i e 50 75 100 f u the movement of the rear buckets is a combination of horizontal translation and vertical lift which progressively produced a passive wedge in front of the buckets comparatively the front bucket exhibited a rotational displacement mechanism like the monopod with the rotation centre located at 0 5l beneath the lid of the bucket therefore it can be concluded that assumption of the push pull mechanism of the tripod response was mainly applicable when a relatively small lateral loading is applied less than 25 f u in this paper this practically implies that the coupling effect of horizontal force and over turning moment should be simultaneously taken into consideration for the estimation of bearing capacity of the tripod bucket foundation 4 1 5 computed foundation stiffness at the seabed level considering the significance of the coupling effect between the horizontal force and the over turning moment four additional numerical analyses were performed to simulate the monopod and tripod bucket foundation under displacement controlled pure translation and rotation by doing so the coefficients of horizontal stiffness k h rotational stiffness k m and the coupling stiffness k m h as formulated in eq 5 can be explicitly decoupled 5 h γ d 3 m γ d 4 k h k m h k m h k m u d θ as shown in eq 5 the lateral load h and moment m and displacement u were all presented in dimensionless terms to enable a direct comparison between the stiffness of the monopod and tripod in the above calculations the reference point was set at the centre of each bucket foundation at the seabed level fig 12 presents the degradation of stiffness coefficient i e representing normalized stiffness with foundation rotation and deflection for both the monopod and the tripod bucket foundations as shown in the figure the normalized stiffness coefficients follow a similar degradation pattern it can be seen that the three components of the foundation stiffness i e horizontal stiffness kh rotational stiffness km and the coupling stiffness khm at the seabed level dramatically degrade with the rotation quantitatively a rotation of 0 25 i e allowable rotation of an offshore wind turbine has led to a reduction of foundation stiffness by almost one order of magnitude this suggests that any dynamic modal analysis based on the initial foundation stiffness which can be estimated based on existing elastic solutions doherty and deeks 2003 doherty et al 2005 may significantly overestimate the natural frequency of a slightly titled offshore wind turbine this will mislead the subsequent assessment of the resonance potential of the offshore wind turbine to obtain more reliable foundation stiffness for dynamic modal analysis it is recommended to perform loading unloading experiment or numerical simulation with the applied load comparable to real load magnitude 4 2 accumulated rotation due to cyclic loading fig 13 a shows the developments of the measured rotation of the monopod with number of loading cycles at different amplitudes at each given cyclic amplitude the rotation of the monopod increased continuously with loading cycles at a decreasing rate moreover the majority of the rotation was produced within the first few hundred cycles similar trends were observed from a series of centrifuge tests simulating cyclically loaded monopod in dry dense sand cox et al 2014 on completion of the multi stage cycling the accumulated total rotation reached about 0 6 which had exceeded the limiting rotation i e 0 25 for an offshore wind turbine fig 13 b illustrates the development of tripod rotation at various stages of the lateral cycling at each given cyclic amplitude the rotation of the tripod increased during the first few hundreds of cycling and subsequently turned to a decrease in rotation i e tilted backward with respect to the loading direction during the remaining numbers of cycling after each stage of cycling the cumulative residual rotation was almost zero in other words the cyclically loaded tripod exhibited a favourable feature of self healing in accumulated rotation the potential of self healing in accumulated ration of a foundation consisting of multiple caissons was hypothesised by houlsby 2016 this is probably attributed to the fact that the fabric of soil adjacent to the rear buckets subjected to two way cycling should have experienced more damage than that near the front caisson subjected to one way cycling causing the former to settle more than the latter and therefore a backward titling of the multiple caissons this unique feature of self healing in cumulative rotation make the tripod distinguish with monopod which exhibited a continuously accumulated rotation under a constant amplitude of lateral cycling a comparison between fig 13 a and b shows that after experiencing 5 000 numbers of cycling with equal amplitudes the cumulative rotation of the tripod 0 1 was only 17 that of the monopod 0 6 although the same amount of material was used to fabricate the two bucket foundations this comparative study implies that with a given amount of steel a foundation consisting of multiple caissons with relatively small dimensions would be much less susceptible to cyclic accumulation of ration than a monopod with larger dimensions to generalize the cumulative trend the cyclic residual and peak rotation is normalized as θ r n θ r 0 θ r 0 and θ p n θ p 0 θ p 0 the definition of θ r 0 θ r n θ p 0 θ p n and ζ b are illustrated in a schematic diagram as shown in fig 14 fig 15 a and b presents the normalized accumulated peak and residual rotation of the monopod respectively an attempt was made to fit the measured data using both power and logarithmic functions which were commonly used for generating the cumulative trends of rotation of caissons zhu et al 2012 and monopiles lin and liao 1999 leblanc et al 2010a leblanc et al 2010b the power and logarithmic functions for curve fitting are formulated by eqs 6 and 7 as follows 6 θ n θ 0 θ 0 t n α 7 θ n θ 0 θ 0 b l n n as shown in the figure the power function yields a better prediction for both accumulated peak and residual rotations as compared with the logarithmic function the fitted coefficients of the power function i e t and α are compared with those reported in the literature as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively it is worth noting that leblanc et al 2010a and zhu et al 2012 simulated cyclically loaded monopod in loose sand in model tests at a low stress level i e 1g with an intention to mimic the dilatancy that would have been exhibited in a medium dense or dense sand at a high stress level i e in the field or in a centrifuge as illustrated in fig 16 the parameter t obtained from the centrifuge tests in medium dense sand this study does not seem to be a function of cyclic amplitude on the other hand the values of t deduced from the 1g model tests in loose sand leblanc et al 2010a zhu et al 2012 shown an obvious increase with cyclic amplitude the parameter α as shown in fig 17 appears to decrease with relative density of sand regardless of the stress level adopted in the model tests based the limited experimental data reported in the literature the suitability of extrapolating the cumulative trend of rotation obtained from 1g test results to that under a prototype stress condition remains inconclusive to convert a series of multi amplitude cyclic loadings to an equivalent constant amplitude cycling the miner s rule based super position method can be used as an approximation leblanc et al 2010a lin and liao 1999 peralta 2010 stewart 1986 the basic concept of the miner s rule is illustrated in fig 18 considering a foundation being subjected to a large number n a of loading cycles with a constant amplitude a and followed by the application of n b cycles of loading with an amplitude b the equivalent number of cycles n a eq b can be determined when the accumulated response induced by n b cycles of load amplitude b is equal to that induced by n a eq b cycles with load amplitude a then the accumulated rotation due to the multi stage cycling can be simply calculated by imposing the equivalent constant amplitude cyclic loading fig 19 shows the measured cumulative rotation of the monopod accompanying with the fitting results and the results calculated based on miner s rule as shown in the figure the fitting results following the power function coincides with the measured results while the fitting results using the logarithmic function underestimated the cumulative rotation at each episode of cycling in addition results calculated by miner s rule shown reasonably agreement with the measured data proving the applicability of miner s rule in predicting cumulative rotation of a monopod subjected to lateral cycling fig 20 a and b show the normalized cumulative peak and residual rotation of the tripod at a typical cyclic loading stage cyclic magnitude 40 f u since the cumulative rotation of the tripod shown a two stage response with a self healing after the cycling the power and logarithmic functions that can fit cumulative rotation of a monopod become invalid for the tripod instead the two stage response of a tripod may be fitted by a distorted gaussian curve as presented in the figure the distorted gaussian curve can well capture the developing pattern of tripod foundation rotation under cyclic loading considering the limited number of test performed further tests on the tripod foundation are necessary to verify the applicability of the distorted gaussian curve on fitting cyclic rotation developing pattern of the tripod 4 3 dynamic stiffness as the offshore wind turbine is a kind of dynamic loading sensitive structure the foundation stiffness changes during the lifetime will decrease or increase the first natural frequency of the structure which will shift the natural frequency to 1p or 3p frequency respectively one common way of defining the foundation stiffness is to take the secant modulus along the unloading path of a moment rotation plot as defined in fig 14 in the figure the parameters k 1 and k n represent the dynamic foundation stiffness on completion of the 1st and the nth cycling respectively fig 21 a and b show the evolution of the normalized dynamic stiffness of the monopod and the tripod with number of loading cycles respectively for the monopod bucket foundation the dynamic stiffness degraded with an increase in the cyclic magnitude as expected for each given cyclic magnitude the dynamic stiffness increases with number of cycles implying a stiffening foundation response and hence an increase in the natural frequency of the wind turbine system as illustrated in the figure the evolutional trend of the monopod stiffness at each cyclic magnitude broadly follow a logarithmic relationship which has been shown to reasonably fit the changing stiffness of monopiles subjected to lateral cycling leblanc et al 2010a li et al 2010 differing from the evolutional trend of monopod stiffness the dynamic stiffness of the tripod exhibited a two stage response i e the stiffness increased during the first few hundreds of cycling followed by a decrease thereafter the decrease in the foundation stiffness is probably because the rear bucket imposed a two way cycling to its surrounding soil resulting from the pull force which could have damaged the fabric of the soil and led to an overall weakening of the tripod foundation a quantitative comparison between fig 21 a and b suggests that for a given cyclic lateral load the tripod foundation is at least five times stiffer than that of the monopod foundation the tripod is therefore much less deformable than the monopod see fig 7 which was produced with a similar amount of steel material suggesting the resilience of the tripod against extreme environmental loadings of low frequency 5 summary and conclusions given the lack of track records on the long term field performance of bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine a series of centrifuge model tests were carried out to investigate and compare the lateral monotonic and cyclic behaviour of a monopod and a tripod for comparative purpose the two foundations were fabricated using the same amount of material the monotonic centrifuge tests were also back analysed using an advanced hypoplastic model considering non linearity of soil stiffness at small strains primarily aiming to decouple their foundation stiffness due to the combined loadings i e horizontal force and moment at the seabed level the distinctive differences of the push over bearing capacity cyclic accumulated rotation and dynamic stiffness of the monopod and the tripod were identified and interpreted key conclusions from this study are summarized below a the moment rotation relationship of the monopod shows a continuous hardening response while the tripod exhibits a bilinear response although the tripod has a significantly higher percentage increase 78 initial lateral stiffness than the monopod it yields at a much smaller percentage reduction 71 4 rotation suggesting a more brittle response of the former b under the combined loading i e horizontal force and moment at the seabed level the motion of the monopod experiences a two stage response namely an initial translation and a subsequent rotation the final position of the rotation centre is located at a depth of 0 7l l depth of the monopod within the monopod on the other hand the motion of the tripod subjected to the combined loading is dominated by a translational movement implying that the commonly assumed push pull mechanism for a tripod should be treated with caution the rotation centre is finally located outside the tripod i e at a depth of 1 5l underneath the front pod c the computed results reveal that the three components of the foundation stiffness i e horizontal stiffness kh rotational stiffness km and the coupling stiffness khm at the seabed level dramatically degrade with the rotation quantitatively the stiffness reduces by approximately one order of magnitude when the rotation reaches 0 25 this suggests that the usage of the initial stiffness for dynamic modal analysis may lead to a significant overestimation of the natural frequency of offshore wind turbine under the environmental loading d at each given magnitude of lateral cycling the cumulative rotation of the monopod increases with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate this trend can be well fitted by a power function comparison between this study and the database in the literature suggests that the fitting coefficients for the power function appear to be dependent on the stress level and relative density of the sand by converting the multi amplitude cyclic loadings to an equivalent constant amplitude cycling with the miner s rule and using the fitted power function the calculated cumulative rotation reasonably agrees with the measured data proving the applicability of the miner s rule e differing from the monopod the cumulative rotation of the tripod under each given cyclic magnitude increases during the first few hundreds of cycling but turned to a decrease during the remaining numbers of cycling this trend can be reasonably fitted by a distorted gaussian curve after each episode of cycling including 1 000 constant magnitude cycling the cumulative residual rotation was almost zero in other words the cyclically loaded tripod exhibited a favourable feature of self healing in accumulated rotation this unique feature of the tripod makes it distinguish with the monopod and is particularly preferred in the design of offshore wind turbine against various long term cyclic loadings f the dynamic stiffness of the monopod under each episode of lateral cycling increases with the cycle number with the trend following a logarithm function on the other hand the dynamic stiffness of the tripod subjected to each episode of lateral cycling exhibits a two stage response namely an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease consequently the dynamic stiffness of the tripod was barely altered after each episode of cycling including 1 000 loading cycles meaning that the natural frequency of the turbine system supported by a tripod foundation would roughly remain constant under the long term cyclic loading this is another preferable feature that makes the tripod superior to the monopod acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by international science

23487,this study addresses the development of a statistical tool for predicting the distribution of the size and velocity of droplets in spray caused by the interaction of waves with a marine object the maximum entropy principle mep is a statistical tool that allows the prediction of a probability distribution that is consistent with information from the input system the prediction satisfies constraint equations covering the conservation of mass momentum and energy the velocity distribution of droplets is gaussian in shape the effect of a drag force on both the liquid sheet that is formed from the wave impact as well as the downstream distribution of droplets was considered in this simulation the examination of the mechanisms of turbulence diffusion in a wave at the moment of impact with an object provides a logical analytical relationship between the wave flows and a spray cloud formation after impact the model prediction is compared with the experimental data of spray cloud formation due to wave impact from a lab scale model and is found to be in good agreement the prediction model is then applied to the full scale model based on the data from previous field observations to predict the droplet size and velocity distributions of spray cloud due to the wave interactions with the vessel keywords maximum entropy method droplet size distribution spray formation wave impact 1 introduction wave spray events are recognized as a dangerous occurrence for marine vessels and offshore structures spray events are characterized by dispersed masses of liquid that move to the vessel deck after a wave impact wave spray combined with cold air temperature cause significant icing conditions on these structures which can affect stability structural integrity and increase safety risks and operation hazards on board roebber and mitten 1987 ryerson 2013 bodaghkhani et al 2016 dehghani sanij et al 2015 the simulation of wave spray is a complex procedure which consists of simulating several free surface related events such as breaking waves water sheet breakup and spray formation these phenomena are currently among the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics hendrickson et al 2003 dehghani sanij et al 2018 in the framework of large ships and structures the amount of water delivery droplet size velocity distributions and height of the spray are major concerns bodaghkhani et al 2017 although wave spray is the major cause of icing on vessels the physical nature of wave impact and spray formation are still poorly understood besides a few observational studies which provide a qualitative understanding of the water delivery and spray heights little research on this subject is available in the literature dehghani sanij et al 2017a 2017b modeling the distribution of droplet size and velocity is essential in the study of spray cloud formation and these distributions are crucial parameters for the fundamental analysis of droplet trajectories upside of the bow of a vessel dehghani et al 2016a dehghani and naterer 2016b typical analytical models for predicting the size and velocity of droplets are extracted from experimental data and measurements for small scale events such as spray formation from a nozzle examples of these distributions are the rosin rammler distribution rosin and rammler 1933 and the nukiyama tanasawa distribution nukiyama and tanasawa 1939 the interested reader can refer to a review paper by babinski and sojka 2002 for broad spray distribution models more recent studies use statistical approaches to predict more general droplet sizes and velocity distributions the mep method has become popular for the prediction of droplet sizes and velocity distributions because it produces reasonably accurate results sellens and brzustowski 1985 1986 and li and tankin 1987 1988 were the first to introduce this method since the theory of this method has been well described by these researchers the background materials are not covered in this article the method assumes that while the system entropy is maximized and conservation equations mass momentum and energy are satisfied the equation for size distribution will be equally satisfied the mep method has been upgraded for different conditions and the effects of several phenomena were added over the past two decades kim et al 2003 used the mep and instability analysis of liquid sheets to consider the effect of the instability of liquid jets in their model huh et al 1998 consider the effect of turbulent conditions for diesel sprays in conjunction with the mep model the mep was originally introduced for predicting the droplet size and velocity distribution of diesel spray from a nozzle however in this study the authors apply the mep to model the spray production due to wave interaction with marine objects similarly after the wave impact the water forms a liquid sheet which is the same as the non homogenous inverted hollow cone that exits from a nozzle with one side of the cone attached to the marine structure afterward it breaks up into ligaments that form droplets this new model prediction was compared with the results of droplet and velocity measurements from wave impacts on a lab scaled flat shaped and bow shaped plate models in this experiment the bubble image velocimetry biv method was used to measure droplet size and velocity across a selected plane in the spray moreover these results are compared with full scale data from the field observations of ryerson 1995 the experiment was designed for measuring droplet size and velocity distribution across a plane in front of two models the flat shaped and the bow shaped plate models the biv technique was used to illuminate the spray for further post processing measurements this technique was first introduced by ryu et al 2005 to experimentally analyze the kinematics of plunging breaking waves that impinge and overtop a structure it is based on the principles of particle image velocimetry piv the biv technique was used to measure the velocity fields in the aerated region around the structure a study using biv techniques to measure the flow kinematics inside an aerated area can be found in govender et al 2002 other attempts to measure flow kinematics outside of aerated areas using the biv method are reported by chang and liu 1999 2000 and melville et al 2002 chang and liu 1998 used piv to measure the velocity of the overturning jet of breaking waves the flow characteristics of aerated regions are rarely reported by researchers some applications of the biv method to model green water and sloshing can be found in ryu et al 2007a 2007b chang et al 2011 and song et al 2013 in this paper new mathematical formulations applied to the mep method are described two drag coefficient equations are introduced based on the shape of the water sheet after the wave impact as well as drag coefficient for the droplets in the next section experimental models and methods are described then the results of the predicted model are compared with the results of the experimental data lastly the mep prediction model is applied to a full scale scenario 2 mathematical formulations spray formation from wave impact is the result of a thin sheet of liquid which develops instabilities and breaks up into ligaments and lastly forms droplets the thermodynamic laws for when equilibrium states are transferred from one state to another govern the size distribution and velocity distribution of droplets during this transformation the equations for mass momentum and energy conservation are used as constraints while entropy maximization occurs constraints are developed by assuming that the breakup and spray formation is a practically conservative process the conservation equations downstream of a wave impact area can be presented as the probability density function f which is the probability of finding droplets based on both droplet diameter d or droplet volume v d and droplet velocity v d in this method it is assumed that the droplets formed just downstream of the breakup area have the same total mass momentum kinetic energy and surface energy as the primary water sheet the solution for all constraints contains both of these variables so that d φ d v d d the solution domain d φ consist of both v velocity characteristics and d diameter characteristics according to the probability concept the total summation of probabilities is equal to unity i j f i j 1 by combining all the conservation constraints with the normalization constraints information regarding droplet size and velocity distributions based on the conservation laws can be provided sellens and brzustowski 1985 the following are a normalized set of equations li and tankin 1987 li et al 1991 that can be solved iteratively based on the newton raphson procedure to predict a size and velocity distribution model for spray cloud 1 d m i n d m a x v m i n v m a x f

liquid sheet and spray droplets the drag force on the liquid is calculated as a momentum transformation and is considered as a momentum source by considering that the drag force is acting on a single side of the liquid sheet with a length of l b the other side is attached to the model the drag force f 1 is written as 7 f 1 1 2 ρ a u 0 2 a f c d where c d is the drag coefficient of flow over a flat plate with a contact area of a f white 1991 and is calculated based on the following equation 8 c d 1 328 r e l 10 3 r e l c d 1 328 r e l 2 3 r e l 1 r e l 10 3 the computational domain was divided into two separate domains once droplets form from the ligament breakup 1 the domain containing the liquid sheet and 2 the domain containing droplets eq 7 describes the drag force acting on the water sheet at the first computational domain and eq 9 illustrates the drag force acting on the droplets at the second computational domain 9 f 2 1 2 c d ρ a v d 2 a d where c d is the droplet drag coefficient and is calculated by following equation 10 c d 24 r e r e 0 2 18 5 r e 0 6 0 2 r e 500 0 44 500 r e 10 5 in eq 9 v d is the droplet velocity which because of the highly transient nature of the problem is varied with time and a d is assumed to be the area of a spherical droplet with a constant size in eq 2 the non dimensional momentum source was calculated for the water sheet domain and the droplet domain using the following equations eqs 11 and 12 which represent the amount of momentum transferred from the surrounding air medium to the liquid sheet and to the droplets per unit of time 11 s m u f j 0 f 1 ρ l u 0 2 a c r o s s 1 2 ρ a ρ l c d b c l b b t 12 s m u f j 0 f 2 ρ l u 0 2 a c r o s s 1 2 ρ a ρ l c d d d d 30 where f is the drag force j 0 is the initial momentum flow rate l b is the breakup length and t is the breakup thickness variables b and c are the initial edge of the impact and the distributed edge of the water sheet respectively to solve eqs 1 5 the lagrange multipliers should be calculated first this can be obtained by solving the whole set of equations simultaneously the newton raphson numerical method was used for the initial value guesses for λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 to calculate new values for the lagrange multipliers because of the complexity of this set of equations another constraint for the lagrange multipliers is needed to stabilize the system after each iteration and to ensure that normalization is maintained this constraint is introduced by sellens and brzustowski 1985 as 13 λ 0 ln d m i n d m a x v m i n v m a x exp λ 1 d 3 λ 2 d 3 v λ 3 d 3 v 2 b d 2 d v d d according to theory the velocity distribution for any droplet size is gaussian and the droplet velocity in a spray cannot be negative this leads to a velocity distribution resembling a truncated gaussian distribution number based droplet size distribution can be extracted by integrating eq 5 in intervals from the minimum to maximum velocity range as 14 d n d d 3 2 π d λ 3 1 2 erf a erf b exp λ 0 λ 3 b d 2 λ 1 λ 2 4 λ 3 d 3 where n is the normalized droplet numbers and 15 a v m a x λ 2 4 λ 3 λ 3 d 3 1 2 16 b v m i n λ 2 4 λ 3 λ 3 d 3 1 2 3 experimental model experiments were performed to analyze wave spray production and distribution of droplet size and velocities from the wave impact with an object these experiments were conducted in a wave tank located at the ocean engineering research center at memorial university of newfoundland s faculty of applied science and engineering this tank is 57 4 m in length 4 5 m in width and has a maximum depth of 3 04 m however the water depth is kept at 1 92 m to allow freeboard for waves a tow carriage supported the scaled models in the experimental simulation and was located approximately at the midway point of the tank the first model was a flat shaped plate with a height of h f 1 m and a width of b f 0 7 m and with 0 2 m wide side plates the dimensions of the second model which was shaped like a ship bow were h b 1 m in height b b 0 15 m in width with 0 3 m wide side plates additionally 0 3 m of each model was submerged in the water the qualitative measurements of spray characteristics were acquired using a phantom v 611 high speed camera the camera was placed in two different positions in relation to the test model to obtain a side view through the tank window for lateral and vertical spray and a front view for spray distribution along the width of the model due to restrictions on the camera s field of view the camera was aimed first at the lower position of the sheet formation and secondly at the higher position to observe the spray heights in separate runs of the same experiment adequate lighting was used to obtain sharp and clear images with the camera further the frame rate of camera set at 1000 frame per second fps with the resolution of 1024 768 pixels to capture the high speed droplet velocities the schematic of the experiment for side fields of view is shown in fig 1 and illustrates the two different fields of view fov fov 1 focuses on spray and droplet characteristics fov 2 focuses on the wave impact area and water sheet production from the impact bodaghkhani et al 2018 the recorded results were limited to those experimental breaking waves and wave crest types that were able to produce a spray these wave conditions were determined by trials which systematically varied the wave generator input characteristics bodaghkhani et al 2018 provided further information about the experiment the process of choosing wave characteristics analysis uncertainties and experimental errors in this experiment three different waves with various wave phase velocities were used to investigate the effect of inlet velocity on the size and velocity distributions each wave characteristic was repeated three times spray characteristics from each trial are measured for three continuous splashes a total of nine spray clouds were considered in each spray cloud 20 samples for three droplet sizes classes were picked and measured these 540 samples are considered to measure the droplet sizes and velocities for both models interested reader for information regarding the choice of specific waves and wave behaviors at the moment of impact can refer to bodaghkhani et al 2018 the biv technique was used to illuminate the bubbles in the aerated region around the structure the biv uses diffused backlighting instead of a laser for illumination such as a diffused light emitting diode led this technique generates shadow images from bubbly flow and droplets and uses these as tracers flow or bubble velocity was determined by correlating the texture of the images furthermore the digital particle image velocimetry dpiv technique was used to calculate droplet velocities and droplet sizes and to track droplets detached from aerated regions this method of computationally analyzing digital video images removes both the photographic and optomechanical processing steps inherent in piv and laser speckle velocimetry lsv the dpiv method first introduced by willert and gharib 1991 has been upgraded by various researchers dpiv and biv techniques are restricted and controlled by a limited depth of field dof ray 2002 suggested adjusting camera aperture and the distance from the camera lens to the center of measurement in front of the object the dof is defined as the distance within which objects captured by the camera are well focused and appear to be sharp the camera focal point is considered as a sheet plane and dof is considered as a sheet thickness objects that are located in front and behind of the dof will appear to be hazy without a clear texture error related to the thickness of the dof in the velocity measurements can be estimated as ε d v 2 l which d v is the depth of view and l is the distance between the camera and focal plane thin d v and large l leads to minimize error for velocity measurements detailed discussions about determining the dof can be found in ryu et al 2005 however ryu et al 2005 reported velocity measurements in both sharp and blurred images are independent from dof methodology in this experiment because of the interest in droplet size and velocity measurements and because a front view was used to measure the droplet distribution along the width of an object errors associated with dof were reduced 4 results and discussion the schematic of the control volume for the present study is shown in fig 2 the control volume extends from the time of impact to the breakup region for the first simulation stage and to the spray region for the second simulation stage in this simulation the mass source term is assumed to be zero which indicates that the breakup and spray are isothermal and enter the still air surrounding the control volume as described before two drag forces were considered a drag force acting on the flat sheet in the breakup region and a drag force acting on individual droplets in the spray region the first drag force was estimated based on a flat triangular sheet of water exposed to the environment however the majority of the water sheet and the spray clouds either move vertically close to or attach to the model based on the geometry of the impact region the impact area can be calculated as the area of a trapezium fig 2 for the wave impact with the bow shaped plate model the breakup length is l b 380 m m on average since the width of the model is b b 200 m m the width of the sheet at the final distribution moment the moment from breakup to spray is c b 300 m m this indicates that the water sheet tends to spread about 50 m m from both sides of the model since the width of the flat shaped plate model is b f 1000 m m the breakup height is approximately l f 485 m m and the width of the sheet at the final stage of distribution is c f 1200 m m which indicates that the water sheet spreads about 100 m m from both sides of the model mostly symmetrical it should be noted that the subscript b and f represents bow and flat plate models respectively similar to a flow sheet from a nozzle the boundary layer flow for the flat sheet due to the wave impact is laminar and the reynolds number is within the confines of the critical reynolds number 5 10 5 by using eq 7 or the blasius relationship and the average velocity of the water sheet the drag coefficient of one side of this flat sheet is calculated as c d b 0 0052 for the bow shaped model and as c d f 0 0046 for flat shaped model by applying these values in eq 11 s m u b is estimated as 3 075 10 5 for the bow shaped and s m u f is estimated as 3 057 10 5 for the flat shaped plate model moreover the average drag coefficient for the second region which only contains the spray is calculated for both lab scale models as c d 0 91 by using these values in eq 12 the momentum source term is calculated for both models as s m u 9 42 10 4 furthermore on larger scales such as vessels and offshore structures by considering that the mean wind velocity is equal to 21 6 m s based on the field observation of ryerson 1995 and the wave phase average velocity at the moment of impact is equal to 25 2 m s the average water sheet velocity after the impact reaches 41 2 55 8 m s this calculation is based on the lab experiments reported by ryu et al 2005 2007a b the drag coefficient and momentum source term for the primary region were calculated as c d 0 0004 and s m u 1 10 5 and for the secondary region they were calculated as c d 0 44 and s m u 7 29 10 4 the drag coefficient for the droplet region is much higher compared to the water sheet region which indicates that the drag force is a significant factor in this stage of the process the velocity profile at the impact moment is assumed to be uniform and the sheets are distributed uniformly on the objects which leads to h 1 for the spray experiment in the laboratory it is assumed that there is no mass transfer and the ambient air is fully saturated however for the sake of simplicity this was not considered in the large scale data similarly the energy source term which is the amount of kinetic energy transferred between the liquid sheet and the droplets was considered to be approximately zero but in reality this energy transfer should be taken into account the results of the predicted and measured size and velocity probability distributions for droplets in front of both lab scaled models are shown in figs 3 and 4 these probability distributions are based on the average of all sample data for specific wave phase velocities 2 2 m s as illustrated in this figure the peak of nondimensional droplet diameter for the predicted model is 0 6 lower than the experimental results this discrepancy can be because of errors and uncertainties related to the experiment measurements moreover the diameter and distribution of droplets were measured on a specific plane in front of the models and the presence of droplets in 3 dimensional were not considered in the experiment however the peak of nondimensional velocity for both predicted and experimental results are the same fig 5 shows the predicted size and velocity probability distributions for droplets in front of a large scale model this results are based on the measured field observation values that are reported by ryerson 1995 on a u s coast guard cutter comparison between the results of small scale and large scale models conclude that higher initial velocity of impact leads to shift of curve of distribution around a specific nondimensional droplet diameter and velocity which indicates that in large scale most of droplets tends to have a narrow size range of diameters and velocities also for large scale the droplet size are smaller than the small scale models which shows that the breakup phenomena is significant in this wave impact process and should be considered for the study of spray formation from the wave impact by using the set of governing equations eqs 1 5 and the parameter values described earlier the probability counters of size and velocity of the water sheet for all three models were demonstrated in fig 6 this figure shows that the probability of the presence of droplets is different for each model for flat plate model the peak of velocity distribution is narrower around average velocity and shows most droplets tends to have an average velocity magnitude however for the bow shaped model droplet velocities are more equally distributed for various velocities based on the graph of the large scale model the peak is rather narrower around the average magnitude of droplet velocity which can conclude that droplet behavior is more similar to flat plate model results fig 7 shows the droplet size distribution d n d d for all three models based on eq 14 these graphs illustrate the effect of various initial velocities on the droplet size distribution as the initial velocity of impact increases the distribution curve shifts towards the larger droplets and in consequence leads to larger distributions the peaks of the distribution curves increase when the initial velocity increases this is due to an increase in the value of the weber number which is a result of the creation of surface area the weber number in different trials varied over a range of 30 500 which demonstrates a broad variety of this dimensionless number that is higher than the previously documented critical weber numbers such as bag mechanism 18 we 30 and transition mechanism 30 we 63 cao et al 2007 lee and reitz 2000 han and tryggvason 2001 this range of weber numbers indicates that most of the droplets should experience a breakup however the results of the experiment indicate the opposite because droplets do not have enough travelling time to experience a breakup or the instability growth rate are low furthermore because of the resistance forces of drag and gravity the instability in these droplets reduces and resists break up nevertheless in some cases droplet deformation and breakup were observed in these instances the weber number is very large 400 500 and droplets have enough time to become unstable which leads to a break up this can be explained based on the definition of the weber number the surface energy of the droplets decreases relative to the total energy of the spray droplets this causes the formation of larger droplets for the large scale model the distribution curve shifts towards the smaller range of droplet sizes fig 7c due to a decrease of mass mean diameters and greater values of initial sheet velocities in this case the quantities of droplet sizes in the medium range increased compared to small scale models furthermore fig 7 only considered the effect of the drag force on the water sheet and the results are utilized in the primary part of this simulation in the next step the drag force on droplets is added to the momentum source term and the control volume is extended from the moment of wave impact to the maximum height of the spray cloud which covers water sheet formation water sheet breakup and droplets other important phenomena in the secondary breakup zone such as turbulence collision coalescence and gravity effects are ignored because they would add complications to the governing equations the new momentum source is calculated based on the calculation of the drag force on droplets the summation of these individual drag forces for each droplet leads to the computation of a new momentum source term however this requires the assumption that droplet transition from the primary stage of breakup to the secondary stage of spray formation is a steady process in future research this assumption will no longer be required if a turbulence model is considered the size distribution result for droplets with the added drag force for both regions on the large scale model is shown in fig 8 as this figure shows the distribution of medium size droplets is narrower in comparison with the previous distribution that did not consider the secondary region drag forces moreover the size distribution of medium class droplets is greater than the previous prediction model the effect of the initial velocity of the water sheet is illustrated that higher initial velocity produces larger droplet size distribution however this velocity effect is not very significant 5 conclusion a predictive model for droplet size and velocity distributions within sprays at different stages of a breakup during wave impact has been introduced the mep method is applied to the problem of wave impact with a marine object for both laboratory scale models and full scale models this method is shown to be suitable for applications in which thermodynamic equilibrium accurately predicts droplet size and velocity distribution the discrepancies between this prediction method and the results of the experiment can be attributed to aforementioned assumptions that simplify the predictive model the effects of horizontal velocity gravity force slamming force and turbulence is not currently considered in the predictive model however the results of the experiment and prediction model are in reasonable agreement with each other the results of probability density functions between the predicted and experimental models have approximately 5 difference however results of droplet size prediction have 15 differences which is due to the experimental errors uncertainties and several assumptions that have been made in the governing equations the set of governing equations are iteratively solved using a modified newton raphson method to yield the unknown lagrangian multipliers the governing equations and their derivatives are an integral and exponential form which leads to convergence difficulties in calculating a solution although unique solutions for the equations are available these solutions are highly sensitive to the initial values of lagrange multipliers λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ 4 reasonable initial guesses in this procedure can lead to faster convergence this procedure is applied to both primary regions of a breakup first from the impact moment to the water sheet breakup and second from the moment of impact to the downstream of spray and droplet formation regions two models of drag forces were added to the momentum source term the first model considered only the effect of drag force on the water sheet and the second model was considered for the drag force on the droplets in the second region the effect of the initial sheet velocity on the droplet size distribution was investigated and the results show that an increase in the initial velocities can lead to narrower distribution along specific droplet sizes and an increase in the peaks of distribution in this model concept the effect of the inlet velocity profile horizontal velocity fluid phases properties and the weber number are significant in applying this model to various conditions weber number dependency requires the pre estimation of the mass mean diameter of the spray which indicates that a rough estimate of this value

23487,this study addresses the development of a statistical tool for predicting the distribution of the size and velocity of droplets in spray caused by the interaction of waves with a marine object the maximum entropy principle mep is a statistical tool that allows the prediction of a probability distribution that is consistent with information from the input system the prediction satisfies constraint equations covering the conservation of mass momentum and energy the velocity distribution of droplets is gaussian in shape the effect of a drag force on both the liquid sheet that is formed from the wave impact as well as the downstream distribution of droplets was considered in this simulation the examination of the mechanisms of turbulence diffusion in a wave at the moment of impact with an object provides a logical analytical relationship between the wave flows and a spray cloud formation after impact the model prediction is compared with the experimental data of spray cloud formation due to wave impact from a lab scale model and is found to be in good agreement the prediction model is then applied to the full scale model based on the data from previous field observations to predict the droplet size and velocity distributions of spray cloud due to the wave interactions with the vessel keywords maximum entropy method droplet size distribution spray formation wave impact 1 introduction wave spray events are recognized as a dangerous occurrence for marine vessels and offshore structures spray events are characterized by dispersed masses of liquid that move to the vessel deck after a wave impact wave spray combined with cold air temperature cause significant icing conditions on these structures which can affect stability structural integrity and increase safety risks and operation hazards on board roebber and mitten 1987 ryerson 2013 bodaghkhani et al 2016 dehghani sanij et al 2015 the simulation of wave spray is a complex procedure which consists of simulating several free surface related events such as breaking waves water sheet breakup and spray formation these phenomena are currently among the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics hendrickson et al 2003 dehghani sanij et al 2018 in the framework of large ships and structures the amount of water delivery droplet size velocity distributions and height of the spray are major concerns bodaghkhani et al 2017 although wave spray is the major cause of icing on vessels the physical nature of wave impact and spray formation are still poorly understood besides a few observational studies which provide a qualitative understanding of the water delivery and spray heights little research on this subject is available in the literature dehghani sanij et al 2017a 2017b modeling the distribution of droplet size and velocity is essential in the study of spray cloud formation and these distributions are crucial parameters for the fundamental analysis of droplet trajectories upside of the bow of a vessel dehghani et al 2016a dehghani and naterer 2016b typical analytical models for predicting the size and velocity of droplets are extracted from experimental data and measurements for small scale events such as spray formation from a nozzle examples of these distributions are the rosin rammler distribution rosin and rammler 1933 and the nukiyama tanasawa distribution nukiyama and tanasawa 1939 the interested reader can refer to a review paper by babinski and sojka 2002 for broad spray distribution models more recent studies use statistical approaches to predict more general droplet sizes and velocity distributions the mep method has become popular for the prediction of droplet sizes and velocity distributions because it produces reasonably accurate results sellens and brzustowski 1985 1986 and li and tankin 1987 1988 were the first to introduce this method since the theory of this method has been well described by these researchers the background materials are not covered in this article the method assumes that while the system entropy is maximized and conservation equations mass momentum and energy are satisfied the equation for size distribution will be equally satisfied the mep method has been upgraded for different conditions and the effects of several phenomena were added over the past two decades kim et al 2003 used the mep and instability analysis of liquid sheets to consider the effect of the instability of liquid jets in their model huh et al 1998 consider the effect of turbulent conditions for diesel sprays in conjunction with the mep model the mep was originally introduced for predicting the droplet size and velocity distribution of diesel spray from a nozzle however in this study the authors apply the mep to model the spray production due to wave interaction with marine objects similarly after the wave impact the water forms a liquid sheet which is the same as the non homogenous inverted hollow cone that exits from a nozzle with one side of the cone attached to the marine structure afterward it breaks up into ligaments that form droplets this new model prediction was compared with the results of droplet and velocity measurements from wave impacts on a lab scaled flat shaped and bow shaped plate models in this experiment the bubble image velocimetry biv method was used to measure droplet size and velocity across a selected plane in the spray moreover these results are compared with full scale data from the field observations of ryerson 1995 the experiment was designed for measuring droplet size and velocity distribution across a plane in front of two models the flat shaped and the bow shaped plate models the biv technique was used to illuminate the spray for further post processing measurements this technique was first introduced by ryu et al 2005 to experimentally analyze the kinematics of plunging breaking waves that impinge and overtop a structure it is based on the principles of particle image velocimetry piv the biv technique was used to measure the velocity fields in the aerated region around the structure a study using biv techniques to measure the flow kinematics inside an aerated area can be found in govender et al 2002 other attempts to measure flow kinematics outside of aerated areas using the biv method are reported by chang and liu 1999 2000 and melville et al 2002 chang and liu 1998 used piv to measure the velocity of the overturning jet of breaking waves the flow characteristics of aerated regions are rarely reported by researchers some applications of the biv method to model green water and sloshing can be found in ryu et al 2007a 2007b chang et al 2011 and song et al 2013 in this paper new mathematical formulations applied to the mep method are described two drag coefficient equations are introduced based on the shape of the water sheet after the wave impact as well as drag coefficient for the droplets in the next section experimental models and methods are described then the results of the predicted model are compared with the results of the experimental data lastly the mep prediction model is applied to a full scale scenario 2 mathematical formulations spray formation from wave impact is the result of a thin sheet of liquid which develops instabilities and breaks up into ligaments and lastly forms droplets the thermodynamic laws for when equilibrium states are transferred from one state to another govern the size distribution and velocity distribution of droplets during this transformation the equations for mass momentum and energy conservation are used as constraints while entropy maximization occurs constraints are developed by assuming that the breakup and spray formation is a practically conservative process the conservation equations downstream of a wave impact area can be presented as the probability density function f which is the probability of finding droplets based on both droplet diameter d or droplet volume v d and droplet velocity v d in this method it is assumed that the droplets formed just downstream of the breakup area have the same total mass momentum kinetic energy and surface energy as the primary water sheet the solution for all constraints contains both of these variables so that d φ d v d d the solution domain d φ consist of both v velocity characteristics and d diameter characteristics according to the probability concept the total summation of probabilities is equal to unity i j f i j 1 by combining all the conservation constraints with the normalization constraints information regarding droplet size and velocity distributions based on the conservation laws can be provided sellens and brzustowski 1985 the following are a normalized set of equations li and tankin 1987 li et al 1991 that can be solved iteratively based on the newton raphson procedure to predict a size and velocity distribution model for spray cloud 1 d m i n d m a x v m i n v m a x f

equal to 1 for the uniform velocity profile in these equations the solution domain changes from d m i n to d m a x for droplet size variations and from v m i n to v m a x for droplet velocity variations these variables are set as 0 to 1500 μ m for droplet sizes and 0 to 8 m s for droplet velocities according to li and tankin 1987 the dimensionless terms in this set of equations were introduced as d i d i d 30 v j v j u 0 where u 0 is the average initial velocity of the water sheet at the moment of impact with the wall and d 30 is the mass mean diameter of droplets and was calculated based on the experimental results using the following equation 6 d 30 m i d i m n i d i 4 n i d i 3 in eq 5 f is the pdf for representing the continuous size and velocity distribution in an integral form in eq 1 the non dimensional mass source term s m was neglected because the effect of evaporation and condensation was not considered the drag force was considered to be acting on the liquid sheet and spray droplets the drag force on the liquid is calculated as a momentum transformation and is considered as a momentum source by considering that the drag force is acting on a single side of the liquid sheet with a length of l b the other side is attached to the model the drag force f 1 is written as 7 f 1 1 2 ρ a u 0 2 a f c d where c d is the drag coefficient of flow over a flat plate with a contact area of a f white 1991 and is calculated based on the following equation 8 c d 1 328 r e l 10 3 r e l c d 1 328 r e l 2 3 r e l 1 r e l 10 3 the computational domain was divided into two separate domains once droplets form from the ligament breakup 1 the domain containing the liquid sheet and 2 the domain containing droplets eq 7 describes the drag force acting on the water sheet at the first computational domain and eq 9 illustrates the drag force acting on the droplets at the second computational domain 9 f 2 1 2 c d ρ a v d 2 a d where c d is the droplet drag coefficient and is calculated by following equation 10 c d 24 r e r e 0 2 18 5 r e 0 6 0 2 r e 500 0 44 500 r e 10 5 in eq 9 v d is the droplet velocity which because of the highly transient nature of the problem is varied with time and a d is assumed to be the area of a spherical droplet with a constant size in eq 2 the non dimensional momentum source was calculated for the water sheet domain and the droplet domain using the following equations eqs 11 and 12 which represent the amount of momentum transferred from the surrounding air medium to the liquid sheet and to the droplets per unit of time 11 s m u f j 0 f 1 ρ l u 0 2 a c r o s s 1 2 ρ a ρ l c d b c l b b t 12 s m u f j 0 f 2 ρ l u 0 2 a c r o s s 1 2 ρ a ρ l c d d d d 30 where f is the drag force j 0 is the initial momentum flow rate l b is the breakup length and t is the breakup thickness variables b and c are the initial edge of the impact and the distributed edge of the water sheet respectively to solve eqs 1 5 the lagrange multipliers should be calculated first this can be obtained by solving the whole set of equations simultaneously the newton raphson numerical method was used for the initial value guesses for λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 to calculate new values for the lagrange multipliers because of the complexity of this set of equations another constraint for the lagrange multipliers is needed to stabilize the system after each iteration and to ensure that normalization is maintained this constraint is introduced by sellens and brzustowski 1985 as 13 λ 0 ln d m i n d m a x v m i n v m a x exp λ 1 d 3 λ 2 d 3 v λ 3 d 3 v 2 b d 2 d v d d according to theory the velocity distribution for any droplet size is gaussian and the droplet velocity in a spray cannot be negative this leads to a velocity

model experiments were performed to analyze wave spray production and distribution of droplet size and velocities from the wave impact with an object these experiments were conducted in a wave tank located at the ocean engineering research center at memorial university of newfoundland s faculty of applied science and engineering this tank is 57 4 m in length 4 5 m in width and has a maximum depth of 3 04 m however the water depth is kept at 1 92 m to allow freeboard for waves a tow carriage supported the scaled models in the experimental simulation and was located approximately at the midway point of the tank the first model was a flat shaped plate with a height of h f 1 m and a width of b f 0 7 m and with 0 2 m wide side plates the dimensions of the second model which was shaped like a ship bow were h b 1 m in height b b 0 15 m in width with 0 3 m wide side plates additionally 0 3 m of each model was submerged in the water the qualitative measurements of spray characteristics were acquired using a phantom v 611 high speed camera the camera was placed in two different positions in relation to the test model to obtain a side view through the tank window for lateral and vertical spray and a front view for spray distribution along the width of the model due to restrictions on the camera s field of view the camera was aimed first at the lower position of the sheet formation and secondly at the higher position to observe the spray heights in separate runs of the same experiment adequate lighting was used to obtain sharp and clear images with the camera further the frame rate of camera set at 1000 frame per second fps with the resolution of 1024 768 pixels to capture the high speed droplet velocities the schematic of the experiment for side fields of view is shown in fig 1 and illustrates the two different fields of view fov fov 1 focuses on spray and droplet characteristics fov 2 focuses on the wave impact area and water sheet production from the impact bodaghkhani et al 2018 the recorded results were limited to those experimental breaking waves and wave crest types that were able to produce a spray these wave conditions were determined by trials which systematically varied the wave generator input characteristics bodaghkhani et al 2018 provided further information about the experiment the process of choosing wave characteristics analysis uncertainties and experimental errors in this experiment three different waves with various wave phase velocities were used to investigate the effect of inlet velocity on the size and velocity distributions each wave characteristic was repeated three times spray characteristics from each trial are measured for three continuous splashes a total of nine spray clouds were considered in each spray cloud 20 samples for three droplet sizes classes were picked and measured these 540 samples are considered to measure the droplet sizes and velocities for both models interested reader for information regarding the choice of specific waves and wave behaviors at the moment of impact can refer to bodaghkhani et al 2018 the biv technique was used to illuminate the bubbles in the aerated region around the structure the biv uses diffused backlighting instead of a laser for illumination such as a diffused light emitting diode led this technique generates shadow images from bubbly flow and droplets and uses these as tracers flow or bubble velocity was determined by correlating the texture of the images furthermore the digital particle image velocimetry dpiv technique was used to calculate droplet velocities and droplet sizes and to track droplets detached from aerated regions this method of computationally analyzing digital video images removes both the photographic and optomechanical processing steps inherent in piv and laser speckle velocimetry lsv the dpiv method first introduced by willert and gharib 1991 has been upgraded by various researchers dpiv and biv techniques are restricted and controlled by a limited depth of field dof ray 2002 suggested adjusting camera aperture and the distance from the camera lens to the center of measurement in front of the object the dof is defined as the distance within which objects captured by the camera are well focused and appear to be sharp the camera focal point is considered as a sheet plane and dof is considered as a sheet thickness objects that are located in front and behind of the dof will appear to be hazy without a clear texture error related to the thickness of the dof in the velocity measurements can be estimated as ε d v 2 l which d v is the depth of view and l is the distance between the camera and focal plane thin d v and large l leads to minimize error for velocity measurements detailed discussions about determining the dof can be found in ryu et al 2005 however ryu et al 2005 reported velocity measurements in both sharp and blurred images are independent from dof methodology in this experiment because of the interest in droplet size and velocity measurements and because a front view was used to measure the droplet distribution along the width of an object errors associated with dof were reduced 4 results and discussion the schematic of the control volume for the present study is shown in fig 2 the control volume extends from the time of impact to the breakup region for the first simulation stage and to the spray region for the second simulation stage in this simulation the mass source term is assumed to be zero which indicates that the breakup and spray are isothermal and enter the still air surrounding the control volume as described before two drag forces were considered a drag force acting on the flat sheet in the breakup region and a drag force acting on individual droplets in the spray region the first drag force was estimated based on a flat triangular sheet of water exposed to the environment however the majority of the water sheet and the spray clouds either move vertically close to or attach to the model based on the geometry of the impact region the impact area can be calculated as the area of a trapezium fig 2 for the wave impact with the bow shaped plate model the breakup length is l b 380 m m on average since the width of the model is b b 200 m m the width of the sheet at the final distribution moment the moment from breakup to spray is c b 300 m m this indicates that the water sheet tends to spread about 50 m m from both sides of the model since the width of the flat shaped plate model is b f 1000 m m the breakup height is approximately l f 485 m m and the width of the sheet at the final stage of distribution is c f 1200 m m which indicates that the water sheet spreads about 100 m m from both sides of the model mostly symmetrical it should be noted that the subscript b and f represents bow and flat plate models respectively similar to a flow sheet from a nozzle the boundary layer flow for the flat sheet due to the wave impact is laminar and the reynolds number is within the confines of the critical reynolds number 5 10 5 by using eq 7 or the blasius relationship and the average velocity of the water sheet the drag coefficient of one side of this flat sheet is calculated as c d b 0 0052 for the bow shaped model and as c d f 0 0046 for flat shaped model by applying these values in eq 11 s m u b is estimated as 3 075 10 5 for the bow shaped and s m u f is estimated as 3 057 10 5 for the flat shaped plate model moreover the average drag coefficient for the second region which only contains the spray is calculated for both lab scale models as c d 0 91 by using these values in eq 12 the momentum source term is calculated for both models as s m u 9 42 10 4 furthermore on larger scales such as vessels and offshore structures by considering that the mean wind velocity is equal to 21 6 m s based on the field observation of ryerson 1995 and the wave phase average velocity at the moment of impact is equal to 25 2 m s the average water sheet velocity after the impact reaches 41 2 55 8 m s this calculation is based on the lab experiments reported by ryu et al 2005 2007a b the drag coefficient and momentum source term for the primary region were calculated as c d 0 0004 and s m u 1 10 5 and for the secondary region they were calculated as c d 0 44 and s m u 7 29 10 4 the drag coefficient for the droplet region is much higher compared to the water sheet region which indicates that the drag force is a significant factor in this stage of the process the velocity profile at the impact moment is assumed to be uniform and the sheets are distributed uniformly on the objects which leads to h 1 for the spray experiment in the laboratory it is assumed that there is no mass transfer and the ambient air is fully saturated however for the sake of simplicity this was not considered in the large scale data similarly the energy source term which is the amount of kinetic energy transferred between the liquid sheet and the droplets was considered to be approximately zero but in reality this energy transfer should be taken into account the results of the predicted and measured size and velocity probability distributions for droplets in front of both lab scaled models are shown in figs 3 and 4 these probability distributions are based on the average of all sample data for specific wave phase velocities 2 2 m s as illustrated in this figure the peak of nondimensional droplet diameter for the predicted model is 0 6 lower than the experimental results this discrepancy can be because of errors and uncertainties related to the experiment measurements moreover the diameter and distribution of droplets were measured on a specific plane in front of the models and the presence of droplets in 3 dimensional were not considered in the experiment however the peak of nondimensional velocity for both predicted and experimental results are the same fig 5 shows the predicted size and velocity probability distributions for droplets in front of a large scale model this results are based on the measured field observation values that are reported by ryerson 1995 on a u s coast guard cutter comparison between the results of small scale and large scale models conclude that higher initial velocity of impact leads to shift of curve of distribution around a specific nondimensional droplet diameter and velocity which indicates that in large scale most of droplets tends to have a narrow size range of diameters and velocities also for large scale the droplet size are smaller than the small scale models which shows that the breakup phenomena is significant in this wave impact process and should be considered for the study of spray formation from the wave impact by using the set of governing equations eqs 1 5 and the parameter values described earlier the probability counters of size and velocity of the water sheet for all three models were demonstrated in fig 6 this figure shows that the probability of the presence of droplets is different for each model for flat plate model the peak of velocity distribution is narrower around average velocity and shows most droplets tends to have an average velocity magnitude however for the bow shaped model droplet velocities are more equally distributed for various velocities based on the graph of the large scale model the peak is rather narrower around the average magnitude of droplet velocity which can conclude that droplet behavior is more similar to flat plate model results fig 7 shows the droplet size distribution d n d d for all three models based on eq 14 these graphs illustrate the effect of various initial velocities on the droplet size distribution as the initial velocity of impact increases the distribution curve shifts towards the larger droplets and in consequence leads to larger distributions the peaks of the distribution curves increase when the initial velocity increases this is due to an increase in the value of the weber number which is a result of the creation of surface area the weber number in different trials varied over a range of 30 500 which demonstrates a broad variety of this dimensionless number that is higher than the previously documented critical weber numbers such as bag mechanism 18 we 30 and transition mechanism 30 we 63 cao et al 2007 lee and reitz 2000 han and tryggvason 2001 this range of weber numbers indicates that most of the droplets should experience a breakup however the results of the experiment indicate the opposite because droplets do not have enough travelling time to experience a breakup or the instability growth rate are low furthermore because of the resistance forces of drag and gravity the instability in these droplets reduces and resists break up nevertheless in some cases droplet deformation and breakup were observed in these instances the weber number is very large 400 500 and droplets have enough time to become unstable which leads to a break up this can be explained based on the definition of the weber number the surface energy of the droplets decreases relative to the total energy of the spray droplets this causes the formation of larger droplets for the large scale model the distribution curve shifts towards the smaller range of droplet sizes fig 7c due to a decrease of mass mean diameters and greater values of initial sheet velocities in this case the quantities of droplet sizes in the medium range increased compared to small scale models furthermore fig 7 only considered the effect of the drag force on the water sheet and the results are utilized in the primary part of this simulation in the next step the drag force on droplets is added to the momentum source term and the control volume is extended from the moment of wave impact to the maximum height of the spray cloud which covers water sheet formation water sheet breakup and droplets other important phenomena in the secondary breakup zone such as turbulence collision coalescence and gravity effects are ignored because they would add complications to the governing equations the new momentum source is calculated based on the calculation of the drag force on droplets the summation of these individual drag forces for each droplet leads to the computation of a new momentum source term however this requires the assumption that droplet transition from the primary stage of breakup to the secondary stage of spray formation is a steady process in future research this assumption will no longer be required if a turbulence model is considered the size distribution result for droplets with the added drag force for both regions on the large scale model is shown in fig 8 as this figure shows the distribution of medium size droplets is narrower in comparison with the previous distribution that did not consider the secondary region drag forces moreover the size distribution of medium class droplets is greater than the previous prediction model the effect of the initial velocity of the water sheet is illustrated that higher initial velocity produces larger droplet size distribution however this velocity effect is not very significant 5 conclusion a predictive model for droplet size and velocity distributions within sprays at different stages of a breakup during wave impact has been introduced the mep method is applied to the problem of wave impact with a marine object for both laboratory scale models and full scale models this method is shown to be suitable for applications in which thermodynamic equilibrium accurately predicts droplet size and velocity distribution the discrepancies between this prediction method and the results of the experiment can be attributed to aforementioned assumptions that simplify the predictive model the effects of horizontal velocity gravity force slamming force and turbulence is not currently considered in the predictive model however the results of the experiment and prediction model are in reasonable agreement with each other the results of probability density functions between the predicted and experimental models have approximately 5 difference however results of droplet size prediction have 15 differences which is due to the experimental errors uncertainties and several assumptions that have been made in the governing equations the set of governing equations are iteratively solved using a modified newton raphson method to yield the unknown lagrangian multipliers the governing equations and their derivatives are an integral and exponential form which leads to convergence difficulties in calculating a solution although unique solutions for the equations are available these solutions are highly sensitive to the initial values of lagrange multipliers λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ 4 reasonable initial guesses in this procedure can lead to faster convergence this procedure is applied to both primary regions of a breakup first from the impact moment to the water sheet breakup and second from the moment of impact to the downstream of spray and droplet formation regions two models of drag forces were added to the momentum source term the first model considered only the effect of drag force on the water sheet and the second model was considered for the drag force on the droplets in the second region the effect of the initial sheet velocity on the droplet size distribution was investigated and the results show that an increase in the initial velocities can lead to narrower distribution along specific droplet sizes and an increase in the peaks of distribution in this model concept the effect of the inlet velocity profile horizontal velocity fluid phases properties and the weber number are significant in applying this model to various conditions weber number dependency requires the pre estimation of the mass mean diameter of the spray which indicates that a rough estimate of this value

23488,estimation of iceberg impact load is an important design consideration for offshore structures in ice prone regions impact velocity is influenced by the complex hydrodynamic interaction between the iceberg or bergy bit and the offshore structure in order to understand the phenomenon a two phase experimental and numerical study has been conducted in the first phase the change in wave loads on different sized spherical model ice masses was investigated for different proximities to a fixed structure and the results published in sayeed et al 2017b this paper describes the results of the second phase study where the change in wave induced motions of free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure is investigated through physical experiments and numerical simulations the experiments were carried out at the ocean engineering research center oerc of memorial university of newfoundland and the motions were measured using an optical tracking system qualysis the objective is to determine the velocity profiles of approaching ice masses and how that changes prior to impact the experimental results of motion data show excellent correlation with the force data gathered in the first phase similar to previous studies the separation distance to wavelength ratio is shown to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased some experiments have also been conducted to understand the effect of initial starting location on the resulting drift velocity numerical simulations of the experimental cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d show good agreement with the experimental data keywords iceberg bergy bit wave induced motion hydrodynamic interaction offshore structure wave body interaction 1 introduction wave driven small icebergs bergy bits and growlers can become significant hazards for offshore structures operating in ice prone regions estimation of iceberg impact load is an important design consideration for offshore structures in ice infested waters fixed structures are designed to withstand large iceberg impacts whereas floating structures can avoid interaction with large bergs by moving off location a significant number of ship ice collisions continue to be reported because small ice masses are harder to detect in bad weather at night or in heavy seas moreover the hazard is increased by their short impact duration implied by higher impact velocity for small ice pieces lever et al 1988b the impact load from wave driven iceberg and bergy bits with an offshore structure largely depends on the final velocity prior to impact the close proximity hydrodynamic interaction between the approaching iceberg and the offshore structure plays an important role in governing the impact velocity for relatively wave transparent structures like semi submersibles iceberg impact velocities predicted based on open water test data are reported to be reasonable lever et al 1988b 1990b but for less transparent fixed or floating offshore structures such as gravity base structures or large ship shaped fpsos the proximity effect can be significant mak et al 1990 lever et al 1990b impact velocity also changes the failure mode of ice ductile transition or brittle thus changing the effective pressure generally iceberg structure collisions are anticipated to occur at velocities that place the ice in the brittle failure region but lower impact velocities might cause the ice to fail in the ductile or transition regions cammaert et al 1983 johnson and benoit 1987 sodhi and haehnel 2003 ignoring these effects may result in an overestimation in impact load which will ultimately affect the design and cost of the structure there is evidence that the near field hydrodynamic influences do affect impact velocity and trajectory it has been reported that if the ice mass diameter is less than half of the structure diameter the ice mass will not hit the structure because of negative wave drift forces salvalggio and rojansky 1986 isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b even in cases where impacts do occur the impact velocity can be substantially reduced and several phenomenon like fluid cushioning shadowing negative wave drift force change in added mass hydrodynamic damping eccentric impact etc have been reported because of reflected and standing waves bolen 1987 colbourne et al 1998 colbourne 2000 gagnon 2004 a series of experiments conducted by attwood 1987 and lever et al 1988a 1988b revealed that small icebergs showed fluid particle type behavior for wave length iceberg size ratios greater than 13 lever et al 1990a extended their impact velocity probability statistics to include randomly varying iceberg shape the inclusion of iceberg shape showed important variations on significant velocity exceedance levels which in turn resulted in higher total surge velocities including drift for almost all cases mak et al 1990 conducted model tests of wave driven bergy bits impacting with a floating oil production platform in regular and irregular waves open water significant velocities were found to be 10 40 higher than significant impact velocities mctaggart 1989 and isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990c investigated the hydrodynamic forces during iceberg drift in proximity with an offshore structure through model tests and numerical analysis for the waves only condition no impact occurred when the ratio of iceberg diameter and structure diameter is less than or equal to 0 2 whereas salvalggio and rojansky 1986 in their experiments found the ratio to be 0 5 it was reported that the presence of the structure can result in 10 or more velocity reduction for smaller icebergs iceberg structure diameter ratio less than 0 2 approaching the structure colbourne et al 1998 conducted physical model tests of the terra nova fpso in collision with an iceberg 100 000t and a bergy bit 3 600t at different headings and driving environments wave action on the smaller bergy bit resulted in confused collision trends due to the radiated waves in very near field region colbourne 2000 indicated that for small ice pieces increasing input wave energy did not lead to increasing impact energy and postulated that the effect may be due to reflection of waves where the reflected wave energy negated the increased berg energy gagnon 2004 investigated the hydrodynamic interaction between a floating ice mass and a tanker passing at speed using physical model tests this study indicated that the radiation proximity effect can be significant but this work did not directly consider collisions an increase in maximum sway motion of the ice mass was also observed due to the presence of the tanker as a temporary wall boundary thus influencing the wave induced hydrodynamic forces on the ice mass mcgovern and bai 2014a conducted an experiment on isolated ice floes of different sizes and shapes and investigated their surge and heave motions in regular waves the motions observed for ice floes were found to be different than those of icebergs at wavelength to characteristic length ratio of 3 3 5 the floe behaved like a fluid particle mcgovern and bai 2014b also investigated the presence of a circular cylinder on the kinematics of ice floes in regular and irregular waves at separation distance to cylinder diameter ratio less than 10 increase in heave response and significant reduction in surge response was observed the mean drift velocities also showed low and negative values as the ice floe approached head on towards the cylinder sayeed et al 2017b conducted a set of experiments to measure the wave loads on different sized spherical ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure a six component dynamometer was used to measure the wave forces in six different regular head waves the objective was to investigate changes in wave loads at different separation distances from the structure the experimental results show that the distance to wavelength ratio dictates the corresponding wave loads in horizontal and vertical directions the mean drift force in the horizontal direction becomes negative against the direction of wave propagation for most of the cases when the body is close to the structure also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the non dimensional rms forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the non dimensional rms forces in the vertical direction increase most of the numerical models found in the literature to study iceberg interaction with offshore structures utilize potential flow code which assumes inviscid and irrotational flow isaacson and stritto 1986 used a diffraction theory model with oscillatory and drift motions to investigate the two body interaction problem cheung 1987 and isaacson and cheung 1988a 1988b observed an increase in added mass as separation distance decreased based on predictions utilizing their potential flow code lever and sen 1987 highlighted the importance of wave induced iceberg motion in risk analyses of iceberg collisions the authors utilized linear potential flow theory developed by sen 1983 to compute wave induced surge and heave motions of five different size cubic icebergs lever et al 1988a and attwood 1987 conducted wave tank experiments of wave induced iceberg motions to validate results from linear potential theory mctaggart 1989 investigated various hydrodynamic aspects such as added mass wave induced oscillatory motion and modification of iceberg motion due to the presence of a structure during iceberg impact using a potential flow numerical model isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b presented summary results of experiments carried out to investigate iceberg drift in proximity with offshore structures the experimental results are compared with a numerical model based on potential flow theory for the current only cases agreement was reasonable for velocity ratios but the numerical model under predicted impact eccentricities for the cases with waves only the numerical results followed the experimental trend except for one condition for combined wave current with larger waves the numerical results significantly under predicted in general poor agreement resulted especially from the prediction of negative wave drift force in the vicinity of the structure chernetsov et al 2008 proposed two types of spar substructure spar classic and spar ring equipped with mooring systems that can resist ice floe and iceberg impact diffraction theory used in dynamic simulation showed considerable reduction in iceberg approach velocity before contact and impact force was further reduced because of hydrodynamic interaction during contact tsarau et al 2014 presented a numerical model combining discrete element and boundary element methods to predict potential flow with actual movements of bodies in multi body dynamics some model tests were conducted in calm water where a submerged sphere ice mass was fixed and a cylinder structure was towed past the sphere at different speeds and separation distances the hydrodynamic forces varied between positive and negative depending on the separation distance the numerical model predicted qualitative results for large separation distance accurate estimates for moderate distance and overestimates for very small 0 01 m separation distance numerical studies using ls dyna and its ale formulation show good validation results for the hydrodynamic behavior of floating bergy bits during a collision lee et al 2010 investigated the effects of the geometry of the iceberg striking face and the water layer entrapped between an iceberg and a lngc during the collision process lee and nguyen 2011 simulated bow shoulder and side collision responses between a lngc and a cubic iceberg considering wave making of the lngc and relative drift velocity taking the hydrodynamic water pressure into account gagnon and wang 2012 performed numerical simulations of a tanker collision with a bergy bit including hydrodynamics calm water a crushable foam ice model and a collision model sustaining deformation and damage all of these simulations were conducted in calm water wave driven iceberg and bergy bit interaction and impact with a structure is far more complicated tsarau et al 2015 some potential alternative numerical methods to model iceberg structure hydrodynamic interaction are presented by sayeed et al 2017a su et al 2016 used a time domain potential flow model to simulate the kinematics of an ice floe in the presence of a circular cylinder and compared the results with mcgovern and bai 2014b the added mass and damping forces are calculated using the commercial potential flow code wamit and diffraction forces are approximated assuming a small body in waves the simulation results agreed quite well with experiments except in the near cylinder region prior to impact the significant reductions in surge velocity due to close proximity hydrodynamic interaction were not captured by the numerical model only a couple of cases of rans based cfd codes used for studying iceberg drift are found in the literature sayeed et al 2017b compared some of the experimental test cases with rans based cfd code flow3d the results show reasonable comparison demonstrating that the proximity and non linear effect can be captured by viscous flow cfd models bai et al 2017 compared the experimental results of mcgovern and bai 2014a with linear potential flow model hydrostar and viscous flow cfd model openfoam the comparison showed that the surge and heave raos are overestimated by linear flow model whereas the cfd results showed reasonably accurate comparison with experimental data sayeed et al 2017a conducted a review to identify the significance of hydrodynamic interaction of ice masses in close proximity with arctic offshore structures just prior to impact and also to identify related research gaps in this area a number of studies investigated the motions of free floating ice masses in open water or near a fixed floating structure salvalggio and rojansky 1986 attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a 1990a 1990b mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b 1990c colbourne et al 1998 mcgovern and bai 2014a 2014b various complex phenomena have been reported due to the near field hydrodynamic interaction between the ice mass and the structure design codes currently do not have specific guidelines for hydrodynamic effects in close vicinity to structure although they do mention that such effects should be considered for example iso 19906 states hydrodynamic effects associated with ice feature motions in the vicinity of the structure can be considerable especially in conditions where the ice concentration is low and relatively small ice features are impacting wide structures due to hydrodynamic effects smaller ice features can slow down as they approach and tend to move around the structure consideration should be given to added mass of the impacting ice feature with due account for the presence of the seabed and the structure when the structure moves sufficiently during the course of the interaction its added mass should also be considered thus it is evident that the prediction of ice impact forces could be substantially improved through a better understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic properties in the very near field interaction phase the present study is a continuation of previous work by sayeed et al 2017b this phase of the investigation was conducted to determine if the motions measured in proximity to the fixed structure will correlate with the forces measured in the previous experiment sayeed et al 2017b also the high and low frequency wave induced motions will reveal the velocity profiles of approaching ice masses and how that changes prior to impact similar to previous studies complimentary numerical simulations are conducted for selected test cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 in the present study a fixed structure of diameter d s 0 5 m was used which remains stationary in the incoming wave field a wave regime of λ d s 3 6 was chosen where diffraction effects particularly reflected wave energy is important three spherical and one cylindrical models of size d i d s 0 3 0 6 were used to represent floating ice masses moving towards the fixed structure 2 experimental program the current set of experiments involved the measurement of the motions of the free floating ice masses with and without the presence of the fixed structure the objective of these experiments is to identify the change in velocity profiles due to the presence of the structure this should also help to identify the potential velocity just prior to impact 2 1 facility the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the ocean engineering research center oerc at memorial university of newfoundland mun in st john s nl canada the towing tank is 58 m long and 4 5 m wide with maximum still water depth of 2 2 m the tank is equipped with a hydraulically actuated wave board on one side and a wave absorbing beach on the other side 2 2 models and instrumentation a hexagonal aluminium cylinder of 0 5 m diameter was used as the fixed offshore structure the scale ratio is nominally 1 50 thus the full scale structure diameter is 25 m three spheres with diameters of 0 152 m 0 203 m and 0 305 m were used to represent different size ice masses the ratios of ice mass diameters to the fixed structure diameter are 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 respectively in addition a cylindrical model of the same diameter as the medium sphere and 0 098 m high height to diameter ratio of 0 5 was tested to investigate possible shape effect the centre of gravity for each model was experimentally measured and theoretically calculated table 1 shows the vertical center of gravity for each model from the top of the model being considered to measure the motions a qualisys optical tracking system was used qualisys is an optical tracking system that utilizes infrared cameras to track target markers and measure the 6 degrees of freedom motions of the model three infrared cameras were mounted and calibrated to cover the desired field of view three capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected waves one wave probe was placed far upstream to measure the incoming wave profile and two probes were used on two sides in front of the structure so that the models do not touch the probes during the experiment before conducting experiments both the qualisys cameras and the required waves were calibrated fig 1 shows the layout of the experimental set up in the towing tank with dimensions and coordinate system the distances are considered positive in the direction of wave propagation in x direction and positive upward in z direction in addition videos were recorded during experiments and digital still photographs were taken 2 3 environment the towing tank water depth was 1 8 m six regular waves with two different wave steepness were selected with wave lengths as multiples of the fixed structure diameter and also to cover full scale wave periods of 7 10 s the stroke limitation of the wave generator did not allow for waves with frequency greater than 1 hz to be created the wave particulars are given in table 2 2 4 methodology the fixed structure model was placed in the tank and filled with water ballast the structure was also clamped against a fixed cross tank platform to avoid any movement the spheres are ballasted with paraffin wax to float with the nominal draft of the iceberg the sphere motions are restrained to the vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and a light weight carbon fibre rod on top of the sphere moreover the spheres were further ballasted by inserting a rod at the bottom of the spheres with small weights at the end to reduce pitch motions and better extract heave and surge motions the optical tracking system qualysis was used to track the motions in six degrees of freedom four light weight reflective marker balls were installed on the rod attached to the sphere the marker balls were arranged in such a manner that there is no shadowing of multiple markers when the model rotates and the markers can be seen distinctively by the cameras fig 2 shows the experimental set up including the fixed structure the medium sphere with qualisys markers arranged on top and the wave probes for reflected waves the sphere model was held at the release distance from the structure and then was let go after few seconds the release distances were 2 m for the cylinder medium and large spheres and 1 6 m for the small sphere since this sphere takes a longer time to travel than the other two spheres the large sphere was also tested at different release distances of 2 5 m 2 m 1 6 m 1 m and 0 6 m to investigate the effect of different starting location on the corresponding kinematics of the sphere each test duration was about 2 min to avoid possible contamination of the incident wave field due to reflections coming from the tank beach the waiting time in between tests was about 15 min to let the tank settle once the tests with the structure were finished the structure was taken out of the tank and the sphere models were tested in a similar fashion without the presence of the structure the release locations for no structure cases were maintained same as the test cases with the structure table 3 shows the test matrix along with different release locations a number of repeat tests were conducted to validate and to identify reliability on motion results specially most tests with the structure in place were repeated at least twice to improve reliability of the data 3 results and discussion the same spheres are used in this case as in the previous force measurement experiments and the wave particulars are also kept the same as those previously used the data measured included time series of full 6 dof motions and the wave profiles from the wave probes among the 6 dof motions surge and heave motions are the most important motions concerning structure impacts mcgovern and bai 2014a moreover previous experiments sayeed et al 2017b measured the forces in x and z directions since the models are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and also further ballasted to minimize pitch motions only surge and heave motion data are considered for this analysis the distance in the surge direction is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the heave displacement is positive upward in analyzing the data time series of raw data of surge and heave displacements were selected after initial transient values had passed several calm runs were conducted and the static offset was removed to yield wave induced heave motions only a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 3 shows two typical wave cases during the experiment 3 1 no structure cases the 6 dof motion data are resolved to the center of gravity for each model the structure face location in x direction is considered as the origin the time series of raw data for surge and heave motions for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without the structure in wave λ d s 3 5 is shown in fig 4 the x displacement data contains both low and high frequency motions the high frequency motions are the oscillatory motions due to the wave frequency and low frequency motions are due to the second order wave drift forces huang et al 2011 showed two methods of determining the drift velocity the first method is to calculate the period average mean drift velocity as a function of time by dividing the horizontal displacement between two neighboring peaks by the wave period the second method is to calculate the slope of a best fitting linear trend line from the x trajectory the drift motion in the present analysis is calculated from the signal by determining the slope of the best fitting linear trend line once steady state is reached bai et al 2017 huang et al 2011 mcgovern and bai 2014a fig 5 shows the x trajectory and the corresponding linear curve fit for sphere d i d s 0 4 for 10 wave cycles tested without the structure in wave λ d s 4 the slope of the curve determines the drift velocity as 0 039 m s surge and heave velocities are calculated from the corresponding displacement time series sayeed et al 2017b measured the x and z forces on the same spherical models at different proximity to the same fixed structure the forces in the z direction showed non linear behaviour for most of the wave cases wishahy et al 1987 and hinchey et al 1991 also discussed non linear heave motions of spherical bergy bit models in general the non linearity arises from the very small freeboard of floating ice or models ballasted to represent floating ice waves quickly wash over the top surface completely submerging the berg or model fig 6 shows the wave forces in the z direction for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure in wave λ d s 6 from sayeed et al 2017b and the heave motions and velocities for the same sphere tested without the structure in the same wave from the present analysis the results clearly show the non linear behaviour in the forces and corresponding motions in order to plot the motion raos the low frequency motions are removed from the x trajectory then the rms motion for surge and heave were calculated over at least 10 steady state cycles and divided by the wave height since the heave motions of the spherical models show non linear motions in some of the wave cases more than 10 cycles were considered for the analysis of those cases figs 7 and 8 show the surge and heave raos respectively for the three spherical and the cylindrical models plotted against the diffraction parameter k a where k is the wave number and a is the model radius the three spherical models show similar trend indicating that reynolds dissimilitude has little influence on wave induced motions and the application of froude scaling is reasonable the results also show significant difference due to the shape effect on both surge and heave motions the cylindrical model shows much higher rao values than the same diameter spherical model for both surge and heave lever et al 1990a also showed significant difference between different shaped models on wave induced motions particularly cubical and cylindrical models showed higher rao values than the sloping side models of trapezoid and sphere figs 9 and 10 show the sphere size and shape effects on rms surge and heave velocities for different waves of steepness 1 30 for no structure cases the velocities are non dimensionalized by volumetric froude number g v o l 1 3 where g is the acceleration due to gravity and vol is the submerged volume both surge and heave rms velocities are smaller for the sphere d i d s 0 6 compared to the other two smaller spheres this can be attributed to larger surface area and larger displacement the surge and heave rms velocities for sphere d i d s 0 3 is higher than the sphere d i d s 0 4 except for waves λ d s 5 a n d 6 it is also observed that the size effect is more pronounced in the heave direction than in the surge direction contrary to what was found in sayeed et al 2017b where the size effect was more pronounced for the fx force than the fz force this is because the forces were measured by holding the bodies in place and the motions are measured on free floating bodies figs 9 and 10 also show the rms surge and heave velocities of the same diameter sphere and cylinder for different waves of steepness 1 30 in the no structure cases although the diameters are the same the draft of the cylinder is less and the cylindrical model is considerably lighter than the spherical model both rms surge and heave velocities for the cylindrical model are considerably higher than the spherical model 3 2 with structure cases as part of the experimental procedure each model was placed in the initial starting position and held for few seconds to let a few wave cycles pass by and insure that steady state reflections are developed from the structure it was observed that the model was slowed down in some locations on its way towards the structure in some waves the model went forward and came back and in other occasions the model proceeded to hit the structure the data has been analyzed only for the forward motion fig 11 shows the time series of surge and heave displacements for three models in three different wave conditions the sphere d i d s 0 4 in wave λ d s 5 went and hit the structure whereas the sphere d i d s 0 3 in wave λ d s 4 went close to the structure and came back these motion profiles also indicate the change in velocity throughout the trajectory it is to be noted that the purpose of our study is not to analyze the impacts themselves but rather to investigate the change in velocity profile prior to impact due to hydrodynamic interaction with the structure for each test the surge and heave velocities are calculated from the recorded motion data figs 12 and 13 show the calculated time series of surge and heave velocities respectively for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested in wave λ d s 5 for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ d s 3 5 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ d s 4 with structure the results clearly show an envelope type profile indicating the change in velocities with time surge velocities include the low frequency motion as well thus showing the mean velocity is greater than zero and the body moved forward sayeed et al 2017b found that the wave loads at different proximity to the structure are dictated by the separation distance d to wavelength ratio λ and the non dimensional rms forces against d λ show an envelope type profile because of the standing wave in front of the structure also as the forces in the x direction decreased the forces in z direction increased fig 14 shows the surge and heave velocities for sphere d i d s 0 4 in wave λ d s 3 5 tested with structure and plotted against d λ the variable separation distance from the structure d was evaluated from the low frequency drift motion data these results are consistent across tests with strong correlation between forces measured in previous experiments sayeed et al 2017b and motions measured in the present analysis the results indicate the effect of standing wave in front of the structure when a wave of small amplitude encounters a vertical wall the waves are reflected in order to satisfy the wall boundary condition the combined wave form is called standing wave as it does not propagate in any direction fig 15 shows free surface displacement associated with a standing wave form at positions k x π 2 3 π 2 and so on nodes exist where free surface elevation η is zero at these node locations the vertical velocity w and the hydrodynamic pressure component p ρ g z are also zero on the other hand at positions k x 0 π and so on antinodes exist where free surface elevation η has maximum variation at these antinode locations the horizontal velocity u is zero while maximum variations occur in w and p ρ g z the trough to crest height of the standing wave is twice that of incident wave train sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 dean and dalrymple 1991 the results in fig 14 clearly show the how the motions are amplified at nodes and antinodes at nodes the surge motions are increased and heave motions are decreased and at antinodes the surge motions are decreased and heave motions are increased in order to keep consistency with previous analysis the rms velocities were non dimensionalized using the rms velocities for no structure cases and plotted against an average range of d λ figs 16 23 show the non dimensional surge and heave velocities for spheres d i d s 0 6 0 4 0 3 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested in all waves with structure and plotted against d λ the results contain all the repeat runs as well there is more scatter in non dimensional heave velocities for the spheres because of the non linear heave motions for most of the wave cases 3 3 correlation with wave envelope sayeed et al 2017b measured the wave envelope in front of the structure by traversing a wave probe along the direction of wave propagation at slow constant speed using the tow carriage this is a common method used to measure the wave envelope of the standing wave profile and reflection coefficients from beach structures nallayarasu et al 1995 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 dean and dalrymple 1991 the two towing speeds were 5 cm s and 10 cm s fig 24 shows the measured wave envelope for wave λ d s 5 at two speeds since the incident wave energy is not fully reflected and partially dissipated and transmitted this figure shows the quasi standing wave in front of the structure fig 25 shows the surge and heave velocities for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested with structure in the same wave condition this shows the strong correlation between the wave envelope in front of the structure and the surge and heave motions of an approaching body towards a fixed structure the surge motions always follow nicely with the corresponding wave envelope whereas the heave motions are not as well correlated particularly for the spherical models fig 26 shows the heave velocities for the three spheres in the same wave λ d s 5 tested with structure this shows the non linear heave motions of the spherical models due to large submergence and large excursions from equilibrium position during wave excitation similar to that observed by attwood 1987 and wishahy et al 1987 3 4 effect of initial starting location mcgovern and bai 2014b su et al 2016 reported that small variations in initial starting condition may lead to significant variations in resulting impact location and velocity during our initial testing phase similar behavior was noticed when the same sphere moved towards the structure when started from a certain location and moved away from the structure when started from another location hence some experiments were conducted to understand the effect of initial starting location on the resulting drift velocity it is to be noted that initial starting condition implies both starting location and the wave phase during release in our experiments only starting location with respect to the structure was varied and not the wave phase the sphere d i d s 0 6 was tested with structure at five different starting locations and each test was repeated at least twice the test matrix is given table 4 it was observed that for the same wave condition and different starting location the sphere exhibits different motion behaviour fig 27 shows the time history of surge motions for the sphere tested in λ d s 4 starting at five different locations from the structure the differences in the resulting drift motions are obvious due to different initial starting locations fig 28 shows the surge velocity of the sphere plotted against d λ for wave λ d s 3 5 tested in five different release locations there is an offset of half the diameter in surge displacement since the starting location is measured from the center of the sphere to the face of the structure the starting locations of 2 6 2 and 1 6 m are ahead of the point where d λ 0 5 and the sphere gets stuck close to d λ 0 5 and then reverses direction whereas the starting locations of 1 and 0 6 m are behind the point where d λ 0 5 and the sphere then proceeds to a point very close to the structure and then reverses direction as discussed before there are multiple nodes and antinodes in front of the structure due to the standing wave profile at antinode locations the body is slowed in surge and experiences increased heave motions depending on the forward momentum of the sphere the body may be slowed sufficiently in those locations to reduce the forward momentum to zero thus causing it to reverse direction or it may have enough forward momentum to continue to move forward the initial starting location dictates how many antinodes obstacles the body has to overcome to go forward towards the structure this is why the direction of drift velocity changes depending on the initial release location it is to be noted that the other factor of wave phase is also important because the initial momentum of the body will be varied depending on whether the body is released at wave crest or wave trough for the same wave condition and same starting location the repeat runs showed exactly same behaviour except for two conditions one for wave λ d s 5 started from 0 6 m ahead of the structure and the other one for wave λ d s 4 5 started from 2 6 m ahead of the structure five repeats were conducted for wave λ d s 5 started from 0 6 m where in two cases the sphere went in and hit the structure and in three cases the sphere did not hit the structure and reversed direction similarly for wave λ d s 4 5 started from 2 6 m in one case the sphere went forward towards the structure and in the other case the sphere reversed direction as it approached the structure after release these two cases can be attributed to the difference in the initial wave phase being not matched in those repeat runs the distance of 0 6 m is very close to the structure and the initial transient makes the difference in the initial momentum of the sphere initial difference in momentum was also felt in the case of 2 6 m and the sphere started going forward when slightly pushed by hand thus initial staring conditions of location and wave phase have significant influence on the resulting direction of the drift velocity it is to be noted that we are only studying the wave induced motions of the ice masses and there are other environmental forces like current wind pack ice etc in prototype conditions the iceberg may be driven to any offset location from the structure and then the berg can be influenced by wave forces thus our main focus is to understand the velocity profile change in front of the structure prior to impact and not concerned with whether the body will hit the structure or not at the same time the influence of the experimental artifact of starting release condition on the near field trajectory is a significant finding from the present study this problem will definitely inform future experimental and numerical investigation on the subject matter 4 numerical investigation some numerical simulations have been conducted for selected experimental test cases using commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 the objective is to provide a check on the experimental data and to investigate the capability of a cfd tool to capture close proximity multi body hydrodynamic problem flow3d is a general purpose cfd code which utilizes the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to solve the fluid flow problems the computational flow domain divides the physical space into a number of small rectangular volumes called cells or brick elements the cells are connected with several nodes which store the values of unknown variables such as pressure temperature and velocity using a finite difference approach a structured type computational mesh block is formed flow 3d also allows non uniform grid spacing which helps to mesh complex flow domains solid body geometry is defined by a technique named favor fractional area volume obstacle representation using this technique the area fraction on the cell faces and the volume fraction available for fluid flow are calculated for each cell flow3d utilizes volume of fluid method called truvof for free surface tracking a general moving object gmo modeling option allows rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom which is used in the present study the wave boundary condition allows simple wave generation of linear or stokes waves at the boundary flow science inc version 11 1 a wave damping region called the sponge layer can be used in the outlet to absorb waves and reduce reflections at the outflow boundary flow3d has been used by several researchers for different fluid flow and free surface problems e g bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 maguire 2011 sayeed et al 2017b numerical results from flow3d are compared with the current experimental data 4 1 numerical test case set up the sphere d i d s 0 6 and waves λ d s 4 6 a n d 3 5 are selected as test cases similar to sayeed et al 2017b for the numerical studies the same grid size was used in the free surface region as sayeed et al 2017b to match the targeted wave heights the width and height of the numerical tank was 4 5 and 2 5 m respectively and initial fluid elevation was 1 8 m the length of the tank varied with wavelength the boundary conditions applied are xmin wave xmax outflow ymin and ymax wall zmin wall and zmax specified pressure an additional wave absorbing component was added before outflow boundary to reduce wave reflections from the boundary and to maintain fluid volume in the domain the geometry files were imported in stl format and the rendered output was checked to identify whether the grid size was sufficient to maintain geometric shape properly the hexagonal fixed structure was treated as a non moving object and the sphere was treated as a moving object the general moving object gmo modeling option was used to allow coupled motions in x and z translation only surge and heave the mass properties of the sphere were edited accordingly without modeling the top or bottom rods used in the experiment fig 29 shows the computational domain with sphere and hexagonal structure along with boundary conditions stokes fenton s 5th order theory was chosen to simulate the waves in flow3d the grid sensitivity analysis was performed to simulate the targeted waves fig 30 shows the result for wave λ d s 6 from sayeed et al 2017b incompressible one fluid flow mode was selected with free surface or sharp interface tracking the implicit gmres pressure solver and explicit viscous stress solver was used first order momentum advection was selected and the split lagrangian method was used to resolve volume of fluid advection two equation k ε model flow science inc version 11 1 was used as turbulence model with dynamically computed maximum turbulent mixing length although turbulence is not strong in free surface waves but it was used since we modeled multi body simulation and possible eddies may generate from both objects bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 and bai et al 2017 also used turbulence models in their simulation of free surface waves before conducting the simulation with two structures it was made sure that the simulation generates the desired wave with turbulence model without dissipation of energy once the right wave was generated then the multi body simulation was conducted the built in automatic time step control in flow3d was used which ensures the stability limits for the solver 4 2 numerical results the total number of cells depend on wavelength and varied between 5 and 7 million and associated simulation time varied between 20 and 30 h the numerical simulations were run for at least 40 s and compared with steady state sections from the corresponding experimental data fig 31 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere tested without structure in waves λ d s 4 6 a n d 3 5 this clearly shows the big difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation for all the cases except for λ d s 6 table 5 shows the magnitudes of the drift velocity calculated from the steady state cycles for no structure cases this difference can be largely attributed to the modeling difference in the numerical simulations during initial stages of the experiment it was found that the spherical model experience significant pitch motions without any pitch damping then pitch damping was used for the spherical models in experiment during preliminary numerical simulation pitch motion was allowed for the spherical model and the model was also spinning then the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model still experienced some pitch motions also the physical model has a rod and small mass attached to it at the bottom of the model for pitch damping which is not practical to model numerically due to the requirement of very small grid size besides this there is also a small difference in wave heights generated between the experimental facility and the numerical wave tank it is also to be noted that only initial starting locations were matched between the experiment and numerical simulations the other factor of initial wave phase was not experimentally tracked and thus not necessarily the same as the numerical simulations another issue that can influence the divergence of the simulation and experimental results is the number of cells used for the resolution of water surface tilt over the length equal to the diameter of the sphere although the wave height and sphere geometry smoothness were checked before conducting the simulation even finer mesh for the sphere geometry may be worthwhile to investigate which was not possible in the present study because of the lack of computational resources also overset mesh can be a viable option but is not available in flow3d last but not least the reflected waves from the structure may further reflect from the tank walls and may influence the drift of the floating sphere but the effect is anticipated to be small in the near field of the fixed structure the drift speeds in the numerical simulations are higher than experiments because the attached rod and allowable pitch motions in the physical model damped the surge drift motions bai et al 2017 compared their numerical results with experiment for surge and heave oscillatory motions by removing the mean drift motion from the surge displacement signal figs 32 and 33 show the steady state time series of oscillatory surge and heave velocities similar to those presented in bai et al 2017 for the sphere tested without structure in waves λ d s 4 a n d 6 respectively it is found that the oscillatory surge and heave motion results agree reasonably well with experimental data the numerical results also capture the non linear heave motions in wave λ d s 6 quite well fig 34 shows the comparison of surge and heave velocities plotted against d λ for the sphere tested with structure in wave λ d s 6 the initial starting location of the sphere was 2 m the numerical results match quite well with experimental data the numerical results show that the sphere goes forward and hits the structure similar to experiment the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations fig 35 shows the comparison of surge and heave velocities plotted against d λ for the sphere tested with structure in wave λ d s 4 the initial starting location of the sphere was 2 m in this case the sphere went forward up to d λ 0 59 stayed there and then came back during experiment whereas in the numerical simulation the sphere keeps going forward and hits the structure as presented in table 5 that for this wave condition the drift velocity in the numerical simulation was significantly higher than the experimental case for no structure cases in spite of this difference in mean velocity the numerical simulation results show the relative velocity changes at the node and antinode locations similar to those observed in the experiments figs 36 and 37 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity of the sphere tested in wave λ d s 3 5 for two different release locations 2 m and 1 m in numerical simulation the sphere goes forward and hits the structure for both release locations whereas in the experiments the sphere proceeds up to d λ 0 5 and then reverses direction for the 2 m release location and the sphere goes very close to the structure and then reverses for the 1 m release location irrespective of these differences in the mean drift behaviour the numerical simulation shows good agreement with experiment in terms of the wave induced velocity trends and can predict the change in wave induced velocity profile prior to impact thus it can be concluded that rans based cfd simulations show good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the challenges lie in the proper modeling of geometry and mass properties of the physical model considering the limitations of computational resources 5 conclusions a set of experiments has been conducted to investigate the change in wave induced motions for different sizes of free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure it is evident that there is a significant change in the first and second order motions as a small body approaches a larger fixed structure the motion results of experimental data show excellent correlation with the force data gathered in sayeed et al 2017b the separation distance to wavelength ratio is found to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions in the same way as wave forces measured at different proximity to the fixed structure as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased these motions correspond to similar increase in measured heave forces and a decrease in surge forces these changes in motions arising from changes in the wave forces indicate that velocity statistics for small ice masses should incorporate consideration of relative size and relative distance in considering potential impact scenarios with fixed structures reductions in surge drift and wave induced motions could lead to reduced impact forces while increases in heave motions may have implications for potential impacts on overhanging structures numerical investigations of selected test cases were conducted using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d the numerical results show a good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations significant differences were observed in some cases between experimental and simulated drift velocities moreover numerical simulations demonstrate collision of floating sphere with structure for all the tested cases whereas the experiments show cases of collisions and of no collisions the reasons for discrepancy can largely be attributed to the modeling difference of geometry and mass properties of the physical model also the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model experienced pitch motions besides the initial wave phases were not matched between experiment and numerical simulations irrespective of these differences the numerical simulation shows good agreement with experiment in terms of the wave induced velocity trends and can predict the change in wave induced velocity profile prior to impact acknowledgements the authors would like to appreciate the technical assistance from trevor clark matt curtis and craig mitchell

23488,estimation of iceberg impact load is an important design consideration for offshore structures in ice prone regions impact velocity is influenced by the complex hydrodynamic interaction between the iceberg or bergy bit and the offshore structure in order to understand the phenomenon a two phase experimental and numerical study has been conducted in the first phase the change in wave loads on different sized spherical model ice masses was investigated for different proximities to a fixed structure and the results published in sayeed et al 2017b this paper describes the results of the second phase study where the change in wave induced motions of free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure is investigated through physical experiments and numerical simulations the experiments were carried out at the ocean engineering research center oerc of memorial university of newfoundland and the motions were measured using an optical tracking system qualysis the objective is to determine the velocity profiles of approaching ice masses and how that changes prior to impact the experimental results of motion data show excellent correlation with the force data gathered in the first phase similar to previous studies the separation distance to wavelength ratio is shown to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased some experiments have also been conducted to understand the effect of initial starting location on the resulting drift velocity numerical simulations of the experimental cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d show good agreement with the experimental data keywords iceberg bergy bit wave induced motion hydrodynamic interaction offshore structure wave body interaction 1 introduction wave driven small icebergs bergy bits and growlers can become significant hazards for offshore structures operating in ice prone regions estimation of iceberg impact load is an important design consideration for offshore structures in ice infested waters fixed structures are designed to withstand large iceberg impacts whereas floating structures can avoid interaction with large bergs by moving off location a significant number of ship ice collisions continue to be reported because small ice masses are harder to detect in bad weather at night or in heavy seas moreover the hazard is increased by their short impact duration implied by higher impact velocity for small ice pieces lever et al 1988b the impact load from wave driven iceberg and bergy bits with an offshore structure largely depends on the final velocity prior to impact the close proximity hydrodynamic interaction between the approaching iceberg and the offshore structure plays an important role in governing the impact velocity for relatively wave transparent structures like semi submersibles iceberg impact velocities predicted based on open water test data are reported to be reasonable lever et al 1988b 1990b but for less transparent fixed or floating offshore structures such as gravity base structures or large ship shaped fpsos the proximity effect can be significant mak et al 1990 lever et al 1990b impact velocity also changes the failure mode of ice ductile transition or brittle thus changing the effective pressure generally iceberg structure collisions are anticipated to occur at velocities that place the ice in the brittle failure region but lower impact velocities might cause the ice to fail in the ductile or transition regions cammaert et al 1983 johnson and benoit 1987 sodhi and haehnel 2003 ignoring these effects may result in an overestimation in impact load which will ultimately affect the design and cost of the structure there is evidence that the near field hydrodynamic influences do affect impact velocity and trajectory it has been reported that if the ice mass diameter is less than half of the structure diameter the ice mass will not hit the structure because of negative wave drift forces salvalggio and rojansky 1986 isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b even in cases where impacts do occur the impact velocity can be substantially reduced and several phenomenon like fluid cushioning shadowing negative wave drift force change in added mass hydrodynamic damping eccentric impact etc have been reported because of reflected and standing waves bolen 1987 colbourne et al 1998 colbourne 2000 gagnon 2004 a series of experiments conducted by attwood 1987 and lever et al 1988a 1988b revealed that small icebergs showed fluid particle type behavior for wave length iceberg size ratios greater than 13 lever et al 1990a extended their impact velocity probability statistics to include randomly varying iceberg shape the inclusion of iceberg shape showed important variations on significant velocity exceedance levels which in turn resulted in higher total surge velocities including drift for almost all cases mak et al 1990 conducted model tests of wave driven bergy bits impacting with a floating oil production platform in regular and irregular waves open water significant velocities were found to be 10 40 higher than significant impact velocities mctaggart 1989 and isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990c investigated the hydrodynamic forces during iceberg drift in proximity with an offshore structure through model tests and numerical analysis for the waves only condition no impact occurred when the ratio of iceberg diameter and structure diameter is less than or equal to 0 2 whereas salvalggio and rojansky 1986 in their experiments found the ratio to be 0 5 it was reported that the presence of the structure can result in 10 or more velocity reduction for smaller icebergs iceberg structure diameter ratio less than 0 2 approaching the structure colbourne et al 1998 conducted physical model tests of the terra nova fpso in collision with an iceberg 100 000t and a bergy bit 3 600t at different headings and driving environments wave action on the smaller bergy bit resulted in confused collision trends due to the radiated waves in very near field region colbourne 2000 indicated that for small ice pieces increasing input wave energy did not lead to increasing impact energy and postulated that the effect may be due to reflection of waves where the reflected wave energy negated the increased berg energy gagnon 2004 investigated the hydrodynamic interaction between a floating ice mass and a tanker passing at speed using physical model tests this study indicated that the radiation proximity effect can be significant but this work did not directly consider collisions an increase in maximum sway motion of the ice mass was also observed due to the presence of the tanker as a temporary wall boundary thus influencing the wave induced hydrodynamic forces on the ice mass mcgovern and bai 2014a conducted an experiment on isolated ice floes of different sizes and shapes and investigated their surge and heave motions in regular waves the motions observed for ice floes were found to be different than those of icebergs at wavelength to characteristic length ratio of 3 3 5 the floe behaved like a fluid particle mcgovern and bai 2014b also investigated the presence of a circular cylinder on the kinematics of ice floes in regular and irregular waves at separation distance to cylinder diameter ratio less than 10 increase in heave response and significant reduction in surge response was observed the mean drift velocities also showed low and negative values as the ice floe approached head on towards the cylinder sayeed et al 2017b conducted a set of experiments to measure the wave loads on different sized spherical ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure a six component dynamometer was used to measure the wave forces in six different regular head waves the objective was to investigate changes in wave loads at different separation distances from the structure the experimental results show that the distance to wavelength ratio dictates the corresponding wave loads in horizontal and vertical directions the mean drift force in the horizontal direction becomes negative against the direction of wave propagation for most of the cases when the body is close to the structure also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the non dimensional rms forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the non dimensional rms forces in the vertical direction increase most of the numerical models found in the literature to study iceberg interaction with offshore structures utilize potential flow code which assumes inviscid and irrotational flow isaacson and stritto 1986 used a diffraction theory model with oscillatory and drift motions to investigate the two body interaction problem cheung 1987 and isaacson and cheung 1988a 1988b observed an increase in added mass as separation distance decreased based on predictions utilizing their potential flow code lever and sen 1987 highlighted the importance of wave induced iceberg motion in risk analyses of iceberg collisions the authors utilized linear potential flow theory developed by sen 1983 to compute wave induced surge and heave motions of five different size cubic icebergs lever et al 1988a and attwood 1987 conducted wave tank experiments of wave induced iceberg motions to validate results from linear potential theory mctaggart 1989 investigated various hydrodynamic aspects such as added mass wave induced oscillatory motion and modification of iceberg motion due to the presence of a structure during iceberg impact using a potential flow numerical model isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b presented summary results of experiments carried out to investigate iceberg drift in proximity with offshore structures the experimental results are compared with a numerical model based on potential flow theory for the current only cases agreement was reasonable for velocity ratios but the numerical model under predicted impact eccentricities for the cases with waves only the numerical results followed the experimental trend except for one condition for combined wave current with larger waves the numerical results significantly under predicted in general poor agreement resulted especially from the prediction of negative wave drift force in the vicinity of the structure chernetsov et al 2008 proposed two types of spar substructure spar classic and spar ring equipped with mooring systems that can resist ice floe and iceberg impact diffraction theory used in dynamic simulation showed considerable reduction in iceberg approach velocity before contact and impact force was further reduced because of hydrodynamic interaction during contact tsarau et al 2014 presented a numerical model combining discrete element and boundary element methods to predict potential flow with actual movements of bodies in multi body dynamics some model tests were conducted in calm water where a submerged sphere ice mass was fixed and a cylinder structure was towed past the sphere at different speeds and separation distances the hydrodynamic forces varied between positive and negative depending on the separation distance the numerical model predicted qualitative results for large separation distance accurate estimates for moderate distance and overestimates for very small 0 01 m separation distance numerical studies using ls dyna and its ale formulation show good validation results for the hydrodynamic behavior of floating bergy bits during a collision lee et al 2010 investigated the effects of the geometry of the iceberg striking face and the water layer entrapped between an iceberg and a lngc during the collision process lee and nguyen 2011 simulated bow shoulder and side collision responses between a lngc and a cubic iceberg considering wave making of the lngc and relative drift velocity taking the hydrodynamic water pressure into account gagnon and wang 2012 performed numerical simulations of a tanker collision with a bergy bit including hydrodynamics calm water a crushable foam ice model and a collision model sustaining deformation and damage all of these simulations were conducted in calm water wave driven iceberg and bergy bit interaction and impact with a structure is far more complicated tsarau et al 2015 some potential alternative numerical methods to model iceberg structure hydrodynamic interaction are presented by sayeed et al 2017a su et al 2016 used a time domain potential flow model to simulate the kinematics of an ice floe in the presence of a circular cylinder and compared the results with mcgovern and bai 2014b the added mass and damping forces are calculated using the commercial potential flow code wamit and diffraction forces are approximated assuming a small body in waves the simulation results agreed quite well with experiments except in the near cylinder region prior to impact the significant reductions in surge velocity due to close proximity hydrodynamic interaction were not captured by the numerical model only a couple of cases of rans based cfd codes used for studying iceberg drift are found in the literature sayeed et al 2017b compared some of the experimental test cases with rans based cfd code flow3d the results show reasonable comparison demonstrating that the proximity and non linear effect can be captured by viscous flow cfd models bai et al 2017 compared the experimental results of mcgovern and bai 2014a with linear potential flow model hydrostar and viscous flow cfd model openfoam the comparison showed that the surge and heave raos are overestimated by linear flow model whereas the cfd results showed reasonably accurate comparison with experimental data sayeed et al 2017a conducted a review to identify the significance of hydrodynamic interaction of ice masses in close proximity with arctic offshore structures just prior to impact and also to identify related research gaps in this area a number of studies investigated the motions of free floating ice masses in open water or near a fixed floating structure salvalggio and rojansky 1986 attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a 1990a 1990b mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b 1990c colbourne et al 1998 mcgovern and bai 2014a 2014b various complex phenomena have been reported due to the near field hydrodynamic interaction between the ice mass and the structure design codes currently do not have specific guidelines for hydrodynamic effects in close vicinity to structure although they do mention that such effects should be considered for example iso 19906 states hydrodynamic effects associated with ice feature motions in the vicinity of the structure can be considerable especially in conditions where the ice concentration is low and relatively small ice features are impacting wide structures due to hydrodynamic effects smaller ice features can slow down as they approach and tend to move around the structure consideration should be given to added mass of the impacting ice feature with due account for the presence of the seabed and the structure when the structure moves sufficiently during the course of the interaction its added mass should also be considered thus it is evident that the prediction of ice impact forces could be substantially improved through a better understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic properties in the very near field interaction phase the present study is a continuation of previous work by sayeed et al 2017b this phase of the investigation was conducted to determine if the motions measured in proximity to the fixed structure will correlate with the forces measured in the previous experiment sayeed et al 2017b also the high and low frequency wave induced motions will reveal the velocity profiles of approaching ice masses and how that changes prior to impact similar to previous studies complimentary numerical simulations are conducted for selected test cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 in the present study a fixed structure of diameter d s 0 5 m was used which remains stationary in the incoming wave field a wave regime of λ d s 3 6 was chosen where diffraction effects particularly reflected wave energy is important three spherical and one cylindrical models of size d i d s 0 3 0 6 were used to represent floating ice masses moving towards the fixed structure 2 experimental program the current set of experiments involved the measurement of the motions of the free floating ice masses with and without the presence of the fixed structure the objective of these experiments is to identify the change in velocity profiles due to the presence of the structure this should also help to identify the potential velocity just prior to impact 2 1 facility the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the ocean engineering research center oerc at memorial university of newfoundland mun in st john s nl canada the towing tank is 58 m long and 4 5 m wide with maximum still water depth of 2 2 m the tank is equipped with a hydraulically actuated wave board on one side and a wave absorbing beach on the other side 2 2 models and instrumentation a hexagonal aluminium cylinder of 0 5 m diameter was used as the fixed offshore structure the scale ratio is nominally 1 50 thus the full scale structure diameter is 25 m three spheres with diameters of 0 152 m 0 203 m and 0 305 m were used to represent different size ice masses the ratios of ice mass diameters to the fixed structure diameter are 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 respectively in addition a cylindrical model of the same diameter as the medium sphere and 0 098 m high height to diameter ratio of 0 5 was tested to investigate possible shape effect the centre of gravity for each model was experimentally measured and theoretically calculated table 1 shows the vertical center of gravity for each model from the top of the model being considered to measure the motions a qualisys optical tracking system was used qualisys is an optical tracking system that utilizes infrared cameras to track target markers and measure the 6 degrees of freedom motions of the model three infrared cameras were mounted and calibrated to cover the desired field of view three capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected waves one wave probe was placed far upstream to measure the incoming wave profile and two probes were used on two sides in front of the structure so that the models do not touch the probes during the experiment before conducting experiments both the qualisys cameras and the required waves were calibrated fig 1 shows the layout of the experimental set up in the towing tank with dimensions and coordinate system the distances are considered positive in the direction of wave propagation in x direction and positive upward in z direction in addition videos were recorded during experiments and digital still photographs were taken 2 3 environment the towing tank water depth was 1 8 m six regular waves with two different wave steepness were selected with wave lengths as multiples of the fixed structure diameter and also to cover full scale wave periods of 7 10 s the stroke limitation of the wave generator did not allow for waves with frequency greater than 1 hz to be created the wave particulars are given in table 2 2 4 methodology the fixed structure model was placed in the tank and filled with water ballast the structure was also clamped against a fixed cross tank platform to avoid any movement the spheres are ballasted with paraffin wax to float with the nominal draft of the iceberg the sphere motions are restrained to the vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and a light weight carbon fibre rod on top of the sphere moreover the spheres were further ballasted by inserting a rod at the bottom of the spheres with small weights at the end to reduce pitch motions and better extract heave and surge motions the optical tracking system qualysis was used to track the motions in six degrees of freedom four light weight reflective marker balls were installed on the rod attached to the sphere the marker balls were arranged in such a manner that there is no shadowing of multiple markers when the model rotates and the markers can be seen distinctively by the cameras fig 2 shows the experimental set up including the fixed structure the medium sphere with qualisys markers arranged on top and the wave probes for reflected waves the sphere model was held at the release distance from the structure and then was let go after few seconds the release distances were 2 m for the cylinder medium and large spheres and 1 6 m for the small sphere since this sphere takes a longer time to travel than the other two spheres the large sphere was also tested at different release distances of 2 5 m 2 m 1 6 m 1 m and 0 6 m to investigate the effect of different starting location on the corresponding kinematics of the sphere each test duration was about 2 min to avoid possible contamination of the incident wave field due to reflections coming from the tank beach the waiting time in between tests was about 15 min to let the tank settle once the tests with the structure were finished the structure was taken out of the tank and the sphere models were tested in a similar fashion without the presence of the structure the release locations for no structure cases were maintained same as the test cases with the structure table 3 shows the test matrix along with different release locations a number of repeat tests were conducted to validate and to identify reliability on motion results specially most tests with the structure in place were repeated at least twice to improve reliability of the data 3 results and discussion the same spheres are used in this case as in the previous force measurement experiments and the wave particulars are also kept the same as those previously used the data measured included time series of full 6 dof motions and the wave profiles from the wave probes among the 6 dof motions surge and heave motions are the most important motions concerning structure impacts mcgovern and bai 2014a moreover previous experiments sayeed et al 2017b measured the forces in x and z directions since the models are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and also further ballasted to minimize pitch motions only surge and heave motion data are considered for this analysis the distance in the surge direction is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the heave displacement is positive upward in analyzing the data time series of raw data of surge and heave displacements were selected after initial transient values had passed several calm runs were conducted and the static offset was removed to yield wave induced heave motions only a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 3 shows two typical wave cases during the experiment 3 1 no structure cases the 6 dof motion data are resolved to the center of gravity for each model the structure face location in x direction is considered as the origin the time series of raw data for surge and heave motions for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without the structure in wave λ d s 3 5 is shown in fig 4 the x displacement data contains both low and high frequency motions the high frequency motions are the oscillatory motions due to the wave frequency and low frequency motions are due to the second order wave drift forces huang et al 2011 showed two methods of determining the drift velocity the first method is to calculate the period average mean drift velocity as a function of time by dividing the horizontal displacement between two neighboring peaks by the wave period the second method is to calculate the slope of a best fitting linear trend line from the x trajectory the drift motion in the present analysis is calculated from the signal by determining the slope of the best fitting linear trend line once steady state is reached bai et al 2017 huang et al 2011 mcgovern and bai 2014a fig 5 shows the x trajectory and the corresponding linear curve fit for sphere d i d s 0 4 for 10 wave cycles tested without the structure in wave λ d s 4 the slope of the curve determines the drift velocity as 0 039 m s surge and heave velocities are calculated from the corresponding displacement time series sayeed et al 2017b measured the x and z forces on the same spherical models at different proximity to the same fixed structure the forces in the z direction showed non linear behaviour for most of the wave cases wishahy et al 1987 and hinchey et al 1991 also discussed non linear heave motions of spherical bergy bit models in general the non linearity arises from the very small freeboard of floating ice or models ballasted to represent floating ice waves quickly wash over the top surface completely submerging the berg or model fig 6 shows the wave forces in the z direction for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure in wave λ d s 6 from sayeed et al 2017b and the heave motions and velocities for the same sphere tested without the structure in the same wave from the present analysis the results clearly show the non linear behaviour in the forces and corresponding motions in order to plot the motion raos the low frequency motions are removed from the x trajectory then the rms motion for surge and heave were calculated over at least 10 steady state cycles and divided by the wave height since the heave motions of the spherical models show non linear motions in some of the wave cases more than 10 cycles were considered for the analysis of those cases figs 7 and 8 show the surge and heave raos respectively for the three spherical and the cylindrical models plotted against the diffraction parameter k a where k is the wave number and a is the model radius the three spherical models show similar trend indicating that reynolds dissimilitude has little influence on wave induced motions and the application of froude scaling is reasonable the results also show significant difference due to the shape effect on both surge and heave motions the cylindrical model shows much higher rao values than the same diameter spherical model for both surge and heave lever et al 1990a also showed significant difference between different shaped models on wave induced motions particularly cubical and cylindrical models showed higher rao values than the sloping side models of trapezoid and sphere figs 9 and 10 show the sphere size and shape effects on rms surge and heave velocities for different waves of steepness 1 30 for no structure cases the velocities are non dimensionalized by volumetric froude number g v o l 1 3 where g is the acceleration due to gravity and vol is the submerged volume both surge and heave rms velocities are smaller for the sphere d i d s 0 6 compared to the other two smaller spheres this can be attributed to larger surface area and larger displacement the surge and heave rms velocities for sphere d i d s 0 3 is higher than the sphere d i d s 0 4 except for waves λ d s 5 a n d 6 it is also observed that the size effect is more pronounced in the heave direction than in the surge direction contrary to what was found in sayeed et al 2017b where the size effect was more pronounced for the fx force than the fz force this is because the forces were measured by holding the bodies in place and the motions are measured on free floating bodies figs 9 and 10 also show the rms surge and heave velocities of the same diameter sphere and cylinder for different waves of steepness 1 30 in the no structure cases although the diameters are the same the draft of the cylinder is less and the cylindrical model is considerably lighter than the spherical model both rms surge and heave velocities for the cylindrical model are considerably higher than the spherical model 3 2 with structure cases as part of the experimental procedure each model was placed in the initial starting position and held for few seconds to let a few wave cycles pass by and insure that steady state reflections are developed from the structure it was observed that the model was slowed down in some locations on its way towards the structure in some waves the model went forward and came back and in other occasions the model proceeded to hit the structure the data has been analyzed only for the forward motion fig 11 shows the time series of surge and heave displacements for three models in three different wave conditions the sphere d i d s 0 4 in wave λ d s 5 went and hit the structure whereas the sphere d i d s 0 3 in wave λ d s 4 went close to the structure and came back these motion profiles also indicate the change in velocity throughout the trajectory it is to be noted that the purpose of our study is not to analyze the impacts themselves but rather to investigate the change in velocity profile prior to impact due to hydrodynamic interaction with the structure for each test the surge and heave velocities are calculated from the recorded motion data figs 12 and 13 show the calculated time series of surge and heave velocities respectively for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested in wave λ d s 5 for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ d s 3 5 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ d s 4 with structure the results clearly show an envelope type profile indicating the change in velocities with time surge velocities include the low frequency motion as well thus showing the mean velocity is greater than zero and the body moved forward sayeed et al 2017b found that the wave loads at different proximity to the structure are dictated by the separation distance d to wavelength ratio λ and the non dimensional rms forces against d λ show an envelope type profile because of the standing wave in front of the structure also as the forces in the x direction decreased the forces in z direction increased fig 14 shows the surge and heave velocities for sphere d i d s 0 4 in wave λ d s 3 5 tested with structure and plotted against d λ the variable separation distance from the structure d was evaluated from the low frequency drift motion data these results are consistent across tests with strong correlation between forces measured in previous experiments sayeed et al 2017b and motions measured in the present analysis the results indicate the effect of standing wave in front of the structure when a wave of small amplitude encounters a vertical wall the waves are reflected in order to satisfy the wall boundary condition the combined wave form is called standing wave as it does not propagate in any direction fig 15 shows free surface displacement associated with a standing wave form at positions k x π 2 3 π 2 and so on nodes exist where free surface elevation η is zero at these node locations the vertical velocity w and the hydrodynamic pressure component p ρ g z are also zero on the other hand at positions k x 0 π and so on antinodes exist where free surface elevation η has maximum variation at these antinode locations the horizontal velocity u is zero while maximum variations occur in w and p ρ g z the trough to crest height of the standing wave is twice that of incident wave train sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 dean and dalrymple 1991 the results in fig 14 clearly show the how the motions are amplified at nodes and antinodes at nodes the surge motions are increased and heave motions are decreased and at antinodes the surge motions are decreased and heave motions are increased in order to keep consistency with previous analysis the rms velocities were non dimensionalized using the rms velocities for no structure cases and plotted against an average range of d λ figs 16 23 show the non dimensional surge and heave velocities for spheres d i d s 0 6 0 4 0 3 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested in all waves with structure and plotted against d λ the results contain all the repeat runs as well there is more scatter in non dimensional heave velocities for the spheres because of the non linear heave motions for most of the wave cases 3 3 correlation with wave envelope sayeed et al 2017b measured the wave envelope in front of the structure by traversing a wave probe along the direction of wave propagation at slow constant speed using the tow carriage this is a common method used to measure the wave envelope of the standing wave profile and reflection coefficients from beach structures nallayarasu et al 1995 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 dean and dalrymple 1991 the two towing speeds were 5 cm s and 10 cm s fig 24 shows the measured wave envelope for wave λ d s 5 at two speeds since the incident wave energy is not fully reflected and partially dissipated and transmitted this figure shows the quasi standing wave in front of the structure fig 25 shows the surge and heave velocities for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested with structure in the same wave condition this shows the strong correlation between the wave envelope in front of the structure and the surge and heave motions of an approaching body towards a fixed structure the surge motions always follow nicely with the corresponding wave envelope whereas the heave motions are not as well correlated particularly for the spherical models fig 26 shows the heave velocities for the three spheres in the same wave λ d s 5 tested with structure this shows the non linear heave motions of the spherical models due to large submergence and large excursions from equilibrium position during wave excitation similar to that observed by attwood 1987 and wishahy et al 1987 3 4 effect of initial starting location mcgovern and bai 2014b su et al 2016 reported that small variations in initial starting condition may lead to significant variations in resulting impact location and velocity during our initial testing phase similar behavior was noticed when the same sphere moved towards the structure when started from a certain location and moved away from the structure when started from another location hence some experiments were conducted to understand the effect of initial starting location on the resulting drift velocity it is to be noted that initial starting condition implies both starting location and the wave phase during release in our experiments only starting location with respect to the structure was varied and not the wave phase the sphere d i d s 0 6 was tested with structure at five different starting locations and each test was repeated at least twice the test matrix is given table 4 it was observed that for the same wave condition and different starting location the sphere exhibits different motion behaviour fig 27 shows the time history of surge motions for the sphere tested in λ d s 4 starting at five different locations from the structure the differences in the resulting drift motions are obvious due to different initial starting locations fig 28 shows the surge velocity of the sphere plotted against d λ for wave λ d s 3 5 tested in five different release locations there is an offset of half the diameter in surge displacement since the starting location is measured from the center of the sphere to the face of the structure the starting locations of 2 6 2 and 1 6 m are ahead of the point where d λ 0 5 and the sphere gets stuck close to d λ 0 5 and then reverses direction whereas the starting locations of 1 and 0 6 m are behind the point where d λ 0 5 and the sphere then proceeds to a point very close to the structure and then reverses direction as discussed before there are multiple nodes and antinodes in front of the structure due to the standing wave profile at antinode locations the body is slowed in surge and experiences increased heave motions depending on the forward momentum of the sphere the body may be slowed sufficiently in those locations to reduce the forward momentum to zero thus causing it to reverse direction or it may have enough forward momentum to continue to move forward the initial starting location dictates how many antinodes obstacles the body has to overcome to go forward towards the structure this is why the direction of drift velocity changes depending on the initial release location it is to be noted that the other factor of wave phase is also important because the initial momentum of the body will be varied depending on whether the body is released at wave crest or wave trough for the same wave condition and same starting location the repeat runs showed exactly same behaviour except for two conditions one for wave λ d s 5 started from 0 6 m ahead of the structure and the other one for wave λ d s 4 5 started from 2 6 m ahead of the structure five repeats were conducted for wave λ d s 5 started from 0 6 m where in two cases the sphere went in and hit the structure and in three cases the sphere did not hit the structure and reversed direction similarly for wave λ d s 4 5 started from 2 6 m in one case the sphere went forward towards the structure and in the other case the sphere reversed direction as it approached the structure after release these two cases can be attributed to the difference in the initial wave phase being not matched in those repeat runs the distance of 0 6 m is very close to the structure and the initial transient makes the difference in the initial momentum of the sphere initial difference in momentum was also felt in the case of 2 6 m and the sphere started going forward when slightly pushed by hand thus initial staring conditions of location and wave phase have significant influence on the resulting direction of the drift velocity it is to be noted that we are only studying the wave induced motions of the ice masses and there are other environmental forces like current wind pack ice etc in prototype conditions the iceberg may be driven to any offset location from the structure and then the berg can be influenced by wave forces thus our main focus is to understand the velocity profile change in front of the structure prior to impact and not concerned with whether the body will hit the structure or not at the same time the influence of the experimental artifact of starting release condition on the near field trajectory is a significant finding from the present study this problem will definitely inform future experimental and numerical investigation on the subject matter 4 numerical investigation some numerical simulations have been conducted for selected experimental test cases using commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 the objective is to provide a check on the experimental data and to investigate the capability of a cfd tool to capture close proximity multi body hydrodynamic problem flow3d is a general purpose cfd code which utilizes the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to solve the fluid flow problems the computational flow domain divides the physical space into a number of small rectangular volumes called cells or brick elements the cells are connected with several nodes which store the values of unknown variables such as pressure temperature and velocity using a finite difference approach a structured type computational mesh block is formed flow 3d also allows non uniform grid spacing which helps to mesh complex flow domains solid body geometry is defined by a technique named favor fractional area volume obstacle representation using this technique the area fraction on the cell faces and the volume fraction available for fluid flow are calculated for each cell flow3d utilizes volume of fluid method called truvof for free surface tracking a general moving object gmo modeling option allows rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom which is used in the present study the wave boundary condition allows simple wave generation of linear or stokes waves at the boundary flow science inc version 11 1 a wave damping region called the sponge layer can be used in the outlet to absorb waves and reduce reflections at the outflow boundary flow3d has been used by several researchers for different fluid flow and free surface problems e g bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 maguire 2011 sayeed et al 2017b numerical results from flow3d are compared with the current experimental data 4 1 numerical test case set up the sphere d i d s 0 6 and waves λ d s 4 6 a n d 3 5 are selected as test cases similar to sayeed et al 2017b for the numerical studies the same grid size was used in the free surface region as sayeed et al 2017b to match the targeted wave heights the width and height of the numerical tank was 4 5 and 2 5 m respectively and initial fluid elevation was 1 8 m the length of the tank varied with wavelength the boundary conditions applied are xmin wave xmax outflow ymin and ymax wall zmin wall and zmax specified pressure an additional wave absorbing component was added before outflow boundary to reduce wave reflections from the boundary and to maintain fluid volume in the domain the geometry files were imported in stl format and the rendered output was checked to identify whether the grid size was sufficient to maintain geometric shape properly the hexagonal fixed structure was treated as a non moving object and the sphere was treated as a moving object the general moving object gmo modeling option was used to allow coupled motions in x and z translation only surge and heave the mass properties of the sphere were edited accordingly without modeling the top or bottom rods used in the experiment fig 29 shows the computational domain with sphere and hexagonal structure along with boundary conditions stokes fenton s 5th order theory was chosen to simulate the waves in flow3d the grid sensitivity analysis was performed to simulate the targeted waves fig 30 shows the result for wave λ d s 6 from sayeed et al 2017b incompressible one fluid flow mode was selected with free surface or sharp interface tracking the implicit gmres pressure solver and explicit viscous stress solver was used first order momentum advection was selected and the split lagrangian method was used to resolve volume of fluid advection two equation k ε model flow science inc version 11 1 was used as turbulence model with dynamically computed maximum turbulent mixing length although turbulence is not strong in free surface waves but it was used since we modeled multi body simulation and possible eddies may generate from both objects bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 and bai et al 2017 also used turbulence models in their simulation of free surface waves before conducting the simulation with two structures it was made sure that the simulation generates the desired wave with turbulence model without dissipation of energy once the right wave was generated then the multi body simulation was conducted the built in automatic time step control in flow3d was used which ensures the stability limits for the solver 4 2 numerical results the total number of cells depend on wavelength and varied between 5 and 7 million and associated simulation time varied between 20 and 30 h the numerical simulations were run for at least 40 s and compared with steady state sections from the corresponding experimental data fig 31 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere tested without structure in waves λ d s 4 6 a n d 3 5 this clearly shows the big difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation for all the cases except for λ d s 6 table 5 shows the magnitudes of the drift velocity calculated from the steady state cycles for no structure cases this difference can be largely attributed to the modeling difference in the numerical simulations during initial stages of the experiment it was found that the spherical model experience significant pitch motions without any pitch damping then pitch damping was used for the spherical models in experiment during preliminary numerical simulation pitch motion was allowed for the spherical model and the model was also spinning then the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model still experienced some pitch motions also the physical model has a rod and small mass attached to it at the bottom of the model for pitch damping which is not practical to model numerically due to the requirement of very small grid size besides this there is also a small difference in wave heights generated between the experimental facility and the numerical wave tank it is also to be noted that only initial starting locations were matched between the experiment and numerical simulations the other factor of initial wave phase was not experimentally tracked and thus not necessarily the same as the numerical simulations another issue that can influence the divergence of the simulation and experimental results is the number of cells used for the resolution of water surface tilt over the length equal to the diameter of the sphere although the wave height and sphere geometry smoothness were checked before conducting the simulation even finer mesh for the sphere geometry may be worthwhile to investigate which was not possible in the present study because of the lack of computational resources also overset mesh can be a viable option but is not available in flow3d last but not least the reflected waves from the structure may further reflect from the tank walls and may influence the drift of the floating sphere but the effect is anticipated to be small in the near field of the fixed structure the drift speeds in the numerical simulations are higher than experiments because the attached rod and allowable pitch motions in the physical model damped the surge drift motions bai et al 2017 compared their numerical results with experiment for surge and heave oscillatory motions by removing the mean drift motion from the surge displacement signal figs 32 and 33 show the steady state time series of oscillatory surge and heave velocities similar to those presented in bai et al 2017 for the sphere tested without structure in waves λ d s 4 a n d 6 respectively it is found that the oscillatory surge and heave motion results agree reasonably well with experimental data the numerical results also capture the non linear heave motions in wave λ d s 6 quite well fig 34 shows the comparison of surge and heave velocities plotted against d λ for the sphere tested with structure in wave λ d s 6 the initial starting location of the sphere was 2 m the numerical results match quite well with experimental data the numerical results show that the sphere goes forward and hits the structure similar to experiment the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations fig 35 shows the comparison of surge and heave velocities plotted against d λ for the sphere tested with structure in wave λ d s 4 the initial starting location of the sphere was 2 m in this case the sphere went forward up to d λ 0 59 stayed there and then came back during experiment whereas in the numerical simulation the sphere keeps going forward and hits the structure as presented in table 5 that for this wave condition the drift velocity in the numerical simulation was significantly higher than the experimental case for no structure cases in spite of this difference in mean velocity the numerical simulation results show the relative velocity changes at the node and antinode locations similar to those observed in the experiments figs 36 and 37 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity of the sphere tested in wave λ d s 3 5 for two different release locations 2 m and 1 m in numerical simulation the sphere goes forward and hits the structure for both release locations whereas in the experiments the sphere proceeds up to d λ 0 5 and then reverses direction for the 2 m release location and the sphere goes very close to the structure and then reverses for the 1 m release location irrespective of these differences in the mean drift behaviour the numerical simulation shows good agreement with experiment in terms of the wave induced velocity trends and can predict the change in wave induced velocity profile prior to impact thus it can be concluded that rans based cfd simulations show good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the challenges lie in the proper modeling of geometry and mass properties of the physical model considering the limitations of computational resources 5 conclusions a set of experiments has been conducted to investigate the change in wave induced motions for different sizes of free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure it is evident that there is a significant change in the first and second order motions as a small body approaches a larger fixed structure the motion results of experimental data show excellent correlation with the force data gathered in sayeed et al 2017b the separation distance to wavelength ratio is found to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions in the same way as wave forces measured at different proximity to the fixed structure as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased these motions correspond to similar increase in measured heave forces and a decrease in surge forces these changes in motions arising from changes in the wave forces indicate that velocity statistics for small ice masses should incorporate consideration of relative size and relative distance in considering potential impact scenarios with fixed structures reductions in surge drift and wave induced motions could lead to reduced impact forces while increases in heave motions may have implications for potential impacts on overhanging structures numerical investigations of selected test cases were conducted using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d the numerical results show a good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations significant differences were observed in some cases between experimental and simulated drift velocities moreover numerical simulations demonstrate collision of floating sphere with structure for all the tested cases whereas the experiments show cases of collisions and of no collisions the reasons for discrepancy can largely be attributed to the modeling difference of geometry and mass properties of the physical model also the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model experienced pitch motions besides the initial wave phases were not matched between experiment and numerical simulations irrespective of these differences the numerical simulation shows good agreement with experiment in terms of the wave induced velocity trends and can predict the change in wave induced velocity profile prior to impact acknowledgements the authors would like to appreciate the technical assistance from trevor clark matt curtis and craig mitchell

thrust compared with a traditional dva the proposed dva with negative stiffness achieves enhanced vibration transmission suppression performance for a much broader absorber frequency range around resonance and with a much smaller size of mass which is very favorable for a marine shafting system keywords marine shafting system longitudinal vibration mode dva with negative stiffness equivalent model vibration transmission suppression 1 introduction due to its impact on marine life abatement of underwater radiated noise by all kinds of vessels has become one of the most difficult challenges for the shipbuilding industry borelli et al 2015 in addition the underwater radiated noise will undermine its stealth for military ships and vessels yankaskas and slotwinski 1995 hence the shipbuilding industry seeks to offer new solutions to comply with the new guidelines and requirements cinquemani and braghin 2017 zhang et al dylejko et al 2007 dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 merz et al 2010 there are many sources of noise within a ship structure among these are the propulsion systems exhaust stacks and various on board equipment in the low frequency range one of the principal noise sources is the propeller the propeller contributes to acoustic radiation via three ways i e as an acoustic source that directly produces sound radiation as an excitation source that excites the hull through the propulsion shaft and the fluid as an excitation source behaving like a dipole that radiates sound in very low frequency range among them the biggest contributor is that the propeller force excites the hull through the shafting system usually the transmission paths are classified as a longitudinal path and transverse path according to the excitation and vibration transmission directions warikoo and haddara 1992 it is shown that vibration energy transmitted along the longitudinal direction is dominant chen et al 2017 the propeller rotates in the unsteady non uniform fluctuating wake field and results in blade passing frequency bpf and its harmonics as well as broadband random spectrum therefore the propeller force will excite the hull propeller and shaft resonances leading to broadband noise this paper will focus on the control of the first longitudinal resonance of the shafting system under excitation by a longitudinal propeller force vibration control along the transmission path is effective both passive and active vibration attenuation measures have been developed where the most publicly available studies have focused on reducing the axial component of vibration control can be performed along the shaft in the bearings as well as on the foundation of the thrust bearing or on the bulkheads some of these measures are listed as follows the resonance changer rc zhang et al dylejko et al 2007 dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 merz et al 2009 2010 chu et al 2016 periodically layered isolators song et al 2014 magnetorheological elastomers yang et al 2014 dynamic anti resonant vibration isolator liu et al 2017 passive isolation measures zhang et al 2012 active vibration control device applied to the propeller shafting system caresta and kessissoglou 2011a 2012 active noise and vibration control applied to the submarine hull merz et al 2013 and design modifications to the propeller shafting system attachment to the hull caresta and kessissoglou 2011b among them the dynamic vibration absorber dva is very popular since it does not have to be inserted in the transmission path of the propeller shafting system and it has little effect on the dynamic behavior of the propeller a dva can be tuned to suppress vibrations of one mode of a vibrating structure even if the structure is a multi degrees of freedom mdof structure or a continuous structure although mathematical modelling of vibration transmission through a marine propulsion shafting system has been undertaken in the past to perform vibration control analysis a simple dynamic model should be initially developed however the aforementioned research usually employs a simplified model with the propeller and shafting system denoted as masses springs and beams as a simple approximation of a real propeller shafting system further the propeller is excessively simplified to be an equivalent rigid mass for some models this simplification ignores the propeller flexure and the resulting blade resonances it is shown that the rigid propeller model significantly under predicts the transmitted force to the thrust bearing to account for the propeller flexibility the propeller blades are further represented by a continuous beam based on euler bernoulli beam theory or a mass spring model youssef et al 2015 li et al 2016a this simplification can only describe the first resonance of the propeller and cannot simulate the anti resonance of the propeller therefore a more detailed dynamic model in the low frequency range which can be employed to perform vibration control and predict the dynamic behavior of the propulsion shafting system as accurate as a finite element model is still needed in practice since the longitudinal stiffness of the thrust bearing is dependent on the rotation speed and variable for different rotation speeds a wide absorber frequency range is desired in developing the dva to make sure that the dva is able to cover the variation range of resonance passive control measures are usually inferior active and semi active control measures are able to realize the variable stiffness in a broad frequency range yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 caresta and kessissoglou 2011a 2012 merz et al 2013 in addition it is of great importance to reduce the requirements for heavy oscillating masses in dvas for marine applications many attempts have been reported such as the inerter and the kdamper the inerter is a two terminal element which has the property that the force generated at its ends is proportional to the relative acceleration of its terminals smith 2002 the essential limitation of the inerter is the complex and elaborate mechanical design configurations needed for its implementation the kdamper is a dva incorporating a negative stiffness element antoniadis et al sapountzakis et al 2017 chronopoulos et al 2017 li et al 2016b yan and wu 2017 antoniadis et al 2015 generally speaking negative stiffness is easy to implement and can be achieved by many forms such as post buckled beams plates shells platus 1999 pre compressed springs arranged in appropriate geometrical configurations a belleville spring carrella et al 2009 huang et al 2014 and other forms of physical forces such as magnetic or electromagnetic wu et al 2014 zhou and liu 2010 compared to other types of springs a belleville spring can be categorized as having a small deflection coupled with high spring force arranging the belleville spring in parallel or nested formation multiplies the spring force alternating or series arrangement multiplies the spring deflection by employing these stacking methods to combine belleville springs it is able to produce variation of the characteristic force deflection curve over a wide range physically the dva with negative stiffness essentially consists of an indirect approach to increase the inertia effect of the mass owing to the negative value of added stiffness resulting in a spring force in phase with the inertia force many researchers have conducted study on a single dof isolation system with negative stiffness peng et al 2015 shen et al 2017 chronopoulos et al 2015 they have investigated the mechanism and the effect of adding negative stiffness in the dva however they do not consider a dva with negative stiffness which functions in a complex isolation system such as a marine shafting system this study is devoted to investigating the beneficial result of a dva with negative stiffness in suppressing the longitudinal vibration transmission along a marine shafting system the paper is organized as follows the prototype of a proposed dva with negative stiffness is given and the stiffness model is established in section 2 the theoretical dynamic model of the shafting system with and without the proposed dva is set up in section 3 numerical simulations and discussions are given in section 4 and then concluding remarks are given at last 2 configuration and dynamic modeling of the dva with negative stiffness the schematic of the configuration of a dva with negative stiffness in a marine shafting system is shown in fig 1 the proposed dva is in parallel with the thrust pads it consists of an elastomer pad a steel mass and belleville springs the elastomer pad is the flexible element the steel mass acts as mass and the belleville springs provide negative stiffness when they are compressed under the propeller static thrust the series stiffness of the elastomer pad and the belleville springs and the oil film stiffness of the thrust bearing are combined in parallel to support the propeller static thrust and transmit the fluctuating thrust the elastomer pad will not rotate with the rotating thrust disk firstly the stiffness model of the elastomer pad is established the one dimensional quasi static stiffness of the elastomer rubber pad is szefi 2003 1 k e e e a e h e where e e is the young s modulus a e is the cross sectional area and

worth mentioning that the static stiffness and dynamic stiffness of the belleville springs are different the former may be positive while the latter will exhibit negative stiffness after buckling for

static thrust is applied to the belleville springs and the belleville springs work at a point after buckling which exhibits negative stiffness behavior 3 dynamic model 3 1 equivalent dynamic model of the propeller the modes of the propeller in the low frequency range are determined by the blades and the hub can be viewed as a rigid body these modes can be solved in ansys virtual lab or abaqus by coupled fem bem finite element method boundary element method or fem fem models the equivalent dynamic model of the propeller is shown in fig 2 the propeller is modeled as a mass m 2 spring k 2 in series with a cantilever beam representing the blade and a mass m 1 representing the hub the mass m 2 and the spring k 2 accounts for the first anti resonance of the propeller the beam is with uniform cross section with property depicted by ρ b e b i b a b l b which are the density elastic modulus cross sectional moment of inertia cross sectional area and the length respectively the propeller force acts at the cross point of the spring and the beam including a static thrust f 0 and a fluctuating force f it is assumed that the beam does not transmit moments and only transmits a force the beam can be represented by m beq and k beq for simplicity k beq is solved by applying a unit force at one end and obtaining the resulting deformation δ in the cantilever end 12 m b e q ρ b a b l b k b e q 3 e

the propeller resonances and the resonances of the shafting system the equivalent dynamic model of the propeller is accurate to simulate the first two in phase blade modes of the propeller 3 2 dynamic

i e structural damping is assumed and the stiffness has the form as k 2 1 i η 2 k s 1 i η s the force transmitted to the foundation by the thrust bearing is k e x u l t f n x the equilibrium equation of the system under the propeller static thrust is employed to obtain the equilibrium point and the static deformation of the belleville springs which determines the static and dynamic stiffness of the belleville springs since the static deformation of the propeller beam and the shaft rod will keep unchanged for both static and dynamic stiffness the effects of the static deformation caused by f 0 on the propeller beam and the shaft rod are neglected in deriving eqs 22 27 because the propeller beam the shaft rod and the thrust bearing are in series they will deform separately the deformation of the propeller beam and the shaft rod will not influence the deformation of the thrust bearing the initial static deformation of the belleville spring under static thrust f 0 is 28 k s k e k n s x 0

when k ns is unknown which assumes that the static stiffness k ns and dynamic stiffness k n are the same then the dynamic stiffness k n x 0 is computed at the initial static deformation point x 0 3 3 static and dynamic stability analysis both the nonlinear static stiffness k ns and nonlinear dynamic stiffness k n in the concerned deformation range may become negative around the static deformation point thus the stability analysis is concerned with both the static stiffness k ns and dynamic stiffness k n of negative stiffness which may endanger the static and dynamic stability of the shafting system due to temperature variation nonlinear behavior an increase of the critical static stiffness and dynamic stiffness by a factor 1 1 ε will lead to a new value of k ns and k n with some stability

to suppress the first longitudinal mode of the shafting system with resonance denoted as f 0 modal analysis is carried out for the dynamic system described by eqs 22 27 to obtain the modes this is done in matlab by employing the root searching method through two steps i e firstly calculating the determinant of eqs 22 27 at each frequency point and then finding the root for this determinant with the bisection method in the frequency domain the modal mass and modal stiffness are denoted as m mod and k mod for the target mode respectively for the traditional dva the optimal stiffness and the optimal damping ratio without considering the contributions of other modes are respectively denoted as krenk 2014 31 k e o p t m 2 π f 0 2 1 μ r ζ r o p t μ r 2 1 μ r where μ r m m mod an optimal design scheme of the dva with negative stiffness is given based on this specific mode without considering the contribution of other modes however it is not necessarily the best one when the contributions of other modes are taken into consideration the expressions are expressed as follows the detailed derivation is given in the appendix 32 μ r m m m o d n r k e k m o d p r k n k m o d ζ r

40 p 16 μ 1 2 in eq 34 the subscript r is neglected for p r and μ r for simplicity 4 numerical simulation and discussion 4 1 validation of the equivalent dynamic model a specific shafting system is employed to validate the equivalent dynamic model and investigate the influence of dva with negative stiffness on longitudinal vibration transmission control the parameters for the propeller and shaft are listed in table 1 the total mass of the propeller includes the mass wof a propeller and an added mass coefficient of 1 3 to account for the surrounding water macpherson et al 2007 the dynamic model of a real propeller is developed in ansys static analysis is carried out to obtain the displacement of the blade tip under the unit propeller static force in the longitudinal direction and the resulting displacement is 0 398 10 6 m modal analysis is performed to obtain the modes of the propeller then m 2 k 2 m beq k beq and m 1 are obtained according to eqs 12 and 13 and listed in table 2 the total mass of the system is the summation of the propeller and the shaft which is 6178 2 kg the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing without the dva is calculated by ansys and that by the proposed dynamic model is also obtained which are given in fig 4 it is seen that the results obtained by the two methods agree very well the four peaks correspond to the first longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the first in phase blade mode of the propeller the second in phase blade mode of the propeller and the second longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system which are 26 3 hz 51 6 hz 119 7 hz and 133 2 hz respectively an anti resonance of 111 7 hz occurs between the first in phase blade mode and the second in phase blade mode of the propeller for developing the shafting system model in ansys a damping coefficient of 1000 ns m is added for the bearing stiffness material damping η 0 02 is adopted 4 2 stiffness characteristics of the belleville spring a typical realization of belleville spring negative stiffness is given based on eqs 3 5 the parameters for one belleville spring are t s 0 18 mm h s 1 52 mm d s 5 mm d s 3 2 mm e s 2 06 1011 n m2 the assembly consists of a total of 20 belleville springs which consists of 10 pairs of belleville springs arranged in parallel and each pair is composed of 2 belleville springs in series the force displacement and stiffness displacement relations are shown in fig 5 degressive force deflection characteristics are observed in which the spring force diminishes in certain ranges with increasing spring deflection it is shown that the deformation range for negative stiffness is between about 0 2782 mm and 0 9819 mm for this assembly corresponding to a negative stiffness range between 4 896 106 n m and 2 172 107 n m although the static stiffness k ns is larger than the dynamic stiffness k n for most of the deformation range it may become smaller than zero in a deformation range and it can be also smaller than the dynamic stiffness k n in a limited deformation range it is shown by eq 30 that if k ns is larger than zero the overall static stiffness is larger than the oil film stiffness k s in addition the static deformation x 0 under different propeller static thrust is kept smaller than that of the system without the dva if k ns is smaller than zero and larger than k e the overall static stiffness is smaller than k s in addition the static deformation x 0 under different propeller static thrust will be much larger than that of the system without the dva for this case the variation deformation range to obtain a negative stiffness k n is much broader and more difficult to obtain in the design phase the configuration of belleville springs is still unknown and the relative value of k ns and k n are also still unknown a more conservative approach for the design is adopted by employing k n to calculate the static deformation in the following simulations 4 3 optimal design without with constraint on static deformation under propeller static thrust suppose the static propeller force is f 0 48000 n which corresponds to a rotation speed of 70 rpm the dva is employed to suppress the first longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system at f 0 26 3 hz the modal mass and modal stiffness for this mode are m mod 6027 67 kg and k mod 1 646 108 n m respectively for the traditional dva for a given μ r m m mod 0 02 the optimal parameters are m 120 55 kg k eopt 3 2273 106 n m ζ ropt 0 099 a frequency deviation δf is assumed to study the robustness of the proposed dva the parameters of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system remain unchanged and the parameters for the dva are tuned in a way by adding δf to f 0 thus the absorber frequency is f 0 δf instead of directly aimed at f 0 as demonstrated in eq 32 this will result in an influence on the parameters of k e and k n since they are related to k mod which is expressed as k m o d m m o d 2 π f 0 δ f 2 4 3 1 1 maximum negative stiffness the parameters of the dva with negative stiffness are calculated according to eqs 33 and 34 for a given p r and μ r p r and μ r represent the stiffness ratio of the negative stiffness to the modal stiffness and the mass ratio of the absorber to the modal mass respectively larger p r means a larger negative stiffness and larger μ r means a larger absorber mass for each p r k n has a maximum negative stiffness to satisfy eq 30 however since k e is also related to p r as denoted by the expression of n r there is not a direct expression for k n since k n is dependent on p r therefore equation 30 is checked for a given p r and μ r and the maximum p r is obtained when eq 30 reaches its critical value it is shown that under the given parameters the maximum negative stiffness is k n 1 679 107 n m k eopt 1 779 107 n m for μ r 0 003 m 18 08 kg δf 0 corresponding the maximum p r 0 1 and the maximum negative stiffness is k n 1 628 107 n m k eopt 1 759 107 n m for μ r 0 003 m 18 08 kg δf 0 01f 0 corresponding the maximum p r 0 097 as a result the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing for the shafting system without a dva with a traditional dva with the proposed dva δf 0 and δf 0 01f 0 is shown in fig 6 it is shown that the curves for the dva with negative stiffness with without frequency deviation δf exhibit the largest suppression at f 0 for a mass ratio of only μ r 0 003 showing enormous potential in controlling vibration transmission for the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the force transmissibility for the curve with frequency deviation δf 0 01f 0 is slightly larger than that without frequency deviation however for the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the static deformation under propeller static thrust f 0 is of concern and it also influences the negative stiffness of the belleville spring the belleville spring should provide a stable static stiffness over a relatively large deformation range which satisfy eq 30 if there is no dva or with the traditional dva the static deformation by the static propeller force is 0 2182 mm if the dva with negative stiffness is designed at the optimal point the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 504 93 mm and 597 24 mm for δf 0 and δf 0 01f 0 respectively the static deformation is too large and will influence the stability of the shafting system it is worth mentioning that the static deformation is calculated by employing k n which is very conservative 4 3 2 2 static deformation to maintain the same static deformation as that using the traditional dva firstly a set of parameters are designed by setting μ r 0 003 and adjusting p r to satisfy the same static deformation the result is p r 0 0067 ζ ropt 0 069 k n 1 1028 106n m k eopt 1 5925 106 n m the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 7 it is seen that the maximum transmissibility of the dva with negative stiffness around the modal frequency f 0 is lower than that of the traditional dva therefore for the dva with negative stiffness to maintain the same static deformation the mass ratio is μ r 0 003 and the damping ratio is ζ ropt 0 069 compared to μ r 0 02 and ζ ropt 0 099 for the traditional dva in other words the mass and damping costs are lowered while the suppression effect is superior to that of the traditional dva usually the static deformation can be slightly increased which will not influence the stability of the shafting system 4 4 parametric study for optimal design 4 4 1 1 parametric study on p r a parametric study is carried out on p r 0 03 0 05 0 07 for a given μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm 0 43332 mm and 0 8510 mm respectively ζ ropt 0 1266 0 1548 0 1696 respectively k eopt 5 4826 106 n m 8 8998 106 n m and 1 2394 107 n m respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 8 it is seen that the transmissibility is dependent on p r the transmissibility at resonance is further suppressed as the absolute value of p r becomes larger the optimal damping can be realized using viscoelastic material for these cases 4 4 2 2 parametric study on μ r a parametric study is carried out on μ r 0 003 0 006 0 009 for a given p r 0 07 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 8510 mm 0 4490 mm and 0 3637 mm respectively ζ ropt 0 1696 0 1856 0 1931 respectively k eopt 1 2394 107 n m 1 2828 107 n m and 1 3256 107 n m respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 9 it is seen that the transmissibility is slightly dependent on μ r it is not necessary to obtain a superior suppression effect for a larger μ r which is not in accordance with the rules for a traditional dva in other words for the current combination of these parameters the influence of negative stiffness is more significant than the influence of the mass 4 4 3 3 parametric study on ζ r since the optimal damping ζ r for p r 0 07 is relatively large p r 0 03 is adopted in the following numerical simulations a parametric analysis is carried out on ζ r 0 0 1ζ ropt ζ ropt ζ ropt 0 1266 under p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm k eopt 5 4826 106 n m for the three cases the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 10 it is seen that the transmissibility is affected greatly by the damping if there is no damping the suppression effect of the proposed dva with negative stiffness is not superior to that of the traditional dva with small damping the performance of the proposed dva with negative stiffness can compare favorably with that of the traditional dva the optimal damping can suppress two peaks the damping ratio is also a key factor in controlling the force transmission 4 4 4 4 parametric study on δf a parametric analysis is carried out for δf 0 0 01f 0 0 1f 0 using the optimal parameters p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 ζ r 0 1266 the static deformation under the static propeller force is 0 2818 mm 0 2835 mm and 0 3002 mm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 11 it is seen that the transmissibility is not significantly affected by the frequency deviation which suggests that the dva with negative stiffness is robust and can provide suppression over a broad absorber frequency range 4 4 5 5 comparison between k mod and k s since the modal stiffness k mod is slightly smaller than the longitudinal stiffness of the thrust bearing k s optimal design by using k s instead of k mod in eq 32 is carried out for p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm 0 2835 mm and 0 3002 mm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 12 it is seen that optimal design by employing k s is superior in vibration transmission suppression however the static deformation is slightly increased from 0 2818 mm to 0 3125 mm this can be explained by the fact that the contribution by other modes in a mdof system will change the optimal parameters krenk 2014 the reason for this is that the motion of the point of attachment of the dva to the system has not only a contribution from the targeted mode but also a background contribution from other non resonant modes and the force provided by the dva is distributed between the targeted mode and the background modes 4 5 design of belleville springs to control vibration transmission under different rotation speeds the influence of operation conditions with different rotation speeds is investigated different rotation speeds will result in different propeller static thrust and fluctuating thrust as well as different oil film stiffness k s the propeller static thrust is approximately proportional to the square of the rotation speed and influences the initial static deformation point of the belleville springs the propeller fluctuating thrust will influence the static deformation as well as the dynamic response amplitude around the initial static deformation point since the fluctuating thrust is about 0 3 1 of the propeller static thrust its influence is neglected in calculating the initial static deformation point a unit force is considered to obtain the force transmission the oil film stiffness of the thrust bearing is dependent on the rotation speed and can be solved by hydrodynamic lubrication theory the influence of the rotation speed is demonstrated by a fictitious assembly of belleville springs to make it simple k n is assumed unchanged 4 9376 106 n m while k s is 2 2 108 n m 4 49 108 n m 8 8 108 n m for the rotation speeds of 70 rpm 110 rpm and 140 rpm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 13 it is seen that the suppression effect is decreasing with increasing rotation speed this is due to the following facts the optimal parameters for the proposed dva with negative stiffness are obtained under a particular operation condition of 70 rpm and assumed unchanged for other operation conditions however the propeller static thrust and the oil film stiffness have changed resulting in a changed working point and the resonance frequency i e m k e and ζ r are not the optimal parameters for the other rotation speeds therefore the optimal static stiffness and dynamic stiffness of the negative stiffness should consider the influence of different rotation speeds the hardware to achieve the desired static stiffness and dynamic stiffness which is a function of deformation should be developed accordingly a design scheme for the negative stiffness is proposed as follows the oil film stiffness and the propeller static thrust varies for different rotation speeds resulting in different absorber frequency and static deformation for the belleville spring negative stiffness to achieve a pronounced dynamic absorbing effect an optimal dynamic negative stiffness should be prescribed as a function of the static deformation at the same time the static stiffness for the belleville spring negative stiffness should satisfy the stability condition the optimal parameters are usually developed for a particular design condition usually rated condition to achieve an initial assembly of belleville spring combination the optimal parameters are obtained by employing eqs 32 34 through an iteration solution process the static deformation x 0 is calculated under the propeller static thrust f 0 according to eqs 28 and 29 with an initial static stiffness k ns and stiffness k e the static stiffness k ns x 0 and dynamic stiffness at this deformation k n x 0 is employed to obtain the optimal stiffness k e x 0 according to eqs 32 34 this stiffness k e x 0 together with k ns x 0 is employed as an initial value to get the static deformation x 1 the process is repeated until the two adjacent static stiffness satisfies the inequation k n s x i k n s x i 1 0 001 k n s x i the obtained values for k n s x i and k n x i are employed to calculate the static deformation and the other parameters if the initial assembly of the sophisticated belleville springs cannot satisfy the stiffness requirements it should be revised by an iterative design the dynamic stiffness k n is tuned for different oil film stiffness under different rotation speeds the static stiffness k ns is obtained by applying the corresponding propeller static thrust from the hardware part it is usually not sufficient for an ordinary belleville spring to fulfill the tasks over a wide range of operation conditions a more sophisticated belleville spring should be developed and analyzed to verify that whether the static and dynamic stiffness meets the requirement or not such as slotted belleville springs of which the slotting process changes the force deflection range of the ordinary belleville springs if a belleville spring is designed the force displacement relationship can be obtained by employing ansys or conducting experiments to validate the design one should consider the stiffness of the belleville spring as a function of displacement 5 conclusions a dva with negative stiffness is proposed to suppress the longitudinal vibration transmission along the marine shafting system dynamic modeling of the shafting system with and without the proposed dva is performed by employing the equivalent dynamic model of the propeller which can be used to examine the low frequency behavior of the propulsion shafting system in the longitudinal direction a realization of the optimal parameters of the dva with negative stiffness for controlling the vibration transmission at the first longitudinal mode of the shafting system is given numerical simulation demonstrates that the mass and damping values of the dva with negative stiffness is much lower while the suppression effect is superior to the traditional dva the optimal damping can suppress two peaks for the traditional dva the dva with negative stiffness is very robust for suppressing the vibration transmission even if the deviation of the target absorber frequency is up to 10 it is also shown that the dva with negative stiffness always exhibits better performance than a traditional dva with a larger mass instead of increasing the mass the vibration suppression capability of the dva with negative stiffness can be increased by increasing the value of the negative stiffness element an assembly in which belleville springs are arranged in series and in parallel is employed to demonstrate the nonlinear static stiffness and dynamic stiffness characteristics the inherent differences between the nonlinear static stiffness and dynamic stiffness should be considered it is shown that the proposed dva composed of belleville spring negative stiffness is capable of suppressing longitudinal vibration transmission under different operation conditions design of sophisticated belleville spring is crucial for obtaining a robust control device over a broad rotation speeds acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the

23489,a dynamic vibration absorber dva with negative stiffness is proposed to suppress the longitudinal vibration transmission along a marine shafting system stiffness models of the dva with negative stiffness which is composed of a rubber pad and a belleville spring are established an analytical model of the shafting system with and without the proposed dva is set up by employing the equivalent

thrust compared with a traditional dva the proposed dva with negative stiffness achieves enhanced vibration transmission suppression performance for a much broader absorber frequency range around

model vibration transmission suppression 1 introduction due to its impact on marine life abatement of underwater radiated noise by all kinds of vessels has become one of the most difficult challenges for the shipbuilding industry borelli et al 2015 in addition the underwater radiated noise will undermine its stealth for military ships and vessels yankaskas and slotwinski 1995 hence the shipbuilding industry seeks to offer new solutions to comply with the new guidelines and requirements cinquemani and braghin 2017 zhang et al dylejko et al 2007 dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 merz et al 2010 there are many sources of noise within a ship structure among these are the propulsion systems exhaust stacks and various on board equipment in the low frequency range one of the principal noise sources is the propeller the propeller contributes to acoustic radiation via three ways i e as an acoustic source that directly produces sound radiation as an excitation source that excites the hull through the propulsion shaft and the fluid as an excitation source behaving like a dipole that radiates sound in very low frequency range among them the biggest contributor is that the propeller force excites the hull through the shafting system usually the transmission paths are classified as a longitudinal path and transverse path according to the excitation and vibration transmission directions warikoo and haddara 1992 it is shown that vibration energy transmitted along the longitudinal direction is dominant chen et al 2017 the propeller rotates in the unsteady non uniform fluctuating wake field and results in blade passing frequency bpf and its harmonics as well as broadband random spectrum therefore the propeller force will excite the hull propeller and shaft resonances leading to broadband noise this paper will focus on the control of the first longitudinal resonance of the shafting system under excitation by a longitudinal propeller force vibration control along the transmission path is effective both passive and active vibration attenuation measures have been developed where the most publicly available studies have focused on reducing the axial component of vibration control can be performed along the shaft in the bearings as well as on the foundation of the thrust bearing or on the bulkheads some of these measures are listed as follows the resonance changer rc zhang et al dylejko et al 2007 dylejko and kessissoglou 2004 merz et al 2009 2010 chu et al 2016 periodically layered isolators song et al 2014 magnetorheological elastomers yang et al 2014 dynamic anti resonant vibration isolator liu et al 2017 passive isolation measures zhang et al 2012 active vibration control device applied to the propeller shafting system caresta and kessissoglou 2011a 2012 active noise and vibration control applied to the submarine hull merz et al 2013 and design modifications to the propeller shafting system attachment to the hull caresta and kessissoglou 2011b among them the dynamic vibration absorber dva is very popular since it does not have to be inserted in the transmission path of the propeller shafting system and it has little effect on the dynamic behavior of the propeller a dva can be tuned to suppress vibrations of one mode of a vibrating structure even if the structure is a multi degrees of freedom mdof structure or a continuous structure although mathematical modelling of vibration transmission through a marine propulsion shafting system has been undertaken in the past to perform vibration control analysis a simple dynamic model should be initially developed however the aforementioned research usually employs a simplified model with the propeller and shafting system denoted as masses springs and beams as a simple approximation of a real propeller shafting system further the propeller is excessively simplified to be an equivalent rigid mass for some models this simplification ignores the propeller flexure and the resulting blade resonances it is shown that the rigid propeller model significantly under predicts the transmitted force to the thrust bearing to account for the propeller flexibility the propeller blades are further represented by a continuous beam based on euler bernoulli beam theory or a mass spring model youssef et al 2015 li et al 2016a this simplification can only describe the first resonance of the propeller and cannot simulate the anti resonance of the propeller therefore a more detailed dynamic model in the low frequency range which can be employed to perform vibration control and predict the dynamic behavior of the propulsion shafting system as accurate as a finite element model is still needed in practice since the longitudinal stiffness of the thrust bearing is dependent on the rotation speed and variable for different rotation speeds a wide absorber frequency range is desired in developing the dva to make sure that the dva is able to cover the variation range of resonance passive control measures are usually inferior active and semi active control measures are able to realize the variable stiffness in a broad frequency range yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 caresta and kessissoglou 2011a 2012 merz et al 2013 in addition it is of great importance to reduce the requirements for heavy oscillating masses in dvas for marine applications many attempts have been reported such as the inerter and the kdamper the inerter is a two terminal element which has the property that the force generated at its ends is proportional to the relative acceleration of its terminals smith 2002 the essential limitation of the inerter is the complex and elaborate mechanical design configurations needed for its implementation the kdamper is a dva incorporating a negative stiffness element antoniadis et al sapountzakis et al 2017 chronopoulos et al 2017 li et al 2016b yan and wu 2017 antoniadis et al 2015 generally speaking negative stiffness is easy to implement and can be achieved by many forms such as post buckled beams plates shells platus 1999 pre compressed springs arranged in appropriate geometrical configurations a belleville spring carrella et al 2009 huang et al 2014 and other forms of physical forces such as magnetic or electromagnetic wu et al 2014 zhou and liu 2010 compared to other types of springs a belleville spring can be categorized as having a small deflection coupled with high spring force arranging the belleville spring in parallel or nested formation multiplies the spring force alternating or series arrangement multiplies the spring deflection by employing these stacking methods to combine belleville springs it is able to produce variation of the characteristic force deflection curve over a wide range physically the dva with negative stiffness essentially consists of an indirect approach to increase the inertia effect of the mass owing to the negative value of added stiffness resulting in a spring force in phase with the inertia force many researchers have conducted study on a single dof isolation system with negative stiffness peng et al 2015 shen et al 2017 chronopoulos et al 2015 they have investigated the mechanism and the effect of adding negative stiffness in the dva however they do not consider a dva with negative stiffness which functions in a complex isolation system such as a marine shafting system this study is devoted to investigating the beneficial result of a dva with negative stiffness in suppressing the longitudinal vibration transmission along a marine shafting system the paper is organized as follows the prototype of a proposed dva with negative stiffness is given and the stiffness model is established in section 2 the theoretical dynamic model of the shafting system with and without the proposed dva is set up in section 3 numerical simulations and discussions are given in section 4 and then concluding remarks are given at last 2 configuration and dynamic modeling of the dva with negative stiffness the schematic of the configuration of a dva with negative stiffness in a marine shafting system is shown in fig 1 the proposed dva is in parallel with the thrust pads it consists of an elastomer pad a steel mass and belleville springs the elastomer pad is the flexible element the steel mass acts as mass and the belleville springs provide negative stiffness when they are compressed under the propeller static thrust the series stiffness of the elastomer pad and the belleville springs and the oil film stiffness of the thrust bearing are combined in parallel to support the propeller static thrust and transmit the fluctuating thrust the elastomer pad will not rotate with the rotating thrust disk firstly the stiffness model of the elastomer pad is established the one dimensional quasi static stiffness of the elastomer rubber pad is szefi 2003 1 k e e e a e h e where e e is the young s modulus a e is the cross sectional area and

of the system under the propeller static thrust is employed to obtain the equilibrium point and the static deformation of the belleville springs which determines the static and dynamic stiffness of the belleville springs since the static deformation of the propeller beam and the shaft rod will keep unchanged for both static and dynamic stiffness the effects of the static deformation caused by f 0 on the propeller beam and the shaft rod are neglected in deriving eqs 22 27 because the propeller beam the shaft rod and the thrust bearing are in series they will deform separately the deformation

static and dynamic stability analysis both the nonlinear static stiffness k ns and nonlinear dynamic stiffness k n in the concerned deformation range may become negative around the static deformation point thus the stability analysis is concerned with both the static stiffness k ns and dynamic stiffness k n of negative stiffness which may endanger the static and dynamic stability of the shafting system due to temperature variation nonlinear behavior an increase of the critical static stiffness and dynamic stiffness by a factor 1 1 ε will lead to a new value of k ns and k n with some stability

to suppress the first longitudinal mode of the shafting system with resonance denoted as f 0 modal analysis is carried out for the dynamic system described by eqs 22 27 to obtain the modes this is done in matlab by employing the root searching method through two steps i e firstly calculating the determinant of eqs 22 27 at each frequency point and then finding the root for this determinant with the bisection method in the frequency domain the modal mass and modal stiffness are denoted as m mod and k mod for the target mode respectively for the traditional dva the optimal stiffness and the optimal damping ratio without considering the contributions of other modes are respectively denoted as krenk 2014 31 k e o p t m 2 π f 0 2 1 μ r ζ r o p t μ r 2 1 μ r where μ r m m mod an optimal design scheme of the dva with negative stiffness is given based on this specific mode without considering the contribution of other modes however it is not necessarily the best one when the contributions of other modes are taken into consideration the expressions are expressed as follows the detailed derivation is given in the appendix 32 μ r m m m o d n r k e k m o d p r k n k m o d ζ r

40 p 16 μ 1 2 in eq 34 the subscript r is neglected for p r and μ r for simplicity 4 numerical simulation and discussion 4 1 validation of the equivalent dynamic model a specific shafting system is employed to validate the equivalent dynamic model and investigate the influence of dva with negative stiffness on longitudinal vibration transmission control the parameters for the propeller and shaft are listed in table 1 the total mass of the propeller includes the mass wof a propeller and an added mass coefficient of 1 3 to account for the surrounding water macpherson et al 2007 the dynamic model of a real propeller is developed in ansys static analysis is carried out to obtain the displacement of the blade tip under the unit propeller static force in the longitudinal direction and the resulting displacement is 0 398 10 6 m modal analysis is performed to obtain the modes of the propeller then m 2 k 2 m beq k beq and m 1 are obtained according to eqs 12 and 13 and listed in table 2 the total mass of the system is the summation of the propeller and the shaft which is 6178 2 kg the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing without the dva is calculated by ansys and that by the proposed dynamic model is also obtained which are given in fig 4 it is seen that the results obtained by the two methods agree very well the four peaks correspond to the first longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the first in phase blade mode of the propeller the second in phase blade mode of the propeller and the second longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system which are 26 3 hz 51 6 hz 119 7 hz and 133 2 hz respectively an anti resonance of 111 7 hz occurs between the first in phase blade mode and the second in phase blade mode of the propeller for developing the shafting system model in ansys a damping coefficient of 1000 ns m is added for the bearing stiffness material damping η 0 02 is adopted 4 2 stiffness characteristics of the belleville spring a typical realization of belleville spring negative stiffness is given based on eqs 3 5 the parameters for one belleville spring are t s 0 18 mm h s 1 52 mm d s 5 mm d s 3 2 mm e s 2 06 1011 n m2 the assembly consists of a total of 20 belleville springs which consists of 10 pairs of belleville springs arranged in parallel and each pair is composed of 2 belleville springs in series the force displacement and stiffness displacement relations are shown in fig 5 degressive force deflection characteristics are observed in which the spring force diminishes in certain ranges with increasing spring deflection it is shown that the deformation range for negative stiffness is between about 0 2782 mm and 0 9819 mm for this assembly corresponding to a negative stiffness range between 4 896 106 n m and 2 172 107 n m although the static stiffness k ns is larger than the dynamic stiffness k n for most of the deformation range it may become smaller than zero in a deformation range and it can be also smaller than the dynamic stiffness k n in a limited deformation range it is shown by eq 30 that if k ns is larger than zero the overall static stiffness is larger than the oil film stiffness k s in addition the static deformation x 0 under different propeller static thrust is kept smaller than that of the system without the dva if k ns is smaller than zero and larger than k e the overall static stiffness is smaller than k s in addition the static deformation x 0 under different propeller static thrust will be much larger than that of the system without the dva for this case the variation deformation range to obtain a negative stiffness k n is much broader and more difficult to obtain in the design phase the configuration of belleville springs is still unknown and the relative value of k ns and k n are also still unknown a more conservative approach for the design is adopted by employing k n to calculate the static deformation in the following simulations 4 3 optimal design without with constraint on static deformation under propeller static thrust suppose the static propeller force is f 0 48000 n which corresponds to a rotation speed of 70 rpm the dva is employed to suppress the first longitudinal mode of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system at f 0 26 3 hz the modal mass and modal stiffness for this mode are m mod 6027 67 kg and k mod 1 646 108 n m respectively for the traditional dva for a given μ r m m mod 0 02 the optimal parameters are m 120 55 kg k eopt 3 2273 106 n m ζ ropt 0 099 a frequency deviation δf is assumed to study the robustness of the proposed dva the parameters of the propeller shaft thrust bearing system remain unchanged and the parameters for the dva are tuned in a way by adding δf to f 0 thus the absorber frequency is f 0 δf instead of directly aimed at f 0 as demonstrated in eq 32 this will result in an influence on the parameters of k e and k n since they are related to k mod which is expressed as k m o d m m o d 2 π f 0 δ f 2 4 3 1 1 maximum negative stiffness the parameters of the dva with negative stiffness are calculated according to eqs 33 and 34 for a given p r and μ r p r and μ r represent the stiffness ratio of the negative stiffness to the modal stiffness and the mass ratio of the absorber to the modal mass respectively larger p r means a larger negative stiffness and larger μ r means a larger absorber mass for each p r k n has a maximum negative stiffness to satisfy eq 30 however since k e is also related to p r as denoted by the expression of n r there is not a direct expression for k n since k n is dependent on p r therefore equation 30 is checked for a given p r and μ r and the maximum p r is obtained when eq 30 reaches its critical value it is shown that under the given parameters the maximum negative stiffness is k n 1 679 107 n m k eopt 1 779 107 n m for μ r 0 003 m 18 08 kg δf 0 corresponding the maximum p r 0 1 and the maximum negative stiffness is k n 1 628 107 n m k eopt 1 759 107 n m for μ r 0 003 m 18 08 kg δf 0 01f 0 corresponding the maximum p r 0 097 as a result the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing for the shafting system without a dva with a traditional dva with the proposed dva δf 0 and δf 0 01f 0 is shown in fig 6 it is shown that the curves for the dva with negative stiffness with without frequency deviation δf exhibit the largest suppression at f 0 for a mass ratio of only μ r 0 003 showing enormous potential in controlling vibration transmission for the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the force transmissibility for the curve with frequency deviation δf 0 01f 0 is slightly larger than that without frequency deviation however for the propeller shaft thrust bearing system the static deformation under propeller static thrust f 0 is of concern and it also influences the negative stiffness of the belleville spring the belleville spring should provide a stable static stiffness over a relatively large deformation range which satisfy eq 30 if there is no dva or with the traditional dva the static deformation by the static propeller force is 0 2182 mm if the dva with negative stiffness is designed at the optimal point the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 504 93 mm and 597 24 mm for δf 0 and δf 0 01f 0 respectively the static deformation is too large and will influence the stability of the shafting system it is worth mentioning that the static deformation is calculated by employing k n which is very conservative 4 3 2 2 static deformation to maintain the same static deformation as that using the traditional dva firstly a set of parameters are designed by setting μ r 0 003 and adjusting p r to satisfy the same static deformation the result is p r 0 0067 ζ ropt 0 069 k n 1 1028 106n m k eopt 1 5925 106 n m the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 7 it is seen that the maximum transmissibility of the dva with negative stiffness around the modal frequency f 0 is lower than that of the traditional dva therefore for the dva with negative stiffness to maintain the same static deformation the mass ratio is μ r 0 003 and the damping ratio is ζ ropt 0 069 compared to μ r 0 02 and ζ ropt 0 099 for the traditional dva in other words the mass and damping costs are lowered while the suppression effect is superior to that of the traditional dva usually the static deformation can be slightly increased which will not influence the stability of the shafting system 4 4 parametric study for optimal design 4 4 1 1 parametric study on p r a parametric study is carried out on p r 0 03 0 05 0 07 for a given μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm 0 43332 mm and 0 8510 mm respectively ζ ropt 0 1266 0 1548 0 1696 respectively k eopt 5 4826 106 n m 8 8998 106 n m and 1 2394 107 n m respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 8 it is seen that the transmissibility is dependent on p r the transmissibility at resonance is further suppressed as the absolute value of p r becomes larger the optimal damping can be realized using viscoelastic material for these cases 4 4 2 2 parametric study on μ r a parametric study is carried out on μ r 0 003 0 006 0 009 for a given p r 0 07 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 8510 mm 0 4490 mm and 0 3637 mm respectively ζ ropt 0 1696 0 1856 0 1931 respectively k eopt 1 2394 107 n m 1 2828 107 n m and 1 3256 107 n m respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 9 it is seen that the transmissibility is slightly dependent on μ r it is not necessary to obtain a superior suppression effect for a larger μ r which is not in accordance with the rules for a traditional dva in other words for the current combination of these parameters the influence of negative stiffness is more significant than the influence of the mass 4 4 3 3 parametric study on ζ r since the optimal damping ζ r for p r 0 07 is relatively large p r 0 03 is adopted in the following numerical simulations a parametric analysis is carried out on ζ r 0 0 1ζ ropt ζ ropt ζ ropt 0 1266 under p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm k eopt 5 4826 106 n m for the three cases the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 10 it is seen that the transmissibility is affected greatly by the damping if there is no damping the suppression effect of the proposed dva with negative stiffness is not superior to that of the traditional dva with small damping the performance of the proposed dva with negative stiffness can compare favorably with that of the traditional dva the optimal damping can suppress two peaks the damping ratio is also a key factor in controlling the force transmission 4 4 4 4 parametric study on δf a parametric analysis is carried out for δf 0 0 01f 0 0 1f 0 using the optimal parameters p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 ζ r 0 1266 the static deformation under the static propeller force is 0 2818 mm 0 2835 mm and 0 3002 mm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 11 it is seen that the transmissibility is not significantly affected by the frequency deviation which suggests that the dva with negative stiffness is robust and can provide suppression over a broad absorber frequency range 4 4 5 5 comparison between k mod and k s since the modal stiffness k mod is slightly smaller than the longitudinal stiffness of the thrust bearing k s optimal design by using k s instead of k mod in eq 32 is carried out for p r 0 03 μ r 0 003 the static deformation under the propeller static thrust is 0 2818 mm 0 2835 mm and 0 3002 mm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 12 it is seen that optimal design by employing k s is superior in vibration transmission suppression however the static deformation is slightly increased from 0 2818 mm to 0 3125 mm this can be explained by the fact that the contribution by other modes in a mdof system will change the optimal parameters krenk 2014 the reason for this is that the motion of the point of attachment of the dva to the system has not only a contribution from the targeted mode but also a background contribution from other non resonant modes and the force provided by the dva is distributed between the targeted mode and the background modes 4 5 design of belleville springs to control vibration transmission under different rotation speeds the influence of operation conditions with different rotation speeds is investigated different rotation speeds will result in different propeller static thrust and fluctuating thrust as well as different oil film stiffness k s the propeller static thrust is approximately proportional to the square of the rotation speed and influences the initial static deformation point of the belleville springs the propeller fluctuating thrust will influence the static deformation as well as the dynamic response amplitude around the initial static deformation point since the fluctuating thrust is about 0 3 1 of the propeller static thrust its influence is neglected in calculating the initial static deformation point a unit force is considered to obtain the force transmission the oil film stiffness of the thrust bearing is dependent on the rotation speed and can be solved by hydrodynamic lubrication theory the influence of the rotation speed is demonstrated by a fictitious assembly of belleville springs to make it simple k n is assumed unchanged 4 9376 106 n m while k s is 2 2 108 n m 4 49 108 n m 8 8 108 n m for the rotation speeds of 70 rpm 110 rpm and 140 rpm respectively the longitudinal force transmitted by the thrust bearing is shown in fig 13 it is seen that the suppression effect is decreasing with increasing rotation speed this is due to the following facts the optimal parameters for the proposed dva with negative stiffness are obtained under a particular operation condition of 70 rpm and assumed unchanged for other operation conditions however the propeller static thrust and the oil film stiffness have changed resulting in a changed working point and the resonance frequency i e m k e and ζ r are not the optimal parameters for the other rotation speeds therefore the optimal static stiffness and dynamic stiffness of the negative stiffness should consider the influence of different rotation speeds the hardware to achieve the desired static stiffness and dynamic stiffness which is a function of deformation should be developed accordingly a design scheme for the negative stiffness is proposed as follows the oil film stiffness and the propeller static thrust varies for different rotation speeds resulting in different absorber frequency and static deformation for the belleville spring negative stiffness to achieve a pronounced dynamic absorbing effect an optimal dynamic negative stiffness should be prescribed as a function of the static deformation at the same time the static stiffness for the belleville spring negative stiffness should satisfy the stability condition the optimal parameters are usually developed for a particular design condition usually rated condition to achieve an initial assembly of belleville spring combination the optimal parameters are obtained by employing eqs 32 34 through an iteration solution process the static deformation x 0 is calculated under the propeller static thrust f 0 according to eqs 28 and 29 with an initial static stiffness k ns and stiffness k e the static stiffness k ns x 0 and dynamic stiffness at this deformation k n x 0 is employed to obtain the optimal stiffness k e x 0 according to eqs 32 34 this stiffness k e x 0 together with k ns x 0 is employed as an initial value to get the static deformation x 1 the process is repeated until the two adjacent static stiffness satisfies the inequation k n s x i k n s x i 1 0 001 k n s x i the obtained values for k n s x i and k n x i are employed to calculate the static deformation and the other parameters if the initial assembly of the sophisticated belleville springs cannot satisfy the stiffness requirements it should be revised by an iterative design the dynamic stiffness k n is tuned for different oil film stiffness under different rotation speeds the static stiffness k ns is obtained by applying the corresponding propeller static thrust from the hardware part it is usually not sufficient for an ordinary belleville spring to fulfill the tasks over a wide range of operation conditions a more sophisticated belleville spring should be developed and analyzed to verify that whether the static and dynamic stiffness meets the requirement or not such as slotted belleville springs of which the slotting process changes the force deflection range of the ordinary belleville springs if a belleville spring is designed the force displacement relationship can be obtained by employing ansys or conducting experiments to validate the design one should consider the stiffness of the belleville spring as a function of displacement 5 conclusions a dva with negative stiffness is proposed to suppress the longitudinal vibration transmission along the marine shafting system dynamic modeling of the shafting system with and without the proposed dva is performed by employing the equivalent dynamic model of the propeller which can be used to examine the low frequency behavior of the propulsion shafting system in the longitudinal direction a realization of the optimal parameters of the dva with negative stiffness for controlling the vibration transmission at the first longitudinal mode of the shafting system is given numerical simulation demonstrates that the mass and damping values of the dva with negative stiffness is much lower while the suppression effect is superior to the traditional dva the optimal damping can suppress two peaks for the traditional dva the dva with negative stiffness is very robust for suppressing the vibration transmission even if the deviation of the target absorber frequency is up to 10 it is also shown that the dva with negative stiffness always exhibits better performance than a traditional dva with a larger mass instead of increasing the mass the vibration suppression capability of the dva with negative stiffness can be increased by increasing the value of the negative stiffness element an assembly in which belleville springs are arranged in series and in parallel is employed to demonstrate the nonlinear static stiffness and dynamic stiffness characteristics the inherent differences between the nonlinear static stiffness and dynamic stiffness should be considered it is shown that the proposed dva composed of belleville spring negative stiffness is capable of suppressing longitudinal vibration transmission under different operation conditions design of sophisticated belleville spring is crucial for obtaining a robust control device over a broad rotation speeds acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the
