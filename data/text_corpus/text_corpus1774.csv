8870,change in rainfall pattern with longer dry period depletes soil water content swc and incorrect sowing time adversely affects rainfed sorghum production in semi arid tropics sats the present study was conducted to develop agricultural water management strategies for improving swc and to evaluate sowing time as climate change agro adaptations for sorghum production in sats the field experiments on two land water management flatbed broad bed furrows bbf and four nutrient management application of macro and micronutrients through combination of chemical and organic fertilizers were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics india the average swc in bbf was higher over flatbed by 0 90 cm and 1 06 cm in 0 30 cm soil depth 0 67 cm and 1 02 cm in 30 60 cm depth 0 51 cm and 0 84 cm in 60 90 cm depth and 0 34 cm and 0 67 cm in 90 120 cm during 2014 and 2015 respectively the swc in bbf was higher over flatbed by 7 28 throughout 0 120 cm soil depth during longest dry period of 26 days in the year 2014 the simulation analyses using dssat version 4 6 for coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 with rcp 4 5 stated that postponing the normal sowing time 30 june to 10 july resulted in lower grain yield reduction i e 14 75 in 2030 and 19 37 in 2050 as compared to base period 1988 2007 yield with normal sowing in parbhani location of india the bbf combined with macro and micronutrients application through chemical fertilizer and postponing sowing time was found the effective climate change agro adaptation strategies for improving sorghum production in sats this study indicates the need for desired policy orientation by the government to promote integrated land water nutrient management as the effective agro adaptations to climate change in sats keywords broad bed furrows cropping system model nutrient management rainwater use efficiency soil water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for 58 of global food grain production from 80 of the cultivable area kamdi et al 2020 raju et al 2008 and sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is one of the major cereal crops grown mostly under rainfed conditions in semi arid tropics sats due to higher drought tolerance than other cereal crops sorghum is a highly suitable crop for sats ludlow and muchow 1990 and continues to be the main staple food for marginal farmers of developing countries in asia and africa murty et al 2007 however the agricultural water management in rainfed agriculture is facing implications of changes in rainfall pattern such as uncertainty in rainfall parry et al 2004 increase in frequency and duration of droughts alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 and an increase in dryness and wetness rao et al 2013 in the semi arid and dry sub humid zone klaij and vachaud 1992 agarwal 2000 hatibu et al 2003 wani et al 2009 crop production is not only limited by the extent of rainfall but also by extreme variability like intense rainfall few rainy events with poor spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall the adverse meteorological conditions results in long dry spells droughts unseasonal rains and extended moisture stress periods with no mechanisms for storing or conserving the surplus rain to use during the scarcity deficit periods kanwar 1999 the large scale adverse impact on food production and food security will be due to rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns lesk et al 2016 fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change linden et al 2015 stated that most of times the rainfall could occur for short duration with high intensity due to climate change these studies clearly indicate that the change in rainfall pattern and longer dry periods within rainy season are serious agricultural water management issues adversely affecting rainfed crop production through lower soil water content swc in different soil layers and reduced rainwater use efficiency rwue in sats in addition the land water management practices determine the yield of crop cropping systems pathak et al 2013 reported that soils in the sats needs combination of new strategies and more appropriate soil and water management practices this combination will effectively conserve and utilize the soil and water resources in production systems that increase productivity and assure harvest land water management practices include broad bed furrows bbf flatbed ridges and furrows conservation furrow tied ridges open ridges compartmental bunding pit planting for in situ water conservation these land water management practices conserved the moisture in soil and boosted yield contributing parameters and thereby yield of crops cropping systems the previous study conducted by the authors kamdi et al 2020 on land water management practice showed the efficiency of broad bed furrows on changes in swc at the lowest and highest swc up to 90 cm soil depth and increase in water productivity in different cropping systems several efforts have been made to address rainfall associated issues using land water and agronomic management practices such as use of climate resilient cultivars irrigation management and nutrient management practices these management practices were used alone with an objective to increase grain yield in rainfed as well irrigated ecosystems but lesser emphasis was placed on improvement of swc in different soil layers and rwue in addition to field experiments crop modeling is a useful tool to assess the impact of climate change on crop yield and evaluate agro adaptations options in limited time and expenses the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a cropping system model csm used to simulate the growth development and yield of crops csm simulates the effect of climate soil and agronomic management practices on crop growth and yield which reduces the need for carrying out expensive field trials thus helping in the decision making process in climate change adaptations lehmann et al 2013 choruma et al 2019 jones et al 2003 the effect of climate change on diverse crops could be assessed by the use of simulation models challinor et al 2014 akinseye 2020 sannagoudar et al 2020 to evaluate the effect of management options such as sowing dates genotypes used fertilization rates water management etc as the adaptation strategies the studies kothari et al 2020 2020a carried out in the sats were also focused on the use of csm to assess the climate change impacts on sorghum production there is a dearth of studies on the effect of land water management on swc in different soil layers throughout crop growing period and during longest dry periods and rwue in sorghum there is limited or no information available on field based land water and nutrient management and coupling of field experimental data with csm for the decision making process as an adaptation mechanism to rainfall variability in the sat region we hypothesized that the practicing broad bed furrows bbf as improved land water management may store more water in the soil profile and increase the swc which can meet the water requirement of the crop in the dry spell period as compared to the conventional flatbed technique in addition to land water management sowing of the sorghum at the optimum time may reduce the crop vulnerability by avoiding exposure of the critical growth stages to variation in rainfall and temperature in future periods the field experiment on integrated land water and nutrient management combined with a simulation assessment of sorghum yield was the novelty of this comprehensive study to develop agricultural water management and an agro adaptation strategy under future climate scenarios in sats of india in this comprehensive study dssat version 4 6 was used as a csm to simulate the growth development and yield of sorghum the ceres sorghum model was calibrated and validated using present field experimental data and minimum data sets like weather daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation soil soil surface and profile information and experimental data field level input management and crop information several simulation studies rosenzweig et al 1995 mavromatis et al 2002 boomiraj et al 2012 singh et al 2014 were conducted on evaluation of the model using field experimental data for one location and assessing the impact of climate change at a different location rosenzweig et al 1995 clearly indicated performance of model using data from cropping systems currently used in respective countries could be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on cropping systems across similar region mavromatis et al 2002 used cropgro soybean model in dssat and estimated soybean cultivar coefficients for a number of cultivars in georgia to predict the soybean yields in north carolina the simulation results clearly indicated the robustness and ability of the model to predict soybean yield predictions across region boomiraj et al 2012 validated the infocrop sorghum model using data from several field experiments from all india coordinated research trials conducted at various sorghum growing regions in india and future climate change adaptation strategy were developed for across india for similar regions similar crop modeling studies were conducted in chickpea singh et al 2014 in the present study parbhani location used as simulation study location is away from hyderabad field experiment site as per koppen geiger climate classification beck h e et al 2018 parbhani location and hyderabad field experiment site are classified in semi arid zone hence authors chose parbhani location to simulate climate change scenario as an evaluation site though parbhani is away from hyderabad the present study was undertaken with specific objectives to 1 quantify grain yield and rwue of sorghum 2 analyse the effect of bbf against flatbed on changes in swc in different soil layers during longest dry period 3 calibrate and validate ceres sorghum model of dssat v4 6 using present field experiment data and 4 evaluate model for assessing the impact of climate change scenario rcp 4 5 on sorghum grain yield with sowing date as an agro adaptation strategy for parbhani location of maharashtra in india the present study was unique and evaluated two different topics viz field experiment to evaluate changes in swc during longest dry period and simulation study to assess sowing time as an agro adaptation strategy these two different topics related to each other wherein field experimental data on crop management was an input to the ceres sorghum model for calibration and evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were carried out to assess the effect of land water and nutrient management practices on sorghum grain yield changes in swc

sorghum research 2007 for n2 as n p2o5 k2o was 80 40 30 kg ha 1 for n3 in addition to these macronutrients 30 kg ha 1 s 10 kg ha 1 zn and 0 5 kg ha 1 b were recommended as micronutrients for the n4 the dose of vermicompost 1 0 nitrogen and 0 8 phosphorous was based on the nitrogen requirement of sorghum vermicompost was applied to meet the 50 requirement of recommended nitrogen and the rest 50 of nitrogen was supplemented through chemical fertilizer the fertilizers as per treatments were applied before sowing except for n where 50 of n was added as basal and the remaining 50 at 30 days after sowing the fertilizers sources for nutrients were urea for nitrogen dap di ammonium phosphate for phosphorous and nitrogen single super phosphate for phosphorous muriate of potash for potassium gypsum for sulphur zinc sulphate for zinc and agribor for boron the bbf system a 120 cm wide bed with 30 cm wide and 15 cm deep furrows on both sides was made with the help of bullock drawn tropicultor implement during both the years of experimentation the seeding rates were 7 5 kg ha 1 for sorghum cultivar csh16 with a row spacing of 45 cm the experimental field was kept free from weeds throughout the crop growth period and necessary plant protection measures were taken to control insect attack and diseases 2 2 field data collection 2 2 1 above ground biomass sampling and soil moisture monitoring sorghum plant samples for recording above ground biomass were collected at 15 30 45 60 75 days after sowing das and at maturity during both years from each plot representative plants were considered as sample wani et al 1999 the sampled plants were uprooted keeping roots intact cleaned and washed in water to remove surface contamination and separated into roots stems leaves and heads if any thereafter the plant parts were kept in paper packets which in turn were placed in an oven for drying at 80 c till constant weights were obtained dry biomass of leaves stems and roots were noted the sum of the weights of leaf and stem of these plants was used as the total above ground dry biomass production estimation the sorghum crop was grown as rainfed the field experiment with six access tubes were installed up to 120 cm soil depth in each land water management for the nutrient management n3 treatment only to maintain uniformity a calibrated neutron probe 503dr hydroprobe cpn international concord ca was used to monitor swc wani et al 1999 at selected intervals up to 120 cm depth the source of the neutron probe was lowered down to 120 cm soil depth at 15 cm intervals and swc was recorded from eight depths at regular interval the swc values at each 15 cm soil depth were computed into volumetric water content and averaged for the top sub middle and bottom soil layer standard deviation σ and standard error were calculated by the following equations 1 σ x x 2 n 1 2 standarrd error σ number of values in the data set where add up σ standard deviation x individual observations x average n number of observations 2 2 2 grain yield and rainwater use efficiency of sorghum for grain yield estimation the sorghum crop was harvested from an area of 9 0 m2 in each plot

total rainfall mm 2 3 simulation the ceres sorghum of dssat v4 6 was calibrated and validated using present field experimental data this model was used to simulate the grain yield under climate change scenarios in the parbhani location of maharashtra in india which has a semi arid tropical climate the n3 treatment application of macro and micronutrient through chemical fertilizer recommended in this study was evaluated as an adaptation strategy 2 3 1 location characterization climate change scenarios and trend analysis parbhani location of maharashtra in india was selected for simulation of sorghum grain yield fig 1 it is situated at 19 25 n latitude and 76 50 e longitude with 891 mm annual rainfall and the average maximum and minimum temperature are 31 c and 18 c respectively the layer wise physical properties of soil in parbhani location consisted of 14 5 sand 35 5 silt and 50 clay in 0 15 cm soil depth 13 sand 35 silt and 52 clay in 15 22 cm soil depth 15 sand 34 1 silt and 50 9

length found in 0 40 cm soil depth myers r j k 1980 hence 0 30 cm soil depth was considered in this simulation study the soils at icrisat and simulation site parbhani are vertisols with similar properties and soil data included in the dssat model for evaluation authors used climate data of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for 5 no of global circulation models gcms and multi model mean approach was adopted the future climate data was computed for the study area and climate change scenarios were created for the periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 with a representative concentration pathway rcp as rcp 4 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 climate scenario was selected for evaluation of agro adaptation because rcp 4 5 is a stabilized scenario of long term in which total radiative forcing is stabilized at 4 5 w m 2 without overshoot and to be stabilized by the year 2100 owing to improved technologies and reduced greenhouse gas emissions the trend analysis of time series data of the hydrologic variables such as precipitation and temperature consist of determining the magnitude of the trend and its statistical significance dash et al 2009 kumar and jain 2010 subash and sikka 2014 sen s slope estimator determines the magnitude of the trend and the mann kendall test determines the significance of the trend in present study these tests were carried out on time series data of maximum temperature minimum temperature rainfall and solar radiation for the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2020 2040 and 2041 2060 for rcp 4 5 scenarios on annual basis sen s slope estimator sen s slope estimator sen 1968 determines the magnitude of the trend true slope per year to determine the magnitude of the slope of data the slope β of all the data pairs

initiation day anthesis day physiological maturity day time series above ground biomass yield components and grain yield were used for the model calibration and validation genotype parameters of the ceres sorghum model were estimated through calibration and evaluation process the genotype coefficients for the csh16 cultivar of sorghum were calibrated for the recommended macro and micro nutrient management using respective first year experimental data on phenology time series biomass yield components and grain yield the second year experimental data were used for evaluation of the model model performance indicators such as root mean square error normalized rmsen and d index were used for calibration and validation of model performance willmott et al 1985 10 rmse n i 1 n s i ob i 2 n 0 5 ob

is the number of observations in the present study the values of rmse were 0 18 and 0 23 and d index were 0 99 and 0 97 during model calibration and evaluation respectively 2 3 3 sorghum grain yield simulation for climate change scenario sorghum grain yield under climate change scenarios was simulated for parbhani location in semi arid tropics of india using calibrated genotype parameters of the cultivar and existing crop management practices the effect of different sowing dates on sorghum grain yield was simulated for the parbhani location in semi arid tropical india the sowing dates were three weeks before and after the normal sowing date june 30 in sorghum during the rainy season accordingly sowing dates were 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july in sorghum a smaller interval of 5 days may not bring the variation in the temperature hence to capture the effect of varying temperature and to get the response of changing climate on crop yield sowing dates with 10 days interval as an adaptation strategy was evaluated moreover several researchers ameta and sumeria 2004 singh et al 2017 sannagoudar et al 2023 clearly indicated that incidence of shoot fly stem borer and midge increase in sorghum sown in july than sorghum sown in june and per cent reduction in yield increased with delay in sowing after 20 july hence in the simulation study 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july as sowing dates were considered and more late planting dates after 20 july were not considered in the present simulation study it is important to note that sowing time is very crucial operation from farmers point view and further management practices viz inter cultivation weeding nutrient management and irrigation application depends on optimum sowing time therefore only sowing dates were evaluated as an agro adaptation strategy and additional adaptation strategies viz nutrient management and swc were not evaluated though measured swc data was available the climate scenarios were employed for simulation of sorghum grain yield at different sowing dates with recommended macro and micro nutrient management and the best date of sowing with the highest grain yield in the base period was identified for sorghum for the parbhani location the best date of sowing in the base period 1988 2007 was identified and grain yield was simulated for future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in the rcp 4 5 scenario variable sowing dates with recommended macro and micro nutrient management in sorghum were evaluated as agro adaptations to climate change in the semi arid tropics of india the change in simulated grain yield of sorghum for the future climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 in varying sowing dates was compared with the normal sowing date in the base year for evaluation of the adaptation strategy at parbhani location in the semi arid tropics of india the percentage change in the yield was calculated under varying sowing dates with respect to normal sowing date in base period to find out the suitable sowing date for the future scenarios in rcp 4 5 to minimize the adverse impact of climate change on sorghum 12 change in yield y c y b y b 100 yc average yield of

were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance test gomez and gomez 1984 and the least significant difference lsd of the treatment means were calculated at the p 0 05 level the lsd values were calculated whenever the f test was found to be significant in the case of non significant effects the standard error of means sem alone was considered 3 results and discussions 3 1 grain yield and rainwater use efficiency of sorghum the data pertaining to grain yield and rwue of sorghum were statistically analyzed for both years 2014 and 2015 the grain yield of sorghum in both years was significantly higher in bbf than in flatbed fig 2a in bbf the grain yields of sorghum were 2449 and 2873 kg ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the bbf increased the sorghum grain yield by 22 20 in 2014 and 33 56 in 2015 over flatbed the rwue was significantly influenced by land water management during the first year 2014 only the rwue recorded in bbf 12 03 and 6 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater was higher compared to flatbed 9 94 and 5 29 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater in the years 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2b the grain yield of sorghum responded markedly to nutrient management treatments and a significantly higher grain yield was recorded in n3 3120 kg ha 1 compared to n1 1140 kg ha 1 n2 2163 kg ha 1 and n4 2484 kg ha 1 in 2014 however the sorghum grain yield in n3 3379 kg ha 1 was statistically comparable with n4 3177 kg ha 1 and both the treatments were significantly superior to n1 and n2 in the year 2015 fig 2a the rwue of 15 39 kg ha 1 mm 1 was significantly higher in n3 100 recommended application of macro and micro nutrients over the n1 n2 and n4 nutrient management treatments in the first year 2014 however the nutrient management treatment n3 7 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater and n4 7 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater were comparable but significantly higher than n1 and n2 during the second year 2015 fig 2b the interaction effect between land water management and nutrient management treatments on grain yield and rwue of sorghum was significant in first year 2014 15 only the land water management bbf with 100 recommended application of macro and micronutrients through chemical fertilizer n3 significantly influenced the sorghum grain yield this combined effect of land water and nutrient management resulted from the timely availability of nutrients in the required quantity which further enhanced nutrient uptake and its accumulation in different plant parts this is reflected in higher grain yield in bbf with the recommended application of macro and micro nutrients through chemical fertilizer moreover the combined and interlinked various components like increased availability of soil moisture enhanced availability and better transportation of macro n p and k and micronutrient s zn and b in bbf with n3 cf for macro and micro nutrients possibly resulted in effective functioning of plant s physiological process like maintaining membrane integrity which enhanced the ability of membranes to transport vital nutrients cakmak et al 1995 sadeghzadeh and rengel 2011 which lead to increased sorghum grain yield in this study integrated nutrients management n4 through cf and vermicompost resulted in higher grain yield as compared to the application of macronutrients only through cf n2 in sorghum vermicompost is an enriched source of nutrients chander et al 2013 and its application could improve nutrient availability crop growth and yield components compared to cf nutrients from vermicompost were slowly released and were available slowly for longer period for crop uptake the slow release pattern of nutrients in the integrated nutrient management treatment n4 densilin et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 possibly did not fulfill the nutrient requirement of crops at specific growth stages hence could not attend the yield as in n3 recommended macro and micronutrients through cf results of the long term experiments at the heritage watershed site at icrisat patancheru india have shown that integrated watershed interventions which focused on balanced nutrient management along with crop and land water management practices can sustainably increase rainfed crop yield by five folds as compared to that under traditional farmers practice wani et al 2012 wani and rockström 2011 the sorghum grain yield was lowest in no fertilizer application control which was due to the inability of the soil to fulfill the nutrient requirement of plant for proper growth and development the consistent uptake of nutrients by plants declined the macro and micro nutrient reserves from native soil fertility bell et al 2010 and nutrients were inappropriately available to plants which further resulted in lower grain yield in no fertilizer application the rwue depends on grain yield and a higher yield of sorghum resulted in higher rwue higher rwue in bbf and n3 treatments could be due to the combined effect of higher swc and the 100 recommended application of n p k s zn and b which enhanced grain production this combined effect of land water management and nutrient provided a sufficient amount of water and nutrients which not only increased aboveground crop biomass but also root biomass which effectively utilized water and nutrients the growth of aboveground crop biomass contributed to efficient conversion of unproductive evaporation loss in productive transpiration which resulted in increased crop yield and rwue 3 2 soil water content in sorghum soil water content plays a crucial role in determining crop productivity in sats patil and sheelavantar 2004 pathak et al 2011 hati et al 2013 and swc were monitored for a short duration and commonly focused only on the top soil layer in this study swc was evaluated in four soil layers top sub middle and bottom under the two land water management practices in rainfed sorghum compared to flatbed the average swc in bbf was higher by 0 90 cm and 1 06 cm in the top layer 0 67 cm and 1 02 cm in the sub layer 0 51 cm and 0 84 cm in the middle layer and 0 34 cm and 0 67 cm in the bottom layer of soil during 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3a and b land water management practices have a direct effect on swc fig 3a and b the formation of raised beds due to bbf restricted the velocity of runoff generated from rainwater and allowed more opportunity time for soil water to retain in the furrows as compared to the flatbed moreover raised bed increased the soil surface area and improved the horizontal movement of water from furrow to the inner layer of bbf also bbf decreased runoff and the infiltration rate was increased due to more time for water to infiltrate into deeper soil layers and increased swc in different soil layers throughout 0 120 soil profile the vertisol has typical characteristics i e the dry period before rainy season resulted in the formation of large cracks in furrows and micro cracks on raised beds appear during the dry period within the rainy season this distinctive nature of vertisols significantly reduced runoff generated from rainwater and increased swc in bbf compared to the flatbed while high runoff towards the slope without any obstruction decreased infiltration rate and contributed to lower swc in the flatbed moreover compaction of soil reduces internal drainage leading to decreased soil water conservation and thereby lower swc in flatbed patil and sheelavantar 2004 pathak et al 2011 hati et al 2013 3 3 soil water content during longest dry period in sorghum the swc varies with the occurrence of rainfall and dry period between two rainy events the swc reached to highest when heavily rained and lowest in the dry period during the crop growing period in sats dry period during the crop growing season is common and variation in swc during such dry period would be the researchable area for the authors to understand the effect of bbf over flatbed thus the longest dry period during the cropping period was considered to study the variation in swc between dry periods the longest dry period of 26 days occurred between 76 and 101 das during the first year 2014 therefore the swc data point at 84 das in 2014 was evaluated to test the effect of bbf over flatbed fig 4a and b the analysis of data revealed that the swc in bbf was higher over flatbed in different soil layers during the longest dry period of 26 days in sorghum fig 4 the swc during the longest dry period at 84 das was 10 29 cm and 9 33 cm in the top layer 11 67 cm and 10 91 cm in sub layer 12 38 cm and 11 63 cm in the middle layer and 12 38 cm and 11 76 cm in bottom soil layer in bbf and flatbed respectively fig 4a layer wise assessment of swc data during the longest dry period indicated that percent increase of swc in bbf over flatbed showed decreasing trend as the soil depth increased i e bottom middle sub top soil layer the swc in bbf increased over flatbed by 10 30 in the top layer 7 05 in the sub layer 6 50 in the middle layer and 5 27 in the bottom layer during the longest dry period in sorghum at 84 das fig 4b the poor internal drainage in vertisols resulted in reduced water infiltration from the top to bottom soil layer compared to the middle and bottom layer of soil the formation of micro cracks during the dry period within the rainy season contributed to infiltrate and recharge soil water up to the top layer this indicates that lesser soil water recharge happened in the middle and bottom layers of soil hence swc in bbf over flatbed during the longest dry period showed a decreasing trend with increased soil depth under sorghum fig 4 similar results were noted in the long term study from 1976 to 2010 pathak et al 2013 at icrisat hyderabad in the semi arid zone which showed mean annual deep drainage was 3 in lower rainfall regions 750 mm annual rainfall and 13 in medium rainfall regions 750 900 mm annual rainfall of the mean annual rainfall in the same study pathak et al 2013 poor soil water recharge i e reduced infiltration was noted in vertisols with low rainfall areas in sat regions and thereby lower swc in middle and bottom soil layers compared to the top soil layer another reason for decreasing swc trend as the soil depth increased could be more crop foliage coverage around sorghum maturity stage which reduced the soil temperature owing to lesser solar radiation on the surface soil resulting in decreased evaporative losses and thereby soil moisture conservation in the field study longest dry period occurred at 84 days after sowing which was grain filling stage in sorghum the grain filling stage is critical crop growth stage when crop s water and nutrient requirement is more however sufficient swc in bbf during longest dry period might have contributed to appropriate availability of water and nutrients during grain filling stage thereby higher water and nutrient uptake and leading to higher grain yield of sorghum in bbf several studies reported that moisture conservation measures such as bbf increased sorghum yield by 13 16 patil et al 1991 and pearl millet by 17 in ridge and furrows singh and verma 1996 over flatbed planting due to higher swc ramesh and devasenapathy 2007 thakur et al 2011 and better availability of water which also transported nutrients chander et al 2013 3 4 sorghum yield simulation for the climate change scenarios 3 4 1 model calibration and validation the genotype coefficients of ceres sorghum model were calibrated using the crop experimental data of recommended macro and micronutrient management through cf during the calibration process a close match between observed and simulated values of time series above ground biomass of sorghum rmsen 0 18 and d index 0 99 was noted when grown with recommended macro and micronutrients management through cf fig 5 compared to the observed value table 1 the simulated days for anthesis were within 2 days and physiological maturity was within 1 day and the grain yield variation was marginal 3 the calibrated genotype coefficients for sorghum are given in table 2 the calibrated coefficients were validated for above ground biomass and grain yield using experimental data of the second year 2015 for macro and micronutrient management treatments conducted in the field experiment during validation the above ground biomass of experimental and simulated values were in a close match fig 5 up to maturity between the simulated and observed values of biomass the lowest variation rmsen 0 23 and d index 0 98 was noted with recommended macro and micronutrient management treatment n3 3 4 2 climate trend analysis and crop yield simulation the trend analysis of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin rainfall and solar radiation srad was carried out for the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for rcp 4 5 climate scenario at the parbhani location in sat of india the analysis was carried out with the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator and the results are presented in table 3 for the tmax and tmin an increasing trend was observed for the base period 1988 2007 as well as future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in rcp 4 5 the increasing trend was significant p 0 05 for tmax which stated an increase in temperature at 0 065 c year 1 in 2021 2040 and 0 046 c year 1 in 2041 2060 for rainfall a negative trend was noted for the base period 1988 2007 as well as the future period 2021 2060 however they were non significant for the solar radiation significantly negative trend p 0 01 was observed for the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2060 which is expected to decrease in the range 0 081 0 082 mj m 2 day 1 year 1 the maximum sorghum grain yield 5240 kg ha 1 was simulated for 30 june sowing normal sowing date with recommended macro and micronutrient management for the base period 1988 2007 while the grain yield declined in future periods during 2030 and 2050 fig 6 the decrease in the sorghum grain yield was 16 39 in 2030 and 19 98 in 2050 for the rcp 4 5 scenario as compared to the base period yield fig 7 sannagoudar et al 2023 reported that maximum reduction of sorghum grain yield was 32 85 due to the combined effect of reduced rainfall 20 and rise in temperature 2 c in the karnataka india situated in semi arid region the simulated output of this study also showed that early sowing of sorghum in june is suitable to attain higher yield compared to late sowing in july kothari et al 2020 simulated the climate change impacts on grain sorghum production under full and deficit irrigation strategies and indicated that grain sorghum yield under full irrigation was expected to be reduced by 5 by mid century 2036 2065 and by 15 by late century 2066 2095 under rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline period 1976 2005 another study conducted by kothari et al 2020a assess the impacts of climate change on yield and water use of grain sorghum and reported that the irrigated grain sorghum yield is expected to decrease by 5 13 and 16 27 by mid century 2036 2065 and late century 2066 2095 respectively under rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline 1976 2005 3 4 3 evaluation of agro adaptation the sorghum grain yield was simulated for different sowing dates as an agro adaptation option to find suitable sowing time to minimize the adverse impact of climate change on the grain yield in the future periods of 2030 and 2050 for the rcp 4 5 climate scenario the grain yield of sorghum was simulated for the future periods 2030 and 2050 with the five sowing dates 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july for the parbhani location the normal sowing date for sorghum in parbhani location is around last week of june 30 june at parbhani the simulated grain yield of sorghum during 2030 and 2050 decreased with advanced sowing time before 30 june but increased with the later sowing date i e 10 july fig 7 as compared to the base period yield 1988 2007 on normal sowing 30 june the yield of sorghum decreased by 19 22 and 25 48 during 2030 and 2050 respectively for the early sowing on 10 june in contrast postponing of sowing 10 july resulted in lower grain yield reduction i e 14 75 in 2030 and 19 37 in 2050 as compared to base period yield with the normal sowing 30 june the grain yield reduction in 2050 was higher than in 2030 with all the five sowing dates fig 7 during the base period variability in sorghum grain yield might be due to the sensitivity of grain crops to high temperatures during the reproductive stage than the vegetative stage farooq et al 2011 the sats are the most vulnerable regions and crop productivity could be substantially affected due to higher temperature and increase in rainfall variability which was predicted in future climate change scenarios gray 2007 however the negative impact of higher temperature on tropical crop yields in future periods could be ameliorated by adjustment in sowing time which could be one of the effective adaptation strategy to minimize the grain yield losses the adjustment in sowing dates might not expose the crop to high temperature and heat stress during the reproductive stage this present simulation study for the parbhani location stated that sorghum grain yield is reduced by 19 22 and 25 48 in 2030 s and 2050 s respectively for rcp 4 5 scenario on 10 june sowing early sowing dates compared to the base period sorghum grain yield 5240 kg ha 1 with normal sowing date 30 june the yield reduction in future climate on 10 june sowing was higher than 30 june sowing this higher yield reduction with early sowing is likely due to rise in temperature by 1 40 c in 2021 2040 and 1 97 c in 2041 2060 during crop growing period compared to base period 1988 2007 temperature fig 8 this rise in temperature during future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 might have increased evaporation losses of soil water however compared to early sowing sorghum grain yield losses were relatively lower for postpone of sowing 10 july and 20 july when the sowing is postponed to 10 july the average temperature during sorghum reproductive growth period were 26 78 and 27 32 c in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively in future periods the adverse impact of rising temperature on sorghum yield could reduce because temperatures were lower by 3 04 c during 2021 2040 and 3 4 c during 2041 2060 the optimum range for average daily temperature during the reproductive period is reported to be 25 28 c for the sorghum crop prasad et al 2006 prasad et al 2008 besides temperature negative trend was noted for rainfall during the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2060 on the 10 july sowing date flowering to grain filling stage i e reproductive period is expected to appear in september the grain filling stage in sorghum occurs between 70 and 80 das which can be seen during last week of september for the 10 july sowing date similarly the grain filling stage for early sowing 10 june will appear in august but for later sowing date after 10 july it may appear in october from fig 9 this can be understood that the reduction in rainfall in future period is lower in september as compared to august and october thus during the grain filling stage the crop will be less affected by drought if sown around 10 july therefore sowing of sorghum around 10 july in future period is recommended to mitigate the adverse impact of rising temperature and variability in rainfall due to climate change 4 conclusions climate change has a severe adverse effect on rainfed crop production systems in semi arid tropics sats the present study was conducted with specific objectives to evaluate the effect of broad bed furrow over flatbed for improving rainwater use efficiency and soil water content in different soil layers during longest dry period and recommend sowing time as an agro adaptation strategy for sorghum production in sats in india the results of the study revealed that compared to flatbed broad bed furrow had significantly higher rainwater use efficiency 21 in 2014 and 18 in 2015 of sorghum the broad bed furrow conserved higher soil water compared to flatbed throughout the sorghum growing period in all the four soil layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm and 90 120 cm maximum being in the top layer 0 30 cm with an increase up to 11 over flatbed layer wise soil water content data during the longest dry period of 26 days in the year 2014 indicated that the percent increase of soil water content in broad bed furrow over flatbed showed decreasing trend as the soil depth increased i e bottom middle sub top soil layer the adverse effect of climate change on sorghum production in semi arid regions can be minimized to a certain extent by postponing the sowing operation from 30 june to 10 july in the future period 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in parbhani india however further later planting of sorghum after 10 july is more prone to incidence of shootfly hence may not be recommended for normal cultivars results of the present study could be recommended to similar agro climatic regions in sats of asia and africa where sorghum production is low due to climate change based on the findings of this study it would be concluded that integrated land water nutrient management and postponing the sowing time to 10 july of sorghum are likely to be the promising agricultural water management and agro adaptation strategies to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and sustainable production of sorghum for future climate scenarios in sats declaration of competing interest

8870,change in rainfall pattern with longer dry period depletes soil water content swc and incorrect sowing time adversely affects rainfed sorghum production in semi arid tropics sats the present study was conducted to develop agricultural water management strategies for improving swc and to evaluate sowing time as climate change agro adaptations for sorghum production in sats the field experiments on two land water management flatbed broad bed furrows bbf and four nutrient management application of macro and micronutrients through combination of chemical and organic fertilizers were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics india the average swc in bbf was higher over flatbed by 0 90 cm and 1 06 cm in 0 30 cm soil depth 0 67 cm and 1 02 cm in 30 60 cm depth 0 51 cm and 0 84 cm in 60 90 cm depth and 0 34 cm and 0 67 cm in 90 120 cm during 2014 and 2015 respectively the swc in bbf was higher over flatbed by 7 28 throughout 0 120 cm soil depth during longest dry period of 26 days in the year 2014 the simulation analyses using dssat version 4 6 for coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 with rcp 4 5 stated that postponing the normal sowing time 30 june to 10 july resulted in lower grain yield reduction i e 14 75 in 2030 and 19 37 in 2050 as compared to base period 1988 2007 yield with normal sowing in parbhani location of india the bbf combined with macro and micronutrients application through chemical fertilizer and postponing sowing time was found the effective climate change agro adaptation strategies for improving sorghum production in sats this study indicates the need for desired policy orientation by the government to promote integrated land water nutrient management as the effective agro adaptations to climate change in sats keywords broad bed furrows cropping system model nutrient management rainwater use efficiency soil water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for 58 of global food grain production from 80 of the cultivable area kamdi et al 2020 raju et al 2008 and sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is one of the major cereal crops grown mostly under rainfed conditions in semi arid tropics sats due to higher drought tolerance than other cereal crops sorghum is a highly suitable crop for sats ludlow and muchow 1990 and continues to be the main staple food for marginal farmers of developing countries in asia and africa murty et al 2007 however the agricultural water management in rainfed agriculture is facing implications of changes in rainfall pattern such as uncertainty in rainfall parry et al 2004 increase in frequency and duration of droughts alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 and an increase in dryness and wetness rao et al 2013 in the semi arid and dry sub humid zone klaij and vachaud 1992 agarwal 2000 hatibu et al 2003 wani et al 2009 crop production is not only limited by the extent of rainfall but also by extreme variability like intense rainfall few rainy events with poor spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall the adverse meteorological conditions results in long dry spells droughts unseasonal rains and extended moisture stress periods with no mechanisms for storing or conserving the surplus rain to use during the scarcity deficit periods kanwar 1999 the large scale adverse impact on food production and food security will be due to rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns lesk et al 2016 fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change linden et al 2015 stated that most of times the rainfall could occur for short duration with high intensity due to climate change these studies clearly indicate that the change in rainfall pattern and longer dry periods within rainy season are serious agricultural water management issues adversely affecting rainfed crop production through lower soil water content swc in different soil layers and reduced rainwater use efficiency rwue in sats in addition the land water management practices determine the yield of crop cropping systems pathak et al 2013 reported that soils in the sats needs combination of new strategies and more appropriate soil and water management practices this combination will effectively conserve and utilize the soil and water resources in production systems that increase productivity and assure harvest land water management practices include broad bed furrows bbf flatbed ridges and furrows conservation furrow tied ridges open ridges compartmental bunding pit planting for in situ water conservation these land water management practices conserved the moisture in soil and boosted yield contributing parameters and thereby yield of crops cropping systems the previous study conducted by the authors kamdi et al 2020 on land water management practice showed the efficiency of broad bed furrows on changes in swc at the lowest and highest swc up to 90 cm soil depth and increase in water productivity in different cropping systems several efforts have been made to address rainfall associated issues using land water and agronomic management practices such as use of climate resilient cultivars irrigation management and nutrient management practices these management practices were used alone with an objective to increase grain yield in rainfed as well irrigated ecosystems but lesser emphasis was placed on improvement of swc in different soil layers and rwue in addition to field experiments crop modeling is a useful tool to assess the impact of climate change on crop yield and evaluate agro adaptations options in limited time and expenses the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a cropping system model csm used to simulate the growth development and yield of crops csm simulates the effect of climate soil and agronomic management practices on crop growth and yield which reduces the need for carrying out expensive field trials thus helping in the decision making process in climate change adaptations lehmann et al 2013 choruma et al 2019 jones et al 2003 the effect of climate change on diverse crops could be assessed by the use of simulation models challinor et al 2014 akinseye 2020 sannagoudar et al 2020 to evaluate the effect of management options such as sowing dates genotypes used fertilization rates water management etc as the adaptation strategies the studies kothari et al 2020 2020a carried out in the sats were also focused on the use of csm to assess the climate change impacts on sorghum production there is a dearth of studies on the effect of land water management on swc in different soil layers throughout crop growing period and during longest dry periods and rwue in sorghum there is limited or no information available on field based land water and nutrient management and coupling of field experimental data with csm for the decision making process as an adaptation mechanism to rainfall variability in the sat region we hypothesized that the practicing broad bed furrows bbf as improved land water management may store more water in the soil profile and increase the swc which can meet the water requirement of the crop in the dry spell period as compared to the conventional flatbed technique in addition to land water management sowing of the sorghum at the optimum time may reduce the crop vulnerability by avoiding exposure of the critical growth stages to variation in rainfall and temperature in future periods the field experiment on integrated land water and nutrient management combined with a simulation assessment of sorghum yield was the novelty of this comprehensive study to develop agricultural water management and an agro adaptation strategy under future climate scenarios in sats of india in this comprehensive study dssat version 4 6 was used as a csm to simulate the growth development and yield of sorghum the ceres sorghum model was calibrated and validated using present field experimental data and minimum data sets like weather daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation soil soil surface and profile information and experimental data field level input management and crop information several simulation studies rosenzweig et al 1995 mavromatis et al 2002 boomiraj et al 2012 singh et al 2014 were conducted on evaluation of the model using field experimental data for one location and assessing the impact of climate change at a different location rosenzweig et al 1995 clearly indicated performance of model using data from cropping systems currently used in respective countries could be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on cropping systems across similar region mavromatis et al 2002 used cropgro soybean model in dssat and estimated soybean cultivar coefficients for a number of cultivars in georgia to predict the soybean yields in north carolina the simulation results clearly indicated the robustness and ability of the model to predict soybean yield predictions across region boomiraj et al 2012 validated the infocrop sorghum model using data from several field experiments from all india coordinated research trials conducted at various sorghum growing regions in india and future climate change adaptation strategy were developed for across india for similar regions similar crop modeling studies were conducted in chickpea singh et al 2014 in the present study parbhani location used as simulation study location is away from hyderabad field experiment site as per koppen geiger climate classification beck h e et al 2018 parbhani location and hyderabad field experiment site are classified in semi arid zone hence authors chose parbhani location to simulate climate change scenario as an evaluation site though parbhani is away from hyderabad the present study was undertaken with specific objectives to 1 quantify grain yield and rwue of sorghum 2 analyse the effect of bbf against flatbed on changes in swc in different soil layers during longest dry period 3 calibrate and validate ceres sorghum model of dssat v4 6 using present field experiment data and 4 evaluate model for assessing the impact of climate change scenario rcp 4 5 on sorghum grain yield with sowing date as an agro adaptation strategy for parbhani location of maharashtra in india the present study was unique and evaluated two different topics viz field experiment to evaluate changes in swc during longest dry period and simulation study to assess sowing time as an agro adaptation strategy these two different topics related to each other wherein field experimental data on crop management was an input to the ceres sorghum model for calibration and evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were carried out to assess the effect of land water and nutrient management practices on sorghum grain yield changes in swc

gypsum for sulphur zinc sulphate for zinc and agribor for boron the bbf system a 120 cm wide bed with 30 cm wide and 15 cm deep furrows on both sides was made with the help of bullock drawn tropicultor implement during both the years of experimentation the seeding rates were 7 5 kg ha 1 for sorghum cultivar csh16 with a row spacing of 45 cm the experimental field was kept free from weeds throughout the crop growth period and necessary plant protection measures were taken to control insect attack and diseases 2 2 field data collection 2 2 1 above ground biomass sampling and soil moisture monitoring sorghum plant samples for recording above ground biomass were collected at 15 30 45 60 75 days after sowing das and at maturity during both years from each plot representative plants were considered as sample wani et al 1999 the sampled plants were uprooted keeping roots intact cleaned and washed in water to remove surface contamination and separated into roots stems leaves and heads if any thereafter the plant parts were kept in paper packets which in turn were placed in an oven for drying at 80 c till constant weights were obtained dry biomass of leaves stems and roots were noted the sum of the weights of leaf and stem of these plants was used as the total above ground dry biomass production estimation the sorghum crop was grown as rainfed the field experiment with six access tubes were installed up to 120 cm soil depth in each land water management for the nutrient management n3 treatment only to maintain uniformity a calibrated neutron probe 503dr hydroprobe cpn international concord ca was used to monitor swc wani et al 1999 at selected intervals up to 120 cm depth the source of the neutron probe was lowered down to 120 cm soil depth at 15 cm intervals and swc was recorded from eight depths at regular interval the swc values at each 15 cm soil depth were computed into volumetric water content and averaged for the top sub middle and bottom soil layer

scenarios in the parbhani location of maharashtra in india which has a semi arid tropical climate the n3 treatment application of macro and micronutrient through chemical fertilizer recommended in this study was evaluated as an adaptation strategy 2 3 1 location characterization climate change scenarios and trend analysis parbhani location of maharashtra in india was selected for simulation of sorghum grain yield fig 1 it is situated at 19 25 n latitude and 76 50 e longitude with 891 mm annual rainfall and the average maximum and minimum temperature are 31 c and 18 c respectively the layer

properties and soil data included in the dssat model for evaluation authors used climate data of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for 5 no of global circulation models gcms and multi model mean approach was adopted the future climate data was computed for the study area and climate change scenarios were created for the periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 with a representative concentration pathway rcp as rcp 4 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 climate scenario was selected for evaluation of agro adaptation because rcp 4 5 is a stabilized scenario of long term in which total radiative forcing is stabilized at 4 5 w m 2 without overshoot and to be stabilized by the year 2100 owing to improved technologies and reduced greenhouse gas emissions the trend analysis of

management using respective first year experimental data on phenology time series biomass yield components and grain yield the second year experimental data were used for evaluation of the model model performance indicators such as root mean square error normalized rmsen and d index were used for calibration and validation of model performance willmott et al 1985 10 rmse n i 1 n s i ob i 2 n 0 5 ob

is the number of observations in the present study the values of rmse were 0 18 and 0 23 and d index were 0 99 and 0 97 during model calibration and evaluation respectively 2 3 3 sorghum grain yield simulation for climate change scenario sorghum grain yield under climate change scenarios was simulated for parbhani location in semi arid tropics of india using calibrated genotype parameters of the cultivar and existing crop management practices the effect of different sowing dates on sorghum grain yield was simulated for the parbhani location in semi arid tropical india the sowing dates were three weeks before and after the normal sowing date june 30 in sorghum during the rainy season accordingly sowing dates were 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july in sorghum a smaller interval of 5 days may not bring the variation in the temperature hence to capture the effect of varying temperature and to get the response of changing climate on crop yield sowing dates with 10 days interval as an adaptation strategy was evaluated moreover several researchers ameta and sumeria 2004 singh et al 2017 sannagoudar et al 2023 clearly indicated that incidence of shoot fly stem borer and midge increase in sorghum sown in july than sorghum sown in june and per cent reduction in yield increased with delay in sowing after 20 july hence in the simulation study 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july as sowing dates were considered and more late planting dates after 20 july were not considered in the present simulation study it is important to note that sowing time is very crucial operation from farmers point view and further management practices viz inter cultivation weeding nutrient management and irrigation application depends on optimum sowing time therefore only sowing dates were evaluated as an agro adaptation strategy and additional adaptation strategies viz nutrient management and swc were not evaluated though measured swc data was available the climate scenarios were employed for simulation of sorghum grain yield at different sowing dates with recommended macro and micro nutrient management and the best date of sowing with the highest grain yield in the base period was identified for sorghum for the parbhani location the best date of sowing in the base period 1988 2007 was identified and grain yield was simulated for future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in the rcp 4 5 scenario variable sowing dates with recommended macro and micro nutrient management in sorghum were evaluated as agro adaptations to climate change in the semi arid tropics of india the change in simulated grain yield of sorghum for the future climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 in varying sowing dates was compared with the normal sowing date in the base year for evaluation of the adaptation strategy at parbhani location in the semi arid tropics of india the percentage change in the yield was calculated under varying sowing dates with respect to normal sowing date in base period to find out the suitable sowing date for the future scenarios in rcp 4 5 to minimize the adverse impact of climate change on sorghum 12 change in yield y c y b y b 100 yc average yield of

were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance test gomez and gomez 1984 and the least significant difference lsd of the treatment means were calculated at the p 0 05 level the lsd values were calculated whenever the f test was found to be significant in the case of non significant effects the standard error of means sem alone was considered 3 results and discussions 3 1 grain yield and rainwater use efficiency of sorghum the data pertaining to grain yield and rwue of sorghum were statistically analyzed for both years 2014 and 2015 the grain yield of sorghum in both years was significantly higher in bbf than in flatbed fig 2a in bbf the grain yields of sorghum were 2449 and 2873 kg ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the bbf increased the sorghum grain yield by 22 20 in 2014 and 33 56 in 2015 over flatbed the rwue was significantly influenced by land water management during the first year 2014 only the rwue recorded in bbf 12 03 and 6 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater was higher compared to flatbed 9 94 and 5 29 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater in the years 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2b the grain yield of sorghum responded markedly to nutrient management treatments and a significantly higher grain yield was recorded in n3 3120 kg ha 1 compared to n1 1140 kg ha 1 n2 2163 kg ha 1 and n4 2484 kg ha 1 in 2014 however the sorghum grain yield in n3 3379 kg ha 1 was statistically comparable with n4 3177 kg ha 1 and both the treatments were significantly superior to n1 and n2 in the year 2015 fig 2a the rwue of 15 39 kg ha 1 mm 1 was significantly higher in n3 100 recommended application of macro and micro nutrients over the n1 n2 and n4 nutrient management treatments in the first year 2014 however the nutrient management treatment n3 7 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater and n4 7 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 of rainwater were comparable but significantly higher than n1 and n2 during the second year 2015 fig 2b the interaction effect between land water management and nutrient management treatments on grain yield and rwue of sorghum was significant in first year 2014 15 only the land water management bbf with 100 recommended application of macro and micronutrients through chemical fertilizer n3 significantly influenced the sorghum grain yield this combined effect of land water and nutrient management resulted from the timely availability of nutrients in the required quantity which further enhanced nutrient uptake and its accumulation in different plant parts this is reflected in higher grain yield in bbf with the recommended application of macro and micro nutrients through chemical fertilizer moreover the combined and interlinked various components like increased availability of soil moisture enhanced availability and better transportation of macro n p and k and micronutrient s zn and b in bbf with n3 cf for macro and micro nutrients possibly resulted in effective functioning of plant s physiological process like maintaining membrane integrity which enhanced the ability of membranes to transport vital nutrients cakmak et al 1995 sadeghzadeh and rengel 2011 which lead to increased sorghum grain yield in this study integrated nutrients management n4 through cf and vermicompost resulted in higher grain yield as compared to the application of macronutrients only through cf n2 in sorghum vermicompost is an enriched source of nutrients chander et al 2013 and its application could improve nutrient availability crop growth and yield components compared to cf nutrients from vermicompost were slowly released and were available slowly for longer period for crop uptake the slow release pattern of nutrients in the integrated nutrient management treatment n4 densilin et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 possibly did not fulfill the nutrient requirement of crops at specific growth stages hence could not attend the yield as in n3 recommended macro and micronutrients through cf results of the long term experiments at the heritage watershed site at icrisat patancheru india have shown that integrated watershed interventions which focused on balanced nutrient management along with crop and land water management practices can sustainably increase rainfed crop yield by five folds as compared to that under traditional farmers practice wani et al 2012 wani and rockström 2011 the sorghum grain yield was lowest in no fertilizer application control which was due to the inability of the soil to fulfill the nutrient requirement of plant for proper growth and development the consistent uptake of nutrients by plants declined the macro and micro nutrient reserves from native soil fertility bell et al 2010 and nutrients were inappropriately available to plants which further resulted in lower grain yield in no fertilizer application the rwue depends on grain yield and a higher yield of sorghum resulted in higher rwue higher rwue in bbf and n3 treatments could be due to the combined effect of higher swc and the 100 recommended application of n p k s zn and b which enhanced grain production this combined effect of land water management and nutrient provided a sufficient amount of water and nutrients which not only increased aboveground crop biomass but also root biomass which effectively utilized water and nutrients the growth of aboveground crop biomass contributed to efficient conversion of unproductive evaporation loss in productive transpiration which resulted in increased crop yield and rwue 3 2 soil water content in sorghum soil water content plays a crucial role in determining crop productivity in sats patil and sheelavantar 2004 pathak et al 2011 hati et al 2013 and swc were monitored for a short duration and commonly focused only on the top soil layer in this study swc was evaluated in four soil layers top sub middle and bottom under the two land water management practices in rainfed sorghum compared to flatbed the average swc in bbf was higher by 0 90 cm and 1 06 cm in the top layer 0 67 cm and 1 02 cm in the sub layer 0 51 cm and 0 84 cm in the middle layer and 0 34 cm and 0 67 cm in the bottom layer of soil during 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3a and b land water management practices have a direct effect on swc fig 3a and b the formation of raised beds due to bbf restricted the velocity of runoff generated from rainwater and allowed more opportunity time for soil water to retain in the furrows as compared to the flatbed moreover raised bed increased the soil surface area and improved the horizontal movement of water from furrow to the inner layer of bbf also bbf decreased runoff and the infiltration rate was increased due to more time for water to infiltrate into deeper soil layers and increased swc in different soil layers throughout 0 120 soil profile the vertisol has typical characteristics i e the dry period before rainy season resulted in the formation of large cracks in furrows and micro cracks on raised beds appear during the dry period within the rainy season this distinctive nature of vertisols significantly reduced runoff generated from rainwater and increased swc in bbf compared to the flatbed while high runoff towards the slope without any obstruction decreased infiltration rate and contributed to lower swc in the flatbed moreover compaction of soil reduces internal drainage leading to decreased soil water conservation and thereby lower swc in flatbed patil and sheelavantar 2004 pathak et al 2011 hati et al 2013 3 3 soil water content during longest dry period in sorghum the swc varies with the occurrence of rainfall and dry period between two rainy events the swc reached to highest when heavily rained and lowest in the dry period during the crop growing period in sats dry period during the crop growing season is common and variation in swc during such dry period would be the researchable area for the authors to understand the effect of bbf over flatbed thus the longest dry period during the cropping period was considered to study the variation in swc between dry periods the longest dry period of 26 days occurred between 76 and 101 das during the first year 2014 therefore the swc data point at 84 das in 2014 was evaluated to test the effect of bbf over flatbed fig 4a and b the analysis of data revealed that the swc in bbf was higher over flatbed in different soil layers during the longest dry period of 26 days in sorghum fig 4 the swc during the longest dry period at 84 das was 10 29 cm and 9 33 cm in the top layer 11 67 cm and 10 91 cm in sub layer 12 38 cm and 11 63 cm in the middle layer and 12 38 cm and 11 76 cm in bottom soil layer in bbf and flatbed respectively fig 4a layer wise assessment of swc data during the longest dry period indicated that percent increase of swc in bbf over flatbed showed decreasing trend as the soil depth increased i e bottom middle sub top soil layer the swc in bbf increased over flatbed by 10 30 in the top layer 7 05 in the sub layer 6 50 in the middle layer and 5 27 in the bottom layer during the longest dry period in sorghum at 84 das fig 4b the poor internal drainage in vertisols resulted in reduced water infiltration from the top to bottom soil layer compared to the middle and bottom layer of soil the formation of micro cracks during the dry period within the rainy season contributed to infiltrate and recharge soil water up to the top layer this indicates that lesser soil water recharge happened in the middle and bottom layers of soil hence swc in bbf over flatbed during the longest dry period showed a decreasing trend with increased soil depth under sorghum fig 4 similar results were noted in the long term study from 1976 to 2010 pathak et al 2013 at icrisat hyderabad in the semi arid zone which showed mean annual deep drainage was 3 in lower rainfall regions 750 mm annual rainfall and 13 in medium rainfall regions 750 900 mm annual rainfall of the mean annual rainfall in the same study pathak et al 2013 poor soil water recharge i e reduced infiltration was noted in vertisols with low rainfall areas in sat regions and thereby lower swc in middle and bottom soil layers compared to the top soil layer another reason for decreasing swc trend as the soil depth increased could be more crop foliage coverage around sorghum maturity stage which reduced the soil temperature owing to lesser solar radiation on the surface soil resulting in decreased evaporative losses and thereby soil moisture conservation in the field study longest dry period occurred at 84 days after sowing which was grain filling stage in sorghum the grain filling stage is critical crop growth stage when crop s water and nutrient requirement is more however sufficient swc in bbf during longest dry period might have contributed to appropriate availability of water and nutrients during grain filling stage thereby higher water and nutrient uptake and leading to higher grain yield of sorghum in bbf several studies reported that moisture conservation measures such as bbf increased sorghum yield by 13 16 patil et al 1991 and pearl millet by 17 in ridge and furrows singh and verma 1996 over flatbed planting due to higher swc ramesh and devasenapathy 2007 thakur et al 2011 and better availability of water which also transported nutrients chander et al 2013 3 4 sorghum yield simulation for the climate change scenarios 3 4 1 model calibration and validation the genotype coefficients of ceres sorghum model were calibrated using the crop experimental data of recommended macro and micronutrient management through cf during the calibration process a close match between observed and simulated values of time series above ground biomass of sorghum rmsen 0 18 and d index 0 99 was noted when grown with recommended macro and micronutrients management through cf fig 5 compared to the observed value table 1 the simulated days for anthesis were within 2 days and physiological maturity was within 1 day and the grain yield variation was marginal 3 the calibrated genotype coefficients for sorghum are given in table 2 the calibrated coefficients were validated for above ground biomass and grain yield using experimental data of the second year 2015 for macro and micronutrient management treatments conducted in the field experiment during validation the above ground biomass of experimental and simulated values were in a close match fig 5 up to maturity between the simulated and observed values of biomass the lowest variation rmsen 0 23 and d index 0 98 was noted with recommended macro and micronutrient management treatment n3 3 4 2 climate trend analysis and crop yield simulation the trend analysis of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin rainfall and solar radiation srad was carried out for the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for rcp 4 5 climate scenario at the parbhani location in sat of india the analysis was carried out with the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator and the results are presented in table 3 for the tmax and tmin an increasing trend was observed for the base period 1988 2007 as well as future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in rcp 4 5 the increasing trend was significant p 0 05 for tmax which stated an increase in temperature at 0 065 c year 1 in 2021 2040 and 0 046 c year 1 in 2041 2060 for rainfall a negative trend was noted for the base period 1988 2007 as well as the future period 2021 2060 however they were non significant for the solar radiation significantly negative trend p 0 01 was observed for the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2060 which is expected to decrease in the range 0 081 0 082 mj m 2 day 1 year 1 the maximum sorghum grain yield 5240 kg ha 1 was simulated for 30 june sowing normal sowing date with recommended macro and micronutrient management for the base period 1988 2007 while the grain yield declined in future periods during 2030 and 2050 fig 6 the decrease in the sorghum grain yield was 16 39 in 2030 and 19 98 in 2050 for the rcp 4 5 scenario as compared to the base period yield fig 7 sannagoudar et al 2023 reported that maximum reduction of sorghum grain yield was 32 85 due to the combined effect of reduced rainfall 20 and rise in temperature 2 c in the karnataka india situated in semi arid region the simulated output of this study also showed that early sowing of sorghum in june is suitable to attain higher yield compared to late sowing in july kothari et al 2020 simulated the climate change impacts on grain sorghum production under full and deficit irrigation strategies and indicated that grain sorghum yield under full irrigation was expected to be reduced by 5 by mid century 2036 2065 and by 15 by late century 2066 2095 under rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline period 1976 2005 another study conducted by kothari et al 2020a assess the impacts of climate change on yield and water use of grain sorghum and reported that the irrigated grain sorghum yield is expected to decrease by 5 13 and 16 27 by mid century 2036 2065 and late century 2066 2095 respectively under rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline 1976 2005 3 4 3 evaluation of agro adaptation the sorghum grain yield was simulated for different sowing dates as an agro adaptation option to find suitable sowing time to minimize the adverse impact of climate change on the grain yield in the future periods of 2030 and 2050 for the rcp 4 5 climate scenario the grain yield of sorghum was simulated for the future periods 2030 and 2050 with the five sowing dates 10 june 20 june 30 june 10 july and 20 july for the parbhani location the normal sowing date for sorghum in parbhani location is around last week of june 30 june at parbhani the simulated grain yield of sorghum during 2030 and 2050 decreased with advanced sowing time before 30 june but increased with the later sowing date i e 10 july fig 7 as compared to the base period yield 1988 2007 on normal sowing 30 june the yield of sorghum decreased by 19 22 and 25 48 during 2030 and 2050 respectively for the early sowing on 10 june in contrast postponing of sowing 10 july resulted in lower grain yield reduction i e 14 75 in 2030 and 19 37 in 2050 as compared to base period yield with the normal sowing 30 june the grain yield reduction in 2050 was higher than in 2030 with all the five sowing dates fig 7 during the base period variability in sorghum grain yield might be due to the sensitivity of grain crops to high temperatures during the reproductive stage than the vegetative stage farooq et al 2011 the sats are the most vulnerable regions and crop productivity could be substantially affected due to higher temperature and increase in rainfall variability which was predicted in future climate change scenarios gray 2007 however the negative impact of higher temperature on tropical crop yields in future periods could be ameliorated by adjustment in sowing time which could be one of the effective adaptation strategy to minimize the grain yield losses the adjustment in sowing dates might not expose the crop to high temperature and heat stress during the reproductive stage this present simulation study for the parbhani location stated that sorghum grain yield is reduced by 19 22 and 25 48 in 2030 s and 2050 s respectively for rcp 4 5 scenario on 10 june sowing early sowing dates compared to the base period sorghum grain yield 5240 kg ha 1 with normal sowing date 30 june the yield reduction in future climate on 10 june sowing was higher than 30 june sowing this higher yield reduction with early sowing is likely due to rise in temperature by 1 40 c in 2021 2040 and 1 97 c in 2041 2060 during crop growing period compared to base period 1988 2007 temperature fig 8 this rise in temperature during future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 might have increased evaporation losses of soil water however compared to early sowing sorghum grain yield losses were relatively lower for postpone of sowing 10 july and 20 july when the sowing is postponed to 10 july the average temperature during sorghum reproductive growth period were 26 78 and 27 32 c in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively in future periods the adverse impact of rising temperature on sorghum yield could reduce because temperatures were lower by 3 04 c during 2021 2040 and 3 4 c during 2041 2060 the optimum range for average daily temperature during the reproductive period is reported to be 25 28 c for the sorghum crop prasad et al 2006 prasad et al 2008 besides temperature negative trend was noted for rainfall during the base period 1988 2007 and future periods 2021 2060 on the 10 july sowing date flowering to grain filling stage i e reproductive period is expected to appear in september the grain filling stage in sorghum occurs between 70 and 80 das which can be seen during last week of september for the 10 july sowing date similarly the grain filling stage for early sowing 10 june will appear in august but for later sowing date after 10 july it may appear in october from fig 9 this can be understood that the reduction in rainfall in future period is lower in september as compared to august and october thus during the grain filling stage the crop will be less affected by drought if sown around 10 july therefore sowing of sorghum around 10 july in future period is recommended to mitigate the adverse impact of rising temperature and variability in rainfall due to climate change 4 conclusions climate change has a severe adverse effect on rainfed crop production systems in semi arid tropics sats the present study was conducted with specific objectives to evaluate the effect of broad bed furrow over flatbed for improving rainwater use efficiency and soil water content in different soil layers during longest dry period and recommend sowing time as an agro adaptation strategy for sorghum production in sats in india the results of the study revealed that compared to flatbed broad bed furrow had significantly higher rainwater use efficiency 21 in 2014 and 18 in 2015 of sorghum the broad bed furrow conserved higher soil water compared to flatbed throughout the sorghum growing period in all the four soil layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm and 90 120 cm maximum being in the top layer 0 30 cm with an increase up to 11 over flatbed layer wise soil water content data during the longest dry period of 26 days in the year 2014 indicated that the percent increase of soil water content in broad bed furrow over flatbed showed decreasing trend as the soil depth increased i e bottom middle sub top soil layer the adverse effect of climate change on sorghum production in semi arid regions can be minimized to a certain extent by postponing the sowing operation from 30 june to 10 july in the future period 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in parbhani india however further later planting of sorghum after 10 july is more prone to incidence of shootfly hence may not be recommended for normal cultivars results of the present study could be recommended to similar agro climatic regions in sats of asia and africa where sorghum production is low due to climate change based on the findings of this study it would be concluded that integrated land water nutrient management and postponing the sowing time to 10 july of sorghum are likely to be the promising agricultural water management and agro adaptation strategies to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and sustainable production of sorghum for future climate scenarios in sats declaration of competing interest

8871,the role of nocturnal transpiration in plant growth is debatable presumably due to the soil moisture dependent characteristics of transpiration to address this issue we analyzed the relationship between nocturnal and diurnal transpiration and plant growth across various soil moisture and atmospheric co2 levels we investigated the ratio of nocturnal to diurnal transpiration under eight soil moisture conditions 30 35 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 w w and three co2 concentrations approximately 407 610 and 843 ppm in five rice genotypes cv nipponbare irat109 nerica 1 taichung 65 t65 and dv85 the total plant biomass increased linearly with increase in diurnal transpiration but showed a saturated response to increase in nocturnal transpiration suggesting that nocturnal transpiration did not contribute to growth when the soil water content was above 60 co2 enrichment did not decrease the nocturnal transpiration rate en but decreased the diurnal transpiration rate ed thereby causing an increase in the en ed value the en ed value was the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 the graphical curves representing the change in en ed values plotted along with the soil water content showed a v shaped pattern for all genotypes examined furthermore the patterns of variation of en ed values with respect to changes in soil moisture contents were similar under different co2 concentrations therefore we concluded that suppression of nocturnal transpiration in the absence of drought would be an important target for reducing water consumption without compromising biomass production and estimation of the en ed values will help in selecting individuals showing low nocturnal transpiration regardless of the co2 concentration in the environment keywords daytime transpiration elevated co2 nighttime transpiration oryza sativa l plant growth water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial plants inevitably lose water when they acquire co2 mainly through their stomata therefore the amount of biomass produced by plants is tightly coupled with the amount of transpired water to improve this relationship methods to increase water use efficiency wue by increasing the amount of dry matter produced per unit of transpired water have often been explored partial stomatal closure almost always occurs when wue of plants is increased because partial closure usually leads to a drastic reduction in the extent of water loss and a slight decrease in the amount of co2 acquired therefore an increase in wue is achieved at the expense of a decrease in growth rate which is associated with reduced co2 acquisition unless atmospheric co2 concentrations increase igarashi et al 2021 yi and yano 2021 2022 yi et al 2019 2020 consequently a paradox emerges that breeding of crops with higher wue with the aim of enhancing drought resistance will inadvertently cause a reduction in the plants drought resistance ability blum 2009 sinclair 2018 here it should be noted that the meaning of drought resistance may differ among researchers e g productivity during a season vs survival over several days as passioura 2002 had pointed out this paradox highlights a trade off between biomass and wue a high wue will result in low productivity for several months even if the plant survives a severe drought to overcome this paradox decrease in nocturnal transpiration is an important target because plants except those performing crassulacean acid metabolism cam photosynthesis do not need to open their stomata for co2 acquisition at night in fact plants lose a substantial amount of water during the night usually 5 15 and sometimes up to 30 of the water lost during daytime mainly due to incomplete stomatal closure caird et al 2007 if water loss at night occurs mainly via non stomatal routes such as the cuticle the reduction of water loss might be difficult coupel ledru et al 2016 showed that a considerable amount of nocturnal transpiration occurs via incompletely closed stomata and nocturnal stomatal conductance reduction improved wue without any decrease in the growth rate in grape vines these results suggest that reduction in nocturnal transpiration via stomatal closure is a promising way to reduce wasteful water loss for carbon gain however in addition to carbon assimilation if nocturnal transpiration is associated with certain physiological functions its reduction may inhibit plant growth for example previous studies have shown that nocturnal transpiration causes a hydraulic uplift of mineral nutrients to support shoot growth caird et al 2007 and increases efficiency of water uptake to expand leaf fricke 2019 these findings imply that nocturnal transpiration is important especially under drought conditions despite these physiological functions how soil moisture levels affect the relationship between nocturnal transpiration and growth as well as the extent to which suppression of the suggested physiological functions negatively affects plant growth has rarely been tested therefore we investigated the relationship between the extent of nocturnal transpiration and the production of biomass over a wide range of soil moisture levels from dry to waterlogged using rice oryza sativa l plants that can adapt to a wide range of soil moisture conditions as there are four types of rice ecosystem irrigated rainfed lowland deep water and rainfed upland bernier et al 2008 rice is the most important food crop and is consumed by approximately half the world s population maclean et al 2002 according to rahaman and shehab 2018 the water requirement for rice production is high 2497 l kg 1 almost double that for wheat 1350 l kg 1 and maize 1222 l kg 1 reduction of the amount of water consumed in rice production is important because of the global scale of area used for rice production approximately 1 65 108 ha in 2021 data from food and agriculture organization of the united nations in addition to the fact that agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of fresh water resources clarke and king 2004 furthermore approximately 98 of the water consumed by terrestrial plants is lost via transpiration morison 2007 therefore reduction of nocturnal transpiration in rice plants will have a significant worldwide impact however information on how nocturnal transpiration varies with soil moisture levels and how it relates to biomass production in plants including rice is scarce elevated levels of co2 eco2 and other global warming gases may lead to high temperatures and ultimately severe droughts worldwide dai 2011 water scarcity along with the growth in food demand and industrial development may make this amount of water consumption in agriculture unsustainable rosa et al 2020 it seems that the current need for high wue is in part derived from concerns that the climate change that is occurring in recent times may enhance drought prone conditions nevertheless it has been widely recognized that eco2 leads to enhancement of wue without growth reduction by causing a concomitant increase in photosynthesis and a decrease in stomatal conductance ainsworth and rogers 2007 polley 2002 however how eco2 affects water consumption has not been investigated in previous studies in this study we examined the amount of water consumed at the individual plant level during the day and the night using five rice genotypes grown under conditions of eight soil water levels and three co2 concentrations here we aimed to answer the following questions 1 does a reduction in nocturnal transpiration increase wue without growth reduction 2 how do soil moisture and co2 levels affect the extent of nocturnal transpiration in comparison to the level of whole day transpiration and does the extent of nocturnal transpiration differ among different genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth conditions a pot experiment was conducted on five rice genotypes cv nipponbare irat109 nerica 1 t65 and dv85 in three growth chambers lph 410 spc nippon medical chemical instruments co ltd japan with the following settings light intensity 400 µmol m 2 s 1 relative humidity 60 temperature 30 25 c day night respectively and photoperiod 14 10 h day night respectively the co2 concentrations in each chamber were maintained at approximately 400 600 and 800 ppm for low co2 lc medium co2 mc and high co2 hc conditions respectively the plants and co2 concentrations were switched weekly between the three chambers to minimize potential chamber effects a co2 recorder tr 76ui t d inc japan was placed inside each chamber to monitor the conditions every 5 min there were no significant differences in the temperature or relative humidity

was at 30 w w rice seeds germinated in a growth chamber under the following conditions light intensity 400 µmol m 2 s 1 relative humidity 60 temperature 30 25 c day night respectively and photoperiod 12 12 h day night respectively nineteen days later the rice seedlings were transplanted into 1 l volume pots diameter 11 3 cm depth 14 cm one plant per pot filled with 580 g of dry andosol before transplanting nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k in the form of ammonium sulfate 21 0 n calcium superphosphate 17 5 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 0 k2o were uniformly mixed in the soil to obtain final concentrations of 0 2 g n 1 0 g p2o5 and 0 2 g k2o kg 1 dry soil the soil water content was maintained at 60 w w for all treatments for 10 d after transplantation subsequently the plants were grown in soils having eight water contents 30 35 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 w w for soils with water content higher than 60 the plants were watered with the required amount of water 11 days after transplanting to create 60 80 100 and 120 soil water conditions for plants grown in soils with water content below 60 the water supply was withdrawn 11 days after transplanting and then the soil was re watered until the target soil water content was attained 30 35 40 and 50 2 2 measurement of water use water use during the growth period 28 days after transplanting was measured using the gravitational method described in our previous study yi and yano 2021 the pots were covered with transparent plastic films to prevent soil evaporation these pots were weighed on the day of transplanting and before each watering until harvest the amount of water lost during transpiration was recorded for each pot after weighing the amount of water used during the growth period was calculated based on the cumulative transpiration the wue was calculated as the amount of plant biomass accumulated divided by the amount of water used during the growth period according to the formula reported by jones 2004 2 3 analysis of diurnal and nocturnal transpiration transpiration during the daytime td 22 27 and the nighttime tn 22 27 was measured 22 27 days after transplanting following the method reported by coupel ledru et al 2016 pot weight loss was recorded during the light 5 00 19 00 and the dark 19 00 5 00 hours all plants were harvested on the 28th day after transplanting and the leaf area was analyzed using a winrhizo pro la2400 system regent instruments inc canada and a flatbed scanner epson expression 10000xl seiko epson co japan since transpiration was influenced by leaf area which varied with different genotypes and growing conditions the transpiration rate transpiration per unit area was calculated to estimate the differences among plants treated with different soil water concentrations to eliminate the effect of leaf area the transpiration rates during the day ed 27 and night en 27 were calculated based on the diurnal and nocturnal transpiration on the 27th day after transplanting on a leaf area basis 2 4 harvest all plants were harvested 28 days after transplantation and dried to a constant mass in an oven at 80 c for determination of dry weight the samples were then ground into powder and used to determine the n content 2 5 statistical analysis the experiment was organized in a factorial design three co2 concentrations five varieties eight water conditions without biological replicates there were no biological replicates because our intention was to assess the main effects without their interactions lacking replications does not allow to compare whether or not each of the plots significantly differs but that was not our intention instead we can predict the dependent variable by the independent variable when a good regression is obtained in such cases replication of observations is irrelevant and reduces experimental sensitivity barrow 2021 the main effects of variation in co2 concentrations rice varieties and water

between the rice varieties a two way anova without replication was used to analyze the main effects of variation of co2 and water concentrations on each variety table 1 simple regressions were analyzed using the origin 9 0 software https www originlab com all figures were created using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 plant morphology total plant biomass water use and water use efficiency the plant morphology at harvest is shown in fig 2 the plant size increased as the soil water content increased to 60 although morphologically it seems that co2 concentration did not affect plant size the total plant biomass was enhanced by co2 enrichment fig 3a e with an increase in soil water content the total plant biomass increased and the maximum biomass was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content depending on the genotype and the co2 concentration likewise water use increased with an increase in soil water content and the maximum water use was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content fig 3f j a slight decrease in water use upon co2 enrichment was observed in nipponbare p 0 046 irat109 p 0 003 and t65 p 0 004 but not in nerica 1 p 0 835 and dv85 p 0 613 table 1 due to enhancement in biomass and reduction in water use upon co2 enrichment wue was notably increased under conditions of mc and hc fig 3k o with an increase in soil water content the wue decreased to a minimum value at approximately 60 80 soil water content 3 2 transpiration during the day and the night to elucidate the relationship between biomass and transpiration during the nighttime and the daytime nocturnal and diurnal transpirations were recorded 22 27 days after plant transplanting with an increase in soil water content the tn 22 27 value increased linearly and the slopes were steeper for plants grown under high co2 concentrations than the slopes for those grown under lc fig 4a e in contrast the td 22 27 and the whole day transpiration tn 22 27 td 22 27 values increased with the increase in soil water content and saturation was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content fig 4f o the td 22 27 values significantly decreased upon co2 enrichment for all genotypes although a significantly different value was not observed for nerica 1 p 0 069 the tn 22 27 td 22 27 values decreased upon co2 enrichment but significant differences in the values were observed only for irat109 p 0 020 and t65 p 0 004 the ratio of nocturnal transpiration to whole day transpiration tn 22 27 tn 22 27 td 22 27 increased remarkably with co2 enrichment the values initially showed a decreasing trend and then the values increased with the increase in soil water content showing a v shaped pattern fig 4p t 3 3 transpiration rates during the day and the night the en 27 values ranged from 0 21 to 2 73 mmol m 2 s 1 depending on the genotypes and the growth conditions fig 5a e the en 27 values increased linearly with the increase in soil water content and co2 enrichment had a negligible effect on these values even though the anova results indicated a small increase in the values for irat109 t65 and dv 85 table 1 in contrast the ed 27 values significantly decreased from 1 27 5 96 mmol m 2 s 1 under lc to 0 56 4 80 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 67 4 00 mmol m 2 s 1 under mc and hc conditions respectively fig 5f j with an increase in soil moisture the ed 27 values increased to a maximum at approximately 60 80 soil water content the en 27 ed 27 values were estimated to be 0 09 0 53 0 15 0 81 and 0 19 0 93 under lc mc and hc conditions respectively fig 5k o similar to the pattern of change in tn 22 27 tn 22 27 td 22 27 values the slope for en 27 ed 27 values showed a v shaped pattern of change with an increase in soil water content and the values showed a notable increase upon co2 enrichment 3 4 relationship between total plant biomass and transpiration to further distinguish the contributions of nocturnal and diurnal transpiration to biomass accumulation the relationships between total plant biomass and tn 22 27 td 22 27 and tn 22 27 td 22 27 values were analyzed a saturation curve was obtained using the values of total plant biomass and tn 22 27 and the curve was not affected by co2 concentration fig 6a e linear relationships were observed between the values of total plant biomass and td 22 27 and tn 22 27 td 22 27 fig 6f o furthermore the slope steepness increased upon co2 enrichment for all the genotypes 4 discussion 4 1 nocturnal transpiration favors growth under drought conditions excessive nocturnal transpiration without drought indicates wastage of water individual plant biomasses were linearly regressed against the td 22 27 values for all genotypes examined r 2 0 9 furthermore the slopes were steeper for plants grown under mc and hc than for those grown under lc conditions fig 6f j these results indicated that co2 assimilation was closely related to diurnal transpiration supporting the hypothesis that suppression of diurnal transpiration decreases biomass production in contrast the variation in co2 concentrations had a negligible effect on the pattern of change in plant biomass in response to increased transpiration at night when photosynthesis did not occur fig 6a e the nocturnal transpiration values increased linearly up to approximately 0 1 l per plant and then the curve showed saturation as the values did not show any further change interestingly the tn 22 27 values increased linearly with the increase in soil water content fig 4a e however the increase in td 22 27 values was suppressed when the soil water content was higher than 60 fig 4f j the difference in the relationship between biomass production and daytime and nighttime transpiration may be attributed to the difference in transpiration td 22 27 and tn 22 27 observed in response to the change in soil water content there are different views on whether nocturnal transpiration is wasteful or negligible in terms of total water consumption christman et al 2009 dayer et al 2021 and whether it is associated with certain physiological functions in plants fricke 2019 matimati et al 2014 however the effect of soil moisture levels on the relationship between nocturnal transpiration and plant growth has rarely been explored the novel finding of our study is that nocturnal transpiration favored plant growth but this phenomenon was dependent on the soil moisture levels fig 6a e however a turning point appeared when the transpired volume reached 0 1 l per plant regardless of the genotype and this point corresponded to approximately 60 soil water content fig 4a e indeed all growth parameters fig 3 as well as plant morphology fig 2 suggest that the onset of drought stress was at approximately 60 soil water content rice plants are cultivated not only in paddy soils but also in various ecosystem types such as upland rainfed lowland and deep water bernier et al 2008 the soil moisture levels were quite different among these types and moreover can fluctuate from dry to waterlogged within a single season especially under rainfed conditions our results suggest a significance of nocturnal transpiration when drought that can occur in rainfed environments by contrast nocturnal transpiration is obviously wasteful for irrigated paddy rice in which reducing nocturnal transpiration may not be harmful when the soil moisture content was below 60 there was a positive correlation between tn 22 27 values and biomass production therefore suppression of nocturnal transpiration may have a negative effect on plant growth especially on the n acquisition capacity fig s1 therefore in rice plants the n acquisition capacity per transpiration increased to compensate for the reduction in transpiration fig s1 changes in plasma membrane proteins such as transporters may be responsible for the increase in n acquisition capacity per transpiration i e increased soil to plant nitrogen transfer caird et al 2007 matimati et al 2014 4 2 genetic variability and the ratio of night day transpiration rate to soil water content similar to the pattern of change in tn 22 27 values fig 4a e the en 27 values increased linearly with an increase in soil water content fig 5a e however there was a minuscule change in the en 27 values under different co2 concentrations in contrast the tn 22 27 values tended to be higher under hc and mc than those under lc conditions and this finding was attributed to the larger leaf areas observed in plants grown under hc and mc conditions fig s2 the transpiration rate per unit leaf area is determined by stomatal aperture and stomatal density the latter may not only be increased in drought conditions zhao et al 2015 but may also be altered due to strong interactions between p nutrition of plants and soil moisture or atmospheric co2 levels sekiya and yano 2008 since the en 27 ed 27 value was derived from analysis of the same individual within a single day the effect of variation in stomatal density can be ignored considering the difference in vapor pressure deficit vpd during the day approximately 1 7 kpa and night approximately 1 3 kpa the transpiration rate should be 1 3 times higher during the day than that at night assuming that the size of the stomatal aperture is the same as expected the night day ratio of the transpiration rate was approximately 0 8 when the stomatal apertures were equal in size most of the genotypes increased en 27 ed 27 values near 0 8 in mc and hc conditions not only under severe drought but also at sufficient soil moisture levels fig 5k o in particular irat 109 showed the values above 0 8 under hc meaning that the stomatal aperture was wider during the night than that during the day consequently elevated co2 levels led to an increase in nocturnal transpiration fig 4a e but caused a reduction in diurnal transpiration fig 4f j thereby enhancing the overall proportion of nocturnal transpiration fig 4p t however an important exception was observed with the genotype t65 which showed en 27 ed 27 values less than 0 8 across all soil moisture and co2 concentrations this was the probable reason for the lower nocturnal transpiration rate observed for t65 compared with that of the other genotypes fig 4d however the wue of t65 especially under lc condition which should show low nocturnal transpiration levels under wet conditions fig 4d was lower than that of the other lines fig 3n this may be explained by the linear pattern of change in plant biomass in response to change in tn 27 values in t65 fig 6d which is different from the saturation curves obtained for the other genotypes fig 6a e as the saturation curves were an indication of wasteful transpiration therefore further investigations are required to confirm whether reduction in wasteful nocturnal transpiration is important to increase wue without growth reduction in genotypes showing saturated responses such as nipponbare fig 6a the en 27 ed 27 values were generally the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 the en 27 ed 27 values showed a v shaped pattern of change as the values increased when the soil moisture content was less or more than 50 fig 5k o notably the pattern of variation differed among the genotypes fig 5k o as mentioned above there was a positive relationship between nocturnal transpiration and biomass production when the soil water content was below 60 fig 6a 6e therefore an increase in the ratio of night day transpiration rate maintaining a high number of open stomata at night might have an adaptive significance in conditions of drought however an increase in the ratio of night day transpiration rate when the soil water content is more than 60 may lead to excessive water consumption which should be constrained from this perspective an l shaped pattern of change in en 27 ed 27 values corresponding to the change in soil water content is desirable the change in en 27 ed 27 values obtained for the t65 genotype resembled this l shaped pattern as the values hardly increased even under wet conditions in contrast irat 109 is another interesting genotype which showed relatively high en 27 ed 27 values and wide variation in the values compared to that of the other genotypes along with a relatively high biomass and a variable pattern of biomass production when grown in different soil moisture conditions fig 3a e overall it is important to elucidate the morphological and the physiological characteristics responsible for these genotypic differences 4 3 effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the ratio of night day transpiration rate the ratio of tn 22 27 to total transpiration varied widely from 6 to 35 and the percentage of tn 22 27 increased at co2 concentrations above 600 ppm fig 4p t this was because the co2 enriched environment strongly suppressed ed 27 fig 5f j while having a negligible effect on en 27 fig 5a e as a result the en 27 ed 27 values increased under mc and hc comparing to lc although the response of the values with respect to soil water content seemed to depend on the genotypes rather than the co2 concentrations fig 5k o this result suggests that a certain genotype displaying a response of night day transpiration rate to soil moisture level under the current co2 concentrations likely shows an elevated but similar response under high co2 concentrations as stomatal opening and closure involve the movement of solutes against a concentration gradient fischer 1968 this process is accompanied by energy consumption raschke 1970 maintenance of stomatal opening at night affects stomatal opening in light mansfield and heath 1961 therefore opening the pores wide during the day and closing them tightly at night low night day transpiration rate may be useful for reducing wasteful water consumption but may not be rational in terms of energy costs as mentioned earlier we found the lowest en ed values which imply the greatest energy costs for opening and closing stomata at around 50 soil moisture and the values increased i e lower the costs with higher the soil moisture fig 5k o considering the fact that the rice plants were able to close their stomata more tightly when the soil moisture was less than 50 fig 5a e such increased en ed values in the absence of drought may be due to saving the energy costs to close stomata tightly if so it may be advantageous to reduce stomatal density than to expend energy in stomatal opening and closure in general high co2 concentrations in the environment often lead to reduction of stomatal density which has often been discussed primarily in terms of co2 acquisition capacity but this phenomenon may also play an important role in suppression of water consumption especially in inhibition of nocturnal transpiration further studies including analysis of stomatal opening and morphology may be warranted 5 conclusions in this study we aimed to elucidate the following points 1 whether a reduction in nocturnal transpiration increases wue without reducing growth and 2 how soil moisture and co2 levels change the extent of nocturnal transpiration in comparison to the extent of whole day transpiration and does the extent of nocturnal transpiration differ among genotypes after conducting the experiment we found that the loss of significant quantities of water at night without any gain of carbon may be of some benefit to plants under drought conditions however it causes wastage of water resources under well watered conditions therefore the suppression of nocturnal transpiration under well watered conditions is an important target for reducing water consumption without compromising biomass production this is particularly true for rice production in paddy fields the ratio of nocturnal transpiration to diurnal transpiration was generally the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 and showed a v shaped pattern of change in all the genotypes examined furthermore the pattern of variation in the ratio of night day transpiration rate with respect to soil moisture content was similar under different co2 conditions indicating that estimation of the ratio of night day transpiration rate will help in selecting individuals that perform low levels of nocturnal transpiration under wet soil conditions which will be useful as co2 concentrations in the environment are expected to increase in the future funding this study was supported by the japan society for the promotion of science grant numbers 21h02328 credit authorship contribution statement yan yi

8871,the role of nocturnal transpiration in plant growth is debatable presumably due to the soil moisture dependent characteristics of transpiration to address this issue we analyzed the relationship between nocturnal and diurnal transpiration and plant growth across various soil moisture and atmospheric co2 levels we investigated the ratio of nocturnal to diurnal transpiration under eight soil moisture conditions 30 35 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 w w and three co2 concentrations approximately 407 610 and 843 ppm in five rice genotypes cv nipponbare irat109 nerica 1 taichung 65 t65 and dv85 the total plant biomass increased linearly with increase in diurnal transpiration but showed a saturated response to increase in nocturnal transpiration suggesting that nocturnal transpiration did not contribute to growth when the soil water content was above 60 co2 enrichment did not decrease the nocturnal transpiration rate en but decreased the diurnal transpiration rate ed thereby causing an increase in the en ed value the en ed value was the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 the graphical curves representing the change in en ed values plotted along with the soil water content showed a v shaped pattern for all genotypes examined furthermore the patterns of variation of en ed values with respect to changes in soil moisture contents were similar under different co2 concentrations therefore we concluded that suppression of nocturnal transpiration in the absence of drought would be an important target for reducing water consumption without compromising biomass production and estimation of the en ed values will help in selecting individuals showing low nocturnal transpiration regardless of the co2 concentration in the environment keywords daytime transpiration elevated co2 nighttime transpiration oryza sativa l plant growth water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial plants inevitably lose water when they acquire co2 mainly through their stomata therefore the amount of biomass produced by plants is tightly coupled with the amount of transpired water to improve this relationship methods to increase water use efficiency wue by increasing the amount of dry matter produced per unit of transpired water have often been explored partial stomatal closure almost always occurs when wue of plants is increased because partial closure usually leads to a drastic reduction in the extent of water loss and a slight decrease in the amount of co2 acquired therefore an increase in wue is achieved at the expense of a decrease in growth rate which is associated with reduced co2 acquisition unless atmospheric co2 concentrations increase igarashi et al 2021 yi and yano 2021 2022 yi et al 2019 2020 consequently a paradox emerges that breeding of crops with higher wue with the aim of enhancing drought resistance will inadvertently cause a reduction in the plants drought resistance ability blum 2009 sinclair 2018 here it should be noted that the meaning of drought resistance may differ among researchers e g productivity during a season vs survival over several days as passioura 2002 had pointed out this paradox highlights a trade off between biomass and wue a high wue will result in low productivity for several months even if the plant survives a severe drought to overcome this paradox decrease in nocturnal transpiration is an important target because plants except those performing crassulacean acid metabolism cam photosynthesis do not need to open their stomata for co2 acquisition at night in fact plants lose a substantial amount of water during the night usually 5 15 and sometimes up to 30 of the water lost during daytime mainly due to incomplete stomatal closure caird et al 2007 if water loss at night occurs mainly via non stomatal routes such as the cuticle the reduction of water loss might be difficult coupel ledru et al 2016 showed that a considerable amount of nocturnal transpiration occurs via incompletely closed stomata and nocturnal stomatal conductance reduction improved wue without any decrease in the growth rate in grape vines these results suggest that reduction in nocturnal transpiration via stomatal closure is a promising way to reduce wasteful water loss for carbon gain however in addition to carbon assimilation if nocturnal transpiration is associated with certain physiological functions its reduction may inhibit plant growth for example previous studies have shown that nocturnal transpiration causes a hydraulic uplift of mineral nutrients to support shoot growth caird et al 2007 and increases efficiency of water uptake to expand leaf fricke 2019 these findings imply that nocturnal transpiration is important especially under drought conditions despite these physiological functions how soil moisture levels affect the relationship between nocturnal transpiration and growth as well as the extent to which suppression of the suggested physiological functions negatively affects plant growth has rarely been tested therefore we investigated the relationship between the extent of nocturnal transpiration and the production of biomass over a wide range of soil moisture levels from dry to waterlogged using rice oryza sativa l plants that can adapt to a wide range of soil moisture conditions as there are four types of rice ecosystem irrigated rainfed lowland deep water and rainfed upland bernier et al 2008 rice is the most important food crop and is consumed by approximately half the world s population maclean et al 2002 according to rahaman and shehab 2018 the water requirement for rice production is high 2497 l kg 1 almost double that for wheat 1350 l kg 1 and maize 1222 l kg 1 reduction of the amount of water consumed in rice production is important because of the global scale of area used for rice production approximately 1 65 108 ha in 2021 data from food and agriculture organization of the united nations in addition to the fact that agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of fresh water resources clarke and king 2004 furthermore approximately 98 of the water consumed by terrestrial plants is lost via transpiration morison 2007 therefore reduction of nocturnal transpiration in rice plants will have a significant worldwide impact however information on how nocturnal transpiration varies with soil moisture levels and how it relates to biomass production in plants including rice is scarce elevated levels of co2 eco2 and other global warming gases may lead to high temperatures and ultimately severe droughts worldwide dai 2011 water scarcity along with the growth in food demand and industrial development may make this amount of water consumption in agriculture unsustainable rosa et al 2020 it seems that the current need for high wue is in part derived from concerns that the climate change that is occurring in recent times may enhance drought prone conditions nevertheless it has been widely recognized that eco2 leads to enhancement of wue without growth reduction by causing a concomitant increase in photosynthesis and a decrease in stomatal conductance ainsworth and rogers 2007 polley 2002 however how eco2 affects water consumption has not been investigated in previous studies in this study we examined the amount of water consumed at the individual plant level during the day and the night using five rice genotypes grown under conditions of eight soil water levels and three co2 concentrations here we aimed to answer the following questions 1 does a reduction in nocturnal transpiration increase wue without growth reduction 2 how do soil moisture and co2 levels affect the extent of nocturnal transpiration in comparison to the level of whole day transpiration and does the extent of nocturnal transpiration differ among different genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth conditions a pot experiment was conducted on five rice genotypes cv nipponbare irat109 nerica 1 t65 and dv85 in three growth chambers lph 410 spc nippon medical chemical instruments co ltd japan with the following settings light intensity 400 µmol m 2 s 1 relative humidity 60 temperature 30 25 c day night respectively and photoperiod 14 10 h day night respectively the co2 concentrations in each chamber were maintained at approximately 400 600 and 800 ppm for low co2 lc medium co2 mc and high co2 hc conditions respectively the plants and co2 concentrations were switched weekly between the three chambers to minimize potential chamber effects a co2 recorder tr 76ui t d inc japan was placed inside each chamber to monitor the conditions every 5 min there were no significant differences in the temperature or relative humidity conditions among the chambers maintained at the three co2 concentrations fig 1 and table s1 average lc mc and hc co2 concentrations during the growth period 28 days were 407 0 4 0 610 1 2 4 and 843 1

transplanting nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k in the form of ammonium sulfate 21 0 n calcium superphosphate 17 5 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 0 k2o were uniformly mixed in the soil to obtain final concentrations of 0 2 g n 1 0 g p2o5 and 0 2 g k2o kg 1 dry soil the soil water content was maintained at 60 w w for all treatments for 10 d after transplantation subsequently the plants were grown in soils having eight water contents 30 35 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 w w for soils with water content higher than 60 the plants were watered with the required amount of water 11 days after transplanting to create 60 80 100 and 120 soil water conditions for plants grown in soils with water content below 60 the water supply was withdrawn 11 days after transplanting and then the soil was re watered until the target soil water content was attained 30 35 40 and 50 2 2 measurement of water use water use during the growth period 28 days after transplanting was measured using the gravitational method described in our previous study yi and yano 2021 the pots were covered with transparent plastic films to prevent soil evaporation these pots were weighed on the day of transplanting and before each watering until harvest the amount of water lost during transpiration was recorded for each pot after weighing the amount of water used during the growth period was calculated based on the cumulative transpiration the wue was calculated as the amount of plant biomass accumulated divided by the amount of water used during the growth period according to the formula reported by jones 2004 2 3 analysis of diurnal and nocturnal transpiration transpiration during the daytime td 22 27 and the nighttime tn 22 27 was measured 22 27 days after transplanting following

the leaf area was analyzed using a winrhizo pro la2400 system regent instruments inc canada and a flatbed scanner epson expression 10000xl seiko epson co japan since transpiration was influenced by leaf area which varied with different genotypes and growing conditions the transpiration rate transpiration per unit area was calculated to estimate the differences among plants treated with different soil water concentrations to eliminate the effect of leaf area the transpiration rates during the day ed 27 and night en 27 were calculated based on the diurnal and nocturnal transpiration on the 27th day after transplanting on a leaf area basis 2 4 harvest all plants were harvested 28 days after transplantation and dried to a constant mass in an oven at 80 c for determination of dry weight the samples were then ground into powder and used to determine the n content 2 5 statistical analysis the experiment was organized in a factorial design three co2 concentrations five varieties eight water

morphology at harvest is shown in fig 2 the plant size increased as the soil water content increased to 60 although morphologically it seems that co2 concentration did not affect plant size the total plant biomass was enhanced by co2 enrichment fig 3a e with an increase in soil water content the total plant biomass increased and the maximum biomass was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content depending on the genotype and the co2 concentration likewise water use increased with an increase in soil water content and the maximum water use was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content fig 3f j a slight decrease in water use upon co2 enrichment was observed in nipponbare p 0 046 irat109 p 0 003 and t65 p 0 004 but not in nerica 1 p 0 835 and dv85 p 0 613 table 1 due to enhancement in biomass and reduction in water use upon co2 enrichment wue was notably increased under conditions of mc and hc fig 3k o with an increase in soil water content the wue decreased to a minimum value at approximately 60 80 soil water content 3 2 transpiration during the day and the night to elucidate the relationship between biomass and transpiration during the nighttime and the daytime nocturnal and diurnal transpirations were recorded 22 27 days after plant transplanting with an increase in soil water content the tn 22 27 value increased linearly and the slopes were steeper for plants grown under high co2 concentrations than the slopes for those grown under lc fig 4a e in contrast the td 22 27 and the whole day transpiration tn 22 27 td 22 27 values increased with the increase in soil water content and saturation was observed at approximately 60 80 soil water content fig 4f o the td 22 27 values significantly decreased upon co2 enrichment for all genotypes although a significantly different value was not observed for nerica 1 p 0 069 the tn 22 27 td 22 27 values decreased upon co2 enrichment but significant differences in the values were observed only for irat109 p 0 020 and t65 p 0 004 the ratio of nocturnal transpiration to whole day transpiration tn 22 27 tn 22 27 td 22 27 increased remarkably with co2 enrichment the values initially showed a decreasing trend and then the values increased with the increase in soil water content showing a v shaped pattern fig 4p t 3 3 transpiration rates during the day and the night the en 27 values ranged from 0 21 to 2 73 mmol m 2 s 1 depending on the genotypes and the growth conditions fig 5a e the en 27 values increased linearly with the increase in soil water content and co2 enrichment had a negligible effect on these values even though the anova results indicated a small increase in the values for irat109 t65 and dv 85 table 1 in contrast the ed 27 values significantly decreased from 1 27 5 96 mmol m 2 s 1 under lc to 0 56 4 80 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 67 4 00 mmol m 2 s 1 under mc and hc conditions respectively fig 5f j with an increase in soil moisture the ed 27 values increased to a maximum at approximately 60 80 soil water content the en 27 ed 27 values were estimated to be 0 09 0 53 0 15 0 81 and 0 19 0 93 under lc mc and hc conditions respectively fig 5k o similar to the pattern of change in tn 22 27 tn 22 27 td 22 27 values the slope for en 27 ed 27 values showed a v shaped pattern of change with an increase in soil water content and the values showed a notable increase upon co2 enrichment 3 4 relationship between total plant biomass and transpiration to further distinguish the contributions of nocturnal and diurnal transpiration to biomass accumulation the relationships between total plant biomass and tn 22 27 td 22 27 and tn 22 27 td 22 27 values were analyzed a saturation curve was obtained using the values of total plant biomass and tn 22 27 and the curve was not affected by co2 concentration fig 6a e linear relationships were observed between the values of total plant biomass and td 22 27 and tn 22 27 td 22 27 fig 6f o furthermore the slope steepness increased upon co2 enrichment for all the genotypes 4 discussion 4 1 nocturnal transpiration favors growth under drought conditions excessive nocturnal transpiration without drought indicates wastage of water individual plant biomasses were linearly regressed against the td 22 27 values for all genotypes examined r 2 0 9 furthermore the slopes were steeper for plants grown under mc and hc than for those grown under lc conditions fig 6f j these results indicated that co2 assimilation was closely related to diurnal transpiration supporting the hypothesis that suppression of diurnal transpiration decreases biomass production in contrast the variation in co2 concentrations had a negligible effect on the pattern of change in plant biomass in response to increased transpiration at night when photosynthesis did not occur fig 6a e the nocturnal transpiration values increased linearly up to approximately 0 1 l per plant and then the curve showed saturation as the values did not show any further change interestingly the tn 22 27 values increased linearly with the increase in soil water content fig 4a e however the increase in td 22 27 values was suppressed when the soil water content was higher than 60 fig 4f j the difference in the relationship between biomass production and daytime and nighttime transpiration may be attributed to the difference in transpiration td 22 27 and tn 22 27 observed in response to the change in soil water content there are different views on whether nocturnal transpiration is wasteful or negligible in terms of total water consumption christman et al 2009 dayer et al 2021 and whether it is associated with certain physiological functions in plants fricke 2019 matimati et al 2014 however the effect of soil moisture levels on the relationship between nocturnal transpiration and plant growth has rarely been explored the novel finding of our study is that nocturnal transpiration favored plant growth but this phenomenon was dependent on the soil moisture levels fig 6a e however a turning point appeared when the transpired volume reached 0 1 l per plant regardless of the genotype and this point corresponded to approximately 60 soil water content fig 4a e indeed all growth parameters fig 3 as well as plant morphology fig 2 suggest that the onset of drought stress was at approximately 60 soil water content rice plants are cultivated not only in paddy soils but also in various ecosystem types such as upland rainfed lowland and deep water bernier et al 2008 the soil moisture levels were quite different among these types and moreover can fluctuate from dry to waterlogged within a single season especially under rainfed conditions our results suggest a significance of nocturnal transpiration when drought that can occur in rainfed environments by contrast nocturnal transpiration is obviously wasteful for irrigated paddy rice in which reducing nocturnal transpiration may not be harmful when the soil moisture content was below 60 there was a positive correlation between tn 22 27 values and biomass production therefore suppression of nocturnal transpiration may have a negative effect on plant growth especially on the n acquisition capacity fig s1 therefore in rice plants the n acquisition capacity per transpiration increased to compensate for the reduction in transpiration fig s1 changes in plasma membrane proteins such as transporters may be responsible for the increase in n acquisition capacity per transpiration i e increased soil to plant nitrogen transfer caird et al 2007 matimati et al 2014 4 2 genetic variability and the ratio of night day transpiration rate to soil water content similar to the pattern of change in tn 22 27 values fig 4a e the en 27 values increased linearly with an increase in soil water content fig 5a e however there was a minuscule change in the en 27 values under different co2 concentrations in contrast the tn 22 27 values tended to be higher under hc and mc than those under lc conditions and this finding was attributed to the larger leaf areas observed in plants grown under hc and mc conditions fig s2 the transpiration rate per unit leaf area is determined by stomatal aperture and stomatal density the latter may not only be increased in drought conditions zhao et al 2015 but may also be altered due to strong interactions between p nutrition of plants and soil moisture or atmospheric co2 levels sekiya and yano 2008 since the en 27 ed 27 value was derived from analysis of the same individual within a single day the effect of variation in stomatal density can be ignored considering the difference in vapor pressure deficit vpd during the day approximately 1 7 kpa and night approximately 1 3 kpa the transpiration rate should be 1 3 times higher during the day than that at night assuming that the size of the stomatal aperture is the same as expected the night day ratio of the transpiration rate was approximately 0 8 when the stomatal apertures were equal in size most of the genotypes increased en 27 ed 27 values near 0 8 in mc and hc conditions not only under severe drought but also at sufficient soil moisture levels fig 5k o in particular irat 109 showed the values above 0 8 under hc meaning that the stomatal aperture was wider during the night than that during the day consequently elevated co2 levels led to an increase in nocturnal transpiration fig 4a e but caused a reduction in diurnal transpiration fig 4f j thereby enhancing the overall proportion of nocturnal transpiration fig 4p t however an important exception was observed with the genotype t65 which showed en 27 ed 27 values less than 0 8 across all soil moisture and co2 concentrations this was the probable reason for the lower nocturnal transpiration rate observed for t65 compared with that of the other genotypes fig 4d however the wue of t65 especially under lc condition which should show low nocturnal transpiration levels under wet conditions fig 4d was lower than that of the other lines fig 3n this may be explained by the linear pattern of change in plant biomass in response to change in tn 27 values in t65 fig 6d which is different from the saturation curves obtained for the other genotypes fig 6a e as the saturation curves were an indication of wasteful transpiration therefore further investigations are required to confirm whether reduction in wasteful nocturnal transpiration is important to increase wue without growth reduction in genotypes showing saturated responses such as nipponbare fig 6a the en 27 ed 27 values were generally the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 the en 27 ed 27 values showed a v shaped pattern of change as the values increased when the soil moisture content was less or more than 50 fig 5k o notably the pattern of variation differed among the genotypes fig 5k o as mentioned above there was a positive relationship between nocturnal transpiration and biomass production when the soil water content was below 60 fig 6a 6e therefore an increase in the ratio of night day transpiration rate maintaining a high number of open stomata at night might have an adaptive significance in conditions of drought however an increase in the ratio of night day transpiration rate when the soil water content is more than 60 may lead to excessive water consumption which should be constrained from this perspective an l shaped pattern of change in en 27 ed 27 values corresponding to the change in soil water content is desirable the change in en 27 ed 27 values obtained for the t65 genotype resembled this l shaped pattern as the values hardly increased even under wet conditions in contrast irat 109 is another interesting genotype which showed relatively high en 27 ed 27 values and wide variation in the values compared to that of the other genotypes along with a relatively high biomass and a variable pattern of biomass production when grown in different soil moisture conditions fig 3a e overall it is important to elucidate the morphological and the physiological characteristics responsible for these genotypic differences 4 3 effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the ratio of night day transpiration rate the ratio of tn 22 27 to total transpiration varied widely from 6 to 35 and the percentage of tn 22 27 increased at co2 concentrations above 600 ppm fig 4p t this was because the co2 enriched environment strongly suppressed ed 27 fig 5f j while having a negligible effect on en 27 fig 5a e as a result the en 27 ed 27 values increased under mc and hc comparing to lc although the response of the values with respect to soil water content seemed to depend on the genotypes rather than the co2 concentrations fig 5k o this result suggests that a certain genotype displaying a response of night day transpiration rate to soil moisture level under the current co2 concentrations likely shows an elevated but similar response under high co2 concentrations as stomatal opening and closure involve the movement of solutes against a concentration gradient fischer 1968 this process is accompanied by energy consumption raschke 1970 maintenance of stomatal opening at night affects stomatal opening in light mansfield and heath 1961 therefore opening the pores wide during the day and closing them tightly at night low night day transpiration rate may be useful for reducing wasteful water consumption but may not be rational in terms of energy costs as mentioned earlier we found the lowest en ed values which imply the greatest energy costs for opening and closing stomata at around 50 soil moisture and the values increased i e lower the costs with higher the soil moisture fig 5k o considering the fact that the rice plants were able to close their stomata more tightly when the soil moisture was less than 50 fig 5a e such increased en ed values in the absence of drought may be due to saving the energy costs to close stomata tightly if so it may be advantageous to reduce stomatal density than to expend energy in stomatal opening and closure in general high co2 concentrations in the environment often lead to reduction of stomatal density which has often been discussed primarily in terms of co2 acquisition capacity but this phenomenon may also play an important role in suppression of water consumption especially in inhibition of nocturnal transpiration further studies including analysis of stomatal opening and morphology may be warranted 5 conclusions in this study we aimed to elucidate the following points 1 whether a reduction in nocturnal transpiration increases wue without reducing growth and 2 how soil moisture and co2 levels change the extent of nocturnal transpiration in comparison to the extent of whole day transpiration and does the extent of nocturnal transpiration differ among genotypes after conducting the experiment we found that the loss of significant quantities of water at night without any gain of carbon may be of some benefit to plants under drought conditions however it causes wastage of water resources under well watered conditions therefore the suppression of nocturnal transpiration under well watered conditions is an important target for reducing water consumption without compromising biomass production this is particularly true for rice production in paddy fields the ratio of nocturnal transpiration to diurnal transpiration was generally the lowest when the soil water content was approximately 50 and showed a v shaped pattern of change in all the genotypes examined furthermore the pattern of variation in the ratio of night day transpiration rate with respect to soil moisture content was similar under different co2 conditions indicating that estimation of the ratio of night day transpiration rate will help in selecting individuals that perform low levels of nocturnal transpiration under wet soil conditions which will be useful as co2 concentrations in the environment are expected to increase in the future funding this study was supported by the japan society for the promotion of science grant numbers 21h02328 credit authorship contribution statement yan yi

8872,with global climate change most parts of the world face more than one natural disaster field crops must cope with a combination of two or more stresses system vulnerability has changed and quantitative vulnerability analysis is imminent and challenging based on the crop water surplus deficit index cwsdi and low temperature index ltc this study used the copula method to establish a dynamic assessment model of maize vulnerability under different low temperature and drought concurrent stress intensities finally showed it in two forms of three dimensional surface and spatial distribution which was more vivid and comprehensive the main conclusions are as follows the peak number of individual events and concurrent events of low temperature and drought is significantly different the time trend of the number of concurrent events in each growth period is not the same and the interannual difference is significant low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate low temperature severity and drought severity had significant correlation based on this a 3 c vine copula model was established and passed the test the interaction between the joint probability of concurrent event intensity and the loss rate leads to complex changes in vulnerability when low temperature and drought are concurrent the vulnerability analysis cannot be simply superimposed by low temperature and drought intensity the vulnerability distribution of maize at different growth stages in songliao plain shows noticeable regional differences the central and southern parts of the study area are the most vulnerable areas under low temperature and drought stress this study s results can help managers adjust agricultural resources and adopt more effective irrigation policies under combined stress conditions keywords low temperature and drought concurrent stress vulnerability maize vine copula data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agricultural irrigation accounts for 70 of global freshwater consumption li et al 2022 and agricultural systems rely on a stable climate to sustain crop production two of the 17 united nations sustainable development goals are directly or indirectly related to agriculture goal 6 provide water and sanitation for all and sustainably manage them and goal 13 take urgent action to address climate change and its impacts tsani et al 2020 however the depletion of water resources the conflict between limited water supply and increasing water demand coupled with temperature and precipitation changes related to climate change biswas et al 2022 make agriculture face severe global challenges drought stress can affect crops external and internal structure photosynthetic rate and root development reducing crop yield liu et al 2021 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the normal growth and development of crops require a specific temperature range when the temperature is lower than the critical temperature required for growth it will cause stress to crops leng et al 2019 especially maize originates from tropical and subtropical regions and is very sensitive to low temperature stress especially in temperate planting areas avramova et al 2015 crops often experience multiple abiotic stresses simultaneously or continuously in the past few decades most studies have focused on the mechanism of plant response to a single stress chen et al 2021 megha et al 2017 ramazan et al 2021 song et al 2021 however domestic and foreign scholars pay less attention to low temperature and drought coupling stress in recent years only some scholars have used field experiments and uav multispectral remote sensing to explore the effects of low temperature and drought coupling stress on maize transcriptome expression root structure chlorophyll content and yield hussain et al 2020 qianqian et al 2021 crops under field conditions must cope with a combination of two or more stresses which may cause more severe damage to agricultural production than a single stress in particular stress combinations negatively affect crop growth and production in which the concurrent effects of temperature and water deficit conditions may be most detrimental to plant growth therefore it is crucial to reveal the response of crops to comprehensive stress and reduce the negative impact of multiple abiotic stresses on maize crops to improve agricultural production and food security the term vulnerability is derived from the latin which means harm with the continuous improvement of cognitive level the current concept of vulnerability has become a powerful analysis tool for the relationship between natural and social systems in response to disasters in the literature on disaster science vulnerability mainly emphasizes the resilience response and recovery ability of the human socio economic system when affected by disasters and focuses on the human factors of disaster vulnerability anees et al 2019 riyad fatema et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the united nations international strategy for disaster reduction believes that vulnerability is a factor that affects the sensitivity of communities to disasters due to natural social economic and environmental factors ismail zadeh et al 2014 nohrstedt et al 2021 ipcc believes that vulnerability refers to the degree of adverse effects of climate change on the system including climate variability and extreme climate events it is a function of the characteristics magnitude and rate of climate change sensitivity and adaptability within the system oliver smith and shen 2009 robinson 2020 sharma and ravindranath 2019 the united nations university environment and human security pointed out that vulnerability is risk receptors internal and dynamic characteristics communities regions countries infrastructure environment etc determining the expected loss under specific disasters it is determined by natural social economic and environmental factors and changes over time hui et al 2008 thomas et al 2018 with the change in the global environment and the rapid development of the economy society faces an increasingly severe threat from natural and artificial disasters most parts of the world are facing more than one natural disaster when a system suffers from two or more disasters the spatial and temporal relationship of influencing factors will change its vulnerability vulnerability analysis faces enormous challenges kappes et al 2012 marcos roberto et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the traditional two dimensional curve representing the loss of life or property caused by a single disaster cannot describe the multi dimensional relationship and the vulnerability surface came into being in 2005 luers proposed the analysis framework of vulnerability surface which conceptualizes vulnerability as a vector where relative vulnerability is represented by a position on a three dimensional surface luers 2005 vulnerability surface has been proven to be an effective architectural method li and van de lindt 2012 some scholars have begun to propose a three dimensional surface based on the concept of a vulnerability curve to express the vulnerability of crops to various disasters guo et al 2016 ming et al 2014 sicheng et al 2022 however only some scholars have applied three dimensional vulnerability surfaces to agricultural disaster research copula can be used to describe the complex nonlinear relationship in multivariate analysis it combines multi dimensional random variables with a dependency structure to solve the problem that traditional multivariate analysis methods are difficult to solve hasan tanim and goharian 2020 villalobos herrera et al 2021 the copula theory was first applied to the financial and hydrological fields and gradually matured aas et al 2009 favre et al 2004 mishra and singh 2011 patton 2006 because the copula function can describe the complex multivariate joint distribution characteristics more straightforwardly more and more copula based innovations have emerged in agronomy and meteorology in recent years for example establish new drought indexes jiao et al 2019 xu et al 2021 combined duration and severity analysis of frost risk chatrabgoun et al 2020 development of composite drought event assessment models guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however at present the binary copula method is mainly used under high dimensional conditions the correlation between variables is often different and the multi parameter copula has considerable limitations vine copula has better flexibility allowing us to combine single variables into various pairs of copulas to establish a joint distribution with a specific dependency structure czado and nagler 2022 potopová et al 2023 at present there are limitations in crop stress and its response research the space for increasing crop yield through agronomic technology alone is getting smaller and smaller therefore it is urgent to minimize the pressure caused by agrometeorological disasters through agrometeorological disaster risk management and comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the impact of low temperature and drought stress on maize this study aims to establish a new model to assess the dynamic vulnerability of maize to low temperature and drought concurrent stress the novelty of the research content is based on the vine copula conditional probability combined with the theories and techniques of crop science meteorology environmental science and statistics the three dimensional surface and regional scale are more vivid and comprehensive to evaluate maize s drought and low temperature vulnerability at different growth stages the possible loss of maize yield under different low temperature and drought intensities can be quantitatively estimated the research results can guide regional disaster prevention and mitigation work and provide more comprehensive information for managers to adjust agricultural resources and irrigation policies which have significant application value and practical significance 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the songliao plain is in the central part of northeast china between latitude 40 25 48 40 n and longitude 118 40 128 00 e it is an important maize base in china and one of the important temperate maize belts in the world the songliao plain contains 18 prefecture level administrative regions fig 1 a with a total area of about 35 104 km2 the elevation of the songliao plain is mostly below 200 m and most of the terrain is low and flat but the mountains and rivers are surrounded and the southeast and eastern edges are high the songliao plain belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate it is a transitional zone between the humid eastern monsoon region and the arid inland of china the four seasons are distinct winter is cold summer is high and rain is hot the average annual precipitation is between 350 and 800 mm and the average annual temperature is between 3 and 11 c the monthly total rainfall is the most in july and august with an average of 150 mm and the least in january and february with an average of less than 10 mm the monthly average temperature is between minus 15 c and 25 c and the average temperature exceeds 0 c after april the coldest months are december and january the low temperature below 38 c often occurs in these two months the hottest months are july and august with a maximum of 40 c the soil in songliao plain is fertile the terrain is flat and concentrated and the excellent natural conditions are suitable for maize growth however the songliao plain has a high latitude insufficient heat and is sensitive to climate change in recent years low temperatures and concurrent drought events have occurred frequently during the maize growth period causing a considerable impact 2 2 data sources the data used in this study and their sources are shown in table 1 the meteorological data are the daily data of 17 meteorological stations in the study area and its surrounding areas from 1990 to 2020 including the highest temperature the lowest temperature the average temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and other meteorological factors it is the observation data of china s ground basic meteorological stations the data are authoritative and come from the national meteorological information center however some stations may have missing data due to observation reasons and subsequent site screening is needed the maize yield data are mainly derived from the official statistical yearbook and bulletin of china s prefecture level administrative regions from 1990 to 2021 and the data are credible maize growth and development data from the national meteorological information center is provided by agricultural weather stations including sowing emergence three leaves jointing tasseling maturity and other dates but because the data in recent years is not open the time range is 1980 2009 the timeliness is poor in this study the whole growth period of maize was divided into three different growth stages as shown in table 2 the disaster data comes from the provincial meteorological disaster ceremony in china which is compiled by the china meteorological observatory by collecting and sorting out the relevant data the time and place of the disaster and the losses caused by the disaster are obtained dem data comes from geospatial data cloud which is repaired and processed by the chinese academy of sciences based on digital elevation model 3 methods the technical route of this paper is shown in fig 2 it mainly includes the following steps 1 calculate the low temperature index and drought index 2 run theory to extract disaster characteristic variables 3 calculate the yield loss rate 4 use kernel density estimation to analyze the characteristics of concurrent events 5 establish a vulnerability assessment model based on vine copula 6 quantitative vulnerability assessment by three dimensional vulnerability surface and spatial distribution of vulnerability 3 1 low temperature and drought analysis 3 1 1 crop water surplus deficit index cwsdi cwsdi is one of the indexes to characterize the water deficit of maize it is constructed according to the water demand and effective precipitation of maize in each growth stage which can well reflect the response of maize to agricultural drought in its growing period wang et al 2018 1 cwsdi i p ei et ci et ci in the formula p ei is the effective precipitation of crops mm et ci is crop water requirement mm i is each growth stage when cwsdi i 0 it means water surplus when cwsdi i 0 it means water deficit when cwsdi i 0 it indicates the water balance 2 p ei j 1 n p ej 3 p ei α j p j p j is the j th rainfall mm p ej is the j th effective rainfall mm α is the effective utilization times generally when p j 5 mm α j 0 when 5 p j 50 mm α j 0 9 when p j 50 mm α j 0 75 4 et c k c et 0 et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d calculated by the penman monteith p m model recommended by fao 56 suleiman and hoogenboom 2009 k c is the daily crop coefficient in this paper the crop coefficient values of each growth stage of maize given in the drought grade of spring maize in northern china are used qx t 259 2015 cma gov cn 3 1 2 low temperature index ltc the heat index f t combines biology and meteorology to reflect the effect of heat status on the growth and development of crops at various developmental stages zhao et al 2023 however due to the distribution of heat index being easily affected by latitude topography and other factors this study uses heat index anomaly as a low temperature index to analyze the occurrence of cold damage at different growth stages the calculation formulae are as follows 5 f t t t 1 t 2 t b t 0 t 1 t 2 t 0 b 6 b t 2 t 0 t 0 t 1 7 l t c f t f t f t t is the average daily temperature in a growth stage unit t 0 t 1 and t 2 are the optimum lower limit and upper limit temperature of spring maize in each growth period respectively the specific values are shown in fig 3 the greater the f t value the better the heat conditions and vice versa according to the statistical disaster data the events with 0 05 lt c 0 02 were judged as general cold damage and the events with lt c 0 05 were judged as severe cold damage 3 1 3 run theory the run theory is usually used to identify disaster events when the disaster index is lower than a certain threshold and the duration exceeds a certain length the disaster event is considered to occur based on cwsdi and ltc the eight variables of drought occurrence time number of drought events drought duration dd drought intensity di drought severity ds low temperature occurrence time number of low temperature events low temperature duration ld low temperature intensity li and low temperature severity ls were extracted by using the tour theory taking the drought events as an example the steps of the tour theory to extract the variables are as follows fig 4 the steps of the low temperature tour are similar 1 determine the drought index thresholds r0 and r1 set the 1st cutoff level to r0 0 and the 2nd cutoff level to the occurrence of light drought events at each reproductive stage according to the drought classification criteria used in this study such as r1 0 50 for gp ⅰ low temperature event r0 0 r1 0 50 2 initial identification of drought events using r1 values when the indicator value is less than r1 it can be considered as a drought event such as a b c d e and f in the figure 3 perform the merger of drought events and the calculation of duration intensity and severity when the interval between two drought events is one unit period b and c or e and f and the indicator value within the interval is less than r0 h the two events are combined into one drought event however if the indicator value in the interval is greater than r0 g two independent drought events b and c are considered to exist 3 2 copula model 3 2 1 kernel estimation when the data is asymmetric the common parametric copula model is usually not flexible enough for exploratory analysis of dependency structure through the r package kdecopula nagler 2018 the data is converted into pseudo observations of copulas by empirical probability integral rank transformation for estimation the program automatically selects the appropriate bandwidth by default and finally visualizes it as contour maps and surface maps 3 2 2 vine copula assume that there is a ternary distribution function f x 1 x 2 x 3 various decompositions can be made by the conditional probability theorem one of which is wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b 8 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f 3 12 x 3 x 1 x 2 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 f 1 x 1 convert the right side to a combination of copula and conditional marginal distribution functions when the edge distribution is known the conditional edge distribution is known so the focus is the copula function note that the first term on the right is a univariate probability density function and the conditional probability density function is also a probability density function sklar s theorem still holds so there are the following 9 f 13 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 using conditional probability formula 10 p a b c p a b c p b c 11 f 3 12 x 3 x 1 x 2 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 so 12 f 12 x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 13 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 2 x 2 14 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 c 23 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 f 3 x 3 finally 15 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 c 23 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 conditional copula is dependent on condition 2 so it is assumed that the conditional copula does not depend on x 2 but only on its own parameters so c 13 2 itself is a copula but it is different from c 13 table 3 lists six common copula functions and their parameter θ ranges li et al 2021 sadegh et al 2017 3 2 3 goodness of fit test the aic criterion method is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of copula function parameters the expression of aic criterion method is as follows 16 mse 1 n 1 i 1 n p ei p i 2 17 aic n ln mse 2 m n is the number of samples m is the number of parameters p ei and p i are the empirical probability and theoretical probability of joint distribution respectively the smaller the value of aic the better the fitting degree of the copula function 3 3 vulnerability assessment in this study vulnerability is the inherent attribute of maize itself and the degree of loss caused by environmental stress it is formed in the process of dynamic change of various elements and their interaction and influence and in turn becomes the driving factor of meteorological disasters in the regular vulnerability assessment the research objectives are mainly focused on forming the vulnerability curve in contrast establishing the vulnerability curve mostly stays at the two dimensional level involving only the strength and loss of a single stress factor however vulnerability is affected by different stresses and the two dimensional vulnerability curve is difficult to express the multi factor dependence structure of vulnerability therefore this study constructs a dynamic vulnerability assessment model based on vine copula finally the three dimensional vulnerability surface and vulnerability spatial distribution map is used to simulate the changes in drought stress low temperature stress and loss rate express the variability of vulnerability and improve the accuracy of vulnerability assessment the basic steps are as follows 1 calculate the weekly time scale cwsdi and ltc use the run theory to extract the disaster event related variables and use the pearson correlation analysis between the disaster variables and the yield loss rate to select the main variables as the model factors the calculation formula for yield loss rate yr is as follows 18 y m y y t 19 y r y m y t y m is meteorological yield y is maize yield y t is trend yield calculated by the 3 year moving average and yr is relative meteorological yield yield loss rate when it is negative 2 after selecting the model factors the r package vinecopula aas et al 2009 and cdvinecopulaconditional bevacqua et al 2017 were used to select the most suitable binary copula and vine based on the aic criterion and the corresponding parameters were obtained 3 according to the established 3 c vine copula model the vulnerability value is calculated and two different three dimensional surfaces are fitted to express the variability of vulnerability more vividly 4 the inverse distance weight method in arcgis software is used to interpolate the vulnerability to obtain a spatial distribution map 4 result and discussion 4 1 concurrent characteristics of low temperature and drought 4 1 1 number characteristics of concurrent events when the low temperature and drought events extracted by the run theory completely coincide or intersect they are defined as concurrent events the number of individual and concurrent events of each meteorological station in the past three decades was analyzed as shown in fig 5 because the time element is considered the uncertainty of the correlation between individual events and concurrent events increases and the peaks are significantly different gp ⅰ the highest number of drought events is up to 63 in qian an and the lowest is 48 in yongji the highest number of low temperature events is 59 in shangzhi and the lowest is only 38 in dawa but the highest number of concurrent events is in qian an and shuangliao with 39 occurrences and the lowest is 30 in pangshi gp ⅱ baicheng has the most insufficient temperature events and only one less drought event than qian an but the number of concurrent events is less the highest number of concurrent events is in dawa whose drought events do not occur much gp ⅲ the highest number of drought events is in changtu the highest number of low temperature events is in shangzhi and the highest number of concurrent events is in baicheng and harbin gpw the highest number of drought events is in xinmin and anshan and the lowest is in tongliao the most low temperature events were in yongji and the least in dawa the most concurrent events were in baicheng and the least in liaoyuan and xiuyan overall the relationship between two separate occasions and their concurrent events in different fertility periods is more complex than one might think and cannot be simply judged the effects of compound events should be studied more comprehensively considering the interaction effects the temporal variation of the number of concurrent events of maize low temperature and drought in songliao plain from 1990 to 2020 fig 6 shows that the temporal trend of concurrent events in each growth period is different the number of events in gp i fluctuated regularly from 1990 to 2014 except for 33 in 2003 and 26 in 2011 and only 4 in 2012 from 2015 2019 the number of low temperature and concurrent drought events increased significantly in gp ii concurrent events were concentrated in 1997 2001 but in recent years the number of fluctuations in 2017 2019 has increased significantly in gp iii there was a regular fluctuation for about five years before 2004 and the change tended to be gentle after 2004 with an average of 18 times per year in gp w the most events occurred in 2015 55 times and the least in 2020 and 1991 26 times it can be proved from the side that the songliao plain is sensitive to climate change which is caused by the instability of meteorological factors such as temperature and rainfall in the past three decades the considerable interannual variation in the number of concurrent events is mainly because the study was analyzed on a weekly scale which can be a side effect of the fact that the songliao plain is more sensitive to climate change a situation caused by the instability of meteorological factors such as temperature and rainfall in recent years therefore it is necessary to consider the impact of low temperature and drought concurrent events on maize and to develop new management strategies for the government and farmers 4 1 2 concurrent event kernel density estimation kernel density estimates of the severity intensity and duration of concurrent events at each reproductive stage were performed and finally presented as three dimensional and contour plots fig 7 shows the kernel density plot of the severity of concurrent events at each reproductive stage only gp i showed two distinct peaks with the highest density i e the highest frequency of occurrence when both ls and ds were biased toward the minimum and maximum for gp ii ls and ds were more biased toward the poles for example for a density of 0 6 ls was 0 0 2 when ds was at 0 6 1 0 and 0 0 2 when ls was at 0 6 1 0 gp iii concurrent event severity the distribution was flatter and there were no apparent peaks the gpw 3d plot showed an obvious regular wave pattern which nearly showed a specific density and with increasing ls the ds would gradually decrease however the density of concurrent events with minimum or maximum ds and ls at each reproductive stage was high and occurred with increased frequency fig 8 shows the kernel density plot of the intensity of concurrent events at each reproductive stage it can be found that the three dimensional surfaces are all flat and the values of di and hi are more evenly distributed with densities concentrated around 1 fig 9 shows the kernel density plot of the duration of concurrent events at each reproductive stage unlike the intensity there are apparent peaks in the period gp ⅰ the higher density values of dd and ld are concentrated between 0 and 0 4 indicating that drought and low temperature are mostly short duration in concurrent events at this reproductive stage gp ⅱ the concurrent events are mostly concurrent events of one to three weeks and the data are too concentrated to be displayed in 3d and contour plots gp ⅲ the higher density concurrent events are dd of 0 1 0 and ld of 0 0 2 the concurrent events in this reproductive stage are characterized by short medium and long term droughts and short term low temperatures occurring at the same time 4 2 dynamic vulnerability assessment model construction 4 2 1 correlation person correlation analysis was performed on the concurrent events ce dd di ds ld li ls and maize yield loss rate yr and the significance level was 0 05 vulnerability measures the degree of damage to the disaster affected body and is an essential part of disaster loss estimation and risk assessment therefore the loss rate of maize yield is selected as the primary variable it can be seen from fig 10 that ce and di were less and insignificantly correlated with yr dd and ds were significantly correlated with yr only during gpw but not in the rest of the reproductive period ld was significantly correlated with yr in gp ⅲ and gpw li was significantly correlated with yr in gp ⅰ and gpw only low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate were correlated considerably at all fertility periods while low temperature severity and drought severity were significantly and strongly correlated at all fertility periods therefore these three variables ds ls and yr were selected for constructing the vulnerability model 4 2 2 model construction and verification according to the previously selected variables the vine copula method is used to determine the three dimensional c vine copula with two trees and three edges as shown in fig 11 each box represents a node and each edge represents the corresponding binary copula low temperature severity was used as the root node to connect drought severity and maize yield loss rate the optimal copula was then chosen to build the dynamic vulnerability assessment and construct model table 4 shows the specific structure of the model with the corresponding bivariate copulas and particular parameters and provides the values of aic tests in addition to the aic criterion density contour plots of theoretical copula and empirical copula were compared to verify whether the constructed model was reasonable the results of tree2 for each fertility stage are shown in fig 12 and it can be found that the accuracy was higher in gp ⅰ and gp ⅲ followed by gp w and slightly worse in gp ⅱ but the aic test value is within the acceptable range in general the density plots do not differ much and most of the regions are more consistent indicating that the model can assess the dynamic assessment of vulnerability to coupled low temperature and drought stress in maize 4 3 vulnerability assessment of maize under concurrent stress finally the vulnerability assessment is carried out in three dimensional surface and spatial distribution the three dimensional surface map is based on evaluating the entire songliao plain reflecting the overall vulnerability of maize under low temperature and drought coupling stress in a study area which helps study macro disaster reduction the spatial distribution can deeply explore the vulnerability characteristics of maize under the coupling stress of low temperature and drought in each administrative region it can also analyze the distribution characteristics of maize vulnerability to low temperature and drought in the study area making the research more specific 4 3 1 three dimensional vulnerability assessment in this section two three dimensional surfaces were constructed based on maize drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield reduction rate in the songliao plain from 1990 to 2020 as shown in fig 13 the z axis is vulnerability a series xy axis are joint probability and loss rate of concurrent event severity b series xy is the severity of drought and low temperature events respectively few studies have focused on irrigation methods when drought and low temperature coincide therefore establishing a relationship between drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate provides more comprehensive information enabling managers and researchers to adjust corresponding irrigation policies and provide a reference for assessing the combined risk of crop drought and low temperature the interaction between the joint probability of concurrent event severity and the loss rate leads to complex changes in vulnerability fig 13 a gp i there are three apparent peaks the vulnerability is the highest when the concurrent event is 0 8 and the yield reduction rate is 0 2 the other two peak intervals are roughly merged into a joint probability of 0 2 0 7 and the yield reduction rate is 0 25 0 4 gp ii has the most complex vulnerability and the most extensive surface fluctuation except for the joint probability of 0 4 0 7 and the yield reduction rate of 0 15 0 6 the vulnerability of other combinations is high the region with the most heightened vulnerability is the joint probability 0 7 and the yield reduction rate 0 2 gp iii when the yield reduction rate is between 0 4 and 0 6 the vulnerability increases decreases increases decreases with the increase of the joint probability and there are two apparent peaks gpw when the joint probability 0 8 the vulnerability surface and the xy plane handover because the data is too much the software in the fitting process of the data edge part of the deviation as the error value processing is not analyzed the remaining surface appears two prominent peaks the joint probability is 0 2 0 4 the reduction rate is 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 0 6 when low temperature and drought coexist the relationship between low temperature and drought severity is quite complex and vulnerability analysis cannot be superimposed fig 13 b in gp i the trough that appeared in ds is 4 6 ls is 1 0 2 5 and low temperature and drought simultaneously in the high severity however the vulnerability is minimal because the growth stage of high severity concurrent events in the frequency is low and the late water and temperature can compensate for and reduce the impact on maize this result confirms that vulnerability results from the combined influence of multiple factors only by considering a single variable analysis will the results be biased in gp ii when ds is 1 the vulnerability increases with the increase of ls however when the ls is 1 5 the vulnerability decreases with the rise of ds and the highest value appears in the combination of low temperature high intensity and low intensity drought gp iii removes the error value that the severity tends to be 0 and the vulnerability increases when ds and ls increase simultaneously in gpw when ls 4 and ds 10 low temperature and drought events amplify each other when the severity increases the vulnerability increases much faster than the linear growth these results indicate that when low temperature and drought coincide their relationship is very complex and the effect of low temperature and drought stress cannot be ignored specific vulnerabilities related to drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield reduction rate can be visually seen based on different vulnerability surfaces global temperatures showed a rapid upward trend from the early 1980 s to the end of the 20th century researchers were more concerned about the impact of drought and high temperature events on crops pei et al 2022 tsuchida and yakushiji 2017 however in the first decade of the 21st century global temperature showed a warming stagnation phenomenon during which the average temperature in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere even showed a significant downward trend xiong et al 2023 the cooling effect of agricultural irrigation has been widely studied recently some scholars have found that irrigation reduces daytime surface temperature and water saving irrigation can reduce the cooling effect of irrigation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 therefore when low temperature and drought occur simultaneously water saving irrigation and topdressing can be considered to reduce losses 4 3 2 vulnerability distribution of songliao plain the vulnerability corresponding to concurrent events and loss rates can be obtained from the constructed 3 c vine copula model the spatial distribution map of the vulnerability of the study area from 1991 to 2020 was obtained by idw interpolation according to the average of each decade and the whole period which can more effectively analyze the spatial analysis of the vulnerability of low temperature and drought stress and more intuitively identify the relatively more sensitive areas of maize to water temperature stress fig 14 and fig 15 show the vulnerability distribution of maize at different growth stages in songliao plain the distribution of vulnerability in the study area shows noticeable regional differences mainly due to the high latitude and enormous latitude and longitude span of the songliao plain gp ⅰ the vulnerability is highest in the east central part of songliao plain followed by higher in the northeast and southeast mainly because of the large topographic relief in these areas and the rapid temperature change during this reproductive period which makes the temperature stress more serious the area of areas with the higher vulnerability of gp ⅱ expands and is significantly higher in the east and south which is verified according to the meteorological disaster canon statistics because most of the study area is in a semi arid monsoon climate with a long duration of summer drought and the impact range was large and the water stress was more severe gp iii the high value area of vulnerability is transferred tongliao siping and tieling in the middle of songliao plain have the highest vulnerability in this growth period the wind is relatively dry and the temperature fluctuation is large and the threat and loss are greater jilin and baicheng have the lowest vulnerability the climate in these two areas is relatively mild and the water and heat resources are rich the resistance is higher in the face of drought and low temperature concurrent stress gpw the most vulnerable administrative regions are harbin and songyuan which are dominated by temperature stress due to special latitude and terrain large temperature differences and temperature stress the vulnerability of gpw is much higher and the vulnerability of different regions is more different the songyuan area with the highest vulnerability is almost three times the lowest anshan area because the time span is longer when the low temperature and drought events are extracted by the whole growth season run theory the small events will be merged into large events and the severity will increase according to the spatial distribution of vulnerability at different growth stages it can be found that tongliao and siping areas are sensitive to temperature and water at most growth stages and long term severe stress of low temperature and drought may have a huge impact on maize in these areas the vulnerability of the study area was compared according to the average of every ten years and the whole period and the temporal evolution characteristics of vulnerability under low temperature and drought stress were determined from 1991 2000 the areas with high vulnerability of gp i gp ii and gpw were the largest and the southern songliao plain had the highest vulnerability from 2001 2010 the high value area of gp i and gp ii vulnerability decreased but the highest value increased one of the reasons was that the occurrence of cold damage in the 21st century showed a rising trend and low temperature in summer was common the high value area and the highest value of gp iii vulnerability increased significantly during this period the temperature fluctuated sharply and the rainfall decreased and the final yield of maize was damaged from 2011 2020 the area and vulnerability of high value areas of vulnerability in each growth stage were significantly reduced according to meteorological disaster records the impact of climate change was more obvious in this decade with rising temperatures and increasing flood events the vulnerability of different regions in the songliao plain is significantly different and the central and southern regions are considered the most vulnerable to low temperatures and drought stress especially in tongliao and siping areas the resistance to low temperature and drought events at different growth stages is poor and the loss is serious the main reason is that the drought duration of maize in these areas is long the temperature fluctuation is severe and the low temperature and drought stress is more serious from 1991 2000 the low temperature and drought stress in songliao plain was the most serious affected by global warming the high vulnerability area decreased significantly from 2011 to 2020 however the trend of cold damage has rebounded the frequent occurrence of low temperatures in summer and the increase of sudden drought events have led to increased vulnerability which still needs to be vigilant and prevented under the background of climate change the intensity and frequency of extreme water and temperature events increase which seriously threatens the growth of crops and may make the farmland system more vulnerable zhu et al 2022 however farmland s response to climate stress differs from other ecosystems farmland can alleviate the pressure of climate change through carefully planned management and irrigation systems especially in northeast china li et al 2021 the songliao plain is in the middle of humid and arid areas mainly rain fed agriculture there is no artificial irrigation during the whole growing season of maize and only natural precipitation is used as a water source in the face of drought and low temperature stress regions with relatively high economic levels can invest more funds in agricultural infrastructure construction to improve the overall disaster resistance level to reduce the pressure caused by adverse meteorological factors 5 conclusions based on cwsdi and ltc this study established a 3 c vine copula model for dynamic vulnerability assessment using the vine copula method which can quantify the vulnerability of maize under different low temperature and drought stress intensities the research provides new ideas and perspectives for the risk assessment of compound disasters and the results have significant reference value for adjusting agricultural resources and irrigation policies the main conclusions are as follows 1 the uncertainty between individual events and concurrent events of low temperature and drought increases and the number of peaks significantly differs the time trend of the number of concurrent events in each growth period is not the same and the interannual difference is enormous 2 there was a significant correlation between low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate in each growth period there was a significantly strong correlation between low temperature severity and drought severity the three variables of low temperature severity drought severity and maize yield loss rate were selected to construct a 3 c vine copula vulnerability model and verified 3 the interaction between joint probability and loss rate of concurrent event intensity leads to complex changes in vulnerability gp ii vulnerability response is the most difficult and surface fluctuation is the largest when low temperature and drought coexist the relationship between low temperature and drought intensity is quite complex and vulnerability analysis cannot be superimposed 4 the central and southern parts of the study area are considered the most vulnerable areas to low temperature and drought stress especially in tongliao and siping areas in addition due to global warming the areas with high vulnerability have decreased significantly in recent years however the trend of cold damage has rebounded the frequent occurrence of low temperatures in summer and the increase of sudden drought events have led to increased

8872,with global climate change most parts of the world face more than one natural disaster field crops must cope with a combination of two or more stresses system vulnerability has changed and quantitative vulnerability analysis is imminent and challenging based on the crop water surplus deficit index cwsdi and low temperature index ltc this study used the copula method to establish a dynamic assessment model of maize vulnerability under different low temperature and drought concurrent stress intensities finally showed it in two forms of three dimensional surface and spatial distribution which was more vivid and comprehensive the main conclusions are as follows the peak number of individual events and concurrent events of low temperature and drought is significantly different the time trend of the number of concurrent events in each growth period is not the same and the interannual difference is significant low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate low temperature severity and drought severity had significant correlation based on this a 3 c vine copula model was established and passed the test the interaction between the joint probability of concurrent event intensity and the loss rate leads to complex changes in vulnerability when low temperature and drought are concurrent the vulnerability analysis cannot be simply superimposed by low temperature and drought intensity the vulnerability distribution of maize at different growth stages in songliao plain shows noticeable regional differences the central and southern parts of the study area are the most vulnerable areas under low temperature and drought stress this study s results can help managers adjust agricultural resources and adopt more effective irrigation policies under combined stress conditions keywords low temperature and drought concurrent stress vulnerability maize vine copula data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agricultural irrigation accounts for 70 of global freshwater consumption li et al 2022 and agricultural systems rely on a stable climate to sustain crop production two of the 17 united nations sustainable development goals are directly or indirectly related to agriculture goal 6 provide water and sanitation for all and sustainably manage them and goal 13 take urgent action to address climate change and its impacts tsani et al 2020 however the depletion of water resources the conflict between limited water supply and increasing water demand coupled with temperature and precipitation changes related to climate change biswas et al 2022 make agriculture face severe global challenges drought stress can affect crops external and internal structure photosynthetic rate and root development reducing crop yield liu et al 2021 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the normal growth and development of crops require a specific temperature range when the temperature is lower than the critical temperature required for growth it will cause stress to crops leng et al 2019 especially maize originates from tropical and subtropical regions and is very sensitive to low temperature stress especially in temperate planting areas avramova et al 2015 crops often experience multiple abiotic stresses simultaneously or continuously in the past few decades most studies have focused on the mechanism of plant response to a single stress chen et al 2021 megha et al 2017 ramazan et al 2021 song et al 2021 however domestic and foreign scholars pay less attention to low temperature and drought coupling stress in recent years only some scholars have used field experiments and uav multispectral remote sensing to explore the effects of low temperature and drought coupling stress on maize transcriptome expression root structure chlorophyll content and yield hussain et al 2020 qianqian et al 2021 crops under field conditions must cope with a combination of two or more stresses which may cause more severe damage to agricultural production than a single stress in particular stress combinations negatively affect crop growth and production in which the concurrent effects of temperature and water deficit conditions may be most detrimental to plant growth therefore it is crucial to reveal the response of crops to comprehensive stress and reduce the negative impact of multiple abiotic stresses on maize crops to improve agricultural production and food security the term vulnerability is derived from the latin which means harm with the continuous improvement of cognitive level the current concept of vulnerability has become a powerful analysis tool for the relationship between natural and social systems in response to disasters in the literature on disaster science vulnerability mainly emphasizes the resilience response and recovery ability of the human socio economic system when affected by disasters and focuses on the human factors of disaster vulnerability anees et al 2019 riyad fatema et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the united nations international strategy for disaster reduction believes that vulnerability is a factor that affects the sensitivity of communities to disasters due to natural social economic and environmental factors ismail zadeh et al 2014 nohrstedt et al 2021 ipcc believes that vulnerability refers to the degree of adverse effects of climate change on the system including climate variability and extreme climate events it is a function of the characteristics magnitude and rate of climate change sensitivity and adaptability within the system oliver smith and shen 2009 robinson 2020 sharma and ravindranath 2019 the united nations university environment and human security pointed out that vulnerability is risk receptors internal and dynamic characteristics communities regions countries infrastructure environment etc determining the expected loss under specific disasters it is determined by natural social economic and environmental factors and changes over time hui et al 2008 thomas et al 2018 with the change in the global environment and the rapid development of the economy society faces an increasingly severe threat from natural and artificial disasters most parts of the world are facing more than one natural disaster when a system suffers from two or more disasters the spatial and temporal relationship of influencing factors will change its vulnerability vulnerability analysis faces enormous challenges kappes et al 2012 marcos roberto et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the traditional two dimensional curve representing the loss of life or property caused by a single disaster cannot describe the multi dimensional relationship and the vulnerability surface came into being in 2005 luers proposed the analysis framework of vulnerability surface which conceptualizes vulnerability as a vector where relative vulnerability is represented by a position on a three dimensional surface luers 2005 vulnerability surface has been proven to be an effective architectural method li and van de lindt 2012 some scholars have begun to propose a three dimensional surface based on the concept of a vulnerability curve to express the vulnerability of crops to various disasters guo et al 2016 ming et al 2014 sicheng et al 2022 however only some scholars have applied three dimensional vulnerability surfaces to agricultural disaster research copula can be used to describe the complex nonlinear relationship in multivariate analysis it combines multi dimensional random variables with a dependency structure to solve the problem that traditional multivariate analysis methods are difficult to solve hasan tanim and goharian 2020 villalobos herrera et al 2021 the copula theory was first applied to the financial and hydrological fields and gradually matured aas et al 2009 favre et al 2004 mishra and singh 2011 patton 2006 because the copula function can describe the complex multivariate joint distribution characteristics more straightforwardly more and more copula based innovations have emerged in agronomy and meteorology in recent years for example establish new drought indexes jiao et al 2019 xu et al 2021 combined duration and severity analysis of frost risk chatrabgoun et al 2020 development of composite drought event assessment models guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a however at present the binary copula method is mainly used under high dimensional conditions the correlation between variables is often different and the multi parameter copula has considerable limitations vine copula has better flexibility allowing us to combine single variables into various pairs of copulas to establish a joint distribution with a specific dependency structure czado and nagler 2022 potopová et al 2023 at present there are limitations in crop stress and its response research the space for increasing crop yield through agronomic technology alone is getting smaller and smaller therefore it is urgent to minimize the pressure caused by agrometeorological disasters through agrometeorological disaster risk management and comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the impact of low temperature and drought stress on maize this study aims to establish a new model to assess the dynamic vulnerability of maize to low temperature and drought concurrent stress the novelty of the research content is based on the vine copula conditional probability combined with the theories and techniques of crop science meteorology environmental science and statistics the three dimensional surface and regional scale are more vivid and comprehensive to evaluate maize s drought and low temperature vulnerability at different growth stages the possible loss of maize yield under different low temperature and drought intensities can be quantitatively estimated the research results can guide regional disaster prevention and mitigation work and provide more comprehensive information for managers to adjust agricultural resources and irrigation policies which have significant application value and practical significance 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the songliao plain is in the central part of northeast china between latitude 40 25 48 40 n and longitude 118 40 128 00 e it is an important maize base in china and one of the important temperate maize belts in the world the songliao plain contains 18 prefecture level administrative regions fig 1 a with a total area of about 35 104 km2 the elevation of the songliao plain is mostly below 200 m and most of the terrain is low and flat but the mountains and rivers are surrounded and the southeast and eastern edges are high the songliao plain belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate it is a transitional zone between the humid eastern monsoon region and the arid inland of china the four seasons are distinct winter is cold summer is high and rain is hot the average annual precipitation is between 350 and 800 mm and the average annual temperature is between 3 and 11 c the monthly total rainfall is the most in july and august with an average of 150 mm and the least in january and february with an average of less than 10 mm the monthly average temperature is between minus 15 c and 25 c and the average temperature exceeds 0 c after april the coldest months are december and january the low temperature below 38 c often occurs in these two months the hottest months are july and august with a maximum of 40 c the soil in songliao plain is fertile the terrain is flat and concentrated and the excellent natural conditions are suitable for maize growth however the songliao plain has a high latitude insufficient heat and is sensitive to climate change in recent years low temperatures and concurrent drought events have occurred frequently during the maize growth period causing a considerable impact 2 2 data sources the data used in this study and their sources are shown in table 1 the meteorological data are the daily data of 17 meteorological stations in the study area and its surrounding areas from 1990 to 2020 including the highest temperature the lowest temperature the average temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and other meteorological factors it is the observation data of china s ground basic meteorological stations the data are authoritative and come from the national meteorological information center however some stations may have missing data due to observation reasons and subsequent site screening is needed the maize yield data are mainly derived from the official statistical yearbook and bulletin of china s prefecture level administrative regions from 1990 to 2021 and the data are credible maize growth and development data from the national meteorological information center is provided by agricultural weather stations including sowing emergence three leaves jointing tasseling maturity and other dates but because the data in recent years is not open the time range is 1980 2009 the timeliness is poor in this study the whole growth period of maize was divided into three different growth stages as shown in table 2 the disaster data comes from the provincial meteorological disaster ceremony in china which is compiled by the china meteorological observatory by collecting and sorting out the relevant data the time and place of the disaster and the losses caused by the disaster are obtained dem data comes from geospatial data cloud which is repaired and processed by the chinese academy of sciences based on digital elevation model 3 methods the technical route of this paper is shown in fig 2 it mainly includes the following steps 1 calculate the low temperature index and drought index 2 run theory to extract disaster characteristic variables 3 calculate the yield loss rate 4 use kernel density estimation to analyze the characteristics of concurrent events 5 establish a vulnerability assessment model based on vine copula 6 quantitative vulnerability assessment by three dimensional vulnerability surface and spatial distribution of vulnerability 3 1 low temperature and drought analysis 3 1 1 crop water surplus deficit index cwsdi cwsdi is one of the indexes to characterize the water deficit of maize it is constructed according to the water demand and effective precipitation of maize in each growth stage which can well reflect the response of maize to agricultural drought in its growing period wang et al 2018 1 cwsdi i p ei et ci et ci in the formula p ei is the effective precipitation of crops mm et ci is crop water requirement mm i is each growth stage when cwsdi i 0 it means water surplus when cwsdi i 0 it means water deficit when cwsdi i 0 it indicates the water balance 2 p ei j 1 n p ej 3 p ei α j p j p j is the j th rainfall mm p ej is the j th effective rainfall mm α is the effective utilization times generally when p j 5 mm α j 0 when 5 p j 50 mm α j 0 9 when p j 50 mm α j 0 75 4 et c k c et 0 et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d calculated by the penman monteith p m model recommended by fao 56 suleiman and hoogenboom 2009 k c is the daily crop coefficient in this paper the crop coefficient values of each growth stage of maize given in the drought grade of spring maize in northern china are used qx t 259 2015 cma gov cn 3 1 2 low temperature index ltc the heat index f t combines biology and meteorology to reflect the effect of heat status on the growth and development of crops at various developmental stages zhao et al 2023 however due to the distribution of heat index being easily affected by latitude topography and other factors this study uses heat index anomaly as a low temperature index to analyze the occurrence of cold damage at different growth stages the calculation formulae are as follows 5 f t t t 1 t 2 t b t 0 t 1 t 2 t 0 b 6 b t 2 t 0 t 0 t 1 7 l t c f t f t f t t is the average daily temperature in a growth stage unit t 0 t 1 and t 2 are the optimum lower limit and upper limit temperature of spring maize in each growth period respectively the specific values are shown in fig 3 the greater the f t value the better the heat conditions and vice versa according to the statistical disaster data the events with 0 05 lt c 0 02 were judged as general cold damage and the events with lt c 0 05 were judged as severe cold damage 3 1 3 run theory the run theory is usually used to identify disaster events when the disaster index is lower than a certain threshold and the duration exceeds a certain length the disaster event is considered to occur based on cwsdi and ltc the eight variables of drought occurrence time number of drought events drought duration dd drought intensity di drought severity ds low temperature occurrence time number of low temperature events low temperature duration ld low temperature intensity li and low temperature severity ls were extracted by using the tour theory taking the drought events as an example the steps of the tour theory to extract the variables are as follows fig 4 the steps of the low temperature tour are similar 1 determine the drought index thresholds r0 and r1 set the 1st cutoff level to r0 0 and the 2nd cutoff level to the occurrence of light drought events at each reproductive stage according to the drought classification criteria used in this study such as r1 0 50 for gp ⅰ low temperature event r0 0 r1 0 50 2 initial identification of drought events using r1 values when the indicator value is less than r1 it can be considered as a drought event such as a b c d e and f in the figure 3 perform the merger of drought events and the calculation of duration intensity and severity when the interval between two drought events is one unit period b and c or e and f and the indicator value within the interval is less than r0 h the two events are combined into one drought event however if the indicator value in the interval is greater than r0 g two independent drought events b and c are considered to exist 3 2 copula model 3 2 1 kernel estimation when the data is asymmetric the common parametric copula model is usually not flexible enough for exploratory analysis of dependency structure through the r package kdecopula nagler 2018 the data is converted into pseudo observations of copulas by empirical probability integral rank transformation for estimation the program automatically selects the appropriate bandwidth by default and finally visualizes it as contour maps and surface maps 3 2 2 vine copula assume that there is a ternary distribution function f x 1 x 2 x 3 various decompositions can be made by the conditional probability theorem one of which is wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b 8 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f 3 12 x 3 x 1 x 2 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 f 1 x 1 convert the right side to a combination of copula and conditional marginal distribution functions when the edge distribution is known the conditional edge distribution is known so the focus is the copula function note that the first term on the right is a univariate probability density function and the conditional probability density function is also a probability density function sklar s theorem still holds so there are the following 9 f 13 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 using conditional probability formula 10 p a b c p a b c p b c 11 f 3 12 x 3 x 1 x 2 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 so 12 f 12 x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 13 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 2 x 2 14 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 c 23 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 f 3 x 3 finally 15 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c 13 2 f 1 2 x 1 x 2 f 3 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 c 23 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 conditional copula is dependent on condition 2 so it is assumed that the conditional copula does not depend on x 2 but only on its own parameters so c 13 2 itself is a copula but it is different from c 13 table 3 lists six common copula functions and their parameter θ ranges li et al 2021 sadegh et al 2017 3 2 3 goodness of fit test the aic criterion method is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of copula function parameters the expression of aic criterion method is as follows 16 mse 1 n 1 i 1 n p ei p i 2 17 aic n ln mse 2 m n is the number of samples m is the number of parameters p ei and p i are the empirical probability and theoretical probability of joint distribution respectively the smaller the value of aic the better the fitting degree of the copula function 3 3 vulnerability assessment in this study vulnerability is the inherent attribute of maize itself and the degree of loss caused by environmental stress it is formed in the process of dynamic change of various elements and their interaction and influence and in turn becomes the driving factor of meteorological disasters in the regular vulnerability assessment the research objectives are mainly focused on forming the vulnerability curve in contrast establishing the vulnerability curve mostly stays at the two dimensional level involving only the strength and loss of a single stress factor however vulnerability is affected by different stresses and the two dimensional vulnerability curve is difficult to express the multi factor dependence structure of vulnerability therefore this study constructs a dynamic vulnerability assessment model based on vine copula finally the three dimensional vulnerability surface and vulnerability spatial distribution map is used to simulate the changes in drought stress low temperature stress and loss rate express the variability of vulnerability and improve the accuracy of vulnerability assessment the basic steps are as follows 1 calculate the weekly time scale cwsdi and ltc use the run theory to extract the disaster event related variables and use the pearson correlation analysis between the disaster variables and the yield loss rate to select the main variables as the model factors the calculation formula for yield loss rate yr is as follows 18 y m y y t 19 y r y m y t y m is meteorological yield y is maize yield y t is trend yield calculated by the 3 year moving average and yr is relative meteorological yield yield loss rate when it is negative 2 after selecting the model factors the r package vinecopula aas et al 2009 and cdvinecopulaconditional bevacqua et al 2017 were used to select the most suitable binary copula and vine based on the aic criterion and the corresponding parameters were obtained 3 according to the established 3 c vine copula model the vulnerability value is calculated and two different three dimensional surfaces are fitted to express the variability of vulnerability more vividly 4 the inverse distance weight method in arcgis software is used to interpolate the vulnerability to obtain a spatial distribution map 4 result and discussion 4 1 concurrent characteristics of low temperature and drought 4 1 1 number characteristics of concurrent events when the low temperature and drought events extracted by the run theory completely coincide or intersect they are defined as concurrent events the number of individual and concurrent events of each meteorological station in the past three decades was analyzed as shown in fig 5 because the time element is considered the uncertainty of the correlation between individual events and concurrent events increases and the peaks are significantly different gp ⅰ the highest number of drought events is up to 63 in qian an and the lowest is 48 in yongji the highest number of low temperature events is 59 in shangzhi and the lowest is only 38 in dawa but the highest number of concurrent events is in qian an and shuangliao with 39 occurrences and the lowest is 30 in pangshi gp ⅱ baicheng has the most insufficient temperature events and only one less drought event than qian an but the number of concurrent events is less the highest number of concurrent events is in dawa whose drought events do not occur much gp ⅲ the highest number of drought events is in changtu the highest number of low temperature events is in shangzhi and the highest number of concurrent events is in baicheng and harbin gpw the highest number of drought events is in xinmin and anshan and the lowest is in tongliao the most low temperature events were in yongji and the least in dawa the most concurrent events were in baicheng and the least in liaoyuan and xiuyan overall the relationship between two separate occasions and their concurrent events in different fertility periods is more complex than one might think and cannot be simply judged the effects of compound events should be studied more comprehensively considering the interaction effects the temporal variation of the number of concurrent events of maize low temperature and drought in songliao plain from 1990 to 2020 fig 6 shows that the temporal trend of concurrent events in each growth period is different the number of events in gp i fluctuated regularly from 1990 to 2014 except for 33 in 2003 and 26 in 2011 and only 4 in 2012 from 2015 2019 the number of low temperature and concurrent drought events increased significantly in gp ii concurrent events were concentrated in 1997 2001 but in recent years the number of fluctuations in 2017 2019 has increased significantly in gp iii there was a regular fluctuation for about five years before 2004 and the change tended to be gentle after 2004 with an average of 18 times per year in gp w the most events occurred in 2015 55 times and the least in 2020 and 1991 26 times it can be proved from the side that the songliao plain is sensitive to climate change which is caused by the instability of meteorological factors such as temperature and rainfall in the past three decades the considerable interannual variation in the number of concurrent events is mainly because the study was analyzed on a weekly scale which can be a side effect of the fact that the songliao plain is more sensitive to climate change a situation caused by the instability of meteorological factors such as temperature and rainfall in recent years therefore it is necessary to consider the impact of low temperature and drought concurrent events on maize and to develop new management strategies for the government and farmers 4 1 2 concurrent event kernel density estimation kernel density estimates of the severity intensity and duration of concurrent events at each reproductive stage were performed and finally presented as three dimensional and contour plots fig 7 shows the kernel density plot of the severity of concurrent events at each reproductive stage only gp i showed two distinct peaks with the highest density i e the highest frequency of occurrence when both ls and ds were biased toward the minimum and maximum for gp ii ls and ds were more biased toward the poles for example for a density of 0 6 ls was 0 0 2 when ds was at 0 6 1 0 and 0 0 2 when ls was at 0 6 1 0 gp iii concurrent event severity the distribution was flatter and there were no apparent peaks the gpw 3d plot showed an obvious regular wave pattern which nearly showed a specific density and with increasing ls the ds would gradually decrease however the density of concurrent events with minimum or maximum ds and ls at each reproductive stage was high and occurred with increased frequency fig 8 shows the kernel density plot of the intensity of concurrent events at each reproductive stage it can be found that the three dimensional surfaces are all flat and the values of di and hi are more evenly distributed with densities concentrated around 1 fig 9 shows the kernel density plot of the duration of concurrent events at each reproductive stage unlike the intensity there are apparent peaks in the period gp ⅰ the higher density values of dd and ld are concentrated between 0 and 0 4 indicating that drought and low temperature are mostly short duration in concurrent events at this reproductive stage gp ⅱ the concurrent events are mostly concurrent events of one to three weeks and the data are too concentrated to be displayed in 3d and contour plots gp ⅲ the higher density concurrent events are dd of 0 1 0 and ld of 0 0 2 the concurrent events in this reproductive stage are characterized by short medium and long term droughts and short term low temperatures occurring at the same time 4 2 dynamic vulnerability assessment model construction 4 2 1 correlation person correlation analysis was performed on the concurrent events ce dd di ds ld li ls and maize yield loss rate yr and the significance level was 0 05 vulnerability measures the degree of damage to the disaster affected body and is an essential part of disaster loss estimation and risk assessment therefore the loss rate of maize yield is selected as the primary variable it can be seen from fig 10 that ce and di were less and insignificantly correlated with yr dd and ds were significantly correlated with yr only during gpw but not in the rest of the reproductive period ld was significantly correlated with yr in gp ⅲ and gpw li was significantly correlated with yr in gp ⅰ and gpw only low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate were correlated considerably at all fertility periods while low temperature severity and drought severity were significantly and strongly correlated at all fertility periods therefore these three variables ds ls and yr were selected for constructing the vulnerability model 4 2 2 model construction and verification according to the previously selected variables the vine copula method is used to determine the three dimensional c vine copula with two trees and three edges as shown in fig 11 each box represents a node and each edge represents the corresponding binary copula low temperature severity was used as the root node to connect drought severity and maize yield loss rate the optimal copula was then chosen to build the dynamic vulnerability assessment and construct model table 4 shows the specific structure of the model with the corresponding bivariate copulas and particular parameters and provides the values of aic tests in addition to the aic criterion density contour plots of theoretical copula and empirical copula were compared to verify whether the constructed model was reasonable the results of tree2 for each fertility stage are shown in fig 12 and it can be found that the accuracy was higher in gp ⅰ and gp ⅲ followed by gp w and slightly worse in gp ⅱ but the aic test value is within the acceptable range in general the density plots do not differ much and most of the regions are more consistent indicating that the model can assess the dynamic assessment of vulnerability to coupled low temperature and drought stress in maize 4 3 vulnerability assessment of maize under concurrent stress finally the vulnerability assessment is carried out in three dimensional surface and spatial distribution the three dimensional surface map is based on evaluating the entire songliao plain reflecting the overall vulnerability of maize under low temperature and drought coupling stress in a study area which helps study macro disaster reduction the spatial distribution can deeply explore the vulnerability characteristics of maize under the coupling stress of low temperature and drought in each administrative region it can also analyze the distribution characteristics of maize vulnerability to low temperature and drought in the study area making the research more specific 4 3 1 three dimensional vulnerability assessment in this section two three dimensional surfaces were constructed based on maize drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield reduction rate in the songliao plain from 1990 to 2020 as shown in fig 13 the z axis is vulnerability a series xy axis are joint probability and loss rate of concurrent event severity b series xy is the severity of drought and low temperature events respectively few studies have focused on irrigation methods when drought and low temperature coincide therefore establishing a relationship between drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate provides more comprehensive information enabling managers and researchers to adjust corresponding irrigation policies and provide a reference for assessing the combined risk of crop drought and low temperature the interaction between the joint probability of concurrent event severity and the loss rate leads to complex changes in vulnerability fig 13 a gp i there are three apparent peaks the vulnerability is the highest when the concurrent event is 0 8 and the yield reduction rate is 0 2 the other two peak intervals are roughly merged into a joint probability of 0 2 0 7 and the yield reduction rate is 0 25 0 4 gp ii has the most complex vulnerability and the most extensive surface fluctuation except for the joint probability of 0 4 0 7 and the yield reduction rate of 0 15 0 6 the vulnerability of other combinations is high the region with the most heightened vulnerability is the joint probability 0 7 and the yield reduction rate 0 2 gp iii when the yield reduction rate is between 0 4 and 0 6 the vulnerability increases decreases increases decreases with the increase of the joint probability and there are two apparent peaks gpw when the joint probability 0 8 the vulnerability surface and the xy plane handover because the data is too much the software in the fitting process of the data edge part of the deviation as the error value processing is not analyzed the remaining surface appears two prominent peaks the joint probability is 0 2 0 4 the reduction rate is 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 0 6 when low temperature and drought coexist the relationship between low temperature and drought severity is quite complex and vulnerability analysis cannot be superimposed fig 13 b in gp i the trough that appeared in ds is 4 6 ls is 1 0 2 5 and low temperature and drought simultaneously in the high severity however the vulnerability is minimal because the growth stage of high severity concurrent events in the frequency is low and the late water and temperature can compensate for and reduce the impact on maize this result confirms that vulnerability results from the combined influence of multiple factors only by considering a single variable analysis will the results be biased in gp ii when ds is 1 the vulnerability increases with the increase of ls however when the ls is 1 5 the vulnerability decreases with the rise of ds and the highest value appears in the combination of low temperature high intensity and low intensity drought gp iii removes the error value that the severity tends to be 0 and the vulnerability increases when ds and ls increase simultaneously in gpw when ls 4 and ds 10 low temperature and drought events amplify each other when the severity increases the vulnerability increases much faster than the linear growth these results indicate that when low temperature and drought coincide their relationship is very complex and the effect of low temperature and drought stress cannot be ignored specific vulnerabilities related to drought severity low temperature severity and maize yield reduction rate can be visually seen based on different vulnerability surfaces global temperatures showed a rapid upward trend from the early 1980 s to the end of the 20th century researchers were more concerned about the impact of drought and high temperature events on crops pei et al 2022 tsuchida and yakushiji 2017 however in the first decade of the 21st century global temperature showed a warming stagnation phenomenon during which the average temperature in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere even showed a significant downward trend xiong et al 2023 the cooling effect of agricultural irrigation has been widely studied recently some scholars have found that irrigation reduces daytime surface temperature and water saving irrigation can reduce the cooling effect of irrigation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 therefore when low temperature and drought occur simultaneously water saving irrigation and topdressing can be considered to reduce losses 4 3 2 vulnerability distribution of songliao plain the vulnerability corresponding to concurrent events and loss rates can be obtained from the constructed 3 c vine copula model the spatial distribution map of the vulnerability of the study area from 1991 to 2020 was obtained by idw interpolation according to the average of each decade and the whole period which can more effectively analyze the spatial analysis of the vulnerability of low temperature and drought stress and more intuitively identify the relatively more sensitive areas of maize to water temperature stress fig 14 and fig 15 show the vulnerability distribution of maize at different growth stages in songliao plain the distribution of vulnerability in the study area shows noticeable regional differences mainly due to the high latitude and enormous latitude and longitude span of the songliao plain gp ⅰ the vulnerability is highest in the east central part of songliao plain followed by higher in the northeast and southeast mainly because of the large topographic relief in these areas and the rapid temperature change during this reproductive period which makes the temperature stress more serious the area of areas with the higher vulnerability of gp ⅱ expands and is significantly higher in the east and south which is verified according to the meteorological disaster canon statistics because most of the study area is in a semi arid monsoon climate with a long duration of summer drought and the impact range was large and the water stress was more severe gp iii the high value area of vulnerability is transferred tongliao siping and tieling in the middle of songliao plain have the highest vulnerability in this growth period the wind is relatively dry and the temperature fluctuation is large and the threat and loss are greater jilin and baicheng have the lowest vulnerability the climate in these two areas is relatively mild and the water and heat resources are rich the resistance is higher in the face of drought and low temperature concurrent stress gpw the most vulnerable administrative regions are harbin and songyuan which are dominated by temperature stress due to special latitude and terrain large temperature differences and temperature stress the vulnerability of gpw is much higher and the vulnerability of different regions is more different the songyuan area with the highest vulnerability is almost three times the lowest anshan area because the time span is longer when the low temperature and drought events are extracted by the whole growth season run theory the small events will be merged into large events and the severity will increase according to the spatial distribution of vulnerability at different growth stages it can be found that tongliao and siping areas are sensitive to temperature and water at most growth stages and long term severe stress of low temperature and drought may have a huge impact on maize in these areas the vulnerability of the study area was compared according to the average of every ten years and the whole period and the temporal evolution characteristics of vulnerability under low temperature and drought stress were determined from 1991 2000 the areas with high vulnerability of gp i gp ii and gpw were the largest and the southern songliao plain had the highest vulnerability from 2001 2010 the high value area of gp i and gp ii vulnerability decreased but the highest value increased one of the reasons was that the occurrence of cold damage in the 21st century showed a rising trend and low temperature in summer was common the high value area and the highest value of gp iii vulnerability increased significantly during this period the temperature fluctuated sharply and the rainfall decreased and the final yield of maize was damaged from 2011 2020 the area and vulnerability of high value areas of vulnerability in each growth stage were significantly reduced according to meteorological disaster records the impact of climate change was more obvious in this decade with rising temperatures and increasing flood events the vulnerability of different regions in the songliao plain is significantly different and the central and southern regions are considered the most vulnerable to low temperatures and drought stress especially in tongliao and siping areas the resistance to low temperature and drought events at different growth stages is poor and the loss is serious the main reason is that the drought duration of maize in these areas is long the temperature fluctuation is severe and the low temperature and drought stress is more serious from 1991 2000 the low temperature and drought stress in songliao plain was the most serious affected by global warming the high vulnerability area decreased significantly from 2011 to 2020 however the trend of cold damage has rebounded the frequent occurrence of low temperatures in summer and the increase of sudden drought events have led to increased vulnerability which still needs to be vigilant and prevented under the background of climate change the intensity and frequency of extreme water and temperature events increase which seriously threatens the growth of crops and may make the farmland system more vulnerable zhu et al 2022 however farmland s response to climate stress differs from other ecosystems farmland can alleviate the pressure of climate change through carefully planned management and irrigation systems especially in northeast china li et al 2021 the songliao plain is in the middle of humid and arid areas mainly rain fed agriculture there is no artificial irrigation during the whole growing season of maize and only natural precipitation is used as a water source in the face of drought and low temperature stress regions with relatively high economic levels can invest more funds in agricultural infrastructure construction to improve the overall disaster resistance level to reduce the pressure caused by adverse meteorological factors 5 conclusions based on cwsdi and ltc this study established a 3 c vine copula model for dynamic vulnerability assessment using the vine copula method which can quantify the vulnerability of maize under different low temperature and drought stress intensities the research provides new ideas and perspectives for the risk assessment of compound disasters and the results have significant reference value for adjusting agricultural resources and irrigation policies the main conclusions are as follows 1 the uncertainty between individual events and concurrent events of low temperature and drought increases and the number of peaks significantly differs the time trend of the number of concurrent events in each growth period is not the same and the interannual difference is enormous 2 there was a significant correlation between low temperature severity and maize yield loss rate in each growth period there was a significantly strong correlation between low temperature severity and drought severity the three variables of low temperature severity drought severity and maize yield loss rate were selected to construct a 3 c vine copula vulnerability model and verified 3 the interaction between joint probability and loss rate of concurrent event intensity leads to complex changes in vulnerability gp ii vulnerability response is the most difficult and surface fluctuation is the largest when low temperature and drought coexist the relationship between low temperature and drought intensity is quite complex and vulnerability analysis cannot be superimposed 4 the central and southern parts of the study area are considered the most vulnerable areas to low temperature and drought stress especially in tongliao and siping areas in addition due to global warming the areas with high vulnerability have decreased significantly in recent years however the trend of cold damage has rebounded the frequent occurrence of low temperatures in summer and the increase of sudden drought events have led to increased vulnerability which still needs to be vigilant and prevented declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

8873,steep slope vineyards are widely distributed in the mediterranean region and have a pivotal role in wine production economic development and cultural heritage nevertheless they are threatened by climate change in terms of opposite weather extremes such as heavy rainfalls and long lasting droughts in response rainwater harvesting systems have emerged as valuable solutions for managing water resources and controlling related problems of primary importance is the identification of suitable sites for installation however a systematic selection procedure still needs to be explored it is necessary for morphologically complex vineyards that include historical features of significant cultural value such as terraced systems to fill this gap this study employed a high resolution overflow simulation model that combines a set of criteria to identify the optimal network of water harvesting structures also drawing on traditional knowledge and quantify the potential for water storage during rainfall of varying intensities the study area considered is located within the soave traditional vineyards north of italy site a globally important agricultural heritage system giahs recognized by fao the surface overflow was simulated considering two key rainstorms that occurred in the last few years at different time intervals 53 potential sites for water harvesting were selected according to field survey runoff simulation and topographic analysis the results indicate that the water potentially collected from designed sites could have a double function 1 mitigate the surface overflow that can potentially cause downslope terrace collapse or even flooding villages 2 provide irrigation water for vineyards during water scarcity scenarios the spatial distribution of the water collected could undoubtedly guide sustainable decisions in steep slope viticultural systems under climate change forcing keywords steep slope viticulture micro water storages high resolution topography weather extremes rainfall runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the steep slopes accommodate some of the most important vineyards in italy examples are the rural landscapes of the veneto region such as the hills where amarone prosecco and soave wines are produced the valtellina valley lombardy region the langhe piedmont region unesco cultural landscape the gran sasso national park abruzzo region as well as trentino alto adige etc eynard and dalmasso 1990 the soave traditional vineyards veneto region italy is a traditional terrace agricultural landscape that economically supports more than 3000 families in the past 200 years globally important agricultural heritage systems giahs 2018 the giahs programme safeguards the social cultural economic and environmental goods and services these rural areas provide a further relevant reality in veneto region italy is the steep slope viticulture of the colline del prosecco di conegliano e valdobbiadene a unesco world heritage site here the terracing practice of ciglioni has been adopted since 17th century another example is coming from the south of italy the ingenious techniques of cultivating head trained bush vines called alberello which can successfully protect vineyards from the wind and it is transmitted for centuries by vine growers and farmers of the mediterranean island of pantelleria chironi et al 2020 however these high value landscapes are often experiencing extreme weather events and these are predicted to continue in the future bai et al 2013 yin et al 2018 the challenge of growing intense rainfall is paralleled by the increasing prolonged drought straffelini and tarolli 2023 on the one hand climate change tends to have a more dramatic impact on steep slope agriculture than in other agriculture landscapes since the fraction distributed in the arid climate class will double in the future wang et al 2022a one of the worst examples is the drought that occurred in the north of italy in 2022 where 40 of the crop for the whole country and water levels have reached the lowest in the last 70 years levantesi 2022 on the other hand the increasing intensive rainfall led to landslides and even flooding in steep slope areas chen et al 2018 tarolli and straffelini 2020 wang et al 2022b the area of soave traditional vineyards has been exposed to extreme rainfall events that have caused extensive damage among the most severe is the october 31 2010 event more than 100 mm of rain in 72 h recorded at a nearby weather station which caused a creek to overflow and extensive flooding that caused millions in damage and fatalities more recent intense storms recorded in the area occurred on 1st september 2018 and on 29th august 2020 both events caused devastating consequences for the vines and economic losses for the local farmers pijl et al 2022 the 2020 event played an important role on farms and the public on the issue of climate change and associated impacts also due to an unprecedented downburst occurrence on that occasion surface runoff caused extensive land degradation in several farms and along rural roads in addition steep slopes in agricultural areas tend to be more susceptible to water deficits if control measures lack kimaro 2019 considering that water source management will be more complex due to future climatic conditions mitigating climate induced effects like extreme localized rainfall and prolonged droughts is urgent for the suitable development of steep slope viticulture compared to other kinds of farmlands the physical transport of water is more difficult and expensive in steep slope agriculture due to its complex topography in this case rainwater harvests are indispensable water supplies for irrigation and groundwater recharge wu et al 2018 water storage and harvest facilities are the best solutions for making each drop of water useful and decreasing surface overflow at the same time adham et al 2018 rainfall water can be collected in different approaches like runoff interception infiltration improvement in soil and integrated watershed management rockström and falkenmark 2015 water harvesting technique such as dams ditches tank and ponds etc combined with crop management has been proven as a plausible approach to address the water shortage issues and have been widely applied in many countries for years deora and nanore 2019 morgado et al 2022 munyasya et al 2022 odhiambo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for instance kumar et al 2008 derived suitable sites for water conservation structures like check dams contour bunding recharge pits wells and contour trenching on the regional scale kumar et al 2008 furthermore successful water conservation measures have multiple interacting implications in biophysical economic and ecological systems wordofa et al 2020 although the grapevines are experiencing previously unseen conditions due to extreme weather helder and joão 2018 naulleau et al 2022 few studies have been working on the more resilient sustainable water management in steep slope vineyards identifying the optimal position for water storage facilities is the key step to maximizing the water collected and crop production especially under extreme weather in areas with complex topographic conditions the main objective of this paper is to present a prototype of a water harvesting system consisting of low impact micro storages in detail the goals are 1 to simulate hydrological processes in steep slope viticulture for different rainfall events 2 to design a water reservoir system in optimal sites for both alleviating the runoff and harvesting rainwater with minimal disturbance to the local site giving the value of landscapes protected by fao 3 to quantify the water collected therefore also the runoff reduction of the designed water management system to be potentially re used then for irrigation this study provides new insights for farmers and decision makers in exploring rational and economic feasible water resource management which is meant for developing sustainable steep slope vinicultural systems particularly in the context of climate change and intense water pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the north eastern part of the soave vineyard north of italy a valley called brognoligo fig 1 45 27 12 07 n 11 16 41 98 e covering about 20 ha brognoligo is one of the most historic areas for wine production in the area of soave it is famous for manually producing full bodied and structured wine in a dry system the study area is on a steep slope with an average gradient of 17 degrees the elevation ranged from 98 to 217 m annual precipitation is around 1200 mm the dominant soil type in this area is clay the main land use is vineyard fig 1 fig 1 middle is a 3d map of overflow simulation to illustrate the potentially critical points in terms of flow accumulation in the study area fig 1 shows that all the runoff during the rainfall flows towards the downslope village white arrow in the figure the only drainage system in the village is a 1 meter deep and 0 5 meter wide ditch fig 1 picture c 2 2 the surface runoff simulation to quantify the efficiency of the water reservoirs we applied the simulated water erosion simwe model to simulate overland flow in different rainfall scenarios with and without designed water reservoirs simulated water erosion simwe was developed by mitas and mitasova 1998 a physically distributed model well recognized for real time overflow simulation which is widely used in flood risks estimation surface runoff analysis and accumulation as well as drainage systems design in recent years li et al 2020 the simwe model can quantitatively describe the spatial temporal water distribution in the complex agro hydrological process with only a few input data the input of simwe includes an elevation raster map manning s roughness values and rainfall excess mm h 1 the output includes a water depth raster map m and a water discharge raster map m3 s considering the simwe has a higher estimation for hydraulic risk with a high resolution elevation input map li et al 2020 this study applied a 1 meter high resolution digital elevation model the topographic dataset was produced by lidar data the runoff simulation is based on two extreme rainfall events that occurred in the veneto region on september 1st 2018 82 4 mm h 1 5 minutes step pijl et al 2020 and august 29th 2020 182 0 mm h 1 5 minutes step as indicated in pijl

hydrological model have already been validated and based on previous research in soave pijl et al 2022 straffelini et al 2022 are reported in table 1 2 3 water storage locations and design 53 potential sites were identified for water harvesting systems based on field survey and runoff simulation fig 2 different size of water reservoirs was developed according to the traditional knowledge of local farmers farmers were interviewed they also showed us some abandoned examples of micro storages that two generations ago were used to deal with these kinds of water storage solutions now no longer proposed the water storage volume was designed according to the amount of simulated runoff water depth and the surrounding environment ranges from 4 m3 to 30 m3 all the designed sites are generated by digging the hole on the ground with locally available materials similar to the picture e in fig 1 the operation of the water collection facilities in the study area is achieved by modifying the elevation of dtm the site of water storages facilities meets four conditions as follows 1 in the position where have potential runoff 2 in a direction perpendicular to the simulated overflow to intercept runoff more effectively 3 parallel to the contour lines to reduce the practical difficulties 4 between rows of vines where without interfere vineyard cultivation considering the increasing climate change influence on steep slope agriculture landscapes we separately based runoff simulation on two rainfall scenarios in 5 min and 10 min to identify the runoff intercepting and water saving function of the designed water reservoir under extreme rainfall events we chose the maximum 10 minute interval for two reasons 1 the peak rainfall recorded in this area 182 0 mm h 1 lasted for 5 min pijl et al 2022 2 the model reaches a steady state after 10 min as the input and output values are in equilibrium the investigation area highlighted by the red circle fig 2 is where to detect runoff reduction this area is chosen below the designed water storage and perpendicular to the direction of the simulated runoff simultaneously 2 4 statistical analysis the significance of mitigation of surface runoff by designed water management systems was statistically analyzed in different hydrological simulations specifically water depth values for each simulated rainfall intensity and at the two event times were compared the gridded values of model outputs were imported and analyzed in r software the comparison was made using the one way anova test to determine the differences between the simulations and the post hoc tukey kramer test to perform the pairwise comparison between the scenario without before and with after the implementation of the storages 3 result 3 1 the simulation of runoff fig 3 shows the simulated water depth blue label value before and after putting designed water reservoirs based on the rainfall events interval considered in the same time interval the water depth and surface overflow at 182 0 mm h 1 are much higher than at 82 4 mm h 1 similarly in the same rainfall scenario the water depth in 10 min is higher than in 5 min simulated water fluxes showed that water from the upslope mainly followed the ditches located in the center of the study area accumulated in the downslope and finally converged at the outlet of the terraces which is the only drainages system mentioned before fig 1 picture c in the 82 4 mm h 1 5 minutes rainfall scenario the average water depth and discharges are 0 07 m and 0 04 m3 s in the 82 4 mm h 1 10

182 0 mm h 1 10 minutes simulation the average water depth and discharge are 0 019 m and 0 02 m3 s fig 4 shows the magnification of the runoff path before and after putting water storage in several critical areas water accumulation in designed water storage facilities was highlighted by red rectangular the average water depth harvested by designed water storages facilities is 0 07 m 0 09 m 0 26

resource management facilities could collect water effectively in steep slope agricultural landscapes which is especially important for areas that are difficult to access by machinery due to poor traffic conditions 3 2 the effect of water resource management on runoff mitigation our result indicated that a water reservoir can decrease runoff significantly in the 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario 82 4

simulations in 82 4 mm h 1 and 182 0 mm h 1 rainfall events the effect of water decreased is much more significant in 10 min simulation which can be reflected by p value tests returned 0 000001 the

0 053 m 0 069 m fig 5 3 3 assessment of water amount saved by designed water storage fig 6 shows the water saved in the designed water reservoir in different scenarios the most efficient water storages are highlighted in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that the more effective water storage facilities are mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the study area the overall location remains the same although it changes slightly under different climatic conditions according to the calculation 33 67 m3 of water was saved in the 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario 41 92 m3 in the 82 4 mm h 1 10 min 116 74 m3 in the 182 0 mm h 1 5 min and 134 7 m3 in the 182 0 mm h 1 10 min scenario if we assume that all the water storage facilities are filled with water 500 m3 of water can be potentially collected 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of designing site specific water storages facilities for the steep slope viticulture landscapes our study concludes that the micro water storage systems have an enormous potential for water saving in steep slope agriculture in this study the micro water storages network was designed for four reasons 1 as one of few agricultural heritage sites worldwide recognized by fao in the giahs list soave traditional agricultural systems were not allowed to make massive land use shifts such as the construction of big dams or large farm ponds since it had already maintained by locally adapted management giahs 2018 2 to avoid larger and complex infrastructure that can be unstable on a steep slope all the designed water storages in this study are at a maximum depth of 1 m for safety reason 3 for a site specific reason several studies have documented the critical role of ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks etc in water harvesting ammar et al 2016 however different water harvesting structures have their particularities and purpose and require specific construction conditions vema et al 2019 for example check dams have been well recognized in china and india for alleviating the problem of water scarcity and preventing floods balooni et al 2008 yuan et al 2022 however check dams are only suitable in the catchment area 25 ha and agriculture ponds are available for small flat areas with slopes 5 ammar et al 2016 the percolation ponds are suitable on moderate slopes of 5 10 also more tend to recharge groundwater instead of irrigation water use christy and lakshmanan 2017 research has consistently shown that above water harvesting facilities are not plausible in the steep slopes viticulture with low runoff potential and high permeability vema et al 2019 4 the difficulty in transporting water in steep slope vineyards 5 economic acceptable by local farmers the introduction of complex new water storage systems can largely decrease water stress and the risk of crop failures in different scales of farming systems household community and catchment however in this case the investment cost is also expensive an economically feasible system with locally available material approaches is advisable in steep slope agriculture for multipurpose use rockström 2000 tiwari et al 2018 also emphasized the importance of time saving and cost effectiveness in water resource management our research highlighted the significance of the revival of traditional agricultural water harvesting facilities which is also well recognized by some other countries like india balooni et al 2008 4 2 improve water management efficiency by combining the smart irrigation systems for dry spell mitigation in our study 500 m3 of water can be potentially collected based on the previous research the minimum water consumption in the vineyard is 300 mm yr 1 medrano et al 2015 and approximately an entire month s water requirements for a hectare of vineyard in the mediterranean areas rain usually comes in sporadic unpredictable storms and is mainly lost in evaporation and runoff leaving frequent dry periods during the crop growing season oweis and hachum 2006 many researches about smart irrigation systems such as pressurized irrigation systems and automation of farm irrigation are applied for optimal irrigation scheduling bwambale et al 2022 kamienski et al 2019 ommani 2011 oweis and hachum 2006 vij et al 2020 however only a few studies focus on the water source for irrigation in mountainous areas one of the ideas from precision agriculture is to combine intelligent agricultural irrigation systems with designed water harvesting systems where funding allows to solve the problem of over irrigation in steep slope viticulture and thereby improve water productivity optimal distribution of limited water resources can also be coupled with improved irrigation management options and technologies such as supplemental deficit sprinkler and drip irrigation in this way tangible water productivity can be achieved on a sustainable basis baig et al 2013 geerts and raes 2009 man et al 2017 the collection of rural water can also be used to develop livestock farming and ecosystem diversity rockström 2000 water management guidelines should highlight maximum water productivity rather than land productivity geerts and raes 2009 oweis and hachum 2006 interesting is the optimization of the storage design to minimize water infiltration within the system and evaporation after water collection in the first case an impermeable layer such as a sheath should be installed to prevent percolation in the latter a shade net useful to reduce the surface water temperature and retain it during evaporation or a system of floating elements can be considered 4 3 runoff reduction via utilization of micro water harvesting systems our study concluded that micro water reservoir systems could significantly intercept runoff and harvest water in extreme rainfall events to be potentially used for irrigation during drought periods these dual benefits are not necessarily coincident in all types of water harvesting techniques sample and liu 2014 most studies of water harvest techniques have focused on water supply exclusively or large water harvesting facilities garg et al 2022 landicho et al 2022 in this study we aim to identify the influence of a micro water harvesting system with minimum land modifications however more water harvesting facilities are recommended to mitigate the hydrologic risk of extreme rainfall events especially considering that all runoff eventually drains downstream in the village 5 limitations and future challenges the accuracy of the rainfall runoff relationship simulated is highly dependent on the input data model complexity users adham et al 2018 and data availability for model calibration and validation in complex morphology areas are usually lacking therefore a limitation of this study could be determined by the use of a hydrological model and remote sensing data for process evaluation which inevitably incorporates errors nevertheless the simwe model based on high resolution remotely sensed data used in this research has already been successfully tested in the wine growing region and combined with field trials for verification pijl et al 2020 straffelini et al 2022 future challenges include the application of diverse high resolution datasets for example based on uav sfm in the delineation of potential sites for water harvesting structures and water leakages detection which is also confirmed by previous studies abdulla umar naseef and thomas 2016 chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 engman 1991 hammer et al 2011 waseem ghani et al 2013 in addition real time monitoring systems provide a shoulder to the farming industries in monitoring and tracking agricultural water use and improving the effectiveness of water retention measures at multiple scales foster et al 2020 there is a need for further research on the hydrological model development involving both surface and sub surface parameters such as groundwater discharge and evapotranspiration a novel way of estimating the trends of global irrigation dynamics based on multiple satellite products was reported recently zhang et al 2022 the development of finer spatiotemporal resolution satellite based products will significantly increase the effectiveness of water resource management in the future zhang et al 2022 the spatial design and organization of the vineyard can considerably affect surface runoff pathway and accumulation patterns pijl et al 2020 thus the same initiative should be repeated in other steep slope viticulture to avoid site specific biases this study clearly illustrates the water amount harvested by the designed method for irrigation use but this stands in contrast with the actual amount of irrigation in the study area however this research aimed to demonstrate the technical and methodological feasibility of incorporating water harvesting facilities based on remote sensing and modeling in the scenario analyzed 500 m3 of water can be harvested per 20 ha of vineyard thus about 25 m3 ha at the operational level further exploration of micro water harvesting systems is encouraged to obtain the maximum amount of water possible and to minimize leakage due to infiltration or evaporation combining micro water storage on steep slopes with larger ponds in morphologically suitable areas with storable volume could be interesting for instance in italy a farmer could construct up to 50 m3 ha storage facility without special permissions this value is indicated in the new national legislative proposal to address drought in agriculture d l 39 2023 the feasibility of larger infrastructures depends on the type of study area in the case of steep slope cultural landscapes such as the vineyard analyzed in this research further permitting constraints may arise in addition to construction difficulties due to complex morphology it is also recommended to line the interior of the storage with waterproof materials to limit infiltration combined with appropriate and sustainable covers to limit evaporation it is important to emphasize that the use of micro water storage alone cannot be sufficient to solve the problem of the impacts of opposing climate extremes such as intense rainfall and drought in steep slope agriculture indeed they need to be incorporated into a multidimensional planning strategy that combines water harvesting and precision irrigation with a series of targeted interventions promoting conservation agriculture techniques to maintain and improve soil organic carbon content could be useful for soil water retention particular attention should be paid to the vineyard grass cover to protect the soil limit runoff and increase biodiversity finally in cases where manual cultivation of the fields is not suitable light mechanization is recommended to limit soil compaction implementation of a water storage network combined with sustainable vineyard management and proper monitoring can therefore become a winning strategy in steep slope vineyards especially in the case of traditional and cultural landscapes for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change 6 conclusion improving water resource management in traditional landscapes is important for designing sustainable and climate change resilient agricultural systems this study designed a potential water harvesting network including 53 sites for collecting rainwater based on indigenous knowledge field survey runoff simulation and topographic analysis the study area is the fao giahs site of soave italy which has provided social cultural economic and environmental goods and services for over 200 years for local people vigotti 2021 the results show that these simple micro harvesting systems can considerably reduce the surface overflow with p values tests returned 0 001 and effectively collect rainwater in different rainfall conditions according to the calculation 33 67 m3 of water was saved in the 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario 41 92 m3 was saved in the 82 4 mm h 1 10 min 116 74 m3 saved in the 182 0 mm h 1 5 min and 134 7 m3 saved in the 182 0 mm h 1 10 min scenario a total of 500 m3 of water can be collected and used for emergency irrigation during drought the maximum drop in water depth at the outlet of the study area was 2 cm at 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario and 182 0 mm h 1 5 min scenario our work illustrated the urgent need to revival traditional and cost effective water resource management in steep slope viticulture furthermore we discussed that combining new irrigation technologies with designed water harvesting facilities will have a multiplier effect on improving water use given the specificities of steep slope agriculture there is a need to promote various indigenous water harvesting facilities and improve water productivity rather than designing more complex and expensive water management methods that are difficult for farmers to accept except when funding is available sustainable development can only be achieved when the water resource management systems are adapted to the local natural economic and social environment in steep slope viticulture credit authorship contribution

8873,steep slope vineyards are widely distributed in the mediterranean region and have a pivotal role in wine production economic development and cultural heritage nevertheless they are threatened by climate change in terms of opposite weather extremes such as heavy rainfalls and long lasting droughts in response rainwater harvesting systems have emerged as valuable solutions for managing water resources and controlling related problems of primary importance is the identification of suitable sites for installation however a systematic selection procedure still needs to be explored it is necessary for morphologically complex vineyards that include historical features of significant cultural value such as terraced systems to fill this gap this study employed a high resolution overflow simulation model that combines a set of criteria to identify the optimal network of water harvesting structures also drawing on traditional knowledge and quantify the potential for water storage during rainfall of varying intensities the study area considered is located within the soave traditional vineyards north of italy site a globally important agricultural heritage system giahs recognized by fao the surface overflow was simulated considering two key rainstorms that occurred in the last few years at different time intervals 53 potential sites for water harvesting were selected according to field survey runoff simulation and topographic analysis the results indicate that the water potentially collected from designed sites could have a double function 1 mitigate the surface overflow that can potentially cause downslope terrace collapse or even flooding villages 2 provide irrigation water for vineyards during water scarcity scenarios the spatial distribution of the water collected could undoubtedly guide sustainable decisions in steep slope viticultural systems under climate change forcing keywords steep slope viticulture micro water storages high resolution topography weather extremes rainfall runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the steep slopes accommodate some of the most important vineyards in italy examples are the rural landscapes of the veneto region such as the hills where amarone prosecco and soave wines are produced the valtellina valley lombardy region the langhe piedmont region unesco cultural landscape the gran sasso national park abruzzo region as well as trentino alto adige etc eynard and dalmasso 1990 the soave traditional vineyards veneto region italy is a traditional terrace agricultural landscape that economically supports more than 3000 families in the past 200 years globally important agricultural heritage systems giahs 2018 the giahs programme safeguards the social cultural economic and environmental goods and services these rural areas provide a further relevant reality in veneto region italy is the steep slope viticulture of the colline del prosecco di conegliano e valdobbiadene a unesco world heritage site here the terracing practice of ciglioni has been adopted since 17th century another example is coming from the south of italy the ingenious techniques of cultivating head trained bush vines called alberello which can successfully protect vineyards from the wind and it is transmitted for centuries by vine growers and farmers of the mediterranean island of pantelleria chironi et al 2020 however these high value landscapes are often experiencing extreme weather events and these are predicted to continue in the future bai et al 2013 yin et al 2018 the challenge of growing intense rainfall is paralleled by the increasing prolonged drought straffelini and tarolli 2023 on the one hand climate change tends to have a more dramatic impact on steep slope agriculture than in other agriculture landscapes since the fraction distributed in the arid climate class will double in the future wang et al 2022a one of the worst examples is the drought that occurred in the north of italy in 2022 where 40 of the crop for the whole country and water levels have reached the lowest in the last 70 years levantesi 2022 on the other hand the increasing intensive rainfall led to landslides and even flooding in steep slope areas chen et al 2018 tarolli and straffelini 2020 wang et al 2022b the area of soave traditional vineyards has been exposed to extreme rainfall events that have caused extensive damage among the most severe is the october 31 2010 event more than 100 mm of rain in 72 h recorded at a nearby weather station which caused a creek to overflow and extensive flooding that caused millions in damage and fatalities more recent intense storms recorded in the area occurred on 1st september 2018 and on 29th august 2020 both events caused devastating consequences for the vines and economic losses for the local farmers pijl et al 2022 the 2020 event played an important role on farms and the public on the issue of climate change and associated impacts also due to an unprecedented downburst occurrence on that occasion surface runoff caused extensive land degradation in several farms and along rural roads in addition steep slopes in agricultural areas tend to be more susceptible to water deficits if control measures lack kimaro 2019 considering that water source management will be more complex due to future climatic conditions mitigating climate induced effects like extreme localized rainfall and prolonged droughts is urgent for the suitable development of steep slope viticulture compared to other kinds of farmlands the physical transport of water is more difficult and expensive in steep slope agriculture due to its complex topography in this case rainwater harvests are indispensable water supplies for irrigation and groundwater recharge wu et al 2018 water storage and harvest facilities are the best solutions for making each drop of water useful and decreasing surface overflow at the same time adham et al 2018 rainfall water can be collected in different approaches like runoff interception infiltration improvement in soil and integrated watershed management rockström and falkenmark 2015 water harvesting technique such as dams ditches tank and ponds etc combined with crop management has been proven as a plausible approach to address the water shortage issues and have been widely applied in many countries for years deora and nanore 2019 morgado et al 2022 munyasya et al 2022 odhiambo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for instance kumar et al 2008 derived suitable sites for water conservation structures like check dams contour bunding recharge pits wells and contour trenching on the regional scale kumar et al 2008 furthermore successful water conservation measures have multiple interacting implications in biophysical economic and ecological systems wordofa et al 2020 although the grapevines are experiencing previously unseen conditions due to extreme weather helder and joão 2018 naulleau et al 2022 few studies have been working on the more resilient sustainable water management in steep slope vineyards identifying the optimal position for water storage facilities is the key step to maximizing the water collected and crop production especially under extreme weather in areas with complex topographic conditions the main objective of this paper is to present a prototype of a water harvesting system consisting of low impact micro storages in detail the goals are 1 to simulate hydrological processes in steep slope viticulture for different rainfall events 2 to design a water reservoir system in optimal sites for both alleviating the runoff and harvesting rainwater with minimal disturbance to the local site giving the value of landscapes protected by fao 3 to quantify the water collected therefore also the runoff reduction of the designed water management system to be potentially re used then for irrigation this study provides new insights for farmers and decision makers in exploring rational and economic feasible water resource management which is meant for developing sustainable steep slope vinicultural systems particularly in the context of climate change and intense water pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the north eastern part of the soave vineyard north of italy a valley called brognoligo fig 1 45 27 12 07 n 11 16 41 98 e covering about 20 ha brognoligo is one of the most historic areas for wine production in the area of soave it is famous for manually producing full bodied and structured wine in a dry system the study area is on a steep slope with an average gradient of 17 degrees the elevation ranged from 98 to 217 m annual precipitation is around 1200 mm the dominant soil type in this area is clay the main land use is vineyard fig 1 fig 1 middle is a 3d map of overflow simulation to illustrate the potentially critical points in terms of flow accumulation

meter wide ditch fig 1 picture c 2 2 the surface runoff simulation to quantify the efficiency of the water reservoirs we applied the simulated water erosion simwe model to simulate overland flow in different rainfall scenarios with and without designed water reservoirs simulated water erosion simwe was developed by mitas and mitasova 1998 a physically distributed model well recognized for real time overflow simulation which is widely used in flood risks estimation surface runoff analysis and accumulation as well as drainage systems design in recent years li et al 2020 the simwe model can quantitatively describe the spatial temporal water distribution in the complex agro hydrological process with only a few input data the input of simwe includes an elevation raster map manning s roughness values and rainfall excess mm h 1 the output includes a water depth raster map m and a water discharge raster map m3 s considering the simwe has a higher estimation for hydraulic risk with a high resolution elevation input map li et al 2020 this study applied a 1 meter high resolution digital elevation model the topographic dataset was produced by lidar data the runoff simulation is based on two extreme rainfall events that occurred in the veneto region on september 1st 2018 82 4 mm h 1 5 minutes step pijl et al 2020 and august 29th 2020 182 0 mm h 1 5 minutes step as indicated in pijl

recognized by fao in the giahs list soave traditional agricultural systems were not allowed to make massive land use shifts such as the construction of big dams or large farm ponds since it had already maintained by locally adapted management giahs 2018 2 to avoid larger and complex infrastructure that can be unstable on a steep slope all the designed water storages in this study are at a maximum depth of 1 m for safety reason 3 for a site specific reason several studies have documented the critical role of ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks etc in water harvesting ammar et al 2016 however different water harvesting structures have their particularities and purpose and require specific construction conditions vema et al 2019 for example check dams have been well recognized in china and india for alleviating the problem of water scarcity and preventing floods balooni et al 2008 yuan et al 2022 however check dams are only suitable in the catchment area 25 ha and agriculture ponds are available for small flat areas with slopes 5 ammar et al 2016 the percolation ponds are suitable on moderate slopes of 5 10 also more tend to recharge groundwater instead of irrigation water use christy and lakshmanan 2017 research has consistently shown that above water harvesting facilities are not plausible in the steep slopes viticulture with low runoff potential and high permeability vema et al 2019 4 the difficulty in transporting water in steep slope vineyards 5 economic acceptable by local farmers the introduction of complex new water storage systems can largely decrease water stress and the risk of crop failures in different scales of farming systems household community and catchment however in this case the investment cost is also expensive an economically feasible system with locally available material approaches is advisable in steep slope agriculture for multipurpose use rockström 2000 tiwari et al 2018 also emphasized the importance of time saving and cost effectiveness in water resource management our research highlighted the significance of the revival of traditional agricultural water harvesting facilities which is also well recognized by some other countries like india balooni et al 2008 4 2 improve water management efficiency by combining the smart irrigation systems for dry spell mitigation in our study 500 m3 of water can be potentially collected based on the previous research the minimum water consumption in the vineyard is 300 mm yr 1 medrano et al 2015 and approximately an entire month s water requirements for a hectare of vineyard in the mediterranean areas rain usually comes in sporadic unpredictable storms and is mainly lost in evaporation and runoff leaving frequent dry periods during the crop growing season oweis and hachum 2006 many researches about smart irrigation systems such as pressurized irrigation systems and automation of farm irrigation are applied for optimal irrigation scheduling bwambale et al 2022 kamienski et al 2019 ommani 2011 oweis and hachum 2006 vij et al 2020 however only a few studies focus on the water source for irrigation in mountainous areas one of the ideas from precision agriculture is to combine intelligent agricultural irrigation systems with designed water harvesting systems where funding allows to solve the problem of over irrigation in steep slope viticulture and thereby improve water productivity optimal distribution of limited water resources can also be coupled with improved irrigation management options and technologies such as supplemental deficit sprinkler and drip irrigation in this way tangible water productivity can be achieved on a sustainable basis baig et al 2013 geerts and raes 2009 man et al 2017 the collection of rural water can also be used to develop livestock farming and ecosystem diversity rockström 2000 water management guidelines should highlight maximum water productivity rather than land productivity geerts and raes 2009 oweis and hachum 2006 interesting is the optimization of the storage design to minimize water infiltration within the system and evaporation after water collection in the first case an impermeable layer such as a sheath should be installed to prevent percolation in the latter a shade net useful to reduce the surface water temperature and retain it during evaporation or a system of floating elements can be considered 4 3 runoff reduction via utilization of micro water harvesting systems our study concluded that micro water reservoir systems could significantly intercept runoff and harvest water in extreme rainfall events to be potentially used for irrigation during drought periods these dual benefits are not necessarily coincident in all types of water harvesting techniques sample and liu 2014 most studies of water harvest techniques have focused on water supply exclusively or large water harvesting facilities garg et al 2022 landicho et al 2022 in this study we aim to identify the influence of a micro water harvesting system with minimum land modifications however more water harvesting facilities are recommended to mitigate the hydrologic risk of extreme rainfall events especially considering that all runoff eventually drains downstream in the village 5 limitations and future challenges the accuracy of the rainfall runoff relationship simulated is highly dependent on the input data model complexity users adham et al 2018 and data availability for model calibration and validation in complex morphology areas are usually lacking therefore a limitation of this study could be determined by the use of a hydrological model and remote sensing data for process evaluation which inevitably incorporates errors nevertheless the simwe model based on high resolution remotely sensed data used in this research has already been successfully tested in the wine growing region and combined with field trials for verification pijl et al 2020 straffelini et al 2022 future challenges include the application of diverse high resolution datasets for example based on uav sfm in the delineation of potential sites for water harvesting structures and water leakages detection which is also confirmed by previous studies abdulla umar naseef and thomas 2016 chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 engman 1991 hammer et al 2011 waseem ghani et al 2013 in addition real time monitoring systems provide a shoulder to the farming industries in monitoring and tracking agricultural water use and improving the effectiveness of water retention measures at multiple scales foster et al 2020 there is a need for further research on the hydrological model development involving both surface and sub surface parameters such as groundwater discharge and evapotranspiration a novel way of estimating the trends of global irrigation dynamics based on multiple satellite products was reported recently zhang et al 2022 the development of finer spatiotemporal resolution satellite based products will significantly increase the effectiveness of water resource management in the future zhang et al 2022 the spatial design and organization of the vineyard can considerably affect surface runoff pathway and accumulation patterns pijl et al 2020 thus the same initiative should be repeated in other steep slope viticulture to avoid site specific biases this study clearly illustrates the water amount harvested by the designed method for irrigation use but this stands in contrast with the actual amount of irrigation in the study area however this research aimed to demonstrate the technical and methodological feasibility of incorporating water harvesting facilities based on remote sensing and modeling in the scenario analyzed 500 m3 of water can be harvested per 20 ha of vineyard thus about 25 m3 ha at the operational level further exploration of micro water harvesting systems is encouraged to obtain the maximum amount of water possible and to minimize leakage due to infiltration or evaporation combining micro water storage on steep slopes with larger ponds in morphologically suitable areas with storable volume could be interesting for instance in italy a farmer could construct up to 50 m3 ha storage facility without special permissions this value is indicated in the new national legislative proposal to address drought in agriculture d l 39 2023 the feasibility of larger infrastructures depends on the type of study area in the case of steep slope cultural landscapes such as the vineyard analyzed in this research further permitting constraints may arise in addition to construction difficulties due to complex morphology it is also recommended to line the interior of the storage with waterproof materials to limit infiltration combined with appropriate and sustainable covers to limit evaporation it is important to emphasize that the use of micro water storage alone cannot be sufficient to solve the problem of the impacts of opposing climate extremes such as intense rainfall and drought in steep slope agriculture indeed they need to be incorporated into a multidimensional planning strategy that combines water harvesting and precision irrigation with a series of targeted interventions promoting conservation agriculture techniques to maintain and improve soil organic carbon content could be useful for soil water retention particular attention should be paid to the vineyard grass cover to protect the soil limit runoff and increase biodiversity finally in cases where manual cultivation of the fields is not suitable light mechanization is recommended to limit soil compaction implementation of a water storage network combined with sustainable vineyard management and proper monitoring can therefore become a winning strategy in steep slope vineyards especially in the case of traditional and cultural landscapes for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change 6 conclusion improving water resource management in traditional landscapes is important for designing sustainable and climate change resilient agricultural systems this study designed a potential water harvesting network including 53 sites for collecting rainwater based on indigenous knowledge field survey runoff simulation and topographic analysis the study area is the fao giahs site of soave italy which has provided social cultural economic and environmental goods and services for over 200 years for local people vigotti 2021 the results show that these simple micro harvesting systems can considerably reduce the surface overflow with p values tests returned 0 001 and effectively collect rainwater in different rainfall conditions according to the calculation 33 67 m3 of water was saved in the 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario 41 92 m3 was saved in the 82 4 mm h 1 10 min 116 74 m3 saved in the 182 0 mm h 1 5 min and 134 7 m3 saved in the 182 0 mm h 1 10 min scenario a total of 500 m3 of water can be collected and used for emergency irrigation during drought the maximum drop in water depth at the outlet of the study area was 2 cm at 82 4 mm h 1 5 min scenario and 182 0 mm h 1 5 min scenario our work illustrated the urgent need to revival traditional and cost effective water resource management in steep slope viticulture furthermore we discussed that combining new irrigation technologies with designed water harvesting facilities will have a multiplier effect on improving water use given the specificities of steep slope agriculture there is a need to promote various indigenous water harvesting facilities and improve water productivity rather than designing more complex and expensive water management methods that are difficult for farmers to accept except when funding is available sustainable development can only be achieved when the water resource management systems are adapted to the local natural economic and social environment in steep slope viticulture credit authorship contribution

8874,wine production is being threatened by climate change particularly in the mediterranean region thus more knowledge on vineyards well functioning and adjustments to drought conditions is essential we aimed to understand how grapevine varieties from different european origins under the same climatic context respond to water stress and whether the climatic origin plays a role in their water use efficiency wue with that in mind we assessed the carbon isotopic signatures δ13c in berry juice and phloem of 172 white and red grapevine varieties grown in herdade do esporão alentejo portugal from five different climatic origins in two different rainfed water treatments with full and no irrigation our findings indicate that there is a 13c enrichment in both berry juice and phloem under water stress regardless of the climatic origin of the grapevine varieties this suggests that the plants exhibited greater stomatal regulation and tighter control over water loss during drought conditions also we found a positive correlation between berry juice and phloem δ13c signatures that is maintained under limited water conditions i e non irrigated rainfed condition ni rf six clusters based on δ13c patterns in ni rf were obtained and the varieties that showed the higher wue listed the patterns of δ13c drought adjustments differences among water treatments were dependent on specific varieties capacity to acclimate and the varieties that were grouped as the ones with high wue in ni rf also showed greater δ13c drought adjustments these results highlight a range of wue adjustments revealed through phloem isotopic analysis being phloem δ13c signature a complementary and promising proxy to assess grapevine varieties drought acclimation capacity our study reinforces vineyard plasticity and great adaptative ability transversal to several grapevine varieties with different climatic origins the results provided might be a complementary support to identify the varieties that are potentially more physiologically equipped under drought and to further explore their vitality and grape quality under sustainable water management scenarios keywords climatic origin stable

production has great value worldwide being one of the main agro industrial activities rockenbach et al 2011 involving several producing countries encompassing distinct climatic conditions hussain et al 2008 oiv 2019 with 40 of the vineyard vitis vinifera l area accounted in the mediterranean region faostat 2018 wine production is being undoubtedly challenged by climate change with a widespread dryness ascribed to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures ipcc 2022 these worrying scenarios will threaten vineyards well functioning since the whole system dynamics highly depends on biotic and abiotic interactions to be as functional as profitable burkhard and maes 2017 climate fluctuations particularly drought and heat waves affect vineyard phenology by altering the timing of growing season and consequently the optimal phase for maturation moreover grapevine exhibit a wide range of traits that frames physiological strategies which defines how grapevines respond to drier conditions wolkovich et al 2018 it is therefore expected that different varieties will perform differently under drier conditions different geographic origins lead to genetic adaptations associated with experienced contrasting climate conditions during their evolution process pouzoulet et al 2020 therefore resistance to drought soil and atmosphere could be highly variable considering each variety response vineyard efficiently responds to water stress through many different strategies such as highly deep and well developed root system to maximize water uptake bauerle et al 2008 stomata regulation that controls transpiration charrier et al 2018 as well as regulatory mechanisms within xylem to avoid embolisms jones and sutherland 1991 pouzoulet et al 2020 linked to this in situ varietal selection could provide varieties better adapted to new climatic scenarios morales castilla et al 2020 indeed winemakers from northern europe are selecting varieties from a range of southern europe although limited to varieties adapted to warm and dry climates stock et al 2005 santos et al 2020 to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity most of the mediterranean vineyards are already relying on irrigation during drought periods zarrouk et al 2016 since water resources are decreasing by unsustainable practices aquastat fao 2013 engel et al 2015 costa et al 2020 more sustainable

applied in vineyards aim to improve berry characteristics considering proper seasonal ripening chaves et al 2007 zarrouk et al 2012 bchir et al 2016 without compromising vineyard longevity costa et al 2020 considering predicted scenarios of drought and water scarcity it is essential to know how a large set of grapevine varieties change their wue when only rainfed under a mediterranean climate ecophysiological studies under different irrigation conditions including the absence of artificial watering can contribute to understanding vineyard water status their wue and processes involved in grapevine responses to water deficit choné et al 2001 gaudillère et al 2002 several studies relied on stable isotopic analysis to infer water use strategies and efficiency in vineyards e g gibberd et al 2001 herrero langreo et al 2013 santesteban et al 2015 using δ13c grape juice and must carbon isotopic signature δ13c as a proxy for vine water status and wue gaudillère et al 2002 deloire et al 2005 herrero langreo et al 2013 brillante et al 2020 also sugar δ13c in mature berries integrates photosynthetic isotopic discrimination during berry ripening which can be linked to soil water availability gaudillère et al 2002 santesteban et al 2015 under drought conditions these processes could be compromised while moderate water stress could favor sugars redistribution to berries fostering quality wines severe water stress constrains phloem unloading through sugars accumulation inhibition patrick 1997 carbonneau and deloire 2001 water stress will increase δ13c bota et al 2001 costa et al 2012 lovisolo et al 2016 and grapevine varieties are expected to show different sensitivities to water deficits reflected in 13c enrichment when the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 concentration ci ca is reduced due to either stomatal closure or increased photosynthesis rates there is less discrimination against 13c resulting in more enriched δ13c signatures and thus higher wue farquhar et al 1989 moreover δ13c might be expressed differently across different grapevine components and integrate different time scales souza et al 2005b seibt et al 2008 flexas et al 2010 grapes are an extremely efficient carbon sink integrating photosynthetic conditions during all the ripening period the time sugars in the berry juice accumulate and are considered a suitable long term indicator of plant wue in some grapevine varieties bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2010 santesteban et al 2015 bchir et al 2016 whereas δ13c of water soluble organic matter in phloem contain recently assimilated carbon and is expected to respond more dynamically to short term environmental conditions and species characteristics controlling photosynthetic discrimination scartazza et al 2004 gessler et al 2008 rascher et al 2010 phloem sap δ13c has the potential to be an integrative tracer of changes at whole canopy level and a tool for estimating canopy level carbon assimilation rates and whole plant stomatal conductance keitel et al 2006 rascher et al 2010 yet studies are particularly lacking on grapevine phloem and across a wide range of varieties under the same climate thus it is essential to have a better knowledge of the effects of drought on grapevine physiology particularly wue and explore new proxies that would help to reveal drought adapted varieties in this context we aim to understand i the patterns of δ13c reflecting their wue of european grapevine varieties in non irrigated rainfed conditions under a mediterranean climatic context ii whether varieties climatic origin plays a role on their δ13c signatures and drought adjustments iii if there is a relationship between δ13c in berry juice and phloem and if the latter can be a complementary tool to discriminate varieties with high wue and potentially better drought adapted 2 materials and methods 2 1 ampelographic field and experimental design the study was conducted in the ampelographic field of herdade do esporão cahe in reguengos de monsaraz alentejo portugal 38 380098ºn 7 560724ºw this field has a collection of 189 grapevine varieties v vinifera planted in 2011 including 87 red varieties 98 white

each variety n 516 per treatment monthly mean temperatures ranged from 36 to 14 ºc recorded in august and january respectively while mean precipitation was 100 mm during winter and only 31 mm in summer ipma 2021b the sampling season was particularly dry with a total rainfall during summer of only 35 comparing to the long term average including a drastic heat wave occurring in summer in august was observed a positive anomaly of 4 3 ºc in the average temperature and of 7 ºc in the maximum daily temperatures comparing to the long term period of 1981 2010 ipma 2021a phloem was collected in august by cutting 3 4 small rectangles of stem bark superficial portions of the stem of ca 2 cm2 avoiding xylem collection with a razor blade at the middle of the stem between the 5th and the 7th node from 1 year old twigs and placed in a sterile tube containing 2 ml of ddh2o and left to rest at least 5 h at room temperature gessler et al 2004 scartazza et al 2004 rascher et al 2010 to minimize differences caused by the daytime period and inter day variability the sampling was performed by a large team around 40 persons previously trained during the afternoon in two consecutive days with similar weather conditions grapes were collected at technological maturation which was evaluated by berry refractometry according to the varieties precocity brix and taking into account the main phenological stages observed in 2018 and the number of days between flowering and maturation based on a historical dataset of 6 years thus grape sampling was done in seven phases according to the timming at which maturation was reached by the varieties approximately six berries from three clusters per vine ca 18 berries per plant were collected and stored in falcon tubes all phloem n 1032 and berries n 1032 samples were frozen until further analysis 2 3 carbon isotopic composition analysis phloem samples were thawed at room temperature and homogenized in the vortex a volume of 200 μl of soluble sugars from the phloem samples phloem exudates was transferred to a square thin capsule and dried at 60 c for at least 48 h to evaporate the liquid gessler et al 2004 rascher et al 2010 before analysing berries from all the varieties seven varieties were randomly selected to test two methods i by removing the peal from the grape pulp followed by macerating the pulp and retrieving the juice and ii by pressing berries to get the juice from the compost sample a volume of 30 μl of berry juice resulting from each method was transferred to tin weighing capsules and dried at 60 c for at least 48 h in total 84 samples were used to sought the correlation between the two methods supporting fig s3 due to the high correlation between the two methods pearson r 0 84 p 0 001 the most effortless

fcul uncertainty of the isotope ratio analysis calculated using values from 6 to 9 replicates of secondary isotopic reference material interspersed among samples in every batch analysis was 0 1 in this study leaf δ13c was not considered since the effect of irrigation and drought on δ13c is expected to be more pronounced in grape berries than in leaves as postulated by bchir et al 2016 highlighting berry δ13c as the best indicator of plant water status also δ13c of pulp showed a better correlation with intrinsic water use efficiency the ratio between carbon dioxide assimilation and stomatal conductance a gs and water potential than grapevine leaves souza et al 2005b 2 4 data analysis the 172 grapevine varieties were classified according to their climatic origin by first specifying their country of origin based on robinson et al 2013 and cunha et al 2016 and then assigning a köppen geiger climate classification based on maps of köppen 1936 such as bsk arid step cold

by selecting the number of cluster k where reduction in the total weighted sum of squares begins to flatten 6 clusters were considered k 6 we then evaluated if the clusters obtained agreed well with the climatic origins classes and or the color of the grape to seek relations between berry juice and phloem δ13c pearson correlations α 0 05 were performed on the total data n 172 and spearman correlations performed for each cluster group previously defined due to lack of normality in most of the cluster groups considering the two irrigation treatments separately using hmisc r package harrell 2022 the differences of δ13c between treatments i e the difference between mean δ13c of ni rf and fi in each variety for both berry and phloem plant components were calculated the effect of climatic origin on this fi to ni rf δ13c differences was tested through a non parametric kruskal wallis test at a significance level of α 0 05 using agricolae r package de mendiburu and de mendiburu 2019 since we had an extremely unbalanced dataset regarding climatic origins we compared our results with a test applied to a transformed dataset i e with a combination of over and under sampling balancing the dataset by increasing the size of the rare samples through simple repetition and by reducing the size of the abundant classes through the random selection of 15 samples on each variety that had more than 15 samples and the outcomes were the same supporting the results the effect of cluster previously generated on the fi to ni rf δ13c differences and the differences among clusters were evaluated through an anova the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality were met followed by a tukey post hoc test using r functions from stats all statistical analyses and plotting were performed using r statistical software r core team 2022 3 results the cluster analysis based on the patterns of δ13c of the studied grapevine varieties in non irrigated rainfed ni rf conditions revealed six groups fig 1 table 1 which were not in accordance with either their climatic origin or grape color fig s4 cluster 1 and 2 which encompassed 17 and 26 varieties respectively table 1 represented the varieties with the more enriched values of 13c in both phloem and grape under water stress fig 1 by exploring the relationship between carbon isotopic signature in berry juice and phloem we found a general positive significant correlation fig 2 this positive relationship is observed in both fi and ni rf with no major effect of water stress in the relationship between the two plant components analysed neverthless in the ni rf treatment the clusters groups of varieties showed negative and positive correlations between the berry and phloem δ13c our results showed that regardless of grapevine varieties climatic origin there was a common 13c enrichment under water stress for berry juice and phloem δ13c fig 3 fig s5 there were no significant differences among climatic origins fig s5 and the most enriched values for both plant components were mostly belonging to clusters 1 and 2 fig 4 varieties with higher values of grape and phloem δ13c under drought clusters 1 and 2 fig 1 and table 1 were also the ones showing higher differences of δ13c between water treatments i e drought adjustments while the ones with the most depleted values of δ13c cluster 6 fig 1 and table 1 were the ones showing lower δ13c differences between water treatments fig 4 the decreasing differences between fi and ni rf were more clear in phloem than in grape fig 4 additionally although the range of δ13c in ni rf was different among clusters their isotopic signatures in fi were similar in the grape component fig s6 while considering the phloem δ13c at fi cluster 1 segregated from the others showing a distinct enriched value even in fi fig s6 they all shared a common negative correlation between δ13c in fi and the differences between ni rf and fi drought adjustments in both phloem and grape fig s7 in both components with increasing δ13c in fi conditions a lower difference is denoted between water treatments in all groups in other words within their cluster range higher isotopic adjustments are observed when lower δ13c is experienced under full irrigation fig s7 4 discussion by exploring the δ13c signatures of european grapevine varieties growing in non irrigated rainfed conditions ni rf under a mediterranean climatic context we delimited different groups clusters of varieties reflecting their stomatal control and water use efficiency wue under drought we found that the climatic origin did not played a role on these isotopic signatures groups neither on the water treatments differences observed both berry juice and phloem showed an enrichment in 13c under water stress regardless of their climatic origin we also found different ranges of δ13c enrichment under ni rf across grapevine varieties a higher water stress and needed acclimation was translated into higher stomatal adjustments sperry 1986 sperry et al 2002 see gambetta et al 2020 and references within and particularly for a group of specific varieties identified in table 1 as clusters 1 and 2 under drought stomatal regulation and leaf gas exchange are processes highly determinant for water stress resilience bota et al 2001 palliotti et al 2009 this behavior would allow the varieties making the higher stomatal adjustments and showing higher δ13c in both grape and phloem and therefore higher wue i e the varieties from clusters 1 and 2 fig 1 and listed in table 1 to be potentially more physiologically aquipted under drought there is a range of 13c enrichment that can be supported by genotypes ascribing differential vineyard responses to drought chaves et al 1987 bota et al 2001 palliotti et al 2009 the degree of stomatal conductance seems to depend on each variety s specific acclimation capacities as already proposed by chaves et al 2010 the shift under drought towards an increased wue due to the above mentioned increased stomatal control and reduced transpiration are expected in deficit irrigation and water stressed conditions souza et al 2005a souza et al 2005b gómez alonso and garcía romero 2009 zufferey et al 2017 studies carried out in different grapevine varieties and in different locations e g stoll et al 2000 loveys et al 2004 poni et al 2007 marsal et al 2008 reinforce the ubiquity of stomatal control as a strategy to deal with drought in grapevines and their inherent plasticity in other words although stomatal control is ubiquitous among grapevine varieties fig 3 there is a differentiation of the degree of stomatal adjustments and wue among the varieties fig 4 the greater physiological adjustments supporting a higher wue might eventually promote or affect plant vigor vitality and grape quality thus although not included in this study it is of great importance to further study other physiological aspects and grape quality to completely understand the most drought adapted varieties according to our results phloem might be valuable for assessing plant varieties responses under drought contributing to show isotopic patterns of similarity and dissimilarity among varieties under drought i e in ni rf since it is the plant tissue that will reflect recently fixed carbon e g 1 3 days time lag changes in the environment such as drought will interfere more directly with phloem δ13c with less stored and reused carbon counfounding factors than berry juice which will consist of a more complex mixture of carbon with different turnover times and metabolic history scartazza et al 2004 2015 keitel et al 2006 gessler et al 2008 thus the phloem 13c signature is expected to reflect the conditions of the sampling moment whereas the berry signature will integrate conditions from a wider time range from fruits formation to maturation this is particularly relevant under ni rf since phloem δ13c highlighted for adjustments in certain varieties that otherwise would be missed if only berry juice δ13c was assessed albeit the common 13c enrichment from fi to ni and the expected ranges in grape and phloem c isotope composition because they correspond to different plant organs subjected to different metabolic processes and 13c fractionation we were able to find that carbon isotopic signature in phloem generally reflects δ13c of berry juice reflecting plant wue fig 2 furthermore this general positive relationship is maintained under the drought conditions of ni rf treatment and the positive trend kept in the most 13c enriched varieties from clusters 1 and 2 the different type of correlations at the variety cluster level reflects the complexity of carbon allocation use and partitioning along different periods of

8874,wine production is being threatened by climate change particularly in the mediterranean region thus more knowledge on vineyards well functioning and adjustments to drought conditions is essential we aimed to understand how grapevine varieties from different european origins under the same climatic context respond to water stress and whether the climatic origin plays a role in their water use efficiency wue with that in mind we assessed the carbon isotopic signatures δ13c in berry juice and phloem of 172 white and red grapevine varieties grown in herdade do esporão alentejo portugal from five different climatic origins in two different rainfed water treatments with full and no irrigation our findings indicate that there is a 13c enrichment in both berry juice and phloem under water stress regardless of the climatic origin of the grapevine varieties this suggests that the plants exhibited greater stomatal regulation and tighter control over water loss during drought conditions also we found a positive correlation between berry juice and phloem δ13c signatures that is maintained under limited water conditions i e non irrigated rainfed condition ni rf six clusters based on δ13c patterns in ni rf were obtained and the varieties that showed the higher wue listed the patterns of δ13c drought adjustments differences among water treatments were dependent on specific varieties capacity to acclimate and the varieties that were grouped as the ones with high wue in ni rf also showed greater δ13c drought adjustments these results highlight a range of wue adjustments revealed through phloem isotopic analysis being phloem δ13c signature a complementary and promising proxy to assess grapevine varieties drought acclimation capacity our study reinforces vineyard plasticity and great adaptative ability transversal to several grapevine varieties with different climatic origins the results provided might be a complementary support to identify the varieties that are potentially more physiologically equipped under drought and to further explore their vitality and grape quality under sustainable water management scenarios keywords climatic origin stable

al 2008 oiv 2019 with 40 of the vineyard vitis vinifera l area accounted in the mediterranean region faostat 2018 wine production is being undoubtedly challenged by climate change with a widespread dryness ascribed to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures ipcc 2022 these worrying scenarios will threaten vineyards well functioning since the whole system dynamics highly depends on biotic and abiotic interactions to be as functional as profitable burkhard and maes 2017 climate fluctuations particularly drought and heat waves affect vineyard phenology by altering the timing of growing season and consequently the optimal phase for maturation moreover grapevine exhibit a wide range of traits that frames physiological strategies which defines how grapevines respond to drier conditions wolkovich et al 2018 it is therefore expected that different varieties will perform differently under drier conditions different geographic origins lead to genetic adaptations associated with experienced contrasting climate conditions during their evolution process pouzoulet et al 2020 therefore resistance to drought soil and atmosphere could be highly variable considering each variety response vineyard efficiently responds to water stress through many different strategies such as highly deep and well developed root system to maximize water uptake bauerle et al 2008 stomata regulation that controls transpiration charrier et al 2018 as well as regulatory mechanisms within xylem to avoid embolisms jones and sutherland 1991 pouzoulet et al 2020 linked to this in situ varietal selection could provide varieties better adapted to new climatic scenarios morales castilla et al 2020 indeed winemakers from northern europe are selecting varieties from a range of southern europe although limited to varieties adapted to warm and dry climates stock et al 2005 santos et al 2020 to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity most of the mediterranean vineyards are already

applied in vineyards aim to improve berry characteristics considering proper seasonal ripening chaves et al 2007 zarrouk et al 2012 bchir et al 2016 without compromising vineyard longevity costa et al 2020 considering predicted scenarios of drought and water scarcity it is essential to know how a large set of grapevine varieties change their wue when only rainfed under a mediterranean climate ecophysiological studies under different irrigation conditions including the absence of artificial watering can contribute to understanding vineyard water status their wue and processes involved in grapevine responses to water deficit choné et al 2001 gaudillère et al 2002 several studies relied on stable isotopic analysis to infer water use strategies and efficiency in vineyards e g gibberd et al 2001 herrero langreo et al 2013 santesteban et al 2015 using δ13c grape juice and must carbon isotopic signature δ13c as a proxy for vine water status and wue gaudillère et al 2002 deloire et al 2005 herrero langreo et al 2013 brillante et al 2020 also sugar δ13c in mature berries integrates photosynthetic isotopic discrimination during berry ripening which can be linked to soil water availability gaudillère et al 2002 santesteban et al 2015 under drought conditions these processes could be compromised while moderate water stress could favor sugars redistribution to berries fostering quality wines severe water stress constrains phloem unloading through sugars accumulation inhibition patrick 1997 carbonneau and deloire 2001 water stress will increase δ13c bota et al 2001 costa et al 2012 lovisolo et al 2016 and grapevine varieties are expected to show different sensitivities to water deficits reflected in 13c enrichment when the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 concentration ci ca is reduced due to either stomatal closure or increased photosynthesis rates there is less discrimination against 13c resulting in more enriched δ13c signatures and thus higher wue farquhar et al 1989 moreover δ13c might be expressed differently across different grapevine components and integrate different time scales souza et al 2005b seibt et al 2008 flexas et al 2010 grapes are an extremely efficient carbon sink integrating photosynthetic conditions during all the ripening period the time sugars in the berry juice accumulate and are considered a suitable long term indicator of plant wue in some grapevine varieties bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2010 santesteban et al 2015 bchir et al 2016 whereas δ13c of water soluble organic matter in phloem contain recently assimilated carbon and is expected to respond more dynamically to short term environmental conditions and species characteristics controlling photosynthetic discrimination scartazza et al 2004 gessler et al 2008 rascher et al 2010 phloem sap δ13c has the potential to be an integrative tracer of changes at whole canopy level and a tool for estimating canopy level carbon assimilation rates and whole plant stomatal conductance keitel et al 2006 rascher et al 2010 yet studies are particularly lacking on grapevine phloem and across a wide range of varieties under the same climate thus it is essential to have a better knowledge of the effects of drought on grapevine physiology particularly wue and explore new proxies that would help to reveal drought adapted varieties in this context we aim to understand i the patterns of δ13c reflecting their wue of european grapevine varieties in non irrigated rainfed conditions under a mediterranean climatic context ii whether varieties climatic origin plays a role on their δ13c signatures and drought adjustments iii if there is a relationship between δ13c in berry juice and phloem and if the latter can be a complementary tool to discriminate

august by cutting 3 4 small rectangles of stem bark superficial portions of the stem of ca 2 cm2 avoiding xylem collection with a razor blade at the middle of the stem between the 5th and the 7th node from 1 year old twigs and placed in a sterile tube containing 2 ml of ddh2o and left to rest at least 5 h at room temperature gessler et al 2004 scartazza et al 2004 rascher et al 2010 to minimize differences caused by the daytime period and inter day variability the sampling was performed by a large team around 40 persons previously trained during the afternoon in two consecutive days with similar weather conditions grapes were collected at technological maturation which was evaluated by berry refractometry according to the varieties precocity brix and taking into account the main phenological stages observed in 2018 and the number of days between flowering and maturation based on a historical dataset of 6 years thus grape sampling was done in seven phases according to the timming at which maturation was reached by the varieties approximately six berries from three clusters per vine ca 18 berries per plant were collected and stored in falcon tubes all phloem n 1032 and berries n 1032 samples were frozen until further analysis 2 3 carbon isotopic composition analysis phloem samples were thawed at room temperature and homogenized in the vortex a volume of 200 μl of soluble sugars from the phloem samples phloem exudates was transferred to a square thin capsule and dried at 60 c for at least 48 h to evaporate the liquid gessler et al 2004 rascher et al 2010 before analysing berries from all the varieties seven varieties were randomly selected to test two methods i by removing the peal from the grape pulp followed by macerating the pulp and retrieving the juice and ii by pressing berries to get the juice from the compost sample a volume of 30 μl of berry juice resulting from each method was transferred to tin weighing capsules and dried at 60 c for at least 48 h in total 84 samples were used to sought the correlation between the two methods supporting fig s3 due to the high correlation between the two methods pearson r 0 84 p 0 001 the most effortless method was used for all berry samples i e method ii all samples were encapsulated and analysed for carbon isotopic composition δ13c determined by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry cf

fcul uncertainty of the isotope ratio analysis calculated using values from 6 to 9 replicates of secondary isotopic reference material interspersed among samples in every batch analysis was 0 1 in this study leaf δ13c was not considered since the effect of irrigation and drought on δ13c is expected to be more pronounced in grape berries than in leaves as postulated by bchir et al 2016

stomatal conductance a gs and water potential than grapevine leaves souza et al 2005b 2 4 data analysis the 172 grapevine varieties were classified according to their climatic origin by first specifying their country of origin based on robinson et al 2013 and cunha et al 2016 and then assigning a köppen geiger climate classification based on maps of köppen 1936 such as bsk arid step cold

by selecting the number of cluster k where reduction in the total weighted sum of squares begins to flatten 6 clusters were considered k 6 we then evaluated if the clusters obtained agreed well with the climatic origins classes and or the color of the grape to seek relations between berry juice and phloem δ13c pearson correlations α 0 05 were performed on the total data n 172 and spearman correlations performed for each cluster group previously defined due to lack of normality in most of the cluster groups considering the two irrigation treatments separately using hmisc r package harrell 2022 the differences of δ13c between treatments i e the difference between mean δ13c of ni rf and fi in each variety for both berry and phloem plant components were calculated the effect of climatic origin on this fi to ni rf δ13c differences was tested through a non parametric kruskal wallis test at a significance level of α 0 05 using agricolae r package de mendiburu and de mendiburu 2019 since we had an extremely unbalanced dataset regarding climatic origins we compared our results with a test applied to a transformed dataset i e with a combination of over and under sampling balancing the dataset by increasing the size of the rare samples through simple repetition and by reducing the size of the abundant classes through the random selection of 15 samples on each variety that had more than 15 samples and the outcomes were the same supporting the results the effect of cluster previously generated on the fi to ni rf δ13c differences and the differences among clusters were evaluated through an anova the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality were met followed by a tukey post hoc test using r functions from stats all statistical analyses and plotting were performed using r statistical software r core team 2022 3 results the cluster analysis based on the patterns of δ13c of the studied grapevine varieties in non irrigated rainfed ni rf conditions revealed six groups fig 1 table 1 which were not in accordance with either their climatic origin or grape color fig s4 cluster 1 and 2 which encompassed 17 and 26 varieties respectively table 1 represented the varieties with the more enriched values of 13c in both phloem and grape under water stress fig 1 by exploring the relationship between carbon isotopic signature in berry juice and phloem we found a general positive significant correlation fig 2 this positive relationship is observed in both fi and ni rf with no major effect of water stress in the relationship between the two plant components analysed neverthless in the ni rf treatment the clusters groups of varieties showed negative and positive correlations between the berry and phloem δ13c our results showed that regardless of grapevine varieties climatic origin there was a common 13c enrichment under water stress for berry juice and phloem δ13c fig 3 fig s5 there were no significant differences among climatic origins fig s5 and the most enriched values for both plant components were mostly belonging to clusters 1 and 2 fig 4 varieties with higher values of grape and phloem δ13c under drought clusters 1 and 2 fig 1 and table 1 were also the ones showing higher differences of δ13c between water treatments i e drought adjustments while the ones with the most depleted values of δ13c cluster 6 fig 1 and table 1 were the ones showing lower δ13c differences between water treatments fig 4 the decreasing differences between fi and ni rf were more clear in phloem than in grape fig 4 additionally although the range of δ13c in ni rf was different among clusters their isotopic signatures in fi were similar in the grape component fig s6 while considering the phloem δ13c at fi cluster 1 segregated from the others showing a distinct enriched value even in fi fig s6 they all shared a common negative correlation between δ13c in fi and the differences between ni rf and fi drought adjustments in both phloem and grape fig s7 in both components with increasing δ13c in fi conditions a lower difference is denoted between water treatments in all groups in other words within their cluster range higher isotopic adjustments are observed when lower δ13c is experienced under full irrigation fig s7 4 discussion by exploring the δ13c signatures of european grapevine varieties growing in non irrigated rainfed conditions ni rf under a mediterranean climatic context we delimited different groups clusters of varieties reflecting their stomatal control and water use efficiency wue under drought we found that the climatic origin did not played a role on these isotopic signatures groups neither on the water treatments differences observed both berry juice and phloem showed an enrichment in 13c under water stress regardless of their climatic origin we also found different ranges of δ13c enrichment under ni rf across grapevine varieties a higher water stress and needed acclimation was translated into higher stomatal adjustments sperry 1986 sperry et al 2002 see gambetta et al 2020 and references within and particularly for a group of specific varieties identified in table 1 as clusters 1 and 2 under drought stomatal regulation and leaf gas exchange are processes highly determinant for water stress resilience bota et al 2001 palliotti et al 2009 this behavior would allow the varieties making the higher stomatal adjustments and showing higher δ13c in both grape and phloem and therefore higher wue i e the varieties from clusters 1 and 2 fig 1 and listed in table 1 to be potentially more physiologically aquipted under drought there is a range of 13c enrichment that can be supported by genotypes ascribing differential vineyard responses to drought chaves et al 1987 bota et al 2001 palliotti et al 2009 the degree of stomatal conductance seems to depend on each variety s specific acclimation capacities as already proposed by chaves et al 2010 the shift under drought towards an increased wue due to the above mentioned increased stomatal control and reduced transpiration are expected in deficit irrigation and water stressed conditions souza et al 2005a souza et al 2005b gómez alonso and garcía romero 2009 zufferey et al 2017 studies carried out in different grapevine varieties and in different locations e g stoll et al 2000 loveys et al 2004 poni et al 2007 marsal et al 2008 reinforce the ubiquity of stomatal control as a strategy to deal with drought in grapevines and their inherent plasticity in other words although stomatal control is ubiquitous among grapevine varieties fig 3 there is a differentiation of the degree of stomatal adjustments and wue among the varieties fig 4 the greater physiological adjustments supporting a higher wue might eventually promote or affect plant vigor vitality and grape quality thus although not included in this study it is of great importance to further study other physiological aspects and grape quality to completely understand the most drought adapted varieties according to our results phloem might be valuable for assessing plant varieties responses under drought contributing to show isotopic patterns of similarity and dissimilarity among varieties under drought i e in ni rf since it is the plant tissue that will reflect recently fixed carbon e g 1 3 days time lag changes in the environment such as drought will interfere more directly with phloem δ13c with less stored and reused carbon counfounding factors than berry juice which will consist of a more complex mixture of carbon with different turnover times and metabolic history scartazza et al 2004 2015 keitel et al 2006 gessler et al 2008 thus the phloem 13c signature is expected to reflect the conditions of the sampling moment whereas the berry signature will integrate conditions from a wider time range from fruits formation to maturation this is particularly relevant under ni rf since phloem δ13c highlighted for adjustments in certain varieties that otherwise would be missed if only berry juice δ13c was assessed albeit the common 13c enrichment from fi to ni and the expected ranges in grape and phloem c isotope composition because they correspond to different plant organs subjected to different metabolic processes and 13c fractionation we were able to find that carbon isotopic signature in phloem generally reflects δ13c of berry juice reflecting plant wue fig 2 furthermore this general positive relationship is maintained under the drought conditions of ni rf treatment and the positive trend kept in the most 13c enriched varieties from clusters 1 and 2 the different type of correlations at the variety cluster level reflects the complexity of carbon allocation use and partitioning along different periods of time the phloem to grape positive relationship is thus more evident in the group of varieties with higher δ13c values indicating higher wue at both short and long term and are decoupled or negative in the lower or intermediate ranges of δ13c within these clusters isotopic ranges varieties that show short term drought adjustments towards higher intrinsic wue are the ones that show lower wue through long term indicators i e berry juice δ13c possibly through the maintenance of a higher gs and or lower a along the ripening period for these varieties that are still able to promptly lower their gs and or increase a under drought stress nevertheless the combined analysis of carbon isotopes in phloem and berry juice could be very useful to characterize the wue adjustments of grapevines under ni
