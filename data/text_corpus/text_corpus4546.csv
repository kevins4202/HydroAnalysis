salt water intrudes far upstream for about 65 km in flood seasons freshwater discharge is the main component controlling currents and saltwater intrusion in the ire currents are all seaward during both the flood and ebb phases saltwater freshwater interface is pushed seaward to the mouth of the estuary both field data and numerical results reveal that stratification mixing occur at the mouth of

of tidal action and buoyancy forcing determines the saltwater intrusion pattern gong et al 2013 salt transport pattern is of great significance in terms of regional environmental management for saltwater intrusion prevention this study was performed in the indus river estuary ire fig 1 which is located 67 4 e 67 66 e 23 98 n 24 15 n at the southeastern pakistani coast along the north arabian sea with a basin area of 36 km wide and 40 km long the system of the ire is formed by the confluences of seven major tributaries i e rohro mutni wadh khund and watho to the southeast and bhoori and aado war to the southwest the main channel of the ire is khobar physically it is categorized as a partially mixed coastal plain estuary the estuary is quite shallow with a maximum depth of 7 m tides in the estuary are semidiurnal with maximum tidal range of 3 m seasonal variation is found in hydrodynamic characteristics of the ire a major factor influencing the oceanographic processes of the ire is the fluctuation of the indus river flow before the construction of dams the indus river carried 185 bcm billion m3 of fresh water and about 400 mt million tons of silt per year into its delta nasir and akbar 2012 wells and coleman 1985 after dams being built its silt load has decreased to 13 million tons and river flow was limited to only two months per year august and september kalhoro et al 2017 syvitski et al 2013 variation in fluvial discharge has direct influences on physical processes in estuaries the circulation in the ire fig 1 is governed by tides in the absence of river runoff resulting in sea water intrusion and coastal erosion the ire is the area most seriously suffered from seawater intrusion and coastal inundation with salinity even larger than 5 psu at 60 km upstream according to kalhoro et al 2016 saltwater intrusion took place as far as 84 km upstream the coastal areas of the ire are highly vulnerable to inundation particularly during the dry season when river discharge is negligible during the spring tide period coastal flooding supports tidal transgression over million acres of land in the indus delta khaskheli et al 2018 2 95 million acres of agricultural land has been affected by seawater intrusion in sujawal and badin districs of sindh it is also reported that 0 23 million acres fertile land has become barren in thatta district along the indus coast due to seawater intrusion in the near future such impact will increase because the flow discharge of the indus river has been artificially modulated the indus river delta is at the risk of increasing salinity intrusion thus it is necessary to understand detailed hydrodynamic characteristics in the ire particularly the mechanism of salinity intrusion due to changes of river flows the objective of our study is to assess the impacts of hydrological seasonality on estuarine circulation and salinity intrusion in the ire in this regard field surveys were conducted and numerical model was constructed the hydrological seasonality of tides and salinity intrusion under various conditions was analyzed the field surveys were conducted during both wet fluvial discharge and dry seasons zero discharge in the ire this is the first time such systematic field surveys being conducted and being combined with a coastal ocean model for the ire 2 methodology 2 1 field survey two field surveys were conducted in the ire during spring tides in the wet september 2014 and dry march 2015 seasons eight survey stations were distributed along the channel to 80 km upstream fig 1 hourly data of vertical profiles of salinity were obtained at the eight stations in two spring tidal cycles stations 1 and 3 are located at 5 and 20 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary respectively hourly data of tidal levels currents and salinity were obtained at these two stations in two spring tidal cycles 25 h data at these two stations were used to examine the spatial and temporal variations of water levels currents and salinity more data of water levels were recorded during the months of december 2014 and january 2015 dry season at station 3 data of water levels were recorded by a pressure sensor based on tidal gauge rbr xr 420 the tidal gauge was fixed near the fishermen floating jetty near station 3 to measure profile and register water levels every 10 min for 32 days currents were measured using a boat mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcp 1200 khz at the anchor stations water samples were collected every hour at the surface and bottom levels respectively with a 5 l niskin bottle to determine the salinity salinity was also recorded using a water quality meter hydrolab ms 5 salinity sensor of water quality meter was calibrated through standard saline water before deployment 2 2 hydrological data the climate of sindh coast is arid sub tropical under the influence of biannual monsoonal cycles the summer or southwest sw monsoon covers the period from may to september and the winter or northeast ne monsoon is from november to february the sw and ne monsoon winds have significant influences on the physical and climatic scenario of the region a major factor influencing the oceanographic processes of the indus coast is the discharge of the indus river since the indus delta is situated in a semi arid climate zone with quite low annual rainfall it largely depends on the freshwater discharge from the indus river the precipitation data from 2013 to 2015 were obtained from the meteorological weather station thatta indus coast downstream of kotri barrage fig 1 maintained by the pakistan meteorological department pmd the monthly averaged rainfall was 11 65 3 31 and 13 74 mm month during the year 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively maximum rainfall occurred during the months of july september fig 2 the hydrological runoff data were obtained from the gauge at kotri barrage fig 1 which is the last barrage along the indus river maintained by the sindh irrigation and drainage authority total discharges of 22 3 2 58 and 44 55 bcm billion cubic meters were recorded in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2 the discharges from july to september in these three years were 22 05 2 519 and 42 41 bcm respectively thus the river flow was irregular and limited to within only 2 3 months throughout the year the monthly data on fluvial discharge from the executive engineer kotri barrage revealed a total discharge of 2 519 bcm from july to september in 2014 while that from february to may was nearly zero the minimum and maximum flows were 220 and 1000 m3 day respectively and the average flow was about 300 m3 day from july to september 2 3 hydrodynamic model development 2 3 1 model description the hydrodynamic model used in this study is the three dimensional 3d unstructured grid finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom developed by chen et al 2003 fvcom has been successfully applied in a number of estuaries continental shelf and regional model domains e g chen et al 2008 ji et al 2006 pringle 2006 the source code of fvcom uses 3d unstructured grid free surface primitive equations the primitive governing equations are mathematically closed by using the modified mellor and yamada level 2 5 my 2 5 turbulent closure scheme for vertical mixing the σ coordinate transformation is used in the vertical direction to obtain a smooth representation of irregular variable bottom topography for detailed description one can refer to chen et al 2006a 2006b the ability of fvcom to accurately solve scalar conservation equations combined with the topological flexibility provided by unstructured meshes makes it ideally suited for the ire 2 3 2 computational domain and grids the model domain covers the entire ire area fig 3 including seven tributaries estuarine bays and coastal ocean areas the landward boundaries of the model domain are located at 98 km upstream because the ire is the most serious area suffered from seawater intrusion and coastal inundation the seaward boundary is extended to about 20 km into the open ocean as part of the shoreline data of the indus river are missing the map is overlaid from google earth to obtain the shoreline data of the rivers bathymetric data are also used to help determine the shoreline boundary the triangular grid has 13 236 nodes and 21 116 elements the horizontal resolution varies from 400 to 4000 m in the coastal and ocean areas respectively while it is from 20 to 280 m in the river channels very small triangular grids of about 20 m are used in the river channels the vertical grids are divided into 11 uniform σ layers the bathymetric data are interpolated to the mesh the bathymetry data for the open ocean are obtained from the hydrographic department of the pakistan navy the river bathymetry data were obtained from the national institute of oceanography nio of pakistan all bathymetry data used in this study are referenced to the mean sea level msl the maximum depth of the computational domain is about 25 m in the coastal ocean area along the entire coast of the indus delta water depth gradually increases up to 25 m within the indus shelf the estuary is shallow with a maximum depth of 7 m fig 4 which occurs in the lower estuary the middle estuary is quite shallow with the maximum depth of 3 m the width of the lower estuary varies from 900 to 2 800 m the maximum width occurs at the mouth of the estuary whereas the minimum width of 900 m is about 5 km upstream at the meandering point of the channels the middle estuary width varies from 500 to 1 500 m whereas the upper estuary width varies from 300 to 1 000 m 2 3 3 boundary forcing and initial conditions the model is forced by tides and river inflows the tidal elevation data for the open ocean boundary condition are obtained from http www ioc sealevelmonitoring org water level is calculated from eight tidal constituents namely m2 k2 s2 n2 k1 p1 o1 and q1 the initial salinity is set to 36 at the river boundary measured time series of water discharges at kotri hydrological station are applied during the wet season the river discharge is 300 m3 s from 1st july to 30th september the remaining period has zero river discharge the bottom stress is parameterized based on a logarithmic velocity profile with a roughness length of z0 0 001 cm the model is run from 1st june 2012 to 1st june 2014 then the result is used as the initial condition for numerical experiments the above mentioned model is set as the reference model and then used to examine the hydrodynamics and saltwater intrusion in the ire 2 4 process oriented numerical experiments numerical experiments are designed to analyze dynamic processes and examine the relationships of river discharges tidal forcing and bathymetry the hydrological data obtained from kotri barrge show that river discharges are irregular and limited to only three months from july to september each year therefore the configurations of these numerical experiments are designed as follows table 1 experiment 1 case 1 the model is driven by tidal forcing and zero river discharge experiment 2 case 2 same as case 1 except that the freshwater discharge of 300 m3 s is used to represent the wet season condition with normal river discharge experiment 3 case 3 same as case 2 but with smaller freshwater discharge of 30 m3 s to represent the wet season condition with low river discharge experiment 4 case 4 same as case 2 but with larger freshwater discharge of 3000 m3 s to represent the flood season condition these experiments are used to examine the temporal and spatial magnitude of seawater intrusion into the ire under various flow conditions 2 5 hydrodynamic model validation to access the model s capability we first compare numerical results with observed sea surface level and current velocity the water level data are obtained at stations 1 and 3 fig 1 the model skill is assessed by using the following statistical method suggested by ma et al 2011 s k i l l 1 n i 1 x m o d x o b s 2 n i 1 x m o d x o b s x o b s x o b s 2 where x is the variable being compared x is the mean of the sample and the subscripts mod and obs denotes model result and observation respectively according to ma et al 2011 this skill parameter quantifies the ratio to which observed deviations about the observed mean corresponds to the predicted deviations about the observed mean the skill varies from 0 to 1 a skill is said to be accurate if the model results and observations show a skill of 1 0 and a skill of 0 means they are in disagreement this skill parameter is computed for tidal elevation and current velocity at station 1 which shows a qualitative agreement between simulated and observed measurements the skill is found for tidal level and current velocity during wet and dry seasons and shown in table 2 the vertically averaged current was observed at station 1 during wet and dry seasons the comparison between observed and simulated velocities shows good agreement fig 6 numerical results of salinity are compared with the field measured data this skill parameter is calculated for salinity at eight stations which shows a qualitative agreement between simulated and observed measurements the averaged skill scores for tidally averaged longitudinal salinity surface and near bed at all stations are all larger than 0 7 during wet and dry seasons table 3 2 5 1 tidal elevation and currents fig 5 a and b c show comparison between calculated and observed water levels at stations 3 and 1 the calculated tidal amplitude and phase are in agreement with observed the maximum water level difference was 0 18 m between simulated results and observation at peaks and valleys at station 3 about 20 km upstream most likely the coarse bathymetry resolution was the reason for the difference the comparison between observed and simulated vertically averaged current velocities at the east west ua and the north south va directions shows qualitative agreement in terms of both magnitude and trend fig 6 2 5 2 salinity the modeled salinity is calibrated by the vertical profiles of salinity observed at the eight stations along the channel fig 1 during both wet and dry seasons the modeled salinity agrees well with the observed data in terms of both magnitude and trend the model reproduces the salinity dynamics very well during both wet fig 7 a b and dry fig 7 c d seasons 3 results analysis based on the verified simulation system more numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the dynamic process in the ire and to examine the impacts of river discharge on currents and salinity intrusion 3 1 residual circulation the residual estuarine circulation is also known as sub tidal circulation it governs the long term transports and distributions of salinity and other materials in the estuary it is caused by low frequency forces such as runoff wind baroclinic gradient force and the tide itself pritchard 1956 it is important for the exchanges of salt water and other biological and chemical materials manda et al 2010 the lagranian residual current u l which is the sum of the eulerian residual current u e and stokes drift u s is used in this study the first order approximation lagrangian residual current is calculated through averaging the tidal currents in a spring neap tidal cycle to remove the periodical components and it is done in σ coordinate to investigate the vertical structure giddings et al 2014 longuet higgins 1969 u l σ u e σ u s σ u e σ u s σ u s u σ η h 0 where u σ is the simulated current in σ layer and represents an average operator fig 8 shows the along stream vertical lagrangian residual current structure from the river mouth in case 1 the lagrangian residual currents are down stream from sea surface to bottom and from river mouth to 8 km upstream upper layer down stream and lower layer up stream in 20 km 40 km from the mouth from the river mouth to 8 km upstream upper layer residual currents are down stream and lower layer ones are up stream in case 2 and case 3 respectively residual currents are down stream in all layers from 10 km in case 2 and 2 km in case 4 in case 3 down stream residual currents in upper layers but strong up stream in lower layer figs 9 12 show the lagrangian residual current structure in the surface layer and bottom layer of the numerical experiments there are two residual eddies one cyclonical and another anticyclonical from surface to bottom in the area of aadowar about 8 km upstream in case 1 and case 3 with the river discharge increases case 2 and case 4 the eddies disappear 3 2 salinity stratification vertical salinity distribution near the mouth of the estuary is examined to study the stratification under different river discharges in case 1 in the absence of river runoff the vertically homogenous condition is seen at station 1 fig 13 a whereas in case 2 the partially stratified condition is seen in the presence of river runoff during wet season fig 13b in case 3 when the river discharge is lower 30 m3 s a small difference in flood and ebb phases is observed fig 13c though the estuary is vertically homogenous however in case 4 during flood period when river discharge is higher 3000 m3 s the whole water column is filled with fresh water it shows vertically homogenous with no flood and ebb differences fig 13d the numerical results reveal that stratification mixing occurs only at the mouth of the ire during wet seasons in the absence of freshwater discharge it is vertically homogenous and shows well mixed characteristics due to strong tidal forcing during wet season it behaves as a weakly stratified or partially mixed estuary this behavior is due to the tidal advection and shallowness of the estuary in the presence of fresh water salinity is lower at ebb tides and higher at flood tides when the whole water column is filled with saline water the water column is partially stratified due to estuarine circulation and tidal straining a slight gradient of salinity from surface to bottom occurs during both tidal phases but it is more obvious during flood phase due to density difference fig 13b during dry seasons in the absence of fresh water flood ebb and vertical variation are absent fig 13a because mixing processes in the ire are mainly activated by tidal currents and freshwater discharge the river runoff causes both downstream movement of the saline water and estuarine circulation when the runoff decreases the intensity of estuarine circulation is dampened in stratified estuaries salt transport predominantly due to advection by the net landward flow and the estuarine salt transport hansen and rattray 1966 in relatively well mixed or weakly stratified estuaries tidal dispersion plays an important role in the salt balance jay and smith 1990 the combined effects of river discharge tides and topography control seawater intrusion into the estuaries model results indicate that river runoff plays an important role in controlling seawater intrusion in case 2 the river runoff disperses seawater plume at the mouth of the estuary as a result vertical variation is not significant in case 4 when river discharge is 3000 m3 s the density front is significantly pushed outward from the estuary fig 13d fig 13c shows that the difference of salinity from bottom to surface is small during low river discharge whereas slight difference is observed in both flood and ebb phases in the absence of river discharge it changes from partially mixed circulation to well mixed circulation tides are the main dominant factor for seawater intrusion in the ire during dry seasons 3 3 distance of seawater intrusion during dry seasons when the river discharge is negligible 0 m3 s case 1 the salinity intrusion is very serious the maximum distance of salinity intrusion reaches 65 km upstream fig 14 a a small vertical variation occurs up to 20 km upstream however after 30 km upstream the surface to bottom variation is negligible in this case the estuarine circulation is driven by tides which intensify the upward intrusion of high salinity water considering case 3 wet season with low river discharge of 30 m3 s the salinity intrudes only 22 km upstream fig 14c the river flow is the most dominant factor in case 2 when river discharge is 300 m3 s it pushes back the seawater plume to about 8 km upstream fig 14b on the other hand in case 4 when river discharge is 3000 m3 s the density front is significantly pushed outward from the estuary fig 14d however salinity is absent from the estuary in ebb as well as in flood tide hence seawater intrusion is directly related to the decrease of freshwater discharge rate 4 discussion the ire is a complex system with numerous bays and tidal creeks and varying bathymetry due to the complexity of the estuarine system various physical processes would be involved to contribute to the saltwater intrusion because multiple forces such as river discharge bathymetry tides wind and wave all influence the dynamic processes of the estuarine system since this is a preliminary numerical study to investigate the dynamic processes in the ire only the basic hydrodynamic processes such as river discharge tidal forcing and bathymetric etc are studied due to the limitations of field measurements wind and wave are excluded from the model even with the absence of these forcing factors this simulation system still shows powerful capability of capturing the major dynamic processes of the ire the results show that the simulation system can correctly capture the dynamic processes of interactions between river discharge and oceanic forcing the simulation system is well calibrated and validated using field measurements based on the validated simulation system several process oriented numerical experiments were conducted to study the basic dynamic processes and to find out the relationship between these effecting factors such as river discharge tidal forcing bathymetry etc in future effort will be taken to develop a full simulation system which includes coastal currents wind and wave the numerical results reveal that intensity of currents increases at upstream in the absence of river runoff which enhances the effect of tidal forcing and results in seawater intrusion and vice versa in the presence of river runoff seawater intrusion is limited to only 8 km upstream with a thin layer of brackish water at the bottom during the dry season salt wedge of 5 psu penetrates into the estuary about 65 km upstream with a small vertical variation up to 20 km upstream however such variation is negligible within 30 km from the mouth the manmade activities such as construction of large dams reservoirs and barrages at the upstream of the indus river system have resulted in serious reduction of fresh water water abstraction at upstream has greatly affected the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ire the numerical results of salinity reveal that stratification destratification occurs only at the mouth during the wet season in the absence of freshwater discharge it is vertically homogenous and shows well mixed characteristics due to strong tidal forcing during the wet season it behaves as weakly stratified or partially mixed estuary at the mouth this behavior is due to the shallowness of the estuary and tidal straining during ebb tides river water pushes back salinity gradient to the sea and the whole water column is filled with fresh water while at flood tides tidal straining fills water column with saline water the water column is partially stratified when tidal straining decreases however a slight variation from surface to bottom was observed during both tidal phases though it was more obvious during flood phase due to density difference the seawater intrusion strength generally depends on the amount of river flow sea surface height and inclination of the riverbed though two of the factors change with time the river bed is fixed however the ire has seven active tributaries during the dry season in flood tide the volume of tidal prism also increases which may enhance the upward intrusion of saltwater in the absence of river runoff therefore the mechanism of seawater intrusion is mainly due to the absence of river runoff and tidal forcing through many channels which are responsible for the seawater intrusion in the ire in this study we only examined hydrodynamics driven by tides and river discharge these results can help future studies however more realistic simulations should be carried out in future by adding other parameters such as wind stress to examine the wind effect on physical processes in the ire 5 conclusions a fvcom based high resolution hydrodynamic model is successfully established to numerically analyze seawater intrusion in the ire together with a long time series of field survey model calibration and verification are conducted with field measured data the observed and simulated salinity currents and water level fields are in good agreement given the same tidal forcing and background salinity four numerical experiments were designed as case studies to identify the importance of freshwater discharge into the ire under the same tidal forcing these process oriented numerical experiments show that hydrodynamic processes of the ire including tides currents residual currents and salinity are largely dependent on the seasonality of fluvial discharge river runoff plays an important role in controlling seawater intrusion into the ire flood currents are smaller than ebb currents and flood phases are shorter than ebb phases due to the impact of river discharge currents are all seaward during both flood and ebb phases in the flood seasons due to strong river discharge stratification and mixing occur only at the mouth of the ire during the wet seasons in the absence of freshwater discharge during the dry seasons the study region is vertically homogenous and showed well mixed characteristics due to tidal forcing while the horizontal density gradient varies from mouth to upstream vertical variation is absent at the upstream during both seasons due to shallow bathymetry of the estuary the numerical results reveal that the intensity of currents increases at upstream in the absence of river runoff because the complicated geomorphological system of the ire also impacts the seawater intrusion since it has seven active tidal channels during the flooding period of a dry season as the tide volume of tidal prism increases it may enhance the upward saltwater intrusion through all the tidal channels in the absence of river runoff though the estuary is shallow it also becomes narrow 25 km upstream thus the combined effect of many tidal channels intensifies the strength of seawater in the upstream in the absence of river runoff therefore the mechanism of seawater intrusion in the ire is tidal forcing through many channels in the absence of river runoff the distance of salinity intrusion is basically controlled by river discharge larger river discharge pushes the saline water seaward to the mouth of the ire during flood seasons while zero river discharge during dry season leads to serious saltwater intrusion at upstream the results of this study can help the freshwater supply operation upstream of the indus river the physical processes in the ire have never been systematically investigated and understood our study is the first attempt to reveal physical processes and mechanisms by combining long term field surveys and a high resolution coastal ocean model in this study we only examine the hydrodynamics driven by tides and river discharges future work should add other parameters such as wind stress to examine the wind effect on physical processes in the ire because the study area is influenced by monsoons the southwest and northeast monsoon winds have significant influences on the region furthermore the influences of anthropogenic activities such as the change of river topography and tidal creeks need further study

fig 1 maintained by the pakistan meteorological department pmd the monthly averaged rainfall was 11 65 3 31 and 13 74 mm month during the year 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively maximum rainfall occurred during the months of july september fig 2 the hydrological runoff data were obtained from the gauge at kotri barrage fig 1 which is the last barrage along the indus river maintained by the sindh irrigation and drainage authority total discharges of 22 3 2 58 and 44 55 bcm billion cubic meters were recorded in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2 the discharges from july to september in these three years were 22 05 2 519 and 42 41 bcm respectively thus the river flow was irregular and limited to within only 2 3 months throughout the year the monthly data on fluvial discharge from the executive engineer kotri barrage revealed a total discharge of 2 519 bcm from july to september in 2014 while that from february to may was nearly zero the minimum and maximum flows were 220 and 1000 m3 day respectively and the average flow was about 300 m3 day from july to september 2 3 hydrodynamic model development 2 3 1 model description the hydrodynamic model used in this study is the three dimensional 3d unstructured grid finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom developed by chen et al 2003 fvcom has been successfully applied in a number of estuaries continental shelf and regional model domains e g chen et al 2008 ji et al 2006 pringle 2006 the source code of fvcom uses 3d unstructured grid free surface primitive equations the primitive governing equations are mathematically closed by using the modified mellor and yamada level 2 5 my 2 5 turbulent closure scheme for vertical mixing the σ coordinate transformation is used in the vertical direction to obtain a smooth representation of irregular variable bottom topography for detailed description one can refer to chen et al 2006a 2006b the ability of fvcom to accurately solve scalar conservation equations combined with the topological flexibility provided by unstructured meshes makes it ideally suited for the ire 2 3 2 computational domain and grids the model domain covers the entire ire area fig 3 including seven tributaries estuarine bays and coastal ocean areas the landward boundaries of the model domain are located at 98 km upstream because the ire is the most serious area suffered from seawater intrusion and coastal inundation the seaward boundary is extended to about 20 km into the open ocean as part of the shoreline data of the indus river are missing the map is overlaid from google earth to obtain the shoreline data of the rivers bathymetric data are also used to help determine the shoreline boundary the triangular grid has 13 236 nodes and 21 116 elements the horizontal resolution varies from 400 to 4000 m in the coastal and ocean areas respectively while it is from 20 to 280 m in the river channels very small triangular grids of about 20 m are used in the river channels the vertical grids are divided into 11 uniform σ layers the bathymetric data are interpolated to the mesh the bathymetry data for the open ocean are obtained from the hydrographic department of the pakistan navy the river bathymetry data were obtained from the national institute of oceanography nio of pakistan all bathymetry data used in this study are referenced to the mean sea level msl the maximum depth of the computational domain is about 25 m in the coastal ocean area along the entire coast of the indus delta water depth gradually increases up to 25 m within the indus shelf the estuary is shallow with a maximum depth of 7 m fig 4 which occurs in the lower estuary the middle estuary is quite shallow with the maximum depth of 3 m the width of the lower estuary varies from 900 to 2 800 m the maximum width occurs at the mouth of the estuary whereas the minimum width of 900 m is about 5 km upstream at the meandering point of the channels the middle estuary width varies from 500 to 1 500 m whereas the upper estuary width varies from 300 to 1 000 m 2 3 3 boundary forcing and initial conditions the model is forced by tides and river inflows the tidal elevation data for the open ocean boundary condition are obtained from http www ioc sealevelmonitoring org water level is calculated from eight tidal constituents namely m2 k2 s2 n2 k1 p1 o1 and q1 the initial salinity is set to 36 at the river boundary measured time series of water discharges at kotri hydrological station are applied during the wet season the river discharge is 300 m3 s from 1st july to 30th september the remaining period has zero river discharge the bottom stress is parameterized based on a logarithmic velocity profile with a roughness length of z0 0 001 cm the model is run from 1st june 2012 to 1st june 2014 then the result is used as the initial condition for numerical experiments the above mentioned model is set as the reference model and then used to examine the hydrodynamics and saltwater intrusion in the ire 2 4 process oriented numerical experiments numerical experiments are designed to analyze dynamic processes and examine the relationships of river discharges tidal forcing and bathymetry the hydrological data obtained from kotri barrge show that river discharges are irregular and limited to only three months from july to september each year therefore the configurations of these numerical experiments are designed as follows table 1 experiment 1 case 1 the model is driven by tidal forcing and zero river discharge experiment 2 case 2 same as case 1 except that the freshwater discharge of 300 m3 s is used to represent the wet season condition with normal river discharge experiment 3 case 3 same as case 2 but with smaller freshwater discharge of 30 m3 s to represent the wet season condition with low river discharge experiment 4 case 4 same as case 2 but with larger freshwater discharge of 3000 m3 s to represent the flood season condition these experiments are used to examine the temporal and spatial magnitude of seawater intrusion into the ire under various flow conditions 2 5 hydrodynamic model validation to access the model s capability we first compare numerical results with observed sea surface level and current velocity the water level data are obtained at stations 1 and 3 fig 1 the model skill is assessed by using the following statistical method suggested by ma et al 2011 s k i l l 1 n i 1 x m o d x o b s 2 n i 1 x m o d x o b s x o b s x o b s 2 where x is the variable being compared x is the mean of the sample and the subscripts mod and obs denotes model result and observation respectively according to ma et al 2011 this skill parameter quantifies the ratio to which observed deviations about the observed mean corresponds to the predicted deviations about the observed mean the skill varies from 0 to 1 a skill is said to be accurate if the model results and observations show a skill of 1 0 and a skill of 0 means they are in disagreement this skill parameter is computed for tidal elevation and current velocity at station 1 which shows a qualitative agreement between simulated and observed measurements the skill is found for tidal level and current velocity during wet and dry seasons and shown in table 2 the vertically averaged current was observed at station 1 during wet and dry seasons the comparison between observed and simulated velocities shows good agreement fig 6 numerical results of salinity are compared with the field measured data this skill parameter is calculated for salinity at eight stations which shows a qualitative agreement between simulated and observed measurements the averaged skill scores for tidally averaged longitudinal salinity surface and near bed at all stations are all larger than 0 7 during wet and dry seasons table 3 2 5 1 tidal elevation and currents fig 5 a and b c show comparison between calculated and observed water levels at stations 3 and 1 the calculated tidal amplitude and phase are in agreement with observed the maximum water level difference was 0 18 m between simulated results and observation at peaks and valleys at station 3 about 20 km upstream most likely the coarse bathymetry resolution was the reason for the difference the comparison between observed and simulated vertically averaged current velocities at the east west ua and the north south va directions shows qualitative agreement in terms of both magnitude and trend fig 6 2 5 2 salinity the modeled salinity is calibrated by the vertical profiles of salinity observed at the eight stations along the channel fig 1 during both wet and dry seasons the modeled salinity agrees well with the observed data in terms of both magnitude and trend the model reproduces the salinity dynamics very well during both wet fig 7 a b and dry fig 7 c d seasons 3 results analysis based on the verified simulation system more numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the dynamic process in the ire and to examine the impacts of river discharge on currents and salinity intrusion 3 1 residual circulation the residual estuarine circulation is also known as sub tidal circulation it governs the long term transports and distributions of salinity and other materials in the estuary it is caused by low frequency forces such as runoff wind baroclinic gradient force and the tide itself pritchard 1956 it is important for the exchanges of salt water and other biological and chemical materials manda et al 2010 the lagranian residual current u l which is the sum of the eulerian residual current u e and stokes drift u s is used in this study the first order approximation lagrangian residual current is calculated through averaging the tidal currents in a spring neap tidal cycle to remove the periodical components and it is done in σ coordinate to investigate the vertical structure giddings et al 2014 longuet higgins 1969 u l σ u e σ u s σ u e σ u s σ u s u σ η h 0 where u σ is the simulated current in σ layer and represents an average operator fig 8 shows the along stream vertical lagrangian residual current structure from the river mouth in case 1 the lagrangian residual currents are down stream from sea surface to bottom and from river mouth to 8 km upstream upper layer down stream and lower layer up stream in 20 km 40 km from the mouth from the river mouth to 8 km upstream upper layer residual currents are down stream and lower layer ones are up stream in case 2 and case 3 respectively residual currents are down stream in all layers from 10 km in case 2 and 2 km in case 4 in case 3 down stream residual currents in upper layers but strong up stream in lower layer figs 9 12 show the lagrangian residual current structure in the surface layer and bottom layer of the numerical experiments there are two residual eddies one cyclonical and another anticyclonical from surface to bottom in the area of aadowar about 8 km upstream in case 1 and case 3 with the river discharge increases case 2 and case 4 the eddies disappear 3 2 salinity stratification vertical salinity distribution near the mouth of the estuary is examined to study the stratification under different river discharges in case 1 in the absence of river runoff the vertically homogenous condition is seen at station 1 fig 13 a whereas in case 2 the partially stratified condition is seen in the presence of river runoff during wet season fig 13b in case 3 when the river discharge is lower 30 m3 s a small difference in flood and ebb phases is observed fig 13c though the estuary is vertically homogenous however in case 4 during flood period when river discharge is higher 3000 m3 s the whole water column is filled with fresh water it shows vertically homogenous with no flood and ebb differences fig 13d the numerical results reveal that stratification mixing occurs only at the mouth of the ire during wet seasons in the absence of freshwater discharge it is vertically homogenous and shows well mixed characteristics due to strong tidal forcing during wet season it behaves as a weakly stratified or partially mixed estuary this behavior is due to the tidal advection and shallowness of the estuary in the presence of fresh water salinity is lower at ebb tides and higher at flood tides when the whole water column is filled with saline water the water column is partially stratified due to estuarine circulation and tidal straining a slight gradient of salinity from surface to bottom occurs during both tidal phases but it is more obvious during flood phase due to density difference fig 13b during dry seasons in the absence of fresh water flood ebb and vertical variation are absent fig 13a because mixing processes in the ire are mainly activated by tidal currents and freshwater discharge the river runoff causes both downstream movement of the saline water and estuarine circulation when the runoff decreases the intensity of estuarine circulation is dampened in stratified estuaries salt transport predominantly due to advection by the net landward flow and the estuarine salt transport hansen and rattray 1966 in relatively well mixed or weakly stratified estuaries tidal dispersion plays an important role in the salt balance jay and smith 1990 the combined effects of river discharge tides and topography control seawater intrusion into the estuaries model results indicate that river runoff plays an important role in controlling seawater intrusion in case 2 the river runoff disperses seawater plume at the mouth of the estuary as a result vertical variation is not significant in case 4 when river discharge is 3000 m3 s the density front is significantly pushed outward from the estuary fig 13d fig 13c shows that the difference of salinity from bottom to surface is small during low river discharge whereas slight difference is observed in both flood and ebb phases in the absence of river discharge it changes from partially mixed circulation to well mixed circulation tides are the main dominant factor for seawater intrusion in the ire during dry seasons 3 3 distance of seawater intrusion during dry seasons when the river discharge is negligible 0 m3 s case 1 the salinity intrusion is very serious the maximum distance of salinity intrusion reaches 65 km upstream fig 14 a a small vertical variation occurs up to 20 km upstream however after 30 km upstream the surface to bottom variation is negligible in this case the estuarine circulation is driven by tides which intensify the upward intrusion of high salinity water considering case 3 wet season with low river discharge of 30 m3 s the salinity intrudes only 22 km upstream fig 14c the river flow is the most dominant factor in case 2 when river discharge is 300 m3 s it pushes back the seawater plume to about 8 km upstream fig 14b on the other hand in case 4 when river discharge is 3000 m3 s the density front is significantly pushed outward from the estuary fig 14d however salinity is absent from the estuary in ebb as well as in flood tide hence seawater intrusion is directly related to the decrease of freshwater discharge rate 4 discussion the ire is a complex system with numerous bays and tidal creeks and varying bathymetry due to the complexity of the estuarine system various physical processes would be involved to contribute to the saltwater intrusion because multiple forces such as river discharge bathymetry tides wind and wave all influence the dynamic processes of the estuarine system since this is a preliminary numerical study to investigate the dynamic processes in the ire only the basic hydrodynamic processes such as river discharge tidal forcing and bathymetric etc are studied due to the limitations of field measurements wind and wave are excluded from the model even with the absence of these forcing factors this simulation system still shows powerful capability of capturing the major dynamic processes of the ire the results show that the simulation system can correctly capture the dynamic processes of interactions between river discharge and oceanic forcing the simulation system is well calibrated and validated using field measurements based on the validated simulation system several process oriented numerical experiments were conducted to study the basic dynamic processes and to find out the relationship between these effecting factors such as river discharge tidal forcing bathymetry etc in future effort will be taken to develop a full simulation system which includes coastal currents wind and wave the numerical results reveal that intensity of currents increases at upstream in the absence of river runoff which enhances the effect of tidal forcing and results in seawater intrusion and vice versa in the presence of river runoff seawater intrusion is limited to only 8 km upstream with a thin layer of brackish water at the bottom during the dry season salt wedge of 5 psu penetrates into the estuary about 65 km upstream with a small vertical variation up to 20 km upstream however such variation is negligible within 30 km from the mouth the manmade activities such as construction of large dams reservoirs and barrages at the upstream of the indus river system have resulted in serious reduction of fresh water water abstraction at upstream has greatly affected the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ire the numerical results of salinity reveal that stratification destratification occurs only at the mouth during the wet season in the absence of freshwater discharge it is vertically homogenous and shows well mixed characteristics due to strong tidal forcing during the wet season it behaves as weakly stratified or partially mixed estuary at the mouth this behavior is due to the shallowness of the estuary and tidal straining during ebb tides river water pushes back salinity gradient to the sea and the whole water column is filled with fresh water while at flood tides tidal straining fills water column with saline water the water column is partially stratified when tidal straining decreases however a slight variation from surface to bottom was observed during both tidal phases though it was more obvious during flood phase due to density difference the seawater intrusion strength generally depends on the amount of river flow sea surface height and inclination of the riverbed though two of the factors change with time the river bed is fixed however the ire has seven active tributaries during the dry season in flood tide the volume of tidal prism also increases which may enhance the upward intrusion of saltwater in the absence of river runoff therefore the mechanism of seawater intrusion is mainly due to the absence of river runoff and tidal forcing through many channels which are responsible for the seawater intrusion in the ire in this study we only examined hydrodynamics driven by tides and river discharge these results can help future studies however more realistic simulations should be carried out in future by adding other parameters such as wind stress to examine the wind effect on physical processes in the ire 5 conclusions a fvcom based high resolution hydrodynamic model is successfully established to numerically analyze seawater intrusion in the ire together with a long time series of field survey model calibration and verification are conducted with field measured data the observed and simulated salinity currents and water level fields are in good agreement given the same tidal forcing and background salinity four numerical experiments were designed as case studies to identify the importance of freshwater discharge into the ire under the same tidal forcing these process oriented numerical experiments show that hydrodynamic processes of the ire including tides currents residual currents and salinity are largely dependent on the seasonality of fluvial discharge river runoff plays an important role in controlling seawater intrusion into the ire flood currents are smaller than ebb currents and flood phases are shorter than ebb phases due to the impact of river discharge currents are all seaward during both flood and ebb phases in the flood seasons due to strong river discharge stratification and mixing occur only at the mouth of the ire during the wet seasons in the absence of freshwater discharge during the dry seasons the study region is vertically homogenous and showed well mixed characteristics due to tidal forcing while the horizontal density gradient varies from mouth to upstream vertical variation is absent at the upstream during both seasons due to shallow bathymetry of the estuary the numerical results reveal that the intensity of currents increases at upstream in the absence of river runoff because the complicated geomorphological system of the ire also impacts the seawater intrusion since it has seven active tidal channels during the flooding period of a dry season as the tide volume of tidal prism increases it may enhance the upward saltwater intrusion through all the tidal channels in the absence of river runoff though the estuary is shallow it also becomes narrow 25 km upstream thus the combined effect of many tidal channels intensifies the strength of seawater in the upstream in the absence of river runoff therefore the mechanism of seawater intrusion in the ire is tidal forcing through many channels in the absence of river runoff the distance of salinity intrusion is basically controlled by river discharge larger river discharge pushes the saline water seaward to the mouth of the ire during flood seasons while zero river discharge during dry season leads to serious saltwater intrusion at upstream the results of this study can help the freshwater supply operation upstream of the indus river the physical processes in the ire have never been systematically investigated and understood our study is the first attempt to reveal physical processes and mechanisms by combining long term field surveys and a high resolution coastal ocean model in this study we only examine the hydrodynamics driven by tides and river discharges future work should add other parameters such as wind stress to examine the wind effect on physical processes in the ire because the study area is influenced by monsoons the southwest and northeast monsoon winds have significant influences on the region furthermore the influences of anthropogenic activities such as the change of river topography and tidal creeks need further study

22731,although underwater acoustic uwa communication based on vector sensors has been intensively investigated in past years most of these works focus on theoretical analysis and simulation and only very limited research on the practical application of vector sensors to underwater platforms i e uuvs is available recently a data transmission experiment between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv was conducted in qiandao lake zhejiang province china during this experiment a compact vector sensor array with four elements was installed on the uuv this paper proposes a two stage data processing scheme for the experimental data the fractional fourier transform frft is first used to estimate the delay doppler parameter of uwa channels the delay estimation can help determine the number of equalizer taps while the doppler estimation can help determine the resampling frequency in the passband then a new receiver called the vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer vm dfe is proposed to deal with the inter symbol interference isi introduced by uwa channels the experimental results show that the proposed two stage data processing scheme realizes satisfactory performance and achieves a 1 8 db gain compared with a pressure sensor based equalizer keywords uwa communication unmanned underwater vehicle vector sensor array fractional fourier transform vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer 1 introduction while remote sensing techniques from satellites and airplanes provide useful data they do not penetrate very far below the ocean s surface to gain insight into the temporal and spatial processes below the ocean surface alternative sensing techniques such as uuvs have emerged over the last decade to complement existing sensing techniques yan et al 2018 however the uwa channel is regarded as one of the most challenging wireless channels qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013 consequently a large size array is often employed to achieve acceptable performance and deal with significant multipath and fast channel fluctuations however it is almost impossible to accommodate such a large array on compact underwater platforms additionally the doppler effect may introduce distortion when communicating to a mobile uuv all in all it is challenging to achieve robust data transmissions between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv aiming to solve these problems this study explores using a new receiver the vm dfe to deal with uwa channels and estimates the delay doppler parameters of uwa channels solely by using frft acoustic vector sensors are capable of measuring three orthogonal particle velocity channels of the acoustic field in addition to the scalar acoustic pressure at the same point in space nehorai and paldi 1994 the pressure channel and velocity channel waveforms have the same phase and are theoretically coherent provided that the source is in the far field hui and hui which allows for beamforming for vector sensor signals to suppress isotropic noise interference and improve the signal to noise ratio snr of the received signal since the end of the last decade vector sensors have been widely used in many aspects of underwater missions such as underwater target detection direction of arrival doa estimation and underwater noise measurement wong and zoltowski 1997 hawkes and nehorai 1998 2001 recently vector sensors were introduced in uwa communications in this application different vector sensor channels are always regarded as independent channels so certain spatial diversity based equalizers have been used in vector sensor communication ali abdi has extensively studied acoustic particle velocity channels and vector sensor receivers for uwa communication as reported in abdi and guo 2009 a single vector can serve as a multichannel receiver for uwa communication experimental results show that a single vector sensor can provide similar gain as that from a four sensor pressure sensor array the same conclusion was found in song et al 2011 which verifies that the single vector sensor has the same performance as the pressure sensor array for a long communication range in guo et al 2011 the information shannon capacity of uwa particle velocity channels is studied using measured data vector sensors are also used in multiuser uwa communications making use of its directivity to suppress interference from undesired users various configurations of a biaxial particle velocity sensor are investigated for subspace based direction finding of a point size emitter impinging from the far field song et al 2015 the active acoustic intensity average was proposed in yin et al 2012 to support a three user uwa communication other studies on uwa communication using vector sensors can be found in wang et al 2015 and han et al 2015 to estimate the doppler effect introduced by a moving uuv an frft based delay doppler uwa channel parameter estimation method is used in this paper the delay estimation can help determine the number of equalizer taps while the doppler estimation can help determine the resampling frequency in the passband frft is a signal processing tool mostly suitable for chirps it decomposes the chirp signal into the chirp s orthonormal basis frft was first proposed to solve the local differential equations generated in quantum mechanics by v namias 1980 in 1993 l b almeida redefined the definition of frft using the wigner distribution and explained the rotation operator of the time frequency plane from a new definition and presented its discrete representation almeida 1994 recently the frft has been widely used in many underwater applications such as underwater target detection and parameter estimation and uwa channel estimation t c yang used frft to estimate the time delay and doppler shift of the target echo under severe reverberation environments and compared its performance with the wideband ambiguity parameter method yu et al 2017 a delay doppler parameter estimation method for a doubly spread channel based on the frft is proposed in zhao et al 2015 however this method must work together with a matched filter to complete the delay estimation between different paths a concise frft method with a simple form is proposed in chen et al 2015 its discrete calculation realization can also significantly improve the real time processing speed of underwater target detection and parameter estimation the differences between this work and the previous works can be summarized in the following two points the first of which pertains to the receiver structure the receiver in this paper includes two parts first vector signal processing can improve the snr of the received signal through the linear combination of the pressure channel and the particle velocity channels second a vector multichannel equalizer exploits the spatial diversity of the vector sensor array to deal with the isi introduced by uwa channels the second point is that the experimental data in this study was gathered between a surface vessel and a practical uuv with a compact vector sensor array a rare feat in previous works the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii describes the proposed vm dfe receiver in detail section iii derives the equations for using frft to estimate the delay doppler parameter of the uwa channel and gives some simulation results section iv gives the experimental data processing results section iv summarizes the paper 2 vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer vm dfe the vm dfe block diagram is shown in fig 1 for an acoustic vector sensor with a bi axial velocity sensor plus one pressure sensor lee et al 2016 the received signal can be expressed as 1 p t x t η p t v x t x t cos θ

are isotropic additive incoherent interferences which are independent from each other θ is the horizontal azimuth of the incident acoustic wave and θ 0 2 π note that we suppose the far field case in this paper where the distance between the source and the vector sensor is much larger than the wavelength we also omit the acoustic impedance ρ c for the pressure component in eq 1 for a more detailed mathematical derivation of vector sensor s array manifold one can refer to wu et al 2010 and wu et al 2016 according to the correspondence between pressure and velocity components we use acoustic intensity average aia to estimate the source bearing in this paper the output of aia can be expressed as 2 i x t p t v x t x 2 t cos θ η p t η v x t η p t x t cos θ η v x t x t 3 i y t p t v y t x 2 t sin θ η p t η v y t η p t x t sin θ η v y t x t where the horizontal lines in eq 2 and eq 3 indicate the time average η p t η x t η y t and x t are independent from each other the first terms of i x t and i y t are the expected terms and the remaining terms can be treated as small quantities through the above process eq 2 and eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 i x t p t v x t x 2 t cos θ δ x 5 i y t p t v y t x 2 t sin θ δ y where δ x and δ y are small numbers we can use aia to estimate the direction of the signal 6 θ arctan i y t i x t arctan p t v y t p t v x t using the estimated azimuth information the directivity of the vector sensor can be adjusted by a linear combination of pressure and velocity components when the directivity points to the source a vector sensor can suppress some interference from undesired directions improving the snr in this paper we use a linear combination s t p t 2 v c t where 7 v c t v x t cos θ v y t sin θ x t cos θ θ the combined signal s t can be used further to suppress some isi introduced by uwa channels based on m dfe the output of m dfe can be expressed as 8 d n p n q n i 1 n w f f i h n s i n e j θ i n w f b h n d n where n is the number of

i initially iii frft based delay doppler parameter estimation of uwa channels frft is a signal processing tool mostly suitable for chirps as it decomposes the chirp s signal into its orthonormal basis an lfm signal as shown by the thick solid line in fig 2 can be represented by 15 x t exp j 2 π f 0 t π k t 2 φ t δ t 2 δ t 2 where f 0 is the initial frequency k is the chirp rate φ is the initial phase and δ t is the duration the term 2 π f 0 t π k t 2 φ defines the phase and the instantaneous frequency can be represented by the first derivative of the phase namely f 0 k t the frft of signal x t is defined as 16 x p u f p x t k p t u x t d t where p is the frft order and can be any real number f p stands for the frft operator and k p t u is the kernel of frft defined as 17 k p t u a α exp j π t 2 u 2 cot α 2 u t csc α α n π δ t u α 2 n π δ t u α 2 n 1 π where a α 1 j cot α 2 π is the amplitude factor and α is the rotation angle of the frft when p 1 or α π 2 one finds that the frft reduces to a classical fourier transform so the frft is a generalization of the classical fourier transform first we estimate the doppler effect of the uwa channels for an lfm signal the optimum transform order p o p t can be expressed by 18 p o p t 2 α π 2 π cot 1 m k f s 2 where f s is the sampling rate k is the frequency modulation slope and m is the number of sampling points when there is a doppler effect the frequency modulation slope of the lfm signal will change to k 1 δ 2 k where δ is the doppler coefficient by searching step by step we can get the optimum transform order p o p t of the received lfm signal which is contaminated by the doppler effect so the doppler coefficient estimation results can be expressed as 19 δ cot p o p t π 2 f s 2 m k 1 second we estimate the multipath structure of the uwa channels given a data block of duration t in which the sync signal of the communication frame exists within a duration the problem of estimating the multipath structure can be turned into a problem of estimating the amplitude and delay time of the multipath suppose at time τ the lfm signal begins to appear with an initial frequency f 0 and at time τ δ t the lfm signal disappears with a final frequency f 1 as shown in fig 2 the coordinates of point a can be given by τ t 2 s f 0 s and the coordinates of the point b can be given by τ δ t t 2 s f 1 s where s is

the simulation parameters are as follows the sampling frequency is 25 khz the initial and final lfm signal frequencies are 3 khz and 5 khz respectively and the duration is 200 ms fig 3 a shows the monte carlo simulation result of the doppler effect estimation by frft under different snr and velocity conditions the frft based doppler effect estimation method has a strong anti noise interference ability and it achieves satisfactory performance even in a low snr environment i e 5 db when the snr gets to 0 db its performance gradually stabilizes fig 3 b shows the delay estimation simulation result from the frft when the snr is 0 db in this simulation the uwa channel has three paths with amplitudes of 1 0 7 0 4 and the corresponding delays are 0 5 ms 10 ms respectively fig 3 b shows that the frft achieves an accurate multipath structure estimation 2 1 experimental data processing a lake experiment of uwa communication to uuv was conducted at qiandao lake zhejiang province china in august 2017 the experimental environment was difficult since the water surface was relatively rough during the entire experiment the diving depth of the uuv was 6 m and the transducer was deployed from a surface vessel to a depth of 10 m the relative velocity between the uuv and the surface vessel was 1 5 m s fig 4 shows the layout of the vector sensors on the uuv four sensors denoted as a b c and d from the stern to the bow of uuv respectively were uniformly spaced 0 5 m apart multiple data frames were transmitted during the experiment the communication sequences were modulated by qpsk the transmitted waveform was pulse shaped using a raised cosine filter with a roll off factor of 1 the center frequency was 4 khz the symbol rate was 1000 symbols s the communication rate was 2 kb s and all signals were sampled at 25 khz 21000 bits were transmitted during this experiment the first 1000 bits were used as a training sequence fig 5 shows the estimated uwa channels using the pressure components of each vector sensor the following conclusions can be obtained from fig 5 a fig 5 d 1 the multipath structures are very complex during this experiment and the direct signal and the reflected signal from the surface and the bottom mixed together making it very difficult to distinguish between them 2 during the first four seconds of the communication sequence the acoustic energy focuses to a single channel as time goes on the acoustic energy begins to diverge this phenomenon may be caused by the dynamic environment and the motion of the uuv 3 there is a strong doppler effect throughout the entire data frame leading to time varying uwa channels fig 5 e shows the temporal coherence of the estimated uwa channels the channels changed rapidly during the experiment the channels are totally incoherent with those of two seconds prior fig 5 f shows the cross channel coherence between different vector sensors although the vector sensors are closely spaced their channels are sometime weakly incoherent which means that a spatial diversity method such as m dfe can be used to obtain the diversity gain to estimate and compensate for the doppler effect introduced by relative motion between the uuv and the transducer the frft is first used to estimate the delay doppler parameter fig 6 shows the estimated result based on the transmitted lfm signal at the beginning of the data frame the lfm signal parameters are as follows the initial and final frequencies are 3 khz and 5 khz respectively the signal duration is 200 ms and the sampling frequency is 25 khz by searching the interval 1 0 the optimum transform order of the received lfm signal is 0 9492 using eq 19 the calculated doppler coefficient is 0 00021 which leads to a passband resampling frequency of 24995 hz after resampling this study first uses the pressure components of each vector sensor to restore the transmitted information an rls algorithm is used when updating the coefficients of dfe with the forgetting factor λ 0 9965 and the matrix initialization factor δ 0 01 the proportional and integral tracking constants of pll are 0 0001 and 0 00001 respectively according to the delay doppler parameter estimation result in fig 6 the tap numbers of the feedforward filter and the feedback filter are both set to 20 fig 7 a shows the constellation of equalized symbols only using the pressure component of each vector sensor the equalized output snr osnr is 7 6 db and the bit error rate ber is 7 6 then this paper uses vm dfe to process the experimental data fig 7 b shows the constellation of equalized symbols the osnr is 9 4 db and the ber is 0 4 compared with the pressure component based method the osnr increased by 1 8 db and the ber decreased greatly this experimental result shows that even a compact vector sensor array can achieve better performance compared with a traditional pressure sensor array 3 conclusion an experimental demonstration of data transmission between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv based on a compact vector sensor array was conducted in a recent lake experiment this paper proposes a two stage data processing scheme for the experimental data consisting of the frft based delay doppler parameter estimation followed by a vm dfe equalizer the frft is used to determine the resampling frequency in the passband and to estimate the multipath structure vm dfe is then used to equalize the baseband symbols exploiting the spatial diversity of the vector sensor array the experimental results show that vm dfe achieves a 1 8 db gain compared with a pressure sensor based equalizer indicating that a compact vector sensor can also be used by small underwater platforms such as uuvs to obtain satisfactory performance acknowledgement this

22731,although underwater acoustic uwa communication based on vector sensors has been intensively investigated in past years most of these works focus on theoretical analysis and simulation and only very limited research on the practical application of vector sensors to underwater platforms i e uuvs is available recently a data transmission experiment between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv was conducted in qiandao lake zhejiang province china during this experiment a compact vector sensor array with four elements was installed on the uuv this paper proposes a two stage data processing scheme for the experimental data the fractional fourier transform frft is first used to estimate the delay doppler parameter of uwa channels the delay estimation can help determine the number of equalizer taps while the doppler estimation can help determine the resampling frequency in the passband then a new receiver called the vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer vm dfe is proposed to deal with the inter symbol interference isi introduced by uwa channels the experimental results show that the proposed two stage data processing scheme realizes satisfactory performance and achieves a 1 8 db gain compared with a pressure sensor based equalizer keywords uwa communication unmanned underwater vehicle vector sensor array fractional fourier transform vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer 1 introduction while remote sensing techniques from satellites and airplanes provide useful data they do not penetrate very far below the ocean s surface to gain insight into the temporal and spatial processes below the ocean surface alternative sensing techniques such as uuvs have emerged over the last decade to complement existing sensing techniques yan et al 2018 however the uwa channel is regarded as one of the most challenging wireless channels qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013 consequently a large size array is often employed to achieve acceptable performance and deal with significant multipath and fast channel fluctuations however it is almost impossible to accommodate such a large array on compact underwater platforms additionally the doppler effect may introduce distortion when communicating to a mobile uuv all in all it is challenging to achieve robust data transmissions between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv aiming to solve these problems this study explores using a new receiver the vm dfe to deal with uwa channels and estimates the delay doppler parameters of uwa channels solely by using frft acoustic vector sensors are capable of measuring three orthogonal particle velocity channels of the acoustic field in addition to the scalar acoustic pressure at the same point in space nehorai and paldi 1994 the pressure channel and velocity channel waveforms have the same phase and are theoretically coherent provided that the source is in the far field hui and hui which allows for beamforming for vector sensor signals to suppress isotropic noise interference and improve the signal to noise ratio snr of the received signal since the end of the last decade vector sensors have been widely used in many aspects of underwater missions such as underwater target detection direction of arrival doa estimation and underwater noise measurement wong and zoltowski 1997 hawkes and nehorai 1998 2001 recently vector sensors were introduced in uwa communications in this application different vector sensor channels are always regarded as independent channels so certain spatial diversity based equalizers have been used in vector sensor communication ali abdi has extensively studied acoustic particle velocity channels and vector sensor receivers for uwa communication as reported in abdi and guo 2009 a single vector can serve as a multichannel receiver for uwa communication experimental results show that a single vector sensor can provide similar gain as that from a four sensor pressure sensor array the same conclusion was found in song et al 2011 which verifies that the single vector sensor has the same performance as the pressure sensor array for a long communication range in guo et al 2011 the information shannon capacity of uwa particle velocity channels is studied using measured data vector sensors are also used in multiuser uwa communications making use of its directivity to suppress interference from undesired users various configurations of a biaxial particle velocity sensor are investigated for subspace based direction finding of a point size emitter impinging from the far field song et al 2015 the active acoustic intensity average was proposed in yin et al 2012 to support a three user uwa communication other studies on uwa communication using vector sensors can be found in wang et al 2015 and han et al 2015 to estimate the doppler effect introduced by a moving uuv an frft based delay doppler uwa channel parameter estimation method is used in this paper the delay estimation can help determine the number of equalizer taps while the doppler estimation can help determine the resampling frequency in the passband frft is a signal processing tool mostly suitable for chirps it decomposes the chirp signal into the chirp s orthonormal basis frft was first proposed to solve the local differential equations generated in quantum mechanics by v namias 1980 in 1993 l b almeida redefined the definition of frft using the wigner distribution and explained the rotation operator of the time frequency plane from a new definition and presented its discrete representation almeida 1994 recently the frft has been widely used in many underwater applications such as underwater target detection and parameter estimation and uwa channel estimation t c yang used frft to estimate the time delay and doppler shift of the target echo under severe reverberation environments and compared its performance with the wideband ambiguity parameter method yu et al 2017 a delay doppler parameter estimation method for a doubly spread channel based on the frft is proposed in zhao et al 2015 however this method must work together with a matched filter to complete the delay estimation between different paths a concise frft method with a simple form is proposed in chen et al 2015 its discrete calculation realization can also significantly improve the real time processing speed of underwater target detection and parameter estimation the differences between this work and the previous works can be summarized in the following two points the first of which pertains to the receiver structure the receiver in this paper includes two parts first vector signal processing can improve the snr of the received signal through the linear combination of the pressure channel and the particle velocity channels second a vector multichannel equalizer exploits the spatial diversity of the vector sensor array to deal with the isi introduced by uwa channels the second point is that the experimental data in this study was gathered between a surface vessel and a practical uuv with a compact vector sensor array a rare feat in previous works the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii describes the proposed vm dfe receiver in detail section iii derives the equations for using frft to estimate the delay doppler parameter of the uwa channel and gives some simulation results section iv gives the experimental data processing results section iv summarizes the paper 2 vector multichannel decision feedback equalizer vm dfe the vm dfe block

this paper where the distance between the source and the vector sensor is much larger than the wavelength we also omit the acoustic impedance ρ c for the pressure component in eq 1 for a more detailed mathematical derivation of vector sensor s array manifold one can refer to wu et al 2010 and wu et al 2016 according to the correspondence between pressure and velocity components we use acoustic intensity average aia to estimate the source bearing in this paper the output of aia can be expressed as 2 i x t p t v x t x 2 t cos θ η p t η v x t η p t x t cos θ η v x t x t 3 i y t p t v y t x 2 t sin θ η p t η v y t η p t x t sin θ η v y t x t where the horizontal lines in eq 2 and eq 3 indicate the time average η p t η x t η y t and x t are independent from each other the first terms of i x t and i y t are the expected terms and the remaining terms can be treated as small quantities through the above process eq 2 and eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 i x t p t v x t x 2 t cos θ δ x 5 i y t p t v y t x 2 t sin θ δ y where δ x and δ y are small numbers we can use aia to estimate the direction of the signal 6 θ arctan i y t i x t arctan p t v y t p t v x t using the estimated azimuth information the directivity of the vector sensor can be adjusted by a linear combination of pressure and velocity components when the directivity points to the source a vector sensor can suppress some interference from undesired directions improving the snr in this paper we use a linear combination s t p t 2 v c t where 7 v c t v x t cos θ v y t sin θ x t cos θ θ the combined signal s t can be used further to suppress some isi introduced by uwa channels based on m dfe the output of m dfe can be expressed as 8 d n p n q n i 1 n w f f i h n s i n e j θ i n w f b h n d n where n is the number of

i initially iii frft based delay doppler parameter estimation of uwa channels frft is a signal processing tool mostly suitable for chirps as it decomposes the chirp s signal into its orthonormal basis an lfm signal as shown by the thick solid line in fig 2 can be represented by 15 x t exp j 2 π f 0 t π k t 2 φ t δ t 2 δ t 2 where f 0 is the initial frequency k is the chirp rate φ is the initial phase and δ t is the duration the term 2 π f 0 t π k t 2 φ defines the phase and the instantaneous frequency can be represented by the first derivative of the phase namely f 0 k t the frft of signal x t is defined as 16 x p u f p x t k p t u x t d t where p is the frft order and can be any real number f p stands for the frft operator and k p t u is the kernel of frft defined as 17 k p t u a α exp j π t 2 u 2 cot α 2 u t csc α α n π δ t u α 2 n π δ t u α 2 n 1 π where a α 1 j cot α 2 π is the amplitude factor and α is the rotation angle of the frft when p 1 or α π 2 one finds that the frft reduces to a classical fourier transform so the frft is a generalization of the classical fourier transform first we estimate the doppler effect of the uwa channels for an lfm signal the optimum transform order p o p t can be expressed by 18 p o p t 2 α π 2 π cot 1 m k f s 2 where f s is the sampling rate k is the frequency modulation slope and m is the number of sampling points when there is a doppler effect the frequency modulation slope of the lfm signal will change to k 1 δ 2 k where δ is the doppler coefficient by searching step by step we can get the optimum transform order p o p t of the received lfm signal which is contaminated by the doppler effect so the doppler coefficient estimation results can be expressed as 19 δ cot p o p t π 2 f s 2 m k 1 second we estimate the multipath structure of the uwa channels given a data block of duration t in which the sync signal of the communication frame exists within a duration the problem of estimating the multipath structure can be turned into a problem of estimating the amplitude and delay time of the multipath suppose at time τ the lfm signal begins to appear with an initial frequency f 0 and at time τ δ t the lfm signal disappears with a final frequency f 1 as shown in fig 2 the coordinates of point a can be given by τ t 2 s f 0 s and the coordinates of the point b can be given by τ δ t t 2 s f 1 s where s is the rescaling factor and s t f s through geometric transformation we can obtain the coordinates of point c as 0 f 0 s k τ t 2 s so the projection of the vector c on the u a x i s is given by 20 u 0 c sin α 0 f 0 s k τ t 2 s sin α 0 re writing eq 20 we can get the time offset τ as a parameter of u 0 21 u t 0 τ f 0 t 2 k k u 0 csc α 0 k s if u t 0 is the time benchmark the real time delay corresponding to each point in the u a x i s can be expressed by 22 u t u t 0 u u 0 csc α 0 k s in this paper a computer simulation is conducted for the frft based delay doppler parameter estimation the simulation parameters are as follows the sampling frequency is 25 khz the initial and final lfm signal frequencies are 3 khz and 5 khz respectively and the duration is 200 ms fig 3 a shows the monte carlo simulation result of the doppler effect estimation by frft under different snr and velocity conditions the frft based doppler effect estimation method has a strong anti noise interference ability and it achieves satisfactory performance even in a low snr environment i e 5 db when the snr gets to 0 db its performance gradually stabilizes fig 3 b shows the delay estimation simulation result from the frft when the snr is 0 db in this simulation the uwa channel has three paths with amplitudes of 1 0 7 0 4 and the corresponding delays are 0 5 ms 10 ms respectively fig 3 b shows that the frft achieves an accurate multipath structure estimation 2 1 experimental data processing a lake experiment of uwa communication to uuv was conducted at qiandao lake zhejiang province china in august 2017 the experimental environment was difficult since the water surface was relatively rough during the entire experiment the diving depth of the uuv was 6 m and the transducer was deployed

all signals were sampled at 25 khz 21000 bits were transmitted during this experiment the first 1000 bits were used as a training sequence fig 5 shows the estimated uwa channels using the pressure components of each vector sensor the following conclusions can be obtained from fig 5 a fig 5 d 1 the multipath structures are very complex during this experiment and the direct signal and the reflected signal from the surface and the bottom mixed together making it very difficult to distinguish between them 2 during the first four seconds of the communication sequence the acoustic energy focuses to a single channel as time goes on the acoustic energy begins to diverge this phenomenon may be caused by the dynamic environment and the motion of the uuv 3 there is a strong doppler effect throughout the entire data frame leading to time varying uwa channels fig 5 e shows the temporal coherence of the estimated uwa channels the channels changed rapidly during the experiment the channels are totally incoherent with those of two seconds prior fig 5 f shows the cross channel coherence between different vector sensors although the vector sensors are closely spaced their channels are sometime weakly incoherent which means that a spatial diversity method such as m dfe can be used to obtain the diversity gain to estimate and compensate for the doppler effect introduced by relative motion between the uuv and the transducer the frft is first used to estimate the delay doppler parameter fig 6 shows the estimated result based on the transmitted lfm signal at the beginning of the

the interval 1 0 the optimum transform order of the received lfm signal is 0 9492 using eq 19 the calculated doppler coefficient is 0 00021 which leads to a passband resampling frequency of 24995 hz after resampling this study first uses the pressure components of each vector sensor to restore the transmitted information an rls algorithm is used when updating the coefficients of dfe with the forgetting factor λ 0 9965 and the matrix initialization factor δ 0 01 the proportional and integral tracking constants of pll are 0 0001 and 0 00001 respectively according to the delay doppler

of equalized symbols the osnr is 9 4 db and the ber is 0 4 compared with the pressure component based method the osnr increased by 1 8 db and the ber decreased greatly this experimental result shows that even a compact vector sensor array can achieve better performance compared with a traditional pressure sensor array 3 conclusion an experimental demonstration of data transmission between a surface vessel and a mobile uuv based on a compact vector sensor array was conducted in a recent lake experiment this paper proposes a two stage data processing scheme for the experimental data

22732,this work investigates wave energy attenuation by double trapezoidal porous structures of different structural parameters using a multi domain boundary element method under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory two different cases are considered a wave scattering by dual trapezoidal porous structures and b wave trapping by dual trapezoidal structures near a sloping porous wall backed by a rigid wall the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients along with the wave force exerted on the rigid wall are evaluated and analyzed to illustrate the effects of different structural configurations on wave flow as a special case wave scattering by a single structure is investigated and compared with the results for double trapezoidal structures it is found that almost 90 of wave energy is dissipated by double structures which is much higher than the energy attenuation in the presence of a single structure for wave trapping the results for four different cases are studied i absence of any porous structures ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall iii presence of a single structure with the seawall and iv presence of double structures with the seawall wave reflection and force on the rigid wall are found to be significantly minimized by double structures as compared to that for the other cases finally the findings of this study can give crucial information to the coastal engineers for designing varied combinations of trapezoidal porous structures as effective breakwaters keywords oblique waves wave scattering and trapping submerged porous structures multi domain boundary element method wave energy dissipation 1 introduction submerged porous structures are set up as breakwaters to create a tranquility zone near the coastline that protects the marine facilities by minimizing the incoming wave action these structures have become increasingly common owing to their efficiency durability minimal visual impact and mobility of water transport over the breakwater in recent decades various numerical analytical and experimental models have been developed for wave interaction with single multiple non porous porous structures in various configurations that are proposed as breakwaters even though a single trapezoidal structure is a thoroughly examined breakwater system in literature recent advances have elucidated the advantages of implementing dual structures for effective reduction of wave height on lee side of the system see jeon and cho 2006 chang and liou 2007 cao et al 2012 liu et al 2016 cox and clark 1992 described the physical model and design of an innovative dual trapezoidal breakwater configuration which combines a conventional rubble mound breakwater and a submerged smaller structure operating in tandem and first set up at the southern end of lake michigan usa it was found to cost 1 million less than a corresponding single breakwater design for same conditions as the main structure is designed to be cost effective while the outer structure reduces the incoming wave height recently thesnaar 2015 identified a site in mossel bay south africa suitable for implementation of dual trapezoidal breakwaters however designing of these structures requires further numerical and experimental investigation into the interactions of such configuration with incoming wave action thereby motivating the present work the classical mathematical model describing wave interaction with a submerged structure was given by sollitt and cross 1972 with structural porosity included in the model since then many authors have utilized and modified the sollitt cross model for various applications sulisz 1985 created a hybrid model of infinite rubble mound breakwater using boundary element method bem for numerical evaluation and verified that the experimental and theoretical results are in reasonable agreement dalrymple et al 1991 used sollitt and cross model to study oblique waves over a porous breakwater with vertical faces and deduced that a plane wave approximation on neglecting evanescent modes near the structure provides adequate solutions for wave scattering when damping within the structure is small losada et al 1996 used eigenfunction expansion and mild slope equation for 3 d models in order to analyze the wave reflection and transmission by submerged porous structures additionally losada et al 1993 examined wave reflection and transmission for wave interactions with varied combinations of porous screens and water gaps and demonstrated the occurrence of bragg resonance recently cheng et al 2014 studied anti motion properties of very large floating structures vlfs edged using perforated plates at various water depths they further expanded to numerically and experimentally examine the hydrodynamic performance of vlfs using dual edged structures and under oblique irregular wave action cheng et al 2016b cheng et al 2016a ji et al 2018 they studied the effects of porosity submerged depth angles of incline and the spacing of plates on hydroelastic properties of vlfs liu and li 2014 further studied wave interaction with a new configuration of pile rock structures using matched eigenfunction expansion method they deduced that in the submerged pile rock breakwater configuration most of wave energy dissipated was due to the rock core while a small part of wave energy was dissipated by the closely spaced piles recently liu et al 2016 examined multiple submerged semi circular breakwaters for bragg resonance in reflection of water waves by applying multi pole expansions to develop linear solutions for the potentials khan and behera 2018 also studied waves past double rectangular porous structures to illustrate bragg resonance a detailed review on wave interaction with porous coastal structures can be found in losada et al 2016 in particular submerged trapezoidal breakwaters are especially preferred in the regions of shallow water because these structures are effective in dissipating long wave energy the model for utilization of trapezoidal breakwaters for wave energy attenuation was explicitly developed by madsen and white 1977 wherein multi layered trapezoidal breakwaters were approximated with equivalent rectangular breakwaters using the mild slope equation method rojanakamthorn et al 1991 studied the wave propagation over a submerged permeable trapezoidal breakwater mounted on a sloping bottom and validated the model by comparison with the experimental results for a trapezoidal breakwater along with the solution for a rectangular breakwater using the matching method chang and liou 2007 developed an analytical solution for long wave reflection and transmission from submerged trapezoidal breakwaters and found that the top width and arrangement of the breakwater array are two major parameters in designing multiple composite bragg breakwaters cao et al 2012 experimentally analyzed energy dissipation properties of dual trapezoidal submerged breakwaters on a flat bed xie and liu 2013 performed an analytical study of trapezoidal breakwater in a channel using modified mild slope equation along with a taylor series expansion the solution given was valid for the whole wave range and thus superior to long wave analytical solutions the new solution was found as superior to the eigenfunction expansion method without an approximation to the linear sloped transitions recently scattering of oblique waves by a submerged composite trapezoidal breakwater and trapping of waves when the breakwater is placed at a finite distance from a vertical rigid wall was investigated by koley et al 2015 apart from wave scattering there is a significant interest in wave trapping by porous structures near a rigid wall in a single two layer fluid in these studies the main objective is to find the optimum distance between the structure and rigid wall for moderate values of wave structural parameters to create a tranquility zone near lee side of the structures wave trapping by fully extended porous structure near the end of a semi infinitely long channel was studied by chwang and li 1983 by using the linearized porous wavemaker theory developed by chwang 1983 they observed that due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous structure the confined zone behaves like a trapped zone when distance between the porous plate and the rigid wall is equal to a quarter of wave length plus an integer multiple of half of the incident wave length consequently using the concept of chwang and li 1983 various wave trapping models have been developed and proposed as breakwaters to create tranquility zone near port and harbour see wang and ren 1994 sahoo et al 2000 yip et al 2002 kaligatla et al 2015 and the references therein further behera et al 2013 developed an analytical method for oblique wave trapping by flexible and porous barrier near a rigid wall in two layer fluid they found that for certain critical angle of incidence full reflection occurs both in surface and internal modes and for the same critical angle wave forces on the flexible barrier and rigid wall vanish irrespective of barrier configuration and porous effect parameter using matched eigenfunction expansion method behera and sahoo 2014 studied wave interaction with porous structure of different configurations in two layer fluid koley et al 2014 studied oblique wave trapping by bottom standing and surface piercing porous structures near a vertical rigid wall using multi domain boundary element method bem in finite water depth behera et al 2015 incorporated a two layer fluid in this problem and utilized eigenfunction expansion method and bem to solve the system recently koley and sahoo 2017 developed a solution using bem for wave motion through the configuration of a semi circular breakwater on a porous seabed placed near a porous sloping seawall they analyzed the effectiveness of varying structural parameters of breakwaters for optimal energy dissipation and evaluated values of frictional coefficients and porosities for which 70 90 dissipation of wave energy is achieved further zhao et al 2017 studied oblique wave motion over multiple submerged porous bars near a vertical rigid wall they observed that when the sum of widths for all porous bars is fixed increasing the bar number could significantly enhance the sheltering function of the bars in the aforementioned works wave interaction with a porous trapezoidal breakwater has been modelled analytically and or numerically for various configurations however to the best of authors knowledge an extensive numerical study on the wave attenuation properties of dual trapezoidal breakwaters in case of oblique waves has neither been performed for wave scattering nor for wave trapping in this study both the wave scattering and the wave trapping by double submerged trapezoidal porous structures are investigated using multi domain boundary element method bem this method is advantageous as the solution of wave structure interaction problem is independent of the roots of complex dispersion relation inside the porous regions apart from an extensive parametric analysis and unlike previous studies the bem developed here also illustrates the effects on wave reflection and transmission due to changes in lateral angles of trapezoidal structure the mathematical formulation for oblique wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous of different structural parameters is elaborated in section 2 while the solution procedure of bem for oblique wave trapping by double trapezoidal porous structure near a porous wall backed by a rigid wall is given in section 3 in sections 2 2 and 3 1 the effects of wave and structural parameters are discussed separately for wave scattering and trapping respectively which is accomplished by computation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients and wave force on the rigid wall additionally the multi domain boundary element method is verified in each discussion by comparing the results with those available in related studies for wave scattering and trapping in case of wave scattering as a special case the results for a single structure are also obtained and compared with the results in case of double structures on the other hand in case of wave trapping the results for four different cases are studied namely i absence of all structures ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall iii presence of a single structure and the porous seawall and iv presence of double structures and the porous seawall in addition the effect of triangular shaped structures on wave scattering and trapping is studied as a special case finally through the obtained results the important conclusions for wave scattering and trapping are highlighted separately in sections 4 1 and 4 2 respectively 2 oblique wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures in this section a detailed formulation of wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures is described for different structural parameters the physical problem is modelled for an incompressible inviscid and irrotational fluid in a 3 d cartesian coordinate system under the small amplitude water wave theory the x y axes represent planes parallel to the free surface while the positive z axis is directed upwards with origin of the co ordinate system at free surface as shown in fig 1 relative to the incident wavelength the structures are assumed to be of infinite length in y direction since the physical problem is handled using multi domain boundary element method it needs two auxiliary boundaries at x l 0 and x r consequently the total flow field is divided into outer region o 1 x l 0 o 2 r x and inner region l 0 x r in the water of depth h the inner region is further subdivided into three regions named as regions a b and c for water first and second trapezoidal structures respectively as in fig 1 the two trapezoidal structures have top widths b i base widths l i heights a i porosities ε i inertial coefficients s i and frictional coefficients f i where i 1 2 represent the first and second structures respectively furthermore l is the spacing between two structures and the lateral sides of the structures make angles θ j 1 and θ j 2 with the horizontal where j 1 2 for seaward and leeward side of each structure on assuming that the incident wave is propagating at an angle θ with the x axis and the fluid flow is simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω the velocity potentials in each region are of the form φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i k y y ω t where k y k 0 sin θ and k 0 is the progressive wavenumber in the open water region o 1

solution using boundary element method in this section a numerical solution based on the boundary element method as in au and brebbia 1982 is developed for the wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures the eigenfunction expansion method is used to derive the velocity potentials in the outer region section 2 1 1 while the boundary value problem in the inner region is converted into a system of integral equations using green s integral theorem section 2 1 2 finally by matching the velocity and pressure on the interface boundaries between the inner and outer regions the system of integral equations is numerically handled for the solution section 2 1 3 2 1 1 velocity potentials in the outer region using eigenfunction expansion in the outer regions o 1 and o 2 the spatial velocity potentials ϕ o 1 ϕ o 2 satisfy eq 1 along with eqs 2 5 and are deduced for n modes of the dispersion relation 12 as 9 ϕ o 1 a 0 e i q 0 x l 0 i 0 k 0 z n 0 r n e i q n x l 0 i n k n z at γ l 10 ϕ o 2 n 0 t n e i q n x r i n k n z at γ r where the eigenfunctions i n k n z are given by 11 i n k n z i g ω cosh k n z h cosh k n h and r n t n are unknowns to be determined and the eigenvalues k

substituting for r n from eq 13 in eq 15 and truncating the infinite series after n terms it is derived that 16 ϕ o 1 n x l 0 q ϕ z 2 i q 0 a 0 i 0 where q ϕ z is given by 17 q ϕ z n 0 n i q n e n h 0 ϕ s i n k n s d s i n k n z the integral h 0 ϕ s i n k n s d s is evaluated using the same boundary element discretization as in the evaluation of green s function and its normal derivative on the auxiliary boundary ϕ and ψ are assumed as constant over each boundary element in the present study thus the integral is evaluated exactly which in turn gives the matrix factorization of q 2 1 2 velocity potentials in the inner region using boundary integral equation the velocity potential in the inner region can be obtained by applying green s theorem on eq 1 with a green function g the resulting integral equation for boundary γ is given by 18 ϕ x z 1 2 ϕ x z γ ϕ g n g ϕ n d γ if x z interior of γ if x z γ where the green function g is the fundamental solution satisfying 19 2 g k y 2

eqs 23 25 are solved on the entire boundary of regions a b and c which is discretized into a finite number of segments fig 2 and the values of ϕ and ϕ n are assumed to be constant over each segment wang and meylan 2002 thus the integral equations 23 25 are described in the following discrete form 26 h i j k g i j ϕ a j γ f h i j ϕ a j γ l h i j ϕ a j γ l 0 h i j ϕ a j γ a b h i j ϕ a j γ l h i j

to derive a matrix equation for the calculation of unknown coefficients that yields the solution for the outer region liu and abbaspour 1982 2 2 results and discussion the influence of wave and structural parameters on waves past double trapezoidal porous structures is evaluated numerically using matlab for the purpose of standardization structural parameters that are common in all the results are given fixed moderate values each of which is changed for the corresponding effect on wave interaction under discussion while the other values are kept the same those values are kept as inertial coefficients s i 1 linearized frictional coefficients f i 0 5 porosities of the structures ε i 0 437 with i 1 2 3 incident angle θ 30 water depth h 5 m structural spacing l h 5 lateral angles θ j 1 θ j 2 60 j 1 2 and time period t 8 s the changes in lateral angles θ j 1 and θ j 2 j 1 2 affect the base widths l 1 and l 2 for fixed b 1 and b 2 of each trapezoidal structure according to the formula 35 l i b i a i tan θ 1 i a i tan θ 2 i i 1 2 the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are symbolized by k r k t and k d respectively and computed using the formulae 36 k r r 0 a 0 k t t 0 a 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 100 2 2 1 validation with previous results for wave scattering the results evaluated for k r and k t in the present theory using multi domain boundary element method bem are compared with the established results observed on experimentation along with those derived by eigenfunction expansion method efem and volume of fluid vof numerical scheme as developed in jeon and cho 2006 where they studied bragg reflection by array of trapezoidal submerged breakwaters for rigid and porous cases the results evaluated in the current work are in good agreement with the results of jeon and cho 2006 for both rigid fig 3 a and porous fig 3 b double trapezoidal structure cases however on using bem in the present work same discrepancies exist for k 0 h 1 8 between vof experimental and bem as in jeon and cho 2006 for vof experimental and efem this is due to the fact the vof method considers a non linear model while bem and efem are based on linear water wave theory thus it is deduced that the model is fairly accurate in the long wave region along with for shortwaves having wave periods t 1 3744 s i e k 0 h 1 8 furthermore the results using analytical method in losada et al 1996 are also compared with bem for a single structure case in fig 4 losada et al 1996 developed solutions for wave scattering by bottom standing porous structures under the influence of oblique waves in the present context when the lateral angles of the porous structures are 90 and the height of second structure a 2 h 0 then the problem becomes one depicted in losada et al 1996 and thus can be solved using the same analytic solution the comparison between solutions in the present theory and losada et al 1996 is given in fig 4 a that depicts variation in reflection and transmission coefficients against incoming wave angle for a single structure with the structural parameters kept as a 1 h 0 5 f 1 0 5 ε 1 0 4 and b 1 h 1 it is seen that the two solutions are in excellent agreement with k r nearly zero at incident angle θ 50 called the critical angle moreover fig 4 a illustrates the effect of two rectangular structures on wave reflection and transmission so that addition of another rectangular structure increases the wave reflection and decreases wave transmission for θ less than the critical angle this is evident from fig 4 b which plots the changes in dissipation coefficient against incoming wave angle for single and double structures an increase of nearly 10 in dissipation of wave energy is seen irrespective of incoming angle of incidence for the wave finally the troughs in reflection coefficient may arise due to geometrical construction the double submerged structure system combined with energy dissipation inside the porous structures and on account of constructive and destructive interference of oblique waves on seaside region and between the two structures 2 2 2 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against incident wave angle the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients fig 5 a and dissipation coefficient fig 5 b are plotted against the incident wave angle θ for change in structural height a 1 h from fig 5 a it is found that an increase in structural height a 1 h results in higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission in addition the position of zero minima of k r shifts slightly to the right however the reflection coefficient has a minima where k r diminishes to almost zero near θ 48 for a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 which shifts to the right as structural height is increased the dissipation of wave energy also increases on increasing structural height fig 5 b however the dissipation coefficient generally reaches a maxima as θ increases whereafter it decreases to zero as θ 90 fig 6 a and b plot the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients against the wave incident angle θ for changes in the frictional coefficient f 1 and the spacing between two structures l h respectively fig 6 a shows that the reflection and transmission coefficients follow similar patterns as in fig 5 a and an increase in the frictional coefficient f 1 generally lowers wave transmission however wave reflection is higher only for incident angles less than the critical angle and for higher incident angles this behavior is not observed in addition the position of minima of k r remains unchanged while in fig 6 b the transmission coefficient k t remains independent of the change in values of structural spacing l h for θ 60 beyond which it decreases for all values of l h however on increasing l h an increase in the oscillatory behavior of reflection and transmission coefficients is observed along with an increase in the number of minima for k r 2 2 3 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against non dimensional wavenumber the advantage of using double porous structures instead of a single structure for wave scattering is evident from panels in fig 7 fig 7 a measures the change in reflection and transmission coefficients against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h in the presence of a single and double trapezoidal porous structures it is clear that the addition of another structure to fluid domain decreases the wave transmission and increases the oscillatory behavior in wave reflection in particular unlike in k r for a single structure a distinct wave resonance is observed in k r for the case of double structures near k 0 h 0 4 this is further elucidated in fig 7 b which plots the change in dissipation of incoming wave energy against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for the cases of single and double structures for the given parameters an increase of nearly 30 is observed in the dissipation coefficient when a second trapezoidal structure is placed in the fluid domain fig 8 a depicts the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients and fig 8 b shows the changes in dissipation coefficient both against the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different structural heights in fig 8 a a clear bragg resonance is found in k r near k 0 h 0 4 for all structural heights in general the wave reflection is more and wave transmission is less as the height of the porous structures is increased additionally a left shift is observed in the optima of k r and in case of long waves wave reflection develops while it reduces for short waves it is also seen that nearly zero reflection occurs for different values of wavenumber which may be due to the destructive interference between incident and reflected waves further a substantial increase in the attenuation of wave energy is observed as the height of the structures is increased as shown in fig 8 b this is due to increase in dissipation by friction on account of increase in size of the structures it is found that in the presence of double trapezoidal structures almost 90 of wave energy can be dissipated for certain values of wave and structural parameters and in this case the lee side region of the structures will be a tranquility zone in figs 9 and 10 the corresponding panels depict the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients versus wavenumber k 0 h for changes in frictional coefficient f 1 porosity ε 1 and structural widths b 1 h and the incident angle θ in all cases the reflection and transmission follow the same pattern as in 8 a with bragg resonance developing near k 0 h 0 4 in fig 9 a an increase in frictional coefficient f 1 results in higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission respectively and the optima of k r shift towards left if f 1 is increased fig 9 b shows a similar behavior in wave transmission for an increase in structural width b 1 h on the contrary in fig 10 an increase in porosity ε 1 or in incident angle of the wave θ decreases both wave reflection and wave transmission while the optima of k r show a right shift as ε 1 or θ is increased additionally in fig 10 a bragg resonance in k r is maximum for the case of both structures being rigid i e f 1 ε 1 0 with maxima of k r higher throughout however in this case the amount of waves transmitted towards the leeward side is generally more than when the structures are porous as none of the energy is dissipated via friction thereby signifying the benefit of using porous structures in fig 11 a and b the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients and dissipation coefficient against wavenumber k 0 h are plotted for the change in spacing between the two porous structures l h although the oscillatory behavior of wave reflection increases with increase in the spacing l h but the wave transmission is nearly independent of any changes in l h fig 11 a consequently the dissipation of wave energy also remains independent of changes in l h as shown in fig 11 b 2 2 4 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against non dimensional structural width in fig 12 a the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against structural top width k 0 b for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 for a fixed top width b 1 smaller lateral angles θ 1 1 θ 2 1 imply a longer base width l 1 hence it is seen that with a relative decrease in structural base width due to increase in lateral angles of the structure the amplitude of oscillations in the reflection coefficient decreases additionally the wave transmission decreases with increase in structural top width this is due to fact that a major part of the incoming wave energy is dissipated as the structural width increases fig 12 a and b show that with an increase in frictional coefficient the reflection and dissipation coefficients also increase generally however the transmission coefficient decreases a left shift is also observed in optima of k r as frictional coefficient is increased which corresponds to the increase in dissipation of wave energy it may be noted that for zero top width of the structures the trapezoidal structures become triangular structures which causes the reflection to be non zero at k 0 b 0 additionally fig 12 a shows that the wave transmission is minimized as the width of structures increases hence it can be observed in fig 12 b that dissipation of the wave energy increases as frictional coefficient for the structures is increased moreover fig 12 c shows similar variation of k r and k t against structural top width for different values of the angles between lateral sides and horizontal bottom for the structures the periodic pattern in k r increases as the lateral sides become vertical however the difference between adjacent maxima and minima decreases the transmission is lesser for more slanting lateral sides of the structures correspondingly fig 12 d shows that the dissipation of wave energy increases if the lateral sides of the trapezoidal structures are more slanting for a fixed top width in fig 13 a and b the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients against normalized spacing between the dual trapezoidal structures l λ 0 are plotted for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 and structural height a 1 h respectively where λ 0 is wavelength of the incident wave with λ 0 2 π k 0 further in both fig 13 a and b as the frictional coefficient f 1 and structural height a 1 h are increased and the wave reflection increases and the wave transmission decreases similarly for both panels the reflection and transmission coefficients show a periodic pattern with the optima of k r showing a left shift as the value of frictional coefficient or that of structural height is increased however for periodic values of the spacing between structures the wave reflection is minimized irrespective of the frictional coefficients and structural heights 3 wave trapping by double trapezoidal porous structures near a sloping porous wall backed by a rigid wall in case of wave trapping contrary to the scattering of incoming waves the transmitted wave is confined in the region between submerged structures and the sloping porous seawall the sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall is situated at a distance l 3 from second trapezoidal structure on the seabed and labeled as region d the sloping seawall is characterized by structural parameters namely porosity ε 3 inertial coefficient s 3 frictional coefficient f 3 and the front of the seawall makes an angle θ 3 with the horizontal seabed as in fig 14 consequently the physical domain for the present problem is restricted to x r along the x axis where x r is the location of rigid wall the configurations of submerged trapezoidal breakwaters are same as before however three different cases are studied separately i e wave trapping in presence of i only sloping porous seawall ii sloping porous seawall along with one trapezoidal structure and iii sloping porous seawall along with two trapezoidal structures the mathematical formulation for the present problem remains the same as for wave scattering except the radiation condition 5 for x and the matching conditions over γ r are replaced by the boundary conditions for boundaries of the trapezoidal sloping porous seawall in particular seabed under the seawall is also rigid and impermeable in nature as given by 37 ϕ j n 0 on boundaries z h and x r for j d on the sloping front face γ r of the seawall at the fluid structure interface the continuity of pressure and mass flux gives 38 ϕ a s 3 i f 3 ϕ d ϕ a n ε 3 ϕ d n additionally in the presence of a porous seawall the free surface γ f of the existing domain extends in the x direction and is split into two parts as in fig 14 γ f 1 the free surface for the extended region a and γ f 2 the free surface inside the region d i e γ f γ f 1 γ f 2 the boundary condition on γ f 1 remains the same as in eq 3 while the boundary condition on γ f 2 is modified as follows 39 ϕ d z k s 3 i f 3 ϕ d 0 on z 0 the equations for wave trapping are developed in a similar way as described in section 2 1 for wave scattering the integral equations for the regions b and c remain the same as earlier whereas using the boundary conditions 38 and 39 the integral equations for the region a eq 23 are modified as 40 c ϕ a γ f 1 ϕ a g n k g d γ γ l ϕ a g n g ϕ a n d γ γ l 0 γ l γ l 3 ϕ a g n d γ γ a b ϕ b g n g ϕ b n d γ γ a c ϕ c g n g ϕ c n d γ γ r s 3 i f 3 ϕ d g n ε 3 g ϕ d n d γ 0 further using the boundary conditions 38 39 the integral equation for the region d will be of the form 41 c ϕ d γ r ϕ d g n g ϕ d n d γ γ l 4 γ s ϕ d g n d γ γ f 2 ϕ d g n k g s 3 i f 3 ϕ d d γ 0 finally using the same procedure as discussed in section 2 1 the boundary element grid is modified as shown in fig 15 and the integral equations 24 25 40 and 41 are solved together to evaluate the unknowns therein 3 1 results and discussion the wave and structural parameters for wave trapping are same as in section 2 2 the additional seawall parameters are standardized as well unless changed for the corresponding discussion with the distance from base of the second structure l 3 h 1 seawall top width b 3 h 0 5 and sloping angle of the seawall θ 3 45 the base width of the seawall l 4 is calculated using 42 l 4 b 3 h tan θ 3 additionally the non dimensional horizontal wave force k f acting on the rigid seawall is obtained using the formula 43 k f ω g h 2 γ s ϕ d n x d γ 3 1 1 validation with previous results for wave trapping the results for wave trapping evaluated in the present theory are compared with results in koley et al 2014 wherein they also used multi domain boundary element method for examining oblique wave trapping by porous structures in various configurations in the current scenario when the porous seawall has zero top and bottom widths along with similar conditions as in fig 4 a then the present problem is reduced to wave trapping by a bottom standing rectangular porous structure as discussed in koley et al 2014 this comparison is depicted in fig 16 a showing variation of reflection coefficient against structural width for the parameters a 1 h 0 5 f 1 0 5 θ 10 and l λ 1 where λ 2 π k 0 again results from the present theory are in good agreement with the results of previous work by koley et al 2014 furthermore fig 16 a plots the reflection coefficient against non dimensional structural width illustrating the effect of two structures on wave trapping an addition of another structure to a single structure wave trapping scenario decreases the wave reflection irrespective of structural widths this is due to increase in dissipation of wave energy as evident from fig 16 b which plots changes in the dissipation coefficient against non dimensional structural width for single and double structures 3 1 2 effect of structural parameters on wave trapping against non dimensional structural width the efficiency of using a combination of double trapezoidal porous structures in conjunction with a sloping porous seawall is demonstrated in fig 17 the dependence of reflection coefficient k r on non dimensional structural width k 0 b for wave interaction with single double trapezoidal structures in presence of sloping porous seawall is plotted when the structures are rigid and porous as shown in fig 17 a and b respectively as expected the wave reflection is more in case of rigid structures as compared to that in porous structures and wave reflection is reduced in case of double structures for both porous and rigid structure scenarios in particular for rigid structures as shown in fig 17 a the oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection is regular in nature yet for the case of double porous structures the wave reflection is significantly lower which implies that the wave energy dissipation is considerably greater than when only one structure is present however in fig 17 b the reflection coefficient decreases generally with an oscillatory pattern as the structural top width increases this is due to the fact that more wave energy is dissipated by the structures as the structural width increases in fig 18 a and b the reflection coefficients k r against non dimensional structural width k 0 b are plotted for different values of structural height a 1 h and frictional coefficient f 1 respectively it is observed that while showing an oscillatory behavior reflection coefficient generally decreases as structural top width increases irrespective of values of structural heights or frictional coefficients additionally as structural width increases in both panels the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection diminishes and k r becomes uniform for higher values of structural height or frictional coefficient in fig 19 a and b the variation of reflection coefficients against normalized spacing between two trapezoidal structures l h is plotted for different values of spacing between the second trapezoidal structures and base of the sloping porous seawall l 3 λ and the angle of sloping porous seawall θ 3 respectively from fig 19 a it is seen that as the structural spacing increases the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern in the wave reflection diminishes and k r is almost constant for larger values of l λ the reflection coefficients show an resonating pattern with minimum reflection near l λ 0 2 and the minima of k r showing a right shift as structural height is increased fig 19 b depicts that the wave reflection decreases as θ 3 is increased additionally the minima of k r at l λ 0 2 shifts to the right as θ 3 is increased 3 1 3 effect of structural parameters on wave trapping against non dimensional wavenumber fig 20 a depicts the variation of reflection coefficient for various structural configurations against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h showing that the oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection and dissipation is more in the presence of double structures as compared to that in a single structure however there is no oscillation in the absence of trapezoidal structures additionally the reflection is observed to decrease from full reflection to a constant value when the wavenumber goes from shallow water to deep water regime in general the wave reflection is reduced as the number of structures is increased correspondingly in fig 20 b it is observed that addition of structures to the fluid domain decreases the wave force acting on the rigid wall with least force acting on the rigid wall in presence of double trapezoidal structures along with the porous seawall clearly among the geometric configurations tested dual structures in presence of a sloping seawall are the most efficient in dissipating wave energy the effect of different structural heights for the two trapezoidal structures is depicted in fig 21 where the second porous structure which is closer to the sloping seawall is incrementally increased in height in fig 21 a an increase in the structural height a 2 h shows a decrease in the reflection coefficient for both long and short wave regimes further the reflection is minimized near k 0 h 1 5 independent of any changes in the structural height of second structure fig 21 b plots the wave force acting on the rigid wall against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h as the height of the second structure a 2 h is increased while keeping that of the first structure a 1 h constant the wave force on the wall is decreased for all wavenumbers thus placing the relatively larger structure among the two trapezoidal structures near the seawall can be more efficient in attenuation of incoming wave energy fig 22 a and b plot the wave reflection and wave force on the rigid wall respectively against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for increasing values of the porosity for both structures it is seen that both the reflection coefficient and wave force follow the similar patterns as discussed in fig 21 and when the porosity is increased the wave force and wave reflection generally decrease for all wavelengths additionally the oscillatory pattern of the wave force and reflection coefficient also decreases this is due to increase in dissipation of wave energy owing to friction in the structure for high porosities subsequently for analyzing the role of friction fig 23 a and b depict the variation of wave reflection and horizontal wave force on the rigid wall respectively against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 for the dual structures f 2 f 1 fig 23 a plots the change in reflection coefficient against k 0 h showing that for long waves an increase in the frictional coefficient of the structures decreases the reflection of waves in particular the wave reflection diminishes to zero for f 1 f 2 1 5 due to destructive interference between the waves thereby giving maximum dissipation of wave energy for the presence of double trapezoidal structures with a sloping porous seawall additionally fig 23 b shows the effect of increasing frictional coefficient of the structures on wave force k f in this configuration the wave force on the rigid wall is observed to decrease generally on increasing the frictional coefficient of the structures 4 conclusion in the present study interaction of water waves by double trapezoidal porous structures in varying configurations is investigated for different structural parameters along with the scattering of surface waves by double trapezoidal structures the study also includes the trapping of surface waves by double trapezoidal porous structures placed at a finite distance from a sloping porous seawall that is backed by a rigid wall the performance of the single and or double structures is evaluated by examining the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients the hydrodynamic wave force on the rigid wall is also analyzed for all cases in the wave trapping scenario additionally the effect of triangular shaped structures on wave scattering and trapping is studied by assuming top width of the structures to be zero from the present study following conclusions are made which are given separately for wave scattering and trapping 4 1 wave scattering in this case the results for wave interaction with a single structure are obtained and compared with the results for double structures it is found that almost 90 of wave energy can be dissipated by double structures this is much higher than dissipation in the presence of a single structure as expected a substantial amount of increase in wave attenuation is observed as the height of two structures is increased with a clear bragg resonance visible in wave reflection near k 0 h 0 4 for all types of structural parameters an increase in frictional coefficients f i and structural widths b i i 1 2 results in lower transmission and increased dissipation of wave energy figs 9 a and 12 a and 12 b furthermore dissipation is also increased with an increase in porosities ε i and incident angle θ i which results in lower reflection and higher transmission fig 10 a and b wave reflection also diminishes at a critical incident angle θ 48 for a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 which shifts to the right as structural height is increased fig 5 a however the dissipation of wave energy remains independent of changes in spacing between structure although for specific values of the spacing between structures the wave reflection can be minimized to nearly zero fig 11 a further when both the structures are rigid fig 10 a for f i ε i 0 the wave transmission is more as compared to that in porous cases and a decrease in porosities of the structures results in an increase and a right shift of the bragg resonance in the reflection coefficient 4 2 wave trapping in this case the results for four different cases are investigated namely i absence of trapezoidal structures and porous seawall ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall iii presence of a single structure and the porous seawall and iv presence of double structures and the porous seawall the results reveal that the wave reflection and force on the rigid wall is significantly less in the presence of double structures as compared to that for other cases see fig 20 a and b and double trapezoidal structures in presence of the porous seawall is the most efficient configuration in reducing wave force on the rigid wall the wave reflection is observed to generally decrease for long waves and stabilize for short waves as the number of structures is increased in the presence of double trapezoidal structures along with the porous seawall the wave reflection can be found nearly zero near k 0 h 1 5 irrespective of changes in structural heights porosities or the frictional coefficients of the structures figs 21 a and 22 a and 23 a moreover the wave force on the rigid wall decreases generally on increasing the structural heights porosities or the frictional coefficients of the structures it is also observed that wave reflection increases as the sloping angle of the seawall increases fig 19 b when both the trapezoidal structures are rigid for an increase in structural width the optimum of wave reflections are periodic in nature however in case of porous structures the wave reflection and oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection decreases with increase in structural width fig 18 a it may be noted that when the top widths of the structures are zero i e k 0 b 0 the trapezoidal structures become triangular shaped structures further the wave reflection becomes uniform as the structural width increases and in particular nearly constant reflection is found for k 0 b 4 and a 1 h a 2 h 0 8 finally in case of trapezoidal structures with different heights its more efficient to place the relatively larger structure among the two trapezoidal structures near the seawall fig 21 a the conclusions in this work provide an extensive set of data points for using different configurations of dual trapezoidal porous structures as effective breakwaters this data can be adapted based on geographical and environmental conditions near and off shore for engineering design of holistic coastal protection systems

22732,this work investigates wave energy attenuation by double trapezoidal porous structures of different structural parameters using a multi domain boundary element method under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory two different cases are considered a wave scattering by dual trapezoidal porous structures and b wave trapping by dual trapezoidal structures near a sloping porous wall backed by a rigid wall the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients along with the wave force exerted on the rigid wall are evaluated and analyzed to illustrate the effects of different structural configurations on wave flow as a special case wave scattering by a single structure is investigated and compared with the results for double trapezoidal structures it is found that almost 90 of wave energy is dissipated by double structures which is much higher than the energy attenuation in the presence of a single structure for wave trapping the results for four different cases are studied i absence of any porous structures ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall iii presence of a single structure with the seawall and iv presence of double structures with the seawall wave reflection and force on the rigid wall are found to be significantly minimized by double structures as compared to that for the other cases finally the findings of this study can give crucial information to the coastal engineers for designing varied combinations of trapezoidal porous structures as effective breakwaters keywords oblique waves wave scattering and trapping submerged porous structures multi domain boundary element method wave energy dissipation 1 introduction submerged porous structures are set up as breakwaters to create a tranquility zone near the coastline that protects the marine facilities by minimizing the incoming wave action these structures have become increasingly common owing to their efficiency durability minimal visual impact and mobility of water transport over the breakwater in recent decades various numerical analytical and experimental models have been developed for wave interaction with single multiple non porous porous structures in various configurations that are proposed as breakwaters even though a single trapezoidal structure is a thoroughly examined breakwater system in literature recent advances have elucidated the advantages of implementing dual structures for effective reduction of wave height on lee side of the system see jeon and cho 2006 chang and liou 2007 cao et al 2012 liu et al 2016 cox and clark 1992 described the physical model and design of an innovative dual trapezoidal breakwater configuration which combines a conventional rubble mound breakwater and a submerged smaller structure operating in tandem and first set up at the southern end of lake michigan usa it was found to cost 1 million less than a corresponding single breakwater design for same conditions as the main structure is designed to be cost effective while the outer structure reduces the incoming wave height recently thesnaar 2015 identified a site in mossel bay south africa suitable for implementation of dual trapezoidal breakwaters however designing of these structures requires further numerical and experimental investigation into the interactions of such configuration with incoming wave action thereby motivating the present work the classical mathematical model describing wave interaction with a submerged structure was given by sollitt and cross 1972 with structural porosity included in the model since then many authors have utilized and modified the sollitt cross model for various applications sulisz 1985 created a hybrid model of infinite rubble mound breakwater using boundary element method bem for numerical evaluation and verified that the experimental and theoretical results are in reasonable agreement dalrymple et al 1991 used sollitt and cross model to study oblique waves over a porous breakwater with vertical faces and deduced that a plane wave approximation on neglecting evanescent modes near the structure provides adequate solutions for wave scattering when damping within the structure is small losada et al 1996 used eigenfunction expansion and mild slope equation for 3 d models in order to analyze the wave reflection and transmission by submerged porous structures additionally losada et al 1993 examined wave reflection and transmission for wave interactions with varied combinations of porous screens and water gaps and demonstrated the occurrence of bragg resonance recently cheng et al 2014 studied anti motion properties of very large floating structures vlfs edged using perforated plates at various water depths they further expanded to numerically and experimentally examine the hydrodynamic performance of vlfs using dual edged structures and under oblique irregular wave action cheng et al 2016b cheng et al 2016a ji et al 2018 they studied the effects of porosity submerged depth angles of incline and the spacing of plates on hydroelastic properties of vlfs liu and li 2014 further studied wave interaction with a new configuration of pile rock structures using matched eigenfunction expansion method they deduced that in the submerged pile rock breakwater configuration most of wave energy dissipated was due to the rock core while a small part of wave energy was dissipated by the closely spaced piles recently liu et al 2016 examined multiple submerged semi circular breakwaters for bragg resonance in reflection of water waves by applying multi pole expansions to develop linear solutions for the potentials khan and behera 2018 also studied waves past double rectangular porous structures to illustrate bragg resonance a detailed review on wave interaction with porous coastal structures can be found in losada et al 2016 in particular submerged trapezoidal breakwaters are especially preferred in the regions of shallow water because these structures are effective in dissipating long wave energy the model for utilization of trapezoidal breakwaters for wave energy attenuation was explicitly developed by madsen and white 1977 wherein multi layered trapezoidal breakwaters were approximated with equivalent rectangular breakwaters using the mild slope equation method rojanakamthorn et al 1991 studied the wave propagation over a submerged permeable trapezoidal breakwater mounted on a sloping bottom and validated the model by comparison with the experimental results for a trapezoidal breakwater along with the solution for a rectangular breakwater using the matching method chang and liou 2007 developed an analytical solution for long wave reflection and transmission from submerged trapezoidal breakwaters and found that the top width and arrangement of the breakwater array are two major parameters in designing multiple composite bragg breakwaters cao et al 2012 experimentally analyzed energy dissipation properties of dual trapezoidal submerged breakwaters on a flat bed xie and liu 2013 performed an analytical study of trapezoidal breakwater in a channel using modified mild slope equation along with a taylor series expansion the solution given was valid for the whole wave range and thus superior to long wave analytical solutions the new solution was found as superior to the eigenfunction expansion method without an approximation to the linear sloped transitions recently scattering of oblique waves by a submerged composite trapezoidal breakwater and trapping of waves when the breakwater is placed at a finite distance from a vertical rigid wall was investigated by koley et al 2015 apart from wave scattering there is a significant interest in wave trapping by porous structures near a rigid wall in a single two layer fluid in these studies the main objective is to find the optimum distance between the structure and rigid wall for moderate values of wave structural parameters to create a tranquility zone near lee side of the structures wave trapping by fully extended porous structure near the end of a semi infinitely long channel was studied by chwang and li 1983 by using the linearized porous wavemaker theory developed by chwang 1983 they observed that due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous structure the confined zone behaves like a trapped zone when distance between the porous plate and the rigid wall is equal to a quarter of wave length plus an integer multiple of half of the incident wave length consequently using the concept of chwang and li 1983 various wave trapping models have been developed and proposed as breakwaters to create tranquility zone near port and harbour see wang and ren 1994 sahoo et al 2000 yip et al 2002 kaligatla et al 2015 and the references therein further behera et al 2013 developed an analytical method for oblique wave trapping by flexible and porous barrier near a rigid wall in two layer fluid they found that for certain critical angle of incidence full reflection occurs both in surface and internal modes and for the same critical angle wave forces on the flexible barrier and rigid wall vanish irrespective of barrier configuration and porous effect parameter using matched eigenfunction expansion method behera and sahoo 2014 studied wave interaction with porous structure of different configurations in two layer fluid koley et al 2014 studied oblique wave trapping by bottom standing and surface piercing porous structures near a vertical rigid wall using multi domain boundary element method bem in finite water depth behera et al 2015 incorporated a two layer fluid in this problem and utilized eigenfunction expansion method and bem to solve the system recently koley and sahoo 2017 developed a solution using bem for wave motion through the configuration of a semi circular breakwater on a porous seabed placed near a porous sloping seawall they analyzed the effectiveness of varying structural parameters of breakwaters for optimal energy dissipation and evaluated values of frictional coefficients and porosities for which 70 90 dissipation of wave energy is achieved further zhao et al 2017 studied oblique wave motion over multiple submerged porous bars near a vertical rigid wall they observed that when the sum of widths for all porous bars is fixed increasing the bar number could significantly enhance the sheltering function of the bars in the aforementioned works wave interaction with a porous trapezoidal breakwater has been modelled analytically and or numerically for various configurations however to the best of authors knowledge an extensive numerical study on the wave attenuation properties of dual trapezoidal breakwaters in case of oblique waves has neither been performed for wave scattering nor for wave trapping in this study both the wave scattering and the wave trapping by double submerged trapezoidal porous structures are investigated using multi domain boundary element method bem this method is advantageous as the solution of wave structure interaction problem is independent of the roots of complex dispersion relation inside the porous regions apart from an extensive parametric analysis and unlike previous studies the bem developed here also illustrates the effects on wave reflection and transmission due to changes in lateral angles of trapezoidal structure the mathematical formulation for oblique wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous of different structural parameters is elaborated in section 2 while the solution procedure of bem for oblique wave trapping by double trapezoidal porous structure near a porous wall backed by a rigid wall is given in section 3 in sections 2 2 and 3 1 the effects of wave and structural parameters are discussed separately for wave scattering and trapping respectively which is accomplished by computation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients and wave force on the rigid wall additionally the multi domain boundary element method is verified in each discussion by comparing the results with those available in related studies for wave scattering and trapping in case of wave scattering as a special case the results for a single structure are also obtained and compared with the results in case of double structures on the other hand in case of wave trapping the results for four different cases are studied namely i absence of all structures ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall iii presence of a single structure and the porous seawall and iv presence of double structures and the porous seawall in addition the effect of triangular shaped structures on wave scattering and trapping is studied as a special case finally through the obtained results the important conclusions for wave scattering and trapping are highlighted separately in sections 4 1 and 4 2 respectively 2 oblique wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures in this section a detailed formulation of wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures is described for different structural parameters the physical problem is modelled for an incompressible inviscid and irrotational fluid in a 3 d cartesian coordinate system under the small amplitude water wave theory the x y axes represent planes parallel to the free surface while the positive z axis is directed upwards with origin of the co ordinate system at free surface as shown in fig 1 relative to the incident wavelength the structures are assumed to be of infinite length in y direction since the physical problem is handled using multi domain boundary element method it needs two auxiliary boundaries at x l 0 and x r consequently the total flow field is divided into outer region o 1 x l 0 o 2 r x and inner region l 0 x r in the water of depth h the inner region is further subdivided into three regions named as regions a b and c for water first and second trapezoidal structures respectively as in fig 1 the two trapezoidal structures have top widths b i base widths l i heights a i porosities ε i inertial coefficients s i and frictional coefficients f i where i 1 2 represent the first and second structures respectively furthermore l is the spacing between two structures and the lateral sides of the structures make angles θ j 1 and θ j 2 with the horizontal where j 1 2 for seaward and leeward side of each structure on assuming that the incident wave is propagating at an angle θ with the x axis and the fluid flow is simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω the velocity potentials in each region are of the form φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i k y y ω t where k y k 0 sin θ and k 0 is the progressive wavenumber in the open water region o 1 the formulation is reduced to a boundary value problem for the spatial velocity potentials ϕ j x z for j a b c o 1 o 2 that satisfy the helmholtz equation 1 2 x 2 2 z 2 k y ϕ j 0 along with the bottom

solution using boundary element method in this section a numerical solution based on the boundary element method as in au and brebbia 1982 is developed for the wave scattering by double trapezoidal porous structures the eigenfunction expansion method is used to derive the velocity potentials in the outer region section 2 1 1 while the boundary value problem in the inner region is converted into a system of integral equations using green s integral theorem section 2 1 2 finally by matching the velocity and pressure on the interface boundaries between the inner and outer regions the system of integral equations is numerically handled for the solution section 2 1 3 2 1 1 velocity potentials in the outer region using eigenfunction expansion in the outer regions o 1 and o 2 the spatial velocity potentials ϕ o 1 ϕ o 2 satisfy eq 1 along with eqs 2 5 and are deduced for n modes of the dispersion relation 12 as 9 ϕ o 1 a 0 e i q 0 x l 0 i 0 k 0 z n 0 r n e i q n x l 0 i n k n z at γ l 10 ϕ o 2 n 0 t n e i q n x r i n k n z at γ r where the eigenfunctions i n k n z are given by 11 i n k n z i g ω cosh k n z h cosh k n h and r n t n are unknowns to be determined and the eigenvalues k

derived that 13 r n δ n 0 1 e n h 0 ϕ z i n k n z d z 14 t n 1 e n h 0 ψ z i n k n z d z where e n h 0 i n 2 k n z d z g 2 ω 2 k n h sinh k n h cosh k n h 2 k n cosh 2 k n h and δ n 0 is the kronecker

substituting for r n from eq 13 in eq 15 and truncating the infinite series after n terms it is derived that 16 ϕ o 1 n x l 0 q ϕ z 2 i q 0 a 0 i 0 where q ϕ z is given by 17 q ϕ z n 0 n i q n e n h 0 ϕ s i n k n s d s i n k n z the integral h 0 ϕ s i n k n s d s is evaluated using the same boundary element discretization as in the evaluation of green s function and its normal derivative on the auxiliary boundary ϕ and ψ are assumed as constant over each boundary element in the present study thus the integral is evaluated exactly which in turn gives the matrix factorization of q 2 1 2 velocity potentials in the inner region using boundary integral equation the velocity potential in the inner region can be obtained by applying green s theorem on eq 1 with a green function g the resulting integral equation for boundary γ is given by 18 ϕ x z 1 2 ϕ x z γ ϕ g n g ϕ n d γ if x z interior of γ if x z γ where the green function g is the fundamental solution satisfying 19 2 g k y 2

eqs 23 25 are solved on the entire boundary of regions a b and c which is discretized into a finite number of segments fig 2 and the values of ϕ and ϕ n are assumed to be constant over each segment wang and meylan 2002 thus the integral equations 23 25 are described in the following discrete form 26 h i j k g i j ϕ a j γ f h i j ϕ a j γ l h i j ϕ a j γ l 0 h i j ϕ a j γ a b h i j ϕ a j γ l h i j

to derive a matrix equation for the calculation of unknown coefficients that yields the solution for the outer region liu and abbaspour 1982 2 2 results and discussion the influence of wave and structural parameters on waves past double trapezoidal porous structures is evaluated numerically using matlab for the purpose of standardization structural parameters that are common in all the results are given fixed moderate values each of which is changed for the corresponding effect on wave interaction under discussion while the other values are kept the same those values are kept as

θ j 1 θ j 2 60 j 1 2 and time period t 8 s the changes in lateral angles θ j 1 and θ j 2 j 1 2 affect the base widths l 1 and l 2 for fixed b 1 and b 2 of each trapezoidal structure according to the

a 0 k t t 0 a 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 100 2 2 1 validation with previous results for wave scattering the results evaluated for k r and k t in the present theory using multi domain boundary element method bem are compared with the established results observed on experimentation along with those derived by eigenfunction expansion method efem and volume of fluid vof numerical scheme as developed in jeon and cho 2006 where they studied bragg reflection by array of trapezoidal submerged breakwaters for rigid and porous cases the results evaluated in the current work are in good agreement with the results of jeon and cho 2006 for both rigid fig 3 a and porous fig 3 b double trapezoidal structure cases however on using bem in the present work same discrepancies exist for k 0 h 1 8 between vof experimental and bem as in jeon and cho 2006 for vof experimental and efem this is due to the fact the vof method considers a non linear model while bem and efem are based on linear water wave theory thus it is deduced that the model is fairly accurate in the long wave region along with for shortwaves having wave periods t 1 3744 s i e k 0 h 1 8 furthermore the results using analytical method in losada et al 1996 are also compared with bem for a single structure case in fig 4 losada et al 1996 developed solutions for wave scattering by bottom standing porous structures under the influence of oblique waves in the present context when the lateral angles of the porous structures are 90 and the height of second structure a 2 h 0 then the problem becomes one depicted in losada et al 1996 and thus can be solved using the same analytic solution the comparison between solutions in the present theory and losada et al 1996 is given in fig 4 a that depicts variation in reflection and transmission coefficients against incoming wave angle for a single structure with the structural parameters kept as a 1 h 0 5 f 1 0 5 ε 1 0 4 and b 1 h 1 it is seen that the two solutions are in excellent agreement with k r nearly zero at incident angle θ 50 called the critical angle moreover fig 4 a illustrates the effect of two rectangular structures on wave reflection and transmission so that addition of another rectangular structure increases the wave reflection and decreases wave transmission for θ less than the critical angle this is evident from fig 4 b which plots the changes in dissipation coefficient against incoming wave angle for single and double structures an increase of nearly 10 in dissipation of wave energy is seen irrespective of incoming angle of incidence for the wave finally the troughs in reflection coefficient may arise due to geometrical construction the double submerged structure system combined with energy dissipation inside the porous structures and on account of constructive and destructive interference of oblique waves on seaside region and between the two structures 2 2 2 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against incident wave angle the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients fig 5 a and dissipation coefficient fig 5 b are plotted against the incident wave angle θ for change in structural height a 1 h from fig 5 a it is found that an increase in structural height a 1 h results in higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission in addition the position of zero minima of k r shifts slightly to the right however the reflection coefficient has a minima where k r diminishes to almost zero near θ 48 for a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 which shifts to the right as structural height is increased the dissipation of wave energy also increases on increasing structural height fig 5 b however the dissipation coefficient generally reaches a maxima as θ increases whereafter it decreases to zero as θ 90 fig 6 a and b plot the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients against the wave incident angle θ for changes in the frictional coefficient f 1 and the spacing between two structures l h respectively fig 6 a shows that the reflection and transmission coefficients follow similar patterns as in fig 5 a and an increase in the frictional coefficient f 1 generally lowers wave transmission however wave reflection is higher only for incident angles less than the critical angle and for higher incident angles this behavior is not observed in addition the position of minima of k r remains unchanged while in fig 6 b the transmission coefficient k t remains independent of the change in values of structural spacing l h for θ 60 beyond which it decreases for all values of l h however on increasing l h an increase in the oscillatory behavior of reflection and transmission coefficients is observed along with an increase in the number of minima for k r 2 2 3 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against non dimensional wavenumber the advantage of using double porous structures instead of a single structure for wave scattering is evident from panels in fig 7 fig 7 a measures the change in reflection and transmission coefficients against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h in the presence of a single and double trapezoidal porous structures it is clear that the addition of another structure to fluid domain decreases the wave transmission and increases the oscillatory behavior in wave reflection in particular unlike in k r for a single structure a distinct wave resonance is observed in k r for the case of double structures near k 0 h 0 4 this is further elucidated in fig 7 b which plots the change in dissipation of incoming wave energy against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for the cases of single and double structures for the given parameters an increase of nearly 30 is observed in the dissipation coefficient when a second trapezoidal structure is placed in the fluid domain fig 8 a depicts the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients and fig 8 b shows the changes in dissipation coefficient both against the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different structural heights in fig 8 a a clear bragg resonance is found in k r near k 0 h 0 4 for all structural heights in general the wave reflection is more and wave transmission is less as the height of the porous structures is increased additionally a left shift is observed in the optima of k r and in case of long waves wave reflection develops while it reduces for short waves it is also seen that nearly zero reflection occurs for different values of wavenumber which may be due to the destructive interference between incident and reflected waves further a substantial increase in the attenuation of wave energy is observed as the height of the structures is increased as shown in fig 8 b this is due to increase in dissipation by friction on account of increase in size of the structures it is found that in the presence of double trapezoidal structures almost 90 of wave energy can be dissipated for certain values of wave and structural parameters and in this case the lee side region of the structures will be a tranquility zone in figs 9 and 10 the corresponding panels depict the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients versus wavenumber k 0 h for changes in frictional coefficient f 1 porosity ε 1 and structural widths b 1 h and the incident angle θ in all cases the reflection and transmission follow the same pattern as in 8 a with bragg resonance developing near k 0 h 0 4 in fig 9 a an increase in frictional coefficient f 1 results in higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission respectively and the optima of k r shift towards left if f 1 is increased fig 9 b shows a similar behavior in wave transmission for an increase in structural width b 1 h on the contrary in fig 10 an increase in porosity ε 1 or in incident angle of the wave θ decreases both wave reflection and wave transmission while the optima of k r show a right shift as ε 1 or θ is increased additionally in fig 10 a bragg resonance in k r is maximum for the case of both structures being rigid i e f 1 ε 1 0 with maxima of k r higher throughout however in this case the amount of waves transmitted towards the leeward side is generally more than when the structures are porous as none of the energy is dissipated via friction thereby signifying the benefit of using porous structures in fig 11 a and b the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients and dissipation coefficient against wavenumber k 0 h are plotted for the change in spacing between the two porous structures l h although the oscillatory behavior of wave reflection increases with increase in the spacing l h but the wave transmission is nearly independent of any changes in l h fig 11 a consequently the dissipation of wave energy also remains independent of changes in l h as shown in fig 11 b 2 2 4 effect of structural parameters on wave scattering against non dimensional structural width in fig 12 a the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against structural top width k 0 b for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 for a fixed top width b 1 smaller lateral angles θ 1 1 θ 2 1 imply a longer base width l 1 hence it is seen that with a relative decrease in structural base width due to increase in lateral angles of the structure the amplitude of oscillations in the reflection coefficient decreases additionally the wave transmission decreases with increase in structural top width this is due to fact that a major part of the incoming wave energy is dissipated as the structural width increases fig 12 a and b show that with an increase in frictional coefficient the reflection and dissipation coefficients also increase generally however the transmission coefficient decreases a left shift is also observed in optima of k r as frictional coefficient is increased which corresponds to the increase in dissipation of wave energy it may be noted that for zero top width of the structures the trapezoidal structures become triangular structures which causes the reflection to be non zero at k 0 b 0 additionally fig 12 a shows that the wave transmission is minimized as the width of structures increases hence it can be observed in fig 12 b that dissipation of the wave energy increases as frictional coefficient for the structures is increased moreover fig 12 c shows similar variation of k r and k t against structural top width for different values of the angles between lateral sides and horizontal bottom for the structures the periodic pattern in k r increases as the lateral sides become vertical however the difference between adjacent maxima and minima decreases the transmission is lesser for more slanting lateral sides of the structures correspondingly fig 12 d shows that the dissipation of wave energy increases if the lateral sides of the trapezoidal structures are more slanting for a fixed top width in fig 13 a and b the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients against normalized spacing between the dual trapezoidal structures l λ 0 are plotted for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 and structural height a 1 h respectively where λ 0 is wavelength of the incident wave with λ 0 2 π k 0 further in both fig 13 a and b as the frictional coefficient f 1 and structural height a 1 h are increased and the wave reflection increases and the wave transmission decreases similarly for both panels the reflection and transmission coefficients show a periodic pattern with the optima of k r showing a left shift as the value of frictional coefficient or that of structural height is increased however for periodic values of the spacing between structures the wave reflection is minimized irrespective of the frictional coefficients and structural heights 3 wave trapping by double trapezoidal porous structures near a sloping porous wall backed by a rigid wall in case of wave trapping contrary to the scattering of incoming waves the transmitted wave is confined in the region between submerged structures and the sloping porous seawall the sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall is situated at a distance l 3 from second trapezoidal structure on the seabed and labeled as region d the sloping seawall is characterized by structural parameters namely porosity ε 3 inertial coefficient s 3 frictional coefficient f 3 and the front of the seawall makes an angle θ 3 with the horizontal seabed as in fig 14 consequently the physical domain for the present problem is restricted to x r along the x axis where x r is the location of rigid wall the configurations of submerged trapezoidal breakwaters are same as before however three different cases are studied separately i e wave trapping in presence of i only sloping porous seawall ii sloping porous seawall along with one trapezoidal structure and iii sloping porous seawall along with two trapezoidal structures the mathematical formulation for the present problem remains the same as for wave scattering except the radiation condition 5 for x and the matching conditions over γ r are replaced by the boundary conditions for boundaries of the trapezoidal sloping porous seawall in particular seabed under the seawall is also rigid and impermeable in nature as given by 37 ϕ j n 0 on boundaries z h and x r for j d on the sloping front face γ r of the seawall at the fluid structure interface the continuity of pressure and mass flux gives 38 ϕ a s 3 i f 3 ϕ d ϕ a n ε 3 ϕ d n additionally in the presence of a porous seawall the free surface γ f of the existing domain extends in the x direction and is split into two parts as in fig 14 γ f 1 the free surface for the extended region a and γ f 2 the free surface inside the region d i e γ f γ f 1 γ f 2 the boundary condition on γ f 1 remains the same as in eq 3 while the boundary condition on γ f 2 is modified as follows 39 ϕ d z k s 3 i f 3 ϕ d 0 on z 0 the equations for wave trapping are developed in a similar way as described in section 2 1 for wave scattering the integral equations for the regions b and c remain the same as earlier whereas using the boundary conditions 38 and 39 the integral equations for the region a eq 23 are modified as 40 c ϕ a γ f 1 ϕ a g n k g d γ γ l ϕ a g n g ϕ a n d γ γ l 0 γ l γ l 3 ϕ a g n d γ γ a b ϕ b g n g ϕ b n d γ γ a c ϕ c g n g ϕ c n d γ γ r s 3 i f 3 ϕ d g n ε 3 g ϕ d n d γ 0 further using the boundary conditions 38 39 the integral equation for the region d will be of the form 41 c ϕ d γ r ϕ d g n g ϕ d n d γ γ l 4 γ s ϕ d g n d γ γ f 2 ϕ d g n k g s 3 i f 3 ϕ d d γ 0 finally using the same procedure as discussed in section 2 1 the boundary element grid is modified as shown in fig 15 and the integral equations 24 25 40 and 41 are solved together to evaluate the unknowns therein 3 1 results and discussion the wave and structural parameters for wave trapping are same as in section 2 2 the additional seawall parameters are standardized as well unless changed for the corresponding discussion with the distance from base of the second structure l 3 h 1 seawall top width b 3 h 0 5 and sloping angle of the seawall θ 3 45 the base width of the seawall l 4 is calculated using 42 l 4 b 3 h tan θ 3 additionally the non dimensional horizontal wave force k f acting on the rigid seawall is obtained using the formula 43 k f ω g h 2 γ s ϕ d n x d γ 3 1 1 validation with previous results for wave trapping the results for wave trapping evaluated in the present theory are compared with results in koley et al 2014 wherein they also used multi domain boundary element method for examining oblique wave trapping by porous structures in various configurations in the current scenario when the porous seawall has zero top and bottom widths along with similar conditions as in fig 4 a then the present problem is reduced to wave trapping by a bottom standing rectangular porous structure as discussed in koley et al 2014 this comparison is depicted in fig 16 a showing variation of reflection coefficient against structural width for the parameters a 1 h 0 5 f 1 0 5 θ 10 and l λ 1 where λ 2 π k 0 again results from the present theory are in good agreement with the results of previous work by koley et al 2014 furthermore fig 16 a plots the reflection coefficient against non dimensional structural width illustrating the effect of two structures on wave trapping an addition of another structure to a single structure wave trapping scenario decreases the wave reflection irrespective of structural widths this is due to increase in dissipation of wave energy as evident from fig 16 b which plots changes in the dissipation coefficient against non dimensional structural width for single and double structures 3 1 2 effect of structural parameters on wave trapping against non dimensional structural width the efficiency of using a combination of double trapezoidal porous structures in conjunction with a sloping porous seawall is demonstrated in fig 17 the dependence of reflection coefficient k r on non dimensional structural width k 0 b for wave interaction with single double trapezoidal structures in presence of sloping porous seawall is plotted when the structures are rigid and porous as shown in fig 17 a and b respectively as expected the wave reflection is more in case of rigid structures as compared to that in porous structures and wave reflection is reduced in case of double structures for both porous and rigid structure scenarios in particular for rigid structures as shown in fig 17 a the oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection is regular in nature yet for the case of double porous structures the wave reflection is significantly lower which implies that the wave energy dissipation is considerably greater than when only one structure is present however in fig 17 b the reflection coefficient decreases generally with an oscillatory pattern as the structural top width increases this is due to the fact that more wave energy is dissipated by the structures as the structural width increases in fig 18 a and b the reflection coefficients k r against non dimensional structural width k 0 b are plotted for different values of structural height a 1 h and frictional coefficient f 1 respectively it is observed that while showing an oscillatory behavior reflection coefficient generally decreases as structural top width increases irrespective of values of structural heights or frictional coefficients additionally as structural width increases in both panels the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection diminishes and k r becomes uniform for higher values of structural height or frictional coefficient in fig 19 a and b the variation of reflection coefficients against normalized spacing between two trapezoidal structures l h is plotted for different values of spacing between the second trapezoidal structures and base of the sloping porous seawall l 3 λ and the angle of sloping porous seawall θ 3 respectively from fig 19 a it is seen that as the structural spacing increases the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern in the wave reflection diminishes and k r is almost constant for larger values of l λ the reflection coefficients show an resonating pattern with minimum reflection near l λ 0 2 and the minima of k r showing a right shift as structural height is increased fig 19 b depicts that the wave reflection decreases as θ 3 is increased additionally the minima of k r at l λ 0 2 shifts to the right as θ 3 is increased 3 1 3 effect of structural parameters on wave trapping against non dimensional wavenumber fig 20 a depicts the variation of reflection coefficient for various structural configurations against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h showing that the oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection and dissipation is more in the presence of double structures as compared to that in a single structure however there is no oscillation in the absence of trapezoidal structures additionally the reflection is observed to decrease from full reflection to a constant value when the wavenumber goes from shallow water to deep water regime in general the wave reflection is reduced as the number of structures is increased correspondingly in fig 20 b it is observed that addition of structures to the fluid domain decreases the wave force acting on the rigid wall with least force acting on the rigid wall in presence of double trapezoidal structures along with the porous seawall clearly among the geometric configurations tested dual structures in presence of a sloping seawall are the most efficient in dissipating wave energy the effect of different structural heights for the two trapezoidal structures is depicted in fig 21 where the second porous structure which is closer to the sloping seawall is incrementally increased in height in fig 21 a an increase in the structural height a 2 h shows a decrease in the reflection coefficient for both long and short wave regimes further the reflection is minimized near k 0 h 1 5 independent of any changes in the structural height of second structure fig 21 b plots the wave force acting on the rigid wall against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h as the height of the second structure a 2 h is increased while keeping that of the first structure a 1 h constant the wave force on the wall is decreased for all wavenumbers thus placing the relatively larger structure among the two trapezoidal structures near the seawall can be more efficient in attenuation of incoming wave energy fig 22 a and b plot the wave reflection and wave force on the rigid wall respectively against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for increasing values of the porosity for both structures it is seen that both the reflection coefficient and wave force follow the similar patterns as discussed in fig 21 and when the porosity is increased the wave force and wave reflection generally decrease for all wavelengths additionally the oscillatory pattern of the wave force and reflection coefficient also decreases this is due to increase in dissipation of wave energy owing to friction in the structure for high porosities subsequently for analyzing the role of friction fig 23 a and b depict the variation of wave reflection and horizontal wave force on the rigid wall respectively against non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of frictional coefficient f 1 for the dual structures f 2 f 1 fig 23 a plots the change in reflection coefficient against k 0 h showing that for long waves an increase in the frictional coefficient of the structures decreases the reflection of waves in particular the wave reflection diminishes to zero for f 1 f 2 1 5 due to destructive interference between the waves thereby giving maximum dissipation of wave energy for the presence of double trapezoidal structures with a sloping porous seawall additionally fig 23 b shows the effect of increasing frictional coefficient of the structures on wave force k f in this configuration the wave force on the rigid wall is observed to decrease generally on increasing the frictional coefficient of the structures 4 conclusion in the present study interaction of water waves by double trapezoidal porous structures in varying configurations is investigated for different structural parameters along with the scattering of surface waves by double trapezoidal structures the study also includes the trapping of surface waves by double trapezoidal porous structures placed at a finite distance from a sloping porous seawall that is backed by a rigid wall the performance of the single and or double structures is evaluated by examining the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients the hydrodynamic wave force on the rigid wall is also analyzed for all cases in the wave trapping scenario additionally the effect of triangular shaped structures on wave scattering and trapping is studied by assuming top width of the structures to be zero from the present study following conclusions are made which are given separately for wave scattering and trapping 4 1 wave scattering in this case the results for wave interaction with a single structure are obtained and compared with the results for double structures it is found that almost 90 of wave energy can be dissipated by double structures this is much higher than dissipation in the presence of a single structure as expected a substantial amount of increase in wave attenuation is observed as the height of two structures is increased with a clear bragg resonance visible in wave reflection near k 0 h 0 4 for all types of structural parameters an increase in frictional coefficients f i and structural widths b i i 1 2 results in lower transmission and increased dissipation of wave energy figs 9 a and 12 a and 12 b furthermore dissipation is also increased with an increase in porosities ε i and incident angle θ i which results in lower reflection and higher transmission fig 10 a and b wave reflection also diminishes at a critical incident angle θ 48 for a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 which shifts to the right as structural height is increased fig 5 a however the dissipation of wave energy remains independent of changes in spacing between structure although for specific values of the spacing between structures the wave reflection can be minimized to nearly zero fig 11 a further when both the structures are rigid fig 10 a for f i ε i 0 the wave transmission is more as compared to that in porous cases and a decrease in porosities of the structures results in an increase and a right shift of the bragg resonance in the reflection coefficient 4 2 wave trapping in this case the results for four different cases are investigated namely i absence of trapezoidal structures and porous seawall ii presence of only a sloping porous seawall backed by a rigid wall iii presence of a single structure and the porous seawall and iv presence of double structures and the porous seawall the results reveal that the wave reflection and force on the rigid wall is significantly less in the presence of double structures as compared to that for other cases see fig 20 a and b and double trapezoidal structures in presence of the porous seawall is the most efficient configuration in reducing wave force on the rigid wall the wave reflection is observed to generally decrease for long waves and stabilize for short waves as the number of structures is increased in the presence of double trapezoidal structures along with the porous seawall the wave reflection can be found nearly zero near k 0 h 1 5 irrespective of changes in structural heights porosities or the frictional coefficients of the structures figs 21 a and 22 a and 23 a moreover the wave force on the rigid wall decreases generally on increasing the structural heights porosities or the frictional coefficients of the structures it is also observed that wave reflection increases as the sloping angle of the seawall increases fig 19 b when both the trapezoidal structures are rigid for an increase in structural width the optimum of wave reflections are periodic in nature however in case of porous structures the wave reflection and oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection decreases with increase in structural width fig 18 a it may be noted that when the top widths of the structures are zero i e k 0 b 0 the trapezoidal structures become triangular shaped structures further the wave reflection becomes uniform as the structural width increases and in particular nearly constant reflection is found for k 0 b 4 and a 1 h a 2 h 0 8 finally in case of trapezoidal structures with different heights its more efficient to place the relatively larger structure among the two trapezoidal structures near the seawall fig 21 a the conclusions in this work provide an extensive set of data points for using different configurations of dual trapezoidal porous structures as effective breakwaters this data can be adapted based on geographical and environmental conditions near and off shore for engineering design of holistic coastal protection systems

22733,the propulsion system is one of the main sources of ship vibrations a typical propulsion system consists of an engine a shaft line and a propeller in order to estimate the vibration levels of a ship propulsion system analytical methods are still relevant in the preliminary ship design stage in this paper three analytical procedures for the vibration analysis of a ship shafting system are presented the shafting system dynamic behaviour is simulated by reducing the problem to two three and multi mass models propeller and engine damping is taken into account differential equations of motion for the two and the three mass models are solved analytically in the case of the multi mass model rayleigh s quotient and the galerkin method are used for free and forced vibration analysis respectively since the first natural mode of the shaft line is dominant the problem can be reduced to a single d o f in the modal space and solved analytically for all three models relatively simple formulae for the engine torque transfer factor to the intermediate shaft are derived the presented procedures are validated by a comparison with measurements the comparison indicates the high accuracy of the proposed procedures keywords ship propulsion shafting system torsional vibration analytical methods validation against measurements 1 introduction the ship power transmission system is one of the main sources of ship vibrations veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 modern marine diesel engines installed on large merchant ships are characterised by a long stroke low speed and a small number of cylinders such engines are distinguished by their remarkable fuel efficiency however due to the high power output delivered per cylinder the forces exciting shafting system vibrations are relatively high additionally the forcing frequency spectra typically overlap with the natural frequencies of the ship structure in addition the propeller rotating in the non uniform wake field can induce excessive vibrations lewis 1988 grubišić 1991 the vibration analysis of ship propulsion systems is nowadays performed using the finite element method fem naranca et al 2007 lin et al 2009 murawski 2009 vibration levels must be kept under permissible limits with respect to the structural durability of the shafting system if excessive vibrations are predicted in the preliminary design stage remedial actions or special vibration control measures must be applied these include installing a compensator of engine unbalanced moments or using engine support with horizontal stays veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 senjanović čorić 1982a 1982b feese and hill 2002 östman and toivonen 2008 engine induced vibrations can be divided into three basic types of shafting system vibrations axial lateral and torsional the three basic types can also be coupled murawski 2004 huang et al 2017 for instance the torsional vibrations of a reciprocating engine crankshaft cause axial vibrations in the form of cranks bending along the longitudinal axis torsional vibrations also cause bearing reaction forces which induce lateral vibrations shaft line whirling vibrations are an especially interesting problem murawski 2005 torsional vibrations can cause significant problems in the shafting system special attention must be paid in the case of low speed engines with a small number of cylinders brydum and jakobsen 1987 even if the diameter of the shaft line is chosen in accordance with the classification society rules the resulting torsional vibration stresses may still be significantly above the permissible level bureau veritas 2014 det norske veritas 2013 germanisher lloyd 2012 iacs 2014 this problem can be solved either by a flexible or by a rigid shaft line design or by installing a torsional vibration damper magazinović 1998 various devices are used as torsional vibration dampers viscous dampers friction dampers or rubber dampers wright 1988 however they can rarely be found onboard existing ships due to the relatively high costs associated with them torsional vibrations of the shafting system consisting of the crankshaft intermediate shaft propeller shaft and optional couplings and gears are excited by a pulsating torque generated by the main engine veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 this problem has been investigated since the 1950s by reducing the problem to two or three mass systems or to a simplified multi mass system the first two systems can be treated analytically whereas the third one has usually been solved by the iterative holzer table method den hartog 1956 nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 based on the above mentioned achievements in the middle of the last century classification societies specified in their rules simple semi empirical formulae for the estimation of propulsion system vibrations after the emergence of digital computers and numerical methods these formulae were replaced with guidelines for direct calculations of the shafting system dynamic response for this purpose commercial fem software is usually used as are some proprietary codes specifically adapted to the shafting system design in spite of these sophisticated tools for shafting system torsional vibration analysis simple analytical methods are still important for the preliminary shafting system design as well as for controlling the shaft line vibrations of ships in service an example of a simplified analytical procedure is presented by murawski and charchalis 2014 the shaft line has been modelled as a two mass dynamic system it should be mentioned that the procedure murawski and charchalis 2014 is based on some intuitive assumptions concerning both the engine excitation torque as well as the transfer of the torque to the intermediate shaft it should be pointed out that the engine torque transfer factor is occasionally referred to in literature as a magnification amplification factor however amplification factor is a term specifically used to describe the ratio between dynamic and static displacements hence the transfer factor and the amplification factor are two terms that have to be distinguished the dynamic behaviour of shafting systems have recently been simulated by two mass models and by multi mass models senjanović et al 2019 in the first case the governing differential equations of motion were solved analytically a relatively simple formula for the engine torque transfer factor was obtained in the second case the problem was solved by the rayleigh ritz method by taking only the first natural torsional mode into account the problem was reduced to a single d o f system in the modal space and solved analytically since propeller damping is by far the highest in the shafting system the other damping mechanisms in the shaft line were neglected a calculation of the engine excitation torque according to the engine producer tables was systematically included in the analysis the application of analytical methods was illustrated in the case of a 2600 teu container ship powered by a 7 cylinder man b w main engine murawski and charchalis 2014 this paper considers the damping of all shafting system components propeller cylinders etc the shafting system is reduced to two and to three mass models and the finite element formulation is used the shafting system is also modelled as a multi mass system rayleigh s quotient and the galerkin method are used for free and forced vibration analysis respectively the first natural mode is assumed in the form of the static shaft line deformation for all three models of the shafting system relatively simple formulae for the first natural frequency and for the engine torque transfer factor are derived the results using analytical methods are compared to the numerical results and are verified by measurements onboard a 45000 dwt bulk carrier powered by a 5 cylinder man b w main engine magazinović 1998 the comparison indicates the high accuracy of the proposed procedures 2 shafting system a ship propulsion plant consists of the main engine the shaft line and the propeller as shown in fig 1 magazinović 2009 for torsional vibration analysis the complete shafting system is considered it includes the propeller shaft the intermediate shaft the crankshaft the propeller the flange the turning wheel the camshaft drive the cranks of the crankshaft and the tuning wheel a simplified model of a merchant ship shafting system ordinarily used in fem analysis is shown in fig 2 where i i are the polar moments of inertia of the shaft cross sections j i are the polar moments of inertia of the lumped masses α i are the individual magnification factors of the rotating masses and l i are the lengths of different shaft segments the stiffness of each shaft segment is defined as k i g i i l i and the ratio of the actual and critical damping of rotating masses as γ i 1 2 α i the shafting physical and geometrical properties i e the polar moment of inertia and torsional stiffness may be determined in multiple ways for simple cylinder like objects the equations provided in engineering handbooks are generally sufficient for more complex parts e g crankshafts specialised equations apply nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 however these equations are rarely used nowadays since the component manufacturers provide these data obtained from the respective computer aided design models in a similar way they apply to the component damping data although specialised handbooks nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 cover nearly all cases imaginable the contemporary vibration analyses are mostly based on the data provided by the respective component manufacturers regarding the influence of surrounding water on the propeller vibration performance it is well known that it significantly changes the dynamic characteristics of the propeller martio et al 2015 as explained by martio et al 2015 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the propeller include terms proportional to the acceleration inertia forces to the velocity damping force and to the displacement the first term in the vibrational analysis is the so called effective or virtual mass inertia of a propeller in water it consists of not only the actual mass of the submerged propeller but also of the mass of fluid accelerated with the propeller which is termed added mass inertia martio et al 2015 in some cases for a rotating propeller the circulatory forces proportional to the square of the velocity can affect the vibrational analysis the displacement related quantities for fully submerged propellers can be ignored in the vibration analysis a more detailed description of added mass matrices as well as inertia and damping matrices can be found in carlton 2007 in the past for the determination of propeller vibration performance mainly potential flow theory was used ignoring the effect of viscosity dien and schwanecke 1973 vassilopoulos and triantafyllou 1981 takeuchi et al 1983 ghassemi and yari 2011 as well as some semi empirical models the potential theory is even nowadays the subject of investigation mao and young 2016 li et al 2018 2019 mainly due to its simplicity however recent attempts have been made to solve the problem at a higher level of accuracy and consequently with a higher level of complexity by means of cfd methods martio et al 2015 2017 the models referred to above offer the determination of propeller torque and thrust their variation as excitation of shaft vibrations as well as the determination of the added propeller polar moment of inertia and damping in the case of engine induced torsional shaft vibrations only the latter two parameters are of interest the excitation of a propeller working in a non uniform wake field can also be determined however propeller induced ship hull vibrations are outside the scope of this paper another problem related to torsional shaft vibrations is the determination of engine excitation for this purpose the guiding notes of the engine manufacturers for the definition of cylinder radial and tangential forces are used the determination of the resulting harmonics of engine torque taking into account the cylinder firing order and phase angles is presented in senjanović et al 2019 the model shown in fig 2 is the starting point for the torsional vibration analysis of the shafting system by a condensed two mass and three mass model as well as by a full multi mass model 3 the two mass model of a shafting system 3 1 formulation of the problem the crankshaft is normally significantly stiffer than the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft therefore the crankshaft mass the turning wheel mass and the tuning wheel mass can be condensed into one lumped mass at the end of the intermediate shaft the resulting two degrees of freedom d o f system with nodal twist angles φ 0 t and φ 1 t is shown in fig 3 where j 0 is the virtual polar moment of inertia of the propeller that includes the added inertia of the surrounding water whereas j 1 is the polar moment of inertia of the condensed crankshaft masses the shaft is loaded by the following torsional moments fig 3 1 m e t m e cos ω t m i 0 t j 0 φ 0 m i 1 t j 1 φ 1 m d 0 t c 0 φ 0 m d 1 t c 1 φ 1 m 0 t k 0 φ 0 m 1 t k 1 φ 1 where m e t is the engine excitation torque m i j t and m d j t j 0 1 are the inertia and damping torsional

first torsional natural mode the shafting system vibration analysis can be performed by the rayleigh ritz method or by the galerkin method for this purpose natural modes of the shaft line torsional vibrations have to be determined it is well known that the first elastic natural mode is dominant regarding the shaft response to the engine excitation fem analyses show that the shape of the first natural mode is similar to the static shaft torsional deformation exposed to the action of torques at the two shaft ends den hartog 1956 in fact the shaft line is assumed to be clamped at the propeller position and free at the crankshaft end hence this is a statically determined problem fig 5 the shaft line is loaded with torsional moments proportional to the inertia moments m t j ω 2 j j where ω is an assumed frequency accordingly the isolated j th shaft segment can be considered clamped at the section j 1 and loaded with a torque equal to the accumulated torques along the remaining free part of the shaft line fig 5 40 m j ω 2 k j n j k according to the definition of the shaft cross section torsional moment m t g i d φ d x one can write for the increment of the shaft segment twist angle fig 5 41 δ ψ j m j g i j l j ω 2 g l j i j k j n j k summing up the twist angle increments along the shaft line up to i th section the i th twist angle yields 42 ψ i ω 2 g j 1 i l j i j k j n j k since the whole shaft line in reality is free it has to be equilibrated by itself therefore one can write for the first natural mode 43 φ i ψ i ψ r where 44 ψ r i 0 n j i ψ i i 0 n j i is the

2 φ x 2 c x φ t j x 2 φ t 2 μ x e i ω t substituting the assumed solution 49 φ x t f x e i ω t into eq 48 one obtains 50 g i x 2 f x 2 i ω c x f ω 2 j x f μ x function f x can be assumed as a series of natural modes and only the first two terms of the expansion are sufficient to obtain a reliable result 51 f x a b φ moreover since there is interest only to determine the shaft torsional moment the constant a can be omitted now eq 50 can be solved by the galerkin method substituting f x b φ into eq 50 and multiplying it by φ one can write 52 b 0 l g i x d φ d x 2 i ω c x φ 2 ω 2 j x φ 2 d x 0 l μ x φ d x where the first term is transformed by the partial integration in fact the first term in the integral in eq 52 physically represents the potential strain energy which can be found in rayleigh s quotient in eq 45 by using eq 45 the potential energy can be expressed through kinetic energy a more convenient form of the damping function can also be used i e c x 2 ω γ x j x as a result one obtains from eq 52 53 b 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x 2 i ω ω 0 l γ x j x φ 2 d x furthermore eq 53 can be presented in the form 54 b 1 1 ω ω 2 2 i ω ω γ e 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x where 55 γ e 0 l γ x j x φ 2 d x 0 l j x φ 2 d x is the equivalent damping ratio the shaft torsional moment taking eqs 49 and 51 into account is defined as 56 m t x t g i x d φ d x b e i ω t by substituting eq 54 into eq 56 and by rationalizing the fraction one obtains the following expression for the real part of the torsional moment 57 m t x t g i x d φ d x 1 ω ω 2 2 4 γ e 2 ω ω 2 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x cos ω t ε where 58 ε arctg 4 γ e ω ω 1 ω ω 2 is the phase angle next the shaft line is discretized fig 2 and the integrals of continuous functions in eq 55 and eq 57 can be expressed as summations also d φ d x i φ i φ i 1 l i hence 59 γ e i 0 n γ i j i φ i 2 i 0 n j i φ i 2 and 60 w e 0 l μ x φ d x i j k m c i φ i where w e is the work of the engine cylinder torques m c i if the considered harmonic of the periodic cylinder torque coincides with the number of cylinders then w e m e φ e where m e n c m c and φ e is the average value of the twist angle of the crankshaft in the engine span senjanović et al 2019 finally one arrives at the relation between the torsional moment in the i th shaft segment and the engine torque 61 m t i α i m e where 62 α i 1 1 ω ω 2 2 4 γ

vibration analysis of a five cylinder shafting system 6 1 characteristics of the propulsion system the propulsion system of a 45000 dwt bulk carrier powered by a slow speed two stroke five cylinder main engine man b w 5s50mc is considered the propulsion system model is shown in fig 2 and its characteristics are presented in table 1 the encounter propeller moment of inertia consists of three parts i e the propeller in air water addition and one half of the propeller shaft fig 2 j p 14000 3400 110 17510 kgm 2 table 2 hence the water polar moment of inertia is cca 24 of the propeller moment according to the propeller manufacturer the shaft line characteristics have been optimized after a number of iterations in order to conform to the classification society rules in the final design the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft material have been changed from forged steel of 440 n mm2 uts to forged steel of 800 and 600 n mm2 uts respectively a tuning wheel has also been added the difference in the propeller shaft response between the initial and the final shaft line design can be observed in figs 6 and 7 magazinović 1998 in such cases simple analytical procedures to estimate shaft line dynamic response as proposed in this paper are very valuable the main particulars of the shaft line shown in fig 2 are listed in table 2 where the polar moment of inertia of the shaft cross section is i d 4 π 32 the propeller polar moment of inertia is increased due to the added mass of the surrounding water the polar moments of inertia of the remaining lumped masses j i i 1 2 9 fig 2 include the corresponding parts of the shaft mass 6 2 natural vibration 6 2 1 two mass model the value of the first torsional natural frequency of the two mass model is determined according to eq 10 section 3 2 the equivalent stiffness and polar moments of inertia are k 1 278 10 7 nm j 0 17663 kgm 2 and j 1 31843 kgm 2 respectively the obtained value of the natural frequency ω 5 339 hz is included in table 4 and the corresponding natural mode is shown in fig 8 6 2 2 three mass model the stiffness and mass parameters read k 0 1 278 10 7 nm k 2 10 757 10 7 nm j 0 17663 kgm 2 j 1 12887 kgm 2 and j 2 18956 kgm 2 j 0 includes the propeller and flange values from table 2 the remaining items from table 2 j i i 2 3 9 are lumped into nodes 1 and 2 respecting the position of their centre of gravity on the crankshaft the first two natural frequencies are ω 1 5 221 hz and ω 2 19 271 hz the first natural frequency is included in table 4 and the first natural mode is shown in fig 8 the second natural frequency is much lower than the more reliable fem value of 27 082 hz this issue is considered in the appendix to this paper 6 2 3 multi mass model the multi mass model of the shafting system is shown in fig 2 and its main particulars are listed in table 2 the first torsional natural mode assumed to be the same as the static shaft line deformation is determined in table 3 according to eqs 42 44 where a modal scaling factor ω 2 g 10 6 is assumed fig 8 the modal stiffness parameter and the modal inertia are determined in table 4 according to eq 46 the value of natural frequency ω 5 22 hz eq 46 is listed in table 5 the calculated values of the first torsional natural frequency of the shafting system utilizing two three and multi mass models are compared in table 5 with the measured value and the value determined by the transfer matrix method tmm according to the reference magazinović 1998 the details of the transfer matrix method can be found in pestel and leckie 1963 the three mass model and the multi mass model show very slight discrepancies from the measured value in terms of the natural frequency their natural modes are also very similar as shown in fig 8 the mode shape calculated according to the multi mass model is nearly the same as that calculated by fem magazinović 1998 in fact it perfectly resembles the slightly curved part of the natural mode over the whole crankshaft since the two curves perfectly overlap fig 8 the second natural frequency can also be determined by rayleigh s quotient if it is possible to assume a realistic natural mode such a solution obtained by assuming the position of the vibration node to be the same as in the three mass model is shown in the appendix 6 3 engine excitation engine excitation is caused by pulsating periodic gas combustion inside the cylinders cylinder gas forces resulting from the combustion process as well as inertial forces resulting from the accelerations of the pistons and the connecting rods induce tangential forces on the cranks of the crankshaft all of which result in the total cylinder excitation torque the tangential force is specified as a specific force reduced to the piston area it is given in the form of a trigonometric series so that the cylinder torque is defined as 64 m t 1 2 s a c ν 1 t ν sin ν ω e α ν where s is the stroke a c is the piston area t ν is the force amplitude ν ω e is the forcing frequency and α ν is the phase angle of the ν th harmonic the total engine torque is a vector summation of all cylinder torques it takes a maximum value if the ordinary number of the excitation harmonics coincides with the number of cylinders i e if ν n c in that case the amplitude of the primary engine torque is determined from the expression 65 m e 1 2 s a c n c t n the secondary engine torques in the case ν n c are analysed in senjanović et al 2019 in the analysed illustrative example the engine torque is determined by the available data for a similar engine from one of the engine producers the diagrams of the mean indicated pressure the cylinder torque and the resulting engine torque of the 5 th order are shown in fig 9 as functions of the engine speed at the measured critical engine speed n r e s 63 rpm table 5 the engine torque is m c 0 186 mnm 6 4 the transfer factor of engine torque 6 4 1 two mass model damping plays a significant role in the resonant shaft line response the individual magnification factor of a particular rotating mass α i is indicated in fig 2 these values are specified according to the engine producer experience table 2 in addition the values of the damping ratio ordinarily used γ i 1 2 α i are determined it is clear that the propeller damping ratio γ 0 0 05 is dominant according to the values in table 2 the equivalent crankshaft damping ratio is γ 1 0 0074 the equivalent damping ratio of the complete shafting system is 66 γ e i 0 9 γ i j i i 0 9 j i 0 0224 the engine torque transfer factor is determined by employing eq 16 where j 0 and j 1 for the two mass model fig 3 are given in section 6 2 1 instead of the calculated natural frequency ω 5 339 hz table 4 it is more convenient to operate with the critical engine speed n r e s 63 rpm the diagram of the transfer factor α 2 m m is shown in fig 10 6 4 2 three mass model the values of the corresponding stiffness and mass parameters k 0 k 2 j 0 j 1 and j 2 are given in section 6 2 2 the damping coefficients c i 2 γ e i ω j i i 0 1 2 are defined in the following way the value γ e 0 0 05 is taken as equal to the propeller damping ratio table 2 the damping ratios γ e 1 0 008 and γ e 2 0 007 are determined by respecting the centre of gravity of items γ i j i i 2 3 9 from table 2 the engine torque m e is split into two nodal values respecting the centre of gravity of cylinder torques as m 1 0 45 m e m 2 0 55 m e the transfer factor is determined by eq 39 the natural frequency according to section 6 2 2 is ω 32 80 rad s the forcing frequency is ω 2 π n c n 60 rad s where n c is the number of cylinders and n is the engine speed the diagram of the transfer factor α 3 m m is very close to α 2 m m away from the resonance fig 10 6 4 3 multi mass model the transfer factor is determined from eq 62 by employing eqs 59 and 63 all numerical data are taken from tables 3 and 4 and μ 2 2 813 and γ e 0 03467 the transfer factor diagram is shown in fig 10 6 4 4 a comparison of engine torque transfer factors observing the diagram of torque transfer factors α 2 m m α 3 m m and α m m m shown in fig 10 one can notice that the first two factors are almost the same whereas the third one takes a slightly lower value except at the resonance and in the vicinity of n 0 the reason for this is that α 2 m m and α 3 m m are determined by the rigorous solution of differential equations of motion whereas α m m m is a result of the approximate numerical procedure the resonance peaks of the three torque transfer factors are the following α 2 m m 5 20 α 3 m m 5 08 α m m m 5 129 if n 0 then also ω 0 and consequently the harmonic engine torque turns into a stationary propulsion torque in such a case the damping moment due to vibrations is transferred to a resistance torque with a damping much higher than the engine damping in that case the transfer factor α 2 m m according to eq 19 takes a unit value α 0 ω 0 1 the above mentioned theoretical jumping phenomenon from the shaft vibration to a constant speed rotation is analysed by senjanović et al 2019 however the engine speed range which is interesting from a practical viewpoint is within 20 n n n o m in which all three methods result in similar transfer factor values 6 5 shear stress in the intermediate shaft after determining the engine torque and the transfer factor the torsional moment in the intermediate shaft can be determined as m t α m e the maximum sheer stress can be calculated as τ m t w where w d 3 π 16 is the section modulus the sheer stresses calculated by the two mass model and by the multi mass model are shown in fig 11 the stresses determined by the three mass model are very close to those of the two mass model out of resonance and to the multi mass model in the vicinity of the resonance very good agreement with the measured values can be observed stress diagrams due to the complete periodic engine torque determined by the fem analysis is also shown in fig 11 at the resonance the harmonic of the 5 th order is dominant and there is no significant difference between the fem result and the present solutions out of resonance the total fem stresses are somewhat higher than those determined for the dominant 5 th order excitation harmonic for the considered ship experimental data are available the measurements were carried out during the official sea trials by experts from brodarski institute zagreb croatia a set of strain gauges was arranged into a full wheatstone bridge and glued to the intermediate shaft the remaining instrumentation comprising a wireless signal transmission a function generator a tape recorder and an fft analyser was utilized to generate transmit record and analyse the data the measurements were carried out at constant speeds varied in a range from 45 to 127 rpm in steps of five or fewer rpm in addition each measurement was preceded by a pause of a few minutes dedicated to stabilization of the system parameters the calculated sheer stresses are compared with the measured ones at different engine speeds as shown in fig 11 very good agreement can be observed in order to validate the presented analytical methods more precisely the resonance engine speed and the corresponding peak stress in the intermediate shaft are compared with the measured values listed in table 6 in addition the zoomed peak stresses are shown in fig 12 the results obtained by the three mass model and by the multi mass model are very close to the measured values both in terms of the resonance engine speed and the peak stress amplitude 7 conclusion in spite of the fact that complex dynamic problems can nowadays be solved by sophisticated numerical methods and fast computers analytical solutions of ship propulsion system vibrations are still important in this paper a ship shafting system is successfully modelled by two and three mass models a rigorous solution of the governing differential equations of motion is given the shafting system is also presented as a multi mass model natural vibrations are solved by rayleigh s quotient whereas the forced vibration problem is solved by the galerkin method since it is sufficient to take into account only the first natural mode the analytical solution is derived the vibration mode shape is assumed in the form of the static shaft line deformation in contrast to the iterative holzer table method the solution using the present method can be obtained directly the direct calculation process is given step by step in the appropriate columns of tables 3 and 4 using all three shafting system models relatively simple formulae for the engine torque transfer factor to the intermediate shaft are derived the application of the calculation procedures is illustrated in the case of a ship powered by a 5 cylinder main engine this is a typical example of a problematic shafting system design because if classification society rules are followed the maximum allowable stresses in the critical cross section of the intermediate shaft may easily be exceeded the presented analytical methods are very useful and effective in such cases when proposing an appropriate design of the shafting system i e choosing the material and dimensions a comparison of the analytical procedures with numerical results and their validation against the measured results show high accuracy of the analytical procedures therefore analytical procedures can be successfully used in the preliminary ship design stage as well as in the shafting system analyses of ships in service it seems that the application of the multi mass system is preferable due to its efficiency physical insight into each step of the calculation and easy coding acknowledgment this work was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korean government msip through gcrc sop grant no 2011 0030013 appendix shafting system second natural frequency the value of the second natural frequency determined by the three mass model ω 2 19 271 hz is much lower than the fem value of 27 082 hz this is due to the condensing of the crankshaft mass at the end nodes with maximum twist angles which generates very high kinetic energy fig a1 on the other hand the linear crankshaft mode shape as a rough approximation of the real curved mode determined by the fem analysis fig a1 reduces the strain energy the accurate value of the second natural frequency can be obtained by rayleigh s quotient eq 46 if the linear crankshaft mode shape is adjusted to the curved one the curved natural mode looks like a static torsion of the crankshaft fixed at the vibration node and exposed to the action of moments of inertia in the opposite directions in the aft and in the fore part fig a1 the results

calculating the φ i values of the second natural mode the modal stiffness and mass parameters are calculated in table a3 applying eq 46 for rayleigh s quotient for the lumped mass system one obtains ω

22733,the propulsion system is one of the main sources of ship vibrations a typical propulsion system consists of an engine a shaft line and a propeller in order to estimate the vibration levels of a ship propulsion system analytical methods are still relevant in the preliminary ship design stage in this paper three analytical procedures for the vibration analysis of a ship shafting system are presented the shafting system dynamic behaviour is simulated by reducing the problem to two three and multi mass models propeller and engine damping is taken into account differential equations of motion for the two and the three mass models are solved analytically in the case of the multi mass model rayleigh s quotient and the galerkin method are used for free and forced vibration analysis respectively since the first natural mode of the shaft line is dominant the problem can be reduced to a single d o f in the modal space and solved analytically for all three models relatively simple formulae for the engine torque transfer factor to the intermediate shaft are derived the presented procedures are validated by a comparison with measurements the comparison indicates the high accuracy of the proposed procedures keywords ship propulsion shafting system torsional vibration analytical methods validation against measurements 1 introduction the ship power transmission system is one of the main sources of ship vibrations veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 modern marine diesel engines installed on large merchant ships are characterised by a long stroke low speed and a small number of cylinders such engines are distinguished by their remarkable fuel efficiency however due to the high power output delivered per cylinder the forces exciting shafting system vibrations are relatively high additionally the forcing frequency spectra typically overlap with the natural frequencies of the ship structure in addition the propeller rotating in the non uniform wake field can induce excessive vibrations lewis 1988 grubišić 1991 the vibration analysis of ship propulsion systems is nowadays performed using the finite element method fem naranca et al 2007 lin et al 2009 murawski 2009 vibration levels must be kept under permissible limits with respect to the structural durability of the shafting system if excessive vibrations are predicted in the preliminary design stage remedial actions or special vibration control measures must be applied these include installing a compensator of engine unbalanced moments or using engine support with horizontal stays veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 senjanović čorić 1982a 1982b feese and hill 2002 östman and toivonen 2008 engine induced vibrations can be divided into three basic types of shafting system vibrations axial lateral and torsional the three basic types can also be coupled murawski 2004 huang et al 2017 for instance the torsional vibrations of a reciprocating engine crankshaft cause axial vibrations in the form of cranks bending along the longitudinal axis torsional vibrations also cause bearing reaction forces which induce lateral vibrations shaft line whirling vibrations are an especially interesting problem murawski 2005 torsional vibrations can cause significant problems in the shafting system special attention must be paid in the case of low speed engines with a small number of cylinders brydum and jakobsen 1987 even if the diameter of the shaft line is chosen in accordance with the classification society rules the resulting torsional vibration stresses may still be significantly above the permissible level bureau veritas 2014 det norske veritas 2013 germanisher lloyd 2012 iacs 2014 this problem can be solved either by a flexible or by a rigid shaft line design or by installing a torsional vibration damper magazinović 1998 various devices are used as torsional vibration dampers viscous dampers friction dampers or rubber dampers wright 1988 however they can rarely be found onboard existing ships due to the relatively high costs associated with them torsional vibrations of the shafting system consisting of the crankshaft intermediate shaft propeller shaft and optional couplings and gears are excited by a pulsating torque generated by the main engine veritec 1985 bureau veritas 1987 this problem has been investigated since the 1950s by reducing the problem to two or three mass systems or to a simplified multi mass system the first two systems can be treated analytically whereas the third one has usually been solved by the iterative holzer table method den hartog 1956 nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 based on the above mentioned achievements in the middle of the last century classification societies specified in their rules simple semi empirical formulae for the estimation of propulsion system vibrations after the emergence of digital computers and numerical methods these formulae were replaced with guidelines for direct calculations of the shafting system dynamic response for this purpose commercial fem software is usually used as are some proprietary codes specifically adapted to the shafting system design in spite of these sophisticated tools for shafting system torsional vibration analysis simple analytical methods are still important for the preliminary shafting system design as well as for controlling the shaft line vibrations of ships in service an example of a simplified analytical procedure is presented by murawski and charchalis 2014 the shaft line has been modelled as a two mass dynamic system it should be mentioned that the procedure murawski and charchalis 2014 is based on some intuitive assumptions concerning both the engine excitation torque as well as the transfer of the torque to the intermediate shaft it should be pointed out that the engine torque transfer factor is occasionally referred to in literature as a magnification amplification factor however amplification factor is a term specifically used to describe the ratio between dynamic and static displacements hence the transfer factor and the amplification factor are two terms that have to be distinguished the dynamic behaviour of shafting systems have recently been simulated by two mass models and by multi mass models senjanović et al 2019 in the first case the governing differential equations of motion were solved analytically a relatively simple formula for the engine torque transfer factor was obtained in the second case the problem was solved by the rayleigh ritz method by taking only the first natural torsional mode into account the problem was reduced to a single d o f system in the modal space and solved analytically since propeller damping is by far the highest in the shafting system the other damping mechanisms in the shaft line were neglected a calculation of the engine excitation torque according to the engine producer tables was systematically included in the analysis the application of analytical methods was illustrated in the case of a 2600 teu container ship powered by a 7 cylinder man b w main engine murawski and charchalis 2014 this paper considers the damping of all shafting system components propeller cylinders etc the shafting system is reduced to two and to three mass models and the finite element formulation is used the shafting system is also modelled as a multi mass system rayleigh s quotient and the galerkin method are used for free and forced vibration analysis respectively the first natural mode is assumed in the form of the static shaft line deformation for all three models of the shafting system relatively simple formulae for the first natural frequency and for the engine torque transfer factor are derived the results using analytical methods are compared to the numerical results and are verified by measurements onboard a 45000 dwt bulk carrier powered by a 5 cylinder man b w main engine magazinović 1998 the comparison indicates the high accuracy of the proposed procedures 2 shafting system a ship propulsion plant consists of the main engine the shaft line and the propeller as shown in fig 1 magazinović 2009 for torsional vibration analysis the complete shafting system is considered it includes the propeller shaft the intermediate shaft the crankshaft the propeller the flange the turning wheel the camshaft drive the cranks of the crankshaft and the tuning wheel a simplified model of a merchant ship shafting system ordinarily used in fem analysis is shown in fig 2 where i i are the polar moments of inertia of the shaft cross sections j i are the polar moments of inertia of the lumped masses α i are the individual magnification factors of the rotating masses and l i are the lengths of different shaft segments the stiffness of each shaft segment is defined as k i g i i l i and the ratio of the actual and critical damping of rotating masses as γ i 1 2 α i the shafting physical and geometrical properties i e the polar moment of inertia and torsional stiffness may be determined in multiple ways for simple cylinder like objects the equations provided in engineering handbooks are generally sufficient for more complex parts e g crankshafts specialised equations apply nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 however these equations are rarely used nowadays since the component manufacturers provide these data obtained from the respective computer aided design models in a similar way they apply to the component damping data although specialised handbooks nestorides 1958 wilson 1963 cover nearly all cases imaginable the contemporary vibration analyses are mostly based on the data provided by the respective component manufacturers regarding the influence of surrounding water on the propeller vibration performance it is well known that it significantly changes the dynamic characteristics of the propeller martio et al 2015 as explained by martio et al 2015 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the propeller include terms proportional to the acceleration inertia forces to the velocity damping force and to the displacement the first term in the vibrational analysis is the so called effective or virtual mass inertia of a propeller in water it consists of not only the actual mass of the submerged propeller but also of the mass of fluid accelerated with the propeller which is termed added mass inertia martio et al 2015 in some cases for a rotating propeller the circulatory forces proportional to the square of the velocity can affect the vibrational analysis the displacement related quantities for fully submerged propellers can be ignored in the vibration analysis a more detailed description of added mass matrices as well as inertia and damping matrices can be found in carlton 2007 in the past for the determination of propeller vibration performance mainly potential flow theory was used ignoring the effect of viscosity dien and schwanecke 1973 vassilopoulos and triantafyllou 1981 takeuchi et al 1983 ghassemi and yari 2011 as well as some semi empirical models the potential theory is even nowadays the subject of investigation mao and young 2016 li et al 2018 2019 mainly due to its simplicity however recent attempts have been made to solve the problem at a higher level of accuracy and consequently with a higher level of complexity by means of cfd methods martio et al 2015 2017 the models referred to above offer the determination of propeller torque and thrust their variation as excitation of shaft vibrations as well as the determination of the added propeller polar moment of inertia and damping in the case of engine induced torsional shaft vibrations only the latter two parameters are of interest the excitation of a propeller working in a non uniform wake field can also be determined however propeller induced ship hull vibrations are outside the scope of this paper another problem related to torsional shaft vibrations is the determination of engine excitation for this purpose the guiding notes of the engine manufacturers for the definition of cylinder radial and tangential forces are used the determination of the resulting harmonics of engine torque taking into account the cylinder firing order and phase angles is presented in senjanović et al 2019 the model shown in fig 2 is the starting point for the torsional vibration analysis of the shafting system by a condensed two mass and three mass model as well as by a full multi mass model 3 the two mass model of a shafting system 3 1 formulation of the problem the crankshaft is normally significantly stiffer than the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft therefore the crankshaft mass the turning wheel mass and the tuning wheel mass can be condensed into one lumped mass at the end of the intermediate shaft the resulting two degrees of freedom d o f system with nodal twist angles φ 0 t and φ 1 t is shown in fig 3 where j 0 is the virtual polar moment of inertia of the propeller that includes the added inertia of the surrounding water whereas j 1 is the polar moment of inertia of the condensed crankshaft masses the shaft is loaded by the following torsional moments fig 3 1 m e t m e cos ω t m

moments respectively m 0 t and m 1 t are the internal cross section moments c 0 and c 1 are the two damping coefficients k 0 and k 1 are the torsional shaft stiffness and finally ω is the forcing frequency the harmonic excitation torque 1 can be specified as the real part of the complex torque 2 m e t m e e i ω t where i 1 is the imaginary unit accordingly the complex twist angles are assumed in the same form i e 3 φ 0 t φ 0 e i ω t φ 1 t φ 1 e i ω t where φ 0 and φ 1 are now complex constants the problem can be solved by employing the finite element method fem the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft are modelled by a beam finite element each having appropriate torsional characteristics fig 3 the assembly matrix equation reads 4 m 00 m 02 m 12 m 11 k 0 k 0 k 0 k 0 k 1 k 1 k 1 k

nodal twist angles natural frequencies are determined from the condition 9 det ω ω 2 k j 0 j 1 ω 2 j 0 j 1 k 0 the first eigenvalue ω 0 is related to the rigid body motion whereas the second one is a natural frequency of torsional vibrations which can be written in the form 10 ω k j where k is the equivalent shaft stiffness eq 7 and 11 j j 0 j 1 j 0 j 1 is the equivalent polar moment of inertia den hartog 1956 if φ 1 is used as the referent twist angle one finds from the first equation in eqs 8 and 5 12 φ 0 φ 1 1 ω 2 j 0 k φ 2 k 0 φ 0 k 1 φ 1 k 0 k 1 in this way the vector of the natural mode φ 0 φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 is determined where φ 3 is the twist angle at the end of the crankshaft equal to φ 2 due to the assumed infinite stiffness of the crankshaft 3 3 forced vibrations forced vibrations of the two mass system have been analysed by senjanović et al 2019 and here only the outline of the procedure is described and the final results are presented twist angles φ 0 and φ 1 are determined from eq 6 by substituting k ω 2 j eq 10 the stiffness term is eliminated from the solution damping coefficients are presented in the form 13 c 0 2 γ 0 j 0 ω c 1 2 γ 1 j 1 ω where γ 0 and γ

the actual torsional moment 15 m t t α m e cos ω t ε where α is the transfer factor of the engine excitation torque to the shaft response torsional moment and ε is the phase angle the transfer factor can be presented in the form 16 α 1 4 γ 0 2 ω ω 2 1 ω ω 2 2 4 γ e 2 ω ω 2 γ 0 γ 1 γ e ω ω 2 1 2 1 2 j 0 j 1 j 0 where 17 γ e γ 0 j 0 γ 1 j 1 j 0 j 1 is the equivalent damping ratio in the case of

the nodal values of the engine torque m e 4 2 natural vibrations in the case of natural vibrations the matrix in eq 20 is written in the form of an eigenvalue problem senjanović et al 2019 22 k 0 ω 2

c 0 the first solution of eq 25 is ω 0 0 and is related to the shaft rigid body motion from the biquadratic part of eq 25 one obtains the first two natural frequencies of torsional vibrations den

is transformed into 35 m t 0 k 0 d r 2 d i 2 b r d r b i d i i b i d r b r d i where 36 b r a 0 k 0 a 2 m 1 k 2 m 2 b i ω c 0 a 2 c 2 a 0 c 2 k 0 m 1 c 0 k 2 m 2 since 37 m t 0 t m t 0 e i ω t the

first torsional natural mode the shafting system vibration analysis can be performed by the rayleigh ritz method or by the galerkin method for this purpose natural modes of the shaft line torsional vibrations have to be determined it is well known that the first elastic natural mode is dominant regarding the shaft response to the engine excitation fem analyses show that the shape of the first natural mode is similar to the static shaft torsional deformation exposed to the action of torques at the two shaft ends den hartog 1956 in fact the shaft line is assumed to be clamped at the propeller position and free at the crankshaft end hence this is a statically determined problem fig 5 the shaft line is loaded with torsional moments proportional to the inertia moments m t j ω 2 j j where ω is an assumed frequency accordingly the isolated j th shaft segment can be considered clamped at the section j 1 and loaded with a torque equal to the accumulated torques along the remaining free part of the shaft line fig 5 40 m j ω 2 k j n j k according to the definition of the shaft cross section torsional moment m t g i d φ d x one can write for the increment of the shaft segment twist angle fig 5 41 δ ψ j m j g i j l j ω 2 g l j i j k j n j k summing up the twist angle increments along the shaft line up to i th section the i th twist angle yields 42 ψ i ω 2 g j 1 i l j i j k j n j k since the whole shaft line in reality is free it has to be equilibrated by itself therefore one can write for the first natural mode 43 φ i ψ i ψ r where 44 ψ r i 0 n j i ψ i i 0 n j i is the rigid body rotation angle 5 2 the first natural frequency the first torsional natural frequency can be determined by rayleigh s quotient as a result of the maximum potential strain and kinetic energy balance senjanović et al 2019 45 ω 2 g 0 l i x d φ d x 2 d x 0 l j x φ 2 d x where i x is the polar moment of inertia of the shaft cross section and j x is the distributed mass polar moment of inertia for a shaft line with lumped masses eq 45 takes the form 46 ω 2 g i 0 n i i l i δ φ i 2 i 0 n j i φ i 2 where the natural mode is given by eq 43 5 3 forced vibrations the problem of forced shaft line vibrations as a conservative dynamic system is analysed by senjanović et al 2019 by the rayleigh ritz method if damping is taken into account the governing differential equation of motion reads 47 g i

2 φ x 2 c x φ t j x 2 φ t 2 μ x e i ω t substituting the assumed solution 49 φ x t f x e i ω t into eq 48 one obtains 50 g i x 2 f x 2 i ω c x f ω 2 j x f μ x function f x can be assumed as a series of natural modes and only the first two terms of the expansion are sufficient to obtain a reliable result 51 f x a b φ moreover since there is interest only to determine the shaft torsional moment the constant a can be omitted now eq 50 can be solved by the galerkin method substituting f x b φ into eq 50 and multiplying it by φ one can write 52 b 0 l g i x d φ d x 2 i ω c x φ 2 ω 2 j x φ 2 d x 0 l μ x φ d x where the first term is transformed by the partial integration in fact the first term in the integral in eq 52 physically represents the potential strain energy which can be found in rayleigh s quotient in eq 45 by using eq 45 the potential energy can be expressed through kinetic energy a more convenient form of the damping function can also be used i e c x 2 ω γ x j x as a result one obtains from eq 52 53 b 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x 2 i ω ω 0 l γ x j x φ 2 d x furthermore eq 53 can be presented in the form 54 b 1 1 ω ω 2 2 i ω ω γ e 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x where 55 γ e 0 l γ x j x φ 2 d x 0 l j x φ 2 d x is the equivalent damping ratio the shaft torsional moment taking eqs 49 and 51 into account is defined as 56 m t x t g i x d φ d x b e i ω t by substituting eq 54 into eq 56 and by rationalizing the fraction one obtains the following expression for the real part of the torsional moment 57 m t x t g i x d φ d x 1 ω ω 2 2 4 γ e 2 ω ω 2 0 l μ x φ d x ω 2 0 l j x φ 2 d x cos ω t ε where 58 ε arctg 4 γ e ω ω 1 ω ω 2 is the phase angle next the shaft line is discretized fig 2 and the integrals of continuous functions in eq 55 and eq 57 can be expressed as summations also d φ d x i φ i φ i 1 l i hence 59 γ e i 0 n γ i j i φ i 2 i 0 n j i φ i 2 and 60 w e 0 l μ x φ d x i j k m c i φ i where w e is the work of the engine cylinder torques m c

in the engine span senjanović et al 2019 finally one arrives at the relation between the torsional moment in the i th shaft segment and the engine torque 61 m t i α i m e where 62 α i 1 1 ω ω 2 2 4 γ

vibration analysis of a five cylinder shafting system 6 1 characteristics of the propulsion system the propulsion system of a 45000 dwt bulk carrier powered by a slow speed two stroke five cylinder main engine man b w 5s50mc is considered the propulsion system model is shown in fig 2 and its characteristics are presented in table 1 the encounter propeller moment of inertia consists of three parts i e the propeller in air water addition and one half of the propeller shaft fig 2 j p 14000 3400 110 17510 kgm 2 table 2 hence the water polar moment of inertia is cca 24 of the propeller moment according to the propeller manufacturer the shaft line characteristics have been optimized after a number of iterations in order to conform to the classification society rules in the final design the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft material have been changed from forged steel of 440 n mm2 uts to forged steel of 800 and 600 n mm2 uts respectively a tuning wheel has also been added the difference in the propeller shaft response between the initial and the final shaft line design can be observed in figs 6 and 7 magazinović 1998 in such cases simple analytical procedures to estimate shaft line dynamic response as proposed in this paper are very valuable the main particulars of the shaft line shown in fig 2 are listed in table 2 where the polar moment of inertia of the shaft cross section is i d 4 π 32 the propeller polar moment of inertia is increased due to the added mass of the surrounding water the polar moments of inertia of the remaining lumped masses j i i 1 2 9 fig 2 include the corresponding parts of the shaft mass 6 2 natural vibration 6 2 1 two mass model the value of the first torsional natural frequency of the two mass model is determined according to eq 10 section 3 2 the equivalent stiffness and polar moments of inertia are k 1 278 10 7 nm j 0 17663 kgm 2 and j 1 31843 kgm 2 respectively the obtained value of the natural frequency ω 5 339 hz is included in table 4 and the corresponding natural mode is shown in fig 8 6 2 2 three mass model the stiffness and mass parameters read k 0 1 278 10 7 nm k 2 10 757 10 7 nm j 0 17663 kgm 2 j 1 12887 kgm 2 and j 2 18956 kgm 2 j 0 includes the propeller and flange values from table 2 the remaining items from table 2 j i i 2 3 9 are lumped into nodes 1 and 2 respecting the position of their centre of gravity on the crankshaft the first two natural frequencies are ω 1 5 221 hz and ω 2 19 271 hz the first natural frequency is included in table 4 and the first natural mode is shown in fig 8 the second natural frequency is much lower than the more reliable fem value of 27 082 hz this issue is considered in the appendix to this paper 6 2 3 multi mass model the multi mass model of the shafting system is shown in fig 2 and its main particulars are listed in table 2 the first torsional natural mode assumed to be the same as the static shaft line deformation is determined in table 3 according to eqs 42 44 where a modal scaling factor ω 2 g 10 6 is assumed fig 8 the modal stiffness parameter and the modal inertia are determined in table 4 according to eq 46 the value of natural frequency ω 5 22 hz eq 46 is listed in table 5 the calculated values of the first torsional natural frequency of the shafting system utilizing two three and multi mass models are compared in table 5 with the measured value and the value determined by the transfer matrix method tmm according to the reference magazinović 1998 the details of the transfer matrix method can be found in pestel and leckie 1963 the three mass model and the multi mass model show very slight discrepancies from the measured value in terms of the natural frequency their natural modes are also very similar as shown in fig 8 the mode shape calculated according to the multi mass model is nearly the same as that calculated by fem magazinović 1998 in fact it perfectly resembles the slightly curved part of the natural mode over the whole crankshaft since the two curves perfectly overlap fig 8 the second natural frequency can also be determined by rayleigh s quotient if it is possible to assume a realistic natural mode such a solution obtained by assuming the position of the vibration node to be the same as in the three mass model is shown in the appendix 6 3 engine excitation engine excitation is caused by pulsating periodic gas combustion inside the cylinders cylinder gas forces resulting from the combustion process as well as inertial forces resulting from the accelerations of the pistons and the connecting rods induce tangential forces on the cranks of the crankshaft all of which result in the total cylinder excitation torque the tangential force is specified as a specific force reduced to the piston area it is given in the form of a trigonometric series so that the cylinder torque is defined as 64 m t 1 2 s a c ν 1 t ν sin ν ω e α ν where s is the stroke a c is the piston area t ν is the force amplitude ν ω e is the forcing frequency and α ν is the phase angle of the ν th harmonic the total engine torque is a vector summation of all cylinder torques it takes a maximum value if the ordinary number of the excitation harmonics coincides with the number of cylinders i e if ν n c in that case the amplitude of the primary engine torque is determined from the expression 65 m e 1 2 s a c n c t n the secondary engine torques in the case ν n c are analysed in senjanović et al 2019 in the analysed illustrative example the engine torque is determined by the available data for a similar engine from one of the engine producers the diagrams of the mean indicated pressure the cylinder torque and the resulting engine torque of the 5 th order are shown in fig 9 as functions of the engine speed at the measured critical engine speed n r e s 63 rpm table 5 the engine torque is m c 0 186 mnm 6 4 the transfer factor of engine torque 6 4 1 two mass model damping plays a significant role in the resonant shaft line response the individual magnification factor of a particular rotating mass α i is indicated in fig 2 these values are specified according to the engine producer experience table 2 in addition the values of the damping ratio ordinarily used γ i 1 2 α i are determined it is clear that the propeller damping ratio γ 0 0 05 is dominant according to the values in table 2 the equivalent crankshaft damping ratio is γ 1 0 0074 the equivalent damping ratio of the complete shafting system is 66 γ e i 0 9 γ i j i i 0 9 j i 0 0224 the engine torque transfer factor is determined by employing eq 16 where j 0 and j 1 for the two mass model fig 3 are given in section 6 2 1 instead of the calculated natural frequency ω 5 339 hz table 4 it is more convenient to operate with the critical engine speed n r e s 63 rpm the diagram of the transfer factor α 2 m m is shown in fig 10 6 4 2 three mass model the values of the corresponding stiffness and mass parameters k 0 k 2 j 0 j 1 and j 2 are given in section 6 2 2 the damping coefficients c i 2 γ e i ω j i i 0 1 2 are defined in the following way the value γ e 0 0 05 is taken as equal to the propeller damping ratio table 2 the damping ratios γ e 1 0 008 and γ e 2 0 007 are determined by respecting the centre of gravity of items γ i j i i 2 3 9 from table 2 the engine torque m e is split into two nodal values respecting the centre of gravity of cylinder torques as m 1 0 45 m e m 2 0 55 m e the transfer factor is determined by eq 39 the natural frequency according to section 6 2 2 is ω 32 80 rad s the forcing frequency is ω 2 π n c n 60 rad s where n c is the number of cylinders and n is the engine speed the diagram of the transfer factor α 3 m m is very close to α 2 m m away from the resonance fig 10 6 4 3 multi mass model the transfer factor is determined from eq 62 by employing eqs 59 and 63 all numerical data are taken from tables 3 and 4 and μ 2 2 813 and γ e 0 03467 the transfer factor diagram is shown in fig 10 6 4 4 a comparison of engine torque transfer factors observing the diagram of torque transfer factors α 2 m m α 3 m m and α m m m shown in fig 10 one can notice that the first two factors are almost the same whereas the third one takes a slightly lower value except at the resonance and in the vicinity of n 0 the reason for this is that α 2 m m and α 3 m m are determined by the rigorous solution of differential equations of motion whereas α m m m is a result of the approximate numerical procedure the resonance peaks of the three torque transfer factors are the following α 2 m m 5 20 α 3 m m 5 08 α m m m 5 129 if n 0 then also ω 0 and consequently the harmonic engine torque turns into a stationary propulsion torque in such a case the damping moment due to vibrations is transferred to a resistance torque with a damping much higher than the engine damping in that case the transfer factor α 2 m m according to eq 19 takes a unit value α 0 ω 0 1 the above mentioned theoretical jumping phenomenon from the shaft vibration to a constant speed rotation is analysed by senjanović et al 2019 however the engine speed range which is interesting from a practical viewpoint is within 20 n n n o m in which all three methods result in similar transfer factor values 6 5 shear stress in the intermediate shaft after determining the engine torque and the transfer factor the torsional moment in the intermediate shaft can be determined as m t α m e the maximum sheer stress can be calculated as τ m t w where w d 3 π 16 is the section modulus the sheer stresses calculated by the two mass model and by the multi mass model are shown in fig 11 the stresses determined by the three mass model are very close to those of the two mass model out of resonance and to the multi mass model in the vicinity of the resonance very good agreement with the measured values can be observed stress diagrams due to the complete periodic engine torque determined by the fem analysis is also shown in fig 11 at the resonance the harmonic of the 5 th order is dominant and there is no significant difference between the fem result and the present solutions out of resonance the total fem stresses are somewhat higher than those determined for the dominant 5 th order excitation harmonic for the considered ship experimental data are available the measurements were carried out during the official sea trials by experts from brodarski institute zagreb croatia a set of strain gauges was arranged into a full wheatstone bridge and glued to the intermediate shaft the remaining instrumentation comprising a wireless signal transmission a function generator a tape recorder and an fft analyser was utilized to generate transmit record and analyse the data the measurements were carried out at constant speeds varied in a range from 45 to 127 rpm in steps of five or fewer rpm in addition each measurement was preceded by a pause of a few minutes dedicated to stabilization of the system parameters the calculated sheer stresses are compared with the measured ones at different engine speeds as shown in fig 11 very good agreement can be observed in order to validate the presented analytical methods more precisely the resonance engine speed and the corresponding peak stress in the intermediate shaft are compared with the measured values listed in table 6 in addition the zoomed peak stresses are shown in fig 12 the results obtained by the three mass model and by the multi mass model are very close to the measured values both in terms of the resonance engine speed and the peak stress amplitude 7 conclusion in spite of the fact that complex dynamic problems can nowadays be solved by sophisticated numerical methods and fast computers analytical solutions of ship propulsion system vibrations are still important in this paper a ship shafting system is successfully modelled by two and three mass models a rigorous solution of the governing differential equations of motion is given the shafting system is also presented as a multi mass model natural vibrations are solved by rayleigh s quotient whereas the forced vibration problem is solved by the galerkin method since it is sufficient to take into account only the first natural mode the analytical solution is derived the vibration mode shape is assumed in the form of the static shaft line deformation in contrast to the iterative holzer table method the solution using the present method can be obtained directly the direct calculation process is given step by step in the appropriate columns of tables 3 and 4 using all three shafting system models relatively simple formulae for the engine torque transfer factor to the intermediate shaft are derived the application of the calculation procedures is illustrated in the case of a ship powered by a 5 cylinder main engine this is a typical example of a problematic shafting system design because if classification society rules are followed the maximum allowable stresses in the critical cross section of the intermediate shaft may easily be exceeded the presented analytical methods are very useful and effective in such cases when proposing an appropriate design of the shafting system i e choosing the material and dimensions a comparison of the analytical procedures with numerical results and their validation against the measured results show high accuracy of the analytical procedures therefore analytical procedures can be successfully used in the preliminary ship design stage as well as in the shafting system analyses of ships in service it seems that the application of the multi mass system is preferable due to its efficiency physical insight into each step of the calculation and easy coding acknowledgment this work was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korean government msip through gcrc sop grant no 2011 0030013 appendix shafting system second natural frequency the value of the second natural frequency determined by the three mass model ω 2 19 271 hz is much lower than the fem value of 27 082 hz this is due to the condensing of the crankshaft mass at the end nodes with maximum twist angles which generates very high kinetic energy fig a1 on the other hand the linear crankshaft mode shape as a rough approximation of the real curved mode determined by the fem analysis fig a1 reduces the strain energy the accurate value of the second natural frequency can be obtained by rayleigh s quotient eq 46 if the linear crankshaft mode shape is adjusted to the curved one the curved natural mode looks like a static torsion of the crankshaft fixed at the vibration node and exposed to the action of moments of inertia in the opposite directions in the aft and in the fore part fig a1 the results of calculation using the two separated crankshaft parts are shown in tables a1 and a2 following the procedure presented in section 6 2 3 and assuming a modal scaling factor ω 2 g 10 6 after calculating the φ i values of the second natural mode the modal stiffness and mass parameters are calculated in table a3 applying eq 46 for rayleigh s quotient for the lumped mass system one obtains ω

22734,during the very large floating structure vlfs is deployed not far from the shore line or near the island the ocean waves and hydroelastic responses of vlfs could be greatly influenced by the complicated geographic environment particularly for the depth varying seabed firstly the extreme wave parameters of different recurrence periods at the deployed location are solved by the numerical simulations of wave evolution and propagation in an archipelagic water field using the third generation wave model the numerical results are compared with the data from the on site measurement and model test in a shallow water wave basin secondly one hydroelastic numerical coupled model of the floating structure responding to the waves in shallow water with a specified seabed profile is proposed and validated by comparing with the model test results finally based on the above model the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in the waves influenced by complicated geographic environment are obtained it is concluded that the wave statistics experiences obviously changes when propagating and approaching towards the island meanwhile the complicated seabed profile has an apparent influence on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs keywords vlfs fluid structure interaction hydroelasticity complicated geographic environment shallow water wave 1 introduction in the past twenty five years extensive investigations have been carried out on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in deep open seas in usa japan and china wu et al 1993 ertekin et al 1993 kashiwagi 1999 when a vlfs is located not far from the shore line or near islands and reefs the seabed profile is usually complicated and the water depth may change from hundreds of meters to a few meters within a short distance under this circumstance it will cause complicated geographic environment especially for the waves they are always accompanied by refraction diffraction reflection shoaling breaking and etc therefore the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs are quite different from those in the open seas with even seabed to obtain the characteristics of wave evolution principles and the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs near islands and reefs three categories of wave models including mega scale middle scale and local scale models seeing table 1 are proposed to analyze the wave parameters with different resolution tian et al 2014 however it should be noted that their definitions are not so strict particularly for the mega scale and middle scale models 1 mega scale model is based on the wave spectral action density balance equation software packages such as swan and ww3 wave watch iii can deal with wave growth and propagation in several hundreds of kilometers zone for examples northern south china sea jiang et al 2010 and the gulf of mexico fang et al 2009 2 middle scale model is based on one of these equations i e mild slope equation berkhoff 1972 boussinesq equation madsen et al 1991 and green naghdi equation zhao 2010 and can be employed to simulate the wave refraction diffraction and dispersion characteristics near shore or islands 3 local scale model including viscous models and potential solvers which can describe the details of wave disturbances around the floating structures the viscous solver software includes ansys fluent etc the potential solver software includes wamit aqwa etc in the local scale model the effects of seabed profile on the responses of the floating structures have to be taken into account in recent years some different methods were studied by including the variable sea bottom such as finite difference method fdm sun et al 2003 fast multipole method fmm utsunomiya 2001 finite element method fem kyoung 2005 eigen function expansion method eem sturova 2008 a coupled mode model and theory belibassakis and athanassoulis 2005 and boundary element methods bem belibassakis 2008 etc it is found that for both ships moored to the seabed ferreria 2009 and vlfs located at the mouth of the river utsunomiya et al 2008 vlfs located near islands with one module and 8 module ding et al 2017 2019 so the hydroelastic responses have be greatly influenced by the depth varying seabed generally speaking the wave loads and hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in complicated geographic environment are still worthy of investigation up to now including connector loads and structural deflection etc meanwhile the hydroelastic responses principles of vlfs at extreme wave condition and wave spectrum near islands and reefs have not yet fully studied which are particularly concerned in engineering application in the present paper the three models are adopted considering the influence by complicated geographic environment including mega scale model middle scale model and local scale model the extreme wave parameters in 100 year recurrence period are obtained by numerical simulation using swan with mega scale mode meanwhile the numerical results are validated by on site measurement data then the numerical simulation using ww3 with middle scale are carried out and validated by model test the wave parameters and wave spectrum near vlfs are obtained by model test in wave basin finally the hydroelastic responses of a 3 module vlfs are studied using potential theory with local scale model the hydroelastic theory of coupled model between floating structures and seabed are proposed the structural deflection and connector loads of vlfs are investigated using the coupled model with local scale model 2 waves influenced by complicated geographic environment in order to obtain the extreme wave parameters including significant wave height wave period wave spectrum at the position of the vlfs deployment the on site wave measurement model experiment and the numerical wave models of different zone scales are applied comprehensively the sketch of different wave model s zones is shown in fig 1 in addition it can be seen that the floating structure is deployed to the northwest of island c 2 1 the on site wave measurement great progress has been achieved in wave model theories in the past decades however acquiring the wave statistical data by on site measurement of the waves is still one of the most effective methods in addition the measurement data can also be utilized for the validation of the numerical wave models two sets of buoys including waverider 1 p 1 and waverider 2 p 2 were deployed near the islands in june 2014 the layout of the two long term measurement instruments is shown in fig 2 and each red point represents the position of a buoy each buoy could measure wave parameters the buoy is international generic device which obtains the wave height by integrating the acceleration generally it s assumed that the data from waverider 1 can represent the waves parameters near island inside the lagoon and the data from waverider 2 approximately represents the waves from the open sea the characteristics of wave height variation from open sea to the border near the island in the lagoon can be evaluated by analyzing the measurement data from waverider 1 and waverider 2 the wave height variation may be defined by wave height ratio the results of the wave height ratio from june 2014 to feb 2015 will be discussed later 2 2 mega scale wave simulation in the zone of mega scale wave model the evolution and propagation from the open sea of waves approaching the middle scale zone or the islands are simulated by using a third generation numerical wave model based on action density balance equation which can be expressed in cartesian coordinate as 1 t n x c x n y c y n σ c σ n θ c θ n s σ where the action density n σ θ denotes conserved during the wave propagation c x c y c σ and c θ represent the propagation velocity of action density in the x and y directions frequency space and direction space respectively s on the right hand side denotes a source sink term that can be expressed as s s w i n d s d s s n l the terms on the right hand side denote wave growth by the wind wave decay due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking and nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions respectively swan is an open source program based on the above wave model which is applied in the mega scale wave simulation taking into account wave shoaling refraction diffraction bottom friction depth induced wave breaking white capping and wave growth by the wind etc at first the waves generated by no 15 typhoon in 2014 named kalmaegi passing by the islands and reefs are simulated the calculation domain contained the range influenced by the typhoon its longitude varied from 106 to 117 and its latitude varied from 12 1 to 23 5 triangle grid was applied the element number is 33577 and node number is 42445 the space resolution of the wind input data is 0 1 interval along the longitude and latitude direction and the time resolution is 1 h from 0 00 in sep 14th 2014 to 23 00 in sep 21st 2014 the significant wave heights at p 1 are calculated from 16 00 in sep 15th 2014 to 22 00 in sep 21st 2014 during the period the typhoon kalmaegi passed by is at the east to the islands far away from several hundreds of kilometers the numerical results are compared with the on site measurement results which are shown in fig 3 a general agreement is achieved and the maximum discrepancy is less than 30 it shows that the swan model is suitable to simulate the behavior of wave strengthening and weakening in the lagoon during the passage of the typhoon on the other side fig 3 b presents the distribution of significant wave height at 4 00 in sep 16th 2014 which corresponds to the maximum value of h s significant wave height when the typhoon passing by the lagoon it shows the typical of characteristics that the strength of wave in the lagoon is smaller than that outside the lagoon secondly the wave evolution and propagation from the open sea to the lagoon are simulated taking into account different wave directions and recurrence periods including 100 years 50 years 25 years 10 years and 2 years the main characteristics of wave height decay due to the existence of islands and reefs can be obtained by numerical simulation the simulated wave height ratio is defined by h s p 1 h s open sea where h s p 1 and h s open sea denote the calculated wave height at p 1 and the open sea respectively the numerical results are with 2 year recurrence period since the on site measurement time is only one year the comparisons of the wave height ratio between numerical results and those from on site measurement are shown in fig 4 a it can be seen that the wave height ratios are small in the north and east wind directions because the sheltering effect of the island are playing an important role on the contrary the ratio in the northwest wind direction is comparatively higher than the other directions generally the tendency of the calculated wave height ratios looks reasonable thirdly if the design life of the vlfs is 100 years the extreme wave parameters at the location of interest can be obtained from the numerical simulations fig 4 b presents the contour of the significant wave height simulated with 100 year recurrence period in nw direction with the wave height from nw direction at open sea is 11 19 m and the spectrum peak period t p 11 6s it is assumed that the location q shown in figs 4 b and fig 5 a with the water depth about 30 m represents the location of wave maker water depth 28 8 m in the middle scale model test shown in fig 5 b d the calculated wave height at q is 4 35 m considering a 50 averaged safety margin factor the maximum irregular wave height at q can be conservatively estimated as h s max 4 35m 1 5 6 52 m the spectrum peak period t p is still 11 6s based on linear assumption therefore the extreme wave condition for the middle scale model experiment is determined 2 3 middle scale wave simulation and model experiment the model test is carried out to obtain the wave evolution characteristics of middle scale the selected sea area near islands is shown in fig 5 with the length of 1080 m and width of 522 m along nw direction the seabed profile is built in the tank with the scale ratio 1 36 the wave heights are measured at different locations from w1 to w18 at present the wave propagating characteristics are simulated based on ww3 wave model ww3 model is a third generation wave model developed at noaa ncep it is based on wave spectral action density balance equation that is the same to swan model however the precision with the rectangular grid in ww3 is higher than that in swan model for the area with finite water depth ww3 is suitable the calculation domain covers the selected area and the rectangular grid is applied the grid size is 2 m therefore the number along length is 540 and that along width is 261 to validate the numerical model and obtain the extreme wave parameters and spectrum near the vlfs two model test conditions including a regular and an irregular wave cases are discussed in the paper for the regular wave condition h 1 74 m t 12 0s the comparison of wave heights between the numerical result and experimental data along different directions sec 1 and sec 2 is presented in fig 6 it can be seen that general agreement has been achieved particularly for the deep water depth area however the discrepancy at shallow water areas is comparatively bigger but less than 23 for the extreme irregular wave conditions the incident wave from open sea is using jonswap spectrum the corresponding significant wave height h s 6 52 m spectrum peak period t p 11 6s the numerical results and experiments data at different locations are shown in fig 7 a it s concluded that 1 the numerical results agree well with the measurement data in the deep water zone 2 major differences appear in shallow water zone the reasons may be that the complicated seabed effects can note be simulated accurately in the present numerical model the results comparison of wave energy spectrum at target location are shown in fig 7 b it can be seen that the experimental wave spectrum shows two peak ranges which are quite different from jonswap spectrum which is commonly used to describe the encountered wave condition of traditional ocean going ship or a marine platform in deep open sea hereafter the measured wave spectrum will be employed to calculate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs near islands 3 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity and result validation 3 1 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity 1 basic assumption and the decomposition of velocity potential the fluid around the elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous non rotating during studying the interaction between floating structure and wave meanwhile not considering the effects of lift force and surface tension on the other side the elastic deformation of the structure is considered as small and the overall response satisfies the linear superposition principle of the modal deformation the

in shallow water influenced by complicated geographic environment this will require a large number of panels to discretize the hull and the sea bottom which means that the influence coefficients will form a large densely populated asymmetric complex matrix moreover the high numbers of wave frequencies and elastic modes will consume huge computation time one solution to this problem is to adopt the parallel computing method to enhance the efficiency of the hydroelasticity analysis program the parallelization can be carried out at different levels of the data structure and the execution of the computer program such as the wet surface panels wave frequencies etc on these bases the advanced thread level parallelization can be achieved and the parallelization efficiency and the overall computing efficiency can be improved more detailed discussions on this can be seen in the reference ye et al 2015 the parallelization procedure for this specific work is shown in fig 8 3 4 the numerical validation for validating the above theories and numerical methods a rigid semi submersible floating platform was selected for the model tests which carried out at the same time with the model test in chapter 2 3 in which they have used same topographic data and the variable seabed is built in the wave tanker the local water depth of mooring zone of the floating platform is 10 m and the water depth out of the variable seabed is 35 6 m the incident wave is from the open sea and the four sides of the variable seabed built in the model test and the numerical model is under still water surface with 35 6 m in general most researchers use constant water depth for hydrodynamic performance calculation or hydroelastic response assessment according to this way for the local water depth of floating structures is 10 m so the parameters of water depth should choose 10 m in numerical calculation in the chapter 2 it s concluded the wave has been affected obviously by the variable seabed and it is unscientific to use uniform depth assessing model for this reason there are two calculating sets have been chosen one is coupled model shown in fig 9 b the seabed is flat with water depth 35 6 out of the region of the variable seabed which is not shown in the figure for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green theorem so it not need to divide panel on the flat seabed part the other is with constant water depth 10 m no variable seabed is taken in the latter sets the main parameters of the floating platform are shown in table 2 the tanker model test is at a selected scale of 1 36 the length of the model is 1 389 m the coupled numerical hydrodynamic model of the platform and seabed is shown in fig 9 the origin of a cartesian coordinate system is located at the free surface with the x axis along the brace and z positive upwards as shown in fig 9 the panel numbers of the floating platform and variable seabed are 1992 and 11908 respectively and the panel number of the whole coupled model is 13900 the motion response transfer functions of the floating platform in the model test coupled model and numerical model with a constant water depth of 10 m are shown in fig 10 it s concluded that the results are consistent when the wave period is less than 13s and the results from the coupled model are closer to the model test results when the period is larger than 15s which is consistent to the physical phenomena of wave evolution for the seabed has more obvious effect on long waves fig 10 a shows that the measured sway motion of the structure fluctuates at periods close to 13s the coupled model has a similar phenomenon but the curve is very smooth for the case of constant water depth this suggests that the effect of complex three dimensional shallow seabed needs to be considered in the calculation of structure response using the coupled model especially for large periods and the method proposed in the paper can produce results consistent with the experiment 4 hydroelastic responses in complicated geographic environment 4 1 vlfs model a three module semi submersible vlfs is studied in the paper the single module with the length of 300 m is connected by articulated flexible connectors in the flexible module and flexible connector fmfc model no rotational stiffness is included hence the connector s stiffness is characterized by the stiffness in the three directions k x 2 10 9 n m k y 1 10 9 n m and k z 2 10 9 n m two connectors at the deck level are used to join adjacent modules there are four connectors c1 c2 c3 c4 among the three modules they are located at y 29 m and z 24 m the configuration of the three module vlfs which is symmetric about x axis shown in fig 11 and the main characteristics of the vlfs are shown in table 3 a combination of quadrilateral and triangular panels is used to model the wetted surface there are a total of 5652 elements on the other side the structure s finite element model contains 192367 elements including 91929 shell elements and 100438 beam elements the hydrodynamic panel model and the structure s finite element model of the vlfs are shown in fig 12 4 2 elastic modal analysis results the hydroelastic responses and its natural frequencies are obtained by using the mode superposition method there are two rigid modes and five flexible modes for the three module vlfs as shown in fig 13 the added mass of the structure in fluid could change the natural frequencies of the structure in vacuum the resonant frequencies of all modes shown in table 4 could be calculated by eq 12 the results have shown that the resonant frequency is smaller than the natural frequency for the existence of added mass the resonant frequency which plays an important role in wave induced response is harmful to the motion of the structure generally speaking the resonant frequency will skew the region of high wave energy when we design the floating structure through three dimensional hydroelasticity software thafts wu 1984 the resonant frequency can be determined the resonant frequency of vlfs under different modes has been shown in table 4 at the same time load coefficients of connector under different flexible modes have been given in table 5 4 3 coupled model of vlfs and seabed when the vlfs is placed near an island its bow or stern may come to contact with the seabed and the complex seabed profile can influence the hydrodynamic properties and hydroelastic response of the vlfs in order to investigate the effects of the seabed profile a coupled model of the vlfs and seabed was built the seabed as shown in fig 14 a is all below the still water line with the lowest point 36 m under water and the highest point h1 7 9 m under water the length and breadth of the seabed are 250 m and 200 m and the panel number in the hydrodynamic model of the seabed is 10648 a part from the seabed profile with variable depth as defined the water depths at other locations are assumed to be constant at 40 m there are two calculating sets have been chosen one is coupled model the seabed is flat with water depth 40 m out of the region of the variable seabed which is not fully shown in fig 14 b for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green theorem so it not need to divide panels on the flat seabed part the other is with constant water depth 40 m no variable seabed is taken in the latter sets the incident wave direction is shown in fig 14 c 4 4 analysis of results the hydroelastic modal principle coordinate responses of the vlfs considering seabed as shown in fig 15 are different from that in constant water depth because the two mode shapes of p 9 and p 10 are anti symmetric about x axis the modal principle coordinate responses are zero for p 9 p 10 with 0 wave angle in the constant water depth case but with the asymmetric seabed included these responses become non zero shown in fig 15 a and c moreover the modal principle coordinate responses have little difference between the cases with variable seabed and constant water depth no variable seabed which shown in fig 15 b d the seabed near island is at the stern of the vlfs when the wave propagates from the bow to the stern the diffraction and radiation effect of seabed has little influence on the hydroelastic response in fact the wave always comes from the outer field towards the island so the wave angle is mainly between 0 and 45 for the vlfs if the mid ship of the vlfs is placed above the variable seabed the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs may be affected more obviously the vertical elastic deflection of the vlfs may be considerable and the vertical deflection amplitude of the vlfs at the center of the upper deck and along x direction are shown in fig 16 the results of vertical deflection at the center of the upper deck for different wave directions with constant water depth are shown in fig 16 a which indicates that the maximum deflection occurs in wave direction of 60 fig 16 b and c show the comparative results for constant water depth and variable seabed with wave direction of 0 and 60 respectively for the case of 60 the difference is negligible but is apparent for 0 at around 0 5 rad s fig 16 d shows the comparatively different results between constant water depth and variable seabed for 0 wave angle which indicates that the deflection turns smaller under the influence of variable seabed for the four connectors are symmetry about x axis and y axis only the connector c1 is chosen for analysis the loadings in the connector c1 for different wave directions for constant water depth no variable seabed are shown in fig 17 a c which indicates that the peaks of the response transfer function of f x and f y both are corresponding to 80 wave angle and the peak of the response transfer function of f z is corresponding to 60 wave angle the connector loadings for the wave direction 80 considering the variable seabed effect are compared in fig 17 d and e and the force in y direction ignored as it is the smallest the results reflect that the seabed has little influence on the loadings in x and z directions but there are some differences on the loading in z direction during 0 wave angle which is shown in fig 17 f the significant values of the connector forces in x y z directions in constant water depth of 40 m are calculated by combining the experiment wave spectrum data in fig 7 b which are shown in table 6 the maximum values of f x and f y among different wave angles are 5 53 10 8 n and 9 44 10 7 n respectively both occurring at wave angle of 80 and the maximum value of f z among different wave angles is 8 78 10 8 n occurring at 60 wave angle the similar principles were obtained by the reference riggs et al 2000 which has concluded that the maximum value of f x occurs in wave angle of 85 for mob of five modules the significant values of the vertical deflection at the center point of the upper deck are shown in table 7 which indicates that the maximum value occurs in wave angle of 60 the complicated seabed profile has apparent influence on the deflection responses of the vlfs for head sea 0 wave direction and 85 wave direction 5 conclusions for investigating the hydroelastic responses of a vlfs in the complicated geographic and wave environment near shore or islands there are three different scale model used in the numerical calculation including mega scale middle scale and local scale the wave parameters are obtained gradually by these three models and the numerical results are compared with the on site measurement near islands furthermore the mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity is established considering the variable complicated seabed then the response principles of structural deflection and connector loads are investigated some important conclusions are as follows 1 the waves generated by no 15 typhoon are assessed by the numerical software swan using mega scale model have good agreements with the on site measurement data and the maximum discrepancy is less than 30 for the design life of the vlfs is 100 years the extreme wave height and period at the open sea of vlfs with period 100 years are obtained from the numerical simulations 2 the wave propagation and wave parameters are calculated by the numerical software ww3 using middle scale model the numerical results have a certain difference with the model test data especially the wave spectrum in model test have double peaks in shallow water but there is one peak in the numerical results so it s suggested that the experimental results of wave height period and spectrum are used for the response prediction of vlfs in the local model 3 the numerical motion results of a small semi submersible platform using coupled model and the equations proposed in the paper both the numerical results and data of model test show the variable seabed have large effect on the response of floating structures especially for large periods and the method proposed in the paper can produce results consistent with the experiment 4 the complicated seabed profile has a certain influence on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs including the vertical deflection responses connector loadings especially for head sea the maximum value of the connector force in x direction occurs in wave angle of 80 the maximum value of vertical deflection occurs in wave angle of 60 acknowledgment the study is supported by the national basic research program of china no 2013cb036100 
22734,during the very large floating structure vlfs is deployed not far from the shore line or near the island the ocean waves and hydroelastic responses of vlfs could be greatly influenced by the complicated geographic environment particularly for the depth varying seabed firstly the extreme wave parameters of different recurrence periods at the deployed location are solved by the numerical simulations of wave evolution and propagation in an archipelagic water field using the third generation wave model the numerical results are compared with the data from the on site measurement and model test in a shallow water wave basin secondly one hydroelastic numerical coupled model of the floating structure responding to the waves in shallow water with a specified seabed profile is proposed and validated by comparing with the model test results finally based on the above model the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in the waves influenced by complicated geographic environment are obtained it is concluded that the wave statistics experiences obviously changes when propagating and approaching towards the island meanwhile the complicated seabed profile has an apparent influence on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs keywords vlfs fluid structure interaction hydroelasticity complicated geographic environment shallow water wave 1 introduction in the past twenty five years extensive investigations have been carried out on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in deep open seas in usa japan and china wu et al 1993 ertekin et al 1993 kashiwagi 1999 when a vlfs is located not far from the shore line or near islands and reefs the seabed profile is usually complicated and the water depth may change from hundreds of meters to a few meters within a short distance under this circumstance it will cause complicated geographic environment especially for the waves they are always accompanied by refraction diffraction reflection shoaling breaking and etc therefore the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs are quite different from those in the open seas with even seabed to obtain the characteristics of wave evolution principles and the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs near islands and reefs three categories of wave models including mega scale middle scale and local scale models seeing table 1 are proposed to analyze the wave parameters with different resolution tian et al 2014 however it should be noted that their definitions are not so strict particularly for the mega scale and middle scale models 1 mega scale model is based on the wave spectral action density balance equation software packages such as swan and ww3 wave watch iii can deal with wave growth and propagation in several hundreds of kilometers zone for examples northern south china sea jiang et al 2010 and the gulf of mexico fang et al 2009 2 middle scale model is based on one of these equations i e mild slope equation berkhoff 1972 boussinesq equation madsen et al 1991 and green naghdi equation zhao 2010 and can be employed to simulate the wave refraction diffraction and dispersion characteristics near shore or islands 3 local scale model including viscous models and potential solvers which can describe the details of wave disturbances around the floating structures the viscous solver software includes ansys fluent etc the potential solver software includes wamit aqwa etc in the local scale model the effects of seabed profile on the responses of the floating structures have to be taken into account in recent years some different methods were studied by including the variable sea bottom such as finite difference method fdm sun et al 2003 fast multipole method fmm utsunomiya 2001 finite element method fem kyoung 2005 eigen function expansion method eem sturova 2008 a coupled mode model and theory belibassakis and athanassoulis 2005 and boundary element methods bem belibassakis 2008 etc it is found that for both ships moored to the seabed ferreria 2009 and vlfs located at the mouth of the river utsunomiya et al 2008 vlfs located near islands with one module and 8 module ding et al 2017 2019 so the hydroelastic responses have be greatly influenced by the depth varying seabed generally speaking the wave loads and hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in complicated geographic environment are still worthy of investigation up to now including connector loads and structural deflection etc meanwhile the hydroelastic responses principles of vlfs at extreme wave condition and wave spectrum near islands and reefs have not yet fully studied which are particularly concerned in engineering application in the present paper the three models are adopted considering the influence by complicated geographic environment including mega scale model middle scale model and local scale model the extreme wave parameters in 100 year recurrence period are obtained by numerical simulation using swan with mega scale mode meanwhile the numerical results are validated by on site measurement data then the numerical simulation using ww3 with middle scale are carried out and validated by model test the wave parameters and wave spectrum near vlfs are obtained by model test in wave basin finally the hydroelastic responses of a 3 module vlfs are studied using potential theory with local scale model the hydroelastic theory of coupled model between floating structures and seabed are proposed the structural deflection and connector loads of vlfs are investigated using the coupled model with local scale model 2 waves influenced by complicated geographic environment in order to obtain the extreme wave parameters including significant wave height wave period wave spectrum at the position of the vlfs deployment the on site wave measurement model experiment and the numerical wave models of different zone scales are applied comprehensively the sketch of different wave model s zones is shown in fig 1 in addition it can be seen that the floating structure is deployed to the northwest of island c 2 1 the on site wave measurement great progress has been achieved in wave model theories in the past decades however acquiring the wave statistical data by on site measurement of the waves is still one of the most effective methods in addition the measurement data can also be utilized for the validation of the numerical wave models two sets of buoys including waverider 1 p 1 and waverider 2 p 2 were deployed near the islands in june 2014 the layout of the two long term measurement instruments is shown in fig 2 and each red point represents the position of a buoy each buoy could measure wave parameters the buoy is international generic device which obtains the wave height by integrating the acceleration generally it s assumed that the data from waverider 1 can represent the waves parameters near island inside the lagoon and the data from waverider 2 approximately represents the waves from the open sea the characteristics of wave height variation from open sea to the border near the island in the lagoon can be evaluated by analyzing the measurement data from waverider 1 and waverider 2 the wave height variation may be defined by wave height ratio the results of the wave height ratio from june 2014 to feb 2015 will be discussed later 2 2 mega scale wave simulation in the zone of mega scale wave model the evolution and propagation from the open sea of waves approaching the middle scale zone or the islands are simulated by using a third generation numerical wave model based on action density balance equation which can be expressed in cartesian coordinate as 1 t n x c x n y c y n σ c σ n θ c θ n s σ where the action density n σ θ denotes conserved during the wave propagation c x c y c σ and c θ represent the propagation velocity of action density in the x and y directions frequency space and direction space respectively s on the right hand side denotes a source sink term that can be expressed as s s w i n d s d s s n l the terms on the right hand side denote wave growth by the wind wave decay due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking and nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions respectively swan is an open source program based on the above wave model which is applied in the mega scale wave simulation taking into account wave shoaling refraction diffraction bottom friction depth induced wave breaking white capping and wave growth by the wind etc at first the waves generated by no 15 typhoon in 2014 named kalmaegi passing by the islands and reefs are simulated the calculation domain contained the range influenced by the typhoon its longitude varied from 106 to 117 and its latitude varied from 12 1 to 23 5 triangle grid was applied the element number is 33577 and node number is 42445 the space resolution of the wind input data is 0 1 interval along the longitude and latitude direction and the time resolution is 1 h from 0 00 in sep 14th 2014 to 23 00 in sep 21st 2014 the significant wave heights at p 1 are calculated from 16 00 in sep 15th 2014 to 22 00 in sep 21st 2014 during the period the typhoon kalmaegi passed by is at the east to the islands far away from several hundreds of kilometers the numerical results are compared with the on site measurement results which are shown in fig 3 a general agreement is achieved and the maximum discrepancy is less than 30 it shows that the swan model is suitable to simulate the behavior of wave strengthening and weakening in the lagoon during the passage of the typhoon on the other side fig 3 b presents the distribution of significant wave height at 4 00 in sep 16th 2014 which corresponds to the maximum value of h s significant wave height when the typhoon passing by the lagoon it shows the typical of characteristics that the strength of wave in the lagoon is smaller than that outside the lagoon secondly the wave evolution and propagation from the open sea to the lagoon are simulated taking into account different wave directions and recurrence periods including 100 years 50 years 25 years 10 years and 2 years the main characteristics of wave height decay due to the existence of islands and reefs can be obtained by numerical simulation the simulated wave height ratio is defined by h s p 1 h s open sea where h s p 1 and h s open sea denote the calculated wave height at p 1 and the open sea respectively the numerical results are with 2 year recurrence period since the on site measurement time is only one year the comparisons of the wave height ratio between numerical results and those from on site measurement are shown in fig 4 a it can be seen that the wave height ratios are small in the north and east wind directions because the sheltering effect of the island are playing an important role on the contrary the ratio in the northwest wind direction is comparatively higher than the other directions generally the tendency of the calculated wave height ratios looks reasonable thirdly if the design life of the vlfs is 100 years the extreme wave parameters at the location of interest can be obtained from the numerical simulations fig 4 b presents the contour of the significant wave height simulated with 100 year recurrence period in nw direction with the wave height from nw direction at open sea is 11 19 m and the spectrum peak period t p 11 6s it is assumed that the location q shown in figs 4 b and fig 5 a with the water depth about 30 m represents the location of wave maker water depth 28 8 m in the middle scale model test shown in fig 5 b d the calculated wave height at q is 4 35 m considering a 50 averaged safety margin factor the maximum irregular wave height at q can be conservatively estimated as h s max 4 35m 1 5 6 52 m the spectrum peak period t p is still 11 6s based on linear assumption therefore the extreme wave condition for the middle scale model experiment is determined 2 3 middle scale wave simulation and model experiment the model test is carried out to obtain the wave evolution characteristics of middle scale the selected sea area near islands is shown in fig 5 with the length of 1080 m and width of 522 m along nw direction the seabed profile is built in the tank with the scale ratio 1 36 the wave heights are measured at different locations from w1 to w18 at present the wave propagating characteristics are simulated based on ww3 wave model ww3 model is a third generation wave model developed at noaa ncep it is based on wave spectral action density balance equation that is the same to swan model however the precision with the rectangular grid in ww3 is higher than that in swan model for the area with finite water depth ww3 is suitable the calculation domain covers the selected area and the rectangular grid is applied the grid size is 2 m therefore the number along length is 540 and that along width is 261 to validate the numerical model and obtain the extreme wave parameters and spectrum near the vlfs two model test conditions including a regular and an irregular wave cases are discussed in the paper for the regular wave condition h 1 74 m t 12 0s the comparison of wave heights between the numerical result and experimental data along different directions sec 1 and sec 2 is presented in fig 6 it can be seen that general agreement has been achieved particularly for the deep water depth area however the discrepancy at shallow water areas is comparatively bigger but less than 23 for the extreme irregular wave conditions the incident wave from open sea is using jonswap spectrum the corresponding significant wave height h s 6 52 m spectrum peak period t p 11 6s the numerical results and experiments data at different locations are shown in fig 7 a it s concluded that 1 the numerical results agree well with the measurement data in the deep water zone 2 major differences appear in shallow water zone the reasons may be that the complicated seabed effects can note be simulated accurately in the present numerical model the results comparison of wave energy spectrum at target location are shown in fig 7 b it can be seen that the experimental wave spectrum shows two peak ranges which are quite different from jonswap spectrum which is commonly used to describe the encountered wave condition of traditional ocean going ship or a marine platform in deep open sea hereafter the measured wave spectrum will be employed to calculate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs near islands 3 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity and result validation 3 1 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity 1 basic assumption and the decomposition of velocity potential the fluid around the elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous non rotating during studying the interaction between floating structure and wave meanwhile not considering the effects of lift force and

in shallow water influenced by complicated geographic environment this will require a large number of panels to discretize the hull and the sea bottom which means that the influence coefficients will form a large densely populated asymmetric complex matrix moreover the high numbers of wave frequencies and elastic modes will consume huge computation time one solution to this problem is to adopt the parallel computing method to enhance the efficiency of the hydroelasticity analysis program the parallelization can be carried out at different levels of the data structure and the execution of the computer program such as the wet surface panels wave frequencies etc on these bases the advanced thread level parallelization can be achieved and the parallelization efficiency and the overall computing efficiency can be improved more detailed discussions on this can be seen in the reference ye et al 2015 the parallelization procedure for this specific work is shown in fig 8 3 4 the numerical validation for validating the above theories and numerical methods a rigid semi submersible floating platform was selected for the model tests which carried out at the same time with the model test in chapter 2 3 in which they have used same topographic data and the variable seabed is built in the wave tanker the local water depth of mooring zone of the floating platform is 10 m and the water depth out of the variable seabed is 35 6 m the incident wave is from the open sea and the four sides of the variable seabed built in the model test and the numerical model is under still water surface with 35 6 m in general most researchers use constant water depth for hydrodynamic performance calculation or hydroelastic response assessment according to this way for the local water depth of floating structures is 10 m so the parameters of water depth should choose 10 m in numerical calculation in the chapter 2 it s concluded the wave has been affected obviously by the variable seabed and it is unscientific to use uniform depth assessing model for this reason there are two calculating sets have been chosen one is coupled model shown in fig 9 b the seabed is flat with water depth 35 6 out of the region of the variable seabed which is not shown in the figure for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green theorem so it not need to divide panel on the flat seabed part the other is with constant water depth 10 m no variable seabed is taken in the latter sets the main parameters of the floating platform are shown in table 2 the tanker model test is at a selected scale of 1 36 the length of the model is 1 389 m the coupled numerical hydrodynamic model of the platform and seabed is shown in fig 9 the origin of a cartesian coordinate system is located at the free surface with the x axis along the brace and z positive upwards as shown in fig 9 the panel numbers of the floating platform and variable seabed are 1992 and 11908 respectively and the panel number of the whole coupled model is 13900 the motion response transfer functions of the floating platform in the model test coupled model and numerical model with a constant water depth of 10 m are shown in fig 10 it s concluded that the results are consistent when the wave period is less than 13s and the results from the coupled model are closer to the model test results when the period is larger than 15s which is consistent to the physical phenomena of wave evolution for the seabed has more obvious effect on long waves fig 10 a shows that the measured sway motion of the structure fluctuates at periods close to 13s the coupled model has a similar phenomenon but the curve is very smooth for the case of constant water depth this suggests that the effect of complex three dimensional shallow seabed needs to be considered in the calculation of structure response using the coupled model especially for large periods and the method proposed in the paper can produce results consistent with the experiment 4 hydroelastic responses in complicated geographic environment 4 1 vlfs model a three module semi submersible vlfs is studied in the paper the single module with the length of 300 m is connected by articulated flexible connectors in the flexible module and flexible connector fmfc model no rotational stiffness is included hence the connector s stiffness is characterized by the stiffness in the three directions k x 2 10 9 n m k y 1 10 9 n m and k z 2 10 9 n m two connectors at the deck level are used to join adjacent modules there are four connectors c1 c2 c3 c4 among the three modules they are located at y 29 m and z 24 m the configuration of the three module vlfs which is symmetric about x axis shown in fig 11 and the main characteristics of the vlfs are shown in table 3 a combination of quadrilateral and triangular panels is used to model the wetted surface there are a total of 5652 elements on the other side the structure s finite element model contains 192367 elements including 91929 shell elements and 100438 beam elements the hydrodynamic panel model and the structure s finite element model of the vlfs are shown in fig 12 4 2 elastic modal analysis results the hydroelastic responses and its natural frequencies are obtained by using the mode superposition method there are two rigid modes and five flexible modes for the three module vlfs as shown in fig 13 the added mass of the structure in fluid could change the natural frequencies of the structure in vacuum the resonant frequencies of all modes shown in table 4 could be calculated by eq 12 the results have shown that the resonant frequency is smaller than the natural frequency for the existence of added mass the resonant frequency which plays an important role in wave induced response is harmful to the motion of the structure generally speaking the resonant frequency will skew the region of high wave energy when we design the floating structure through three dimensional hydroelasticity software thafts wu 1984 the resonant frequency can be determined the resonant frequency of vlfs under different modes has been shown in table 4 at the same time load coefficients of connector under different flexible modes have been given in table 5 4 3 coupled model of vlfs and seabed when the vlfs is placed near an island its bow or stern may come to contact with the seabed and the complex seabed profile can influence the hydrodynamic properties and hydroelastic response of the vlfs in order to investigate the effects of the seabed profile a coupled model of the vlfs and seabed was built the seabed as shown in fig 14 a is all below the still water line with the lowest point 36 m under water and the highest point h1 7 9 m under water the length and breadth of the seabed are 250 m and 200 m and the panel number in the hydrodynamic model of the seabed is 10648 a part from the seabed profile with variable depth as defined the water depths at other locations are assumed to be constant at 40 m there are two calculating sets have been chosen one is coupled model the seabed is flat with water depth 40 m out of the region of the variable seabed which is not fully shown in fig 14 b for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green theorem so it not need to divide panels on the flat seabed part the other is with constant water depth 40 m no variable seabed is taken in the latter sets the incident wave direction is shown in fig 14 c 4 4 analysis of results the hydroelastic modal principle coordinate responses of the vlfs considering seabed as shown in fig 15 are different from that in constant water depth because the two mode shapes of p 9 and p 10 are anti symmetric about x axis the modal principle coordinate responses are zero for p 9 p 10 with 0 wave angle in the constant water depth case but with the asymmetric seabed included these responses become non zero shown in fig 15 a and c moreover the modal principle coordinate responses have little difference between the cases with variable seabed and constant water depth no variable seabed which shown in fig 15 b d the seabed near island is at the stern of the vlfs when the wave propagates from the bow to the stern the diffraction and radiation effect of seabed has little influence on the hydroelastic response in fact the wave always comes from the outer field towards the island so the wave angle is mainly between 0 and 45 for the vlfs if the mid ship of the vlfs is placed above the variable seabed the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs may be affected more obviously the vertical elastic deflection of the vlfs may be considerable and the vertical deflection amplitude of the vlfs at the center of the upper deck and along x direction are shown in fig 16 the results of vertical deflection at the center of the upper deck for different wave directions with constant water depth are shown in fig 16 a which indicates that the maximum deflection occurs in wave direction of 60 fig 16 b and c show the comparative results for constant water depth and variable seabed with wave direction of 0 and 60 respectively for the case of 60 the difference is negligible but is apparent for 0 at around 0 5 rad s fig 16 d shows the comparatively different results between constant water depth and variable seabed for 0 wave angle which indicates that the deflection turns smaller under the influence of variable seabed for the four connectors are symmetry about x axis and y axis only the connector c1 is chosen for analysis the loadings in the connector c1 for different wave directions for constant water depth no variable seabed are shown in fig 17 a c which indicates that the peaks of the response transfer function of f x and f y both are corresponding to 80 wave angle and the peak of the response transfer function of f z is corresponding to 60 wave angle the connector loadings for the wave direction 80 considering the variable seabed effect are compared in fig 17 d and e and the force in y direction ignored as it is the smallest the results reflect that the seabed has little influence on the loadings in x and z directions but there are some differences on the loading in z direction during 0 wave angle which is shown in fig 17 f the significant values of the connector forces in x y z directions in constant water depth of 40 m are calculated by combining the experiment wave spectrum data in fig 7 b which are shown in table 6 the maximum values of f x and f y among different wave angles are 5 53 10 8 n and 9 44 10 7 n respectively both occurring at wave angle of 80 and the maximum value of f z among different wave angles is 8 78 10 8 n occurring at 60 wave angle the similar principles were obtained by the reference riggs et al 2000 which has concluded that the maximum value of f x occurs in wave angle of 85 for mob of five modules the significant values of the vertical deflection at the center point of the upper deck are shown in table 7 which indicates that the maximum value occurs in wave angle of 60 the complicated seabed profile has apparent influence on the deflection responses of the vlfs for head sea 0 wave direction and 85 wave direction 5 conclusions for investigating the hydroelastic responses of a vlfs in the complicated geographic and wave environment near shore or islands there are three different scale model used in the numerical calculation including mega scale middle scale and local scale the wave parameters are obtained gradually by these three models and the numerical results are compared with the on site measurement near islands furthermore the mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity is established considering the variable complicated seabed then the response principles of structural deflection and connector loads are investigated some important conclusions are as follows 1 the waves generated by no 15 typhoon are assessed by the numerical software swan using mega scale model have good agreements with the on site measurement data and the maximum discrepancy is less than 30 for the design life of the vlfs is 100 years the extreme wave height and period at the open sea of vlfs with period 100 years are obtained from the numerical simulations 2 the wave propagation and wave parameters are calculated by the numerical software ww3 using middle scale model the numerical results have a certain difference with the model test data especially the wave spectrum in model test have double peaks in shallow water but there is one peak in the numerical results so it s suggested that the experimental results of wave height period and spectrum are used for the response prediction of vlfs in the local model 3 the numerical motion results of a small semi submersible platform using coupled model and the equations proposed in the paper both the numerical results and data of model test show the variable seabed have large effect on the response of floating structures especially for large periods and the method proposed in the paper can produce results consistent with the experiment 4 the complicated seabed profile has a certain influence on the hydroelastic responses of the vlfs including the vertical deflection responses connector loadings especially for head sea the maximum value of the connector force in x direction occurs in wave angle of 80 the maximum value of vertical deflection occurs in wave angle of 60 acknowledgment the study is supported by the national basic research program of china no 2013cb036100
