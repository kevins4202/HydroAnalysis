17535,the presence of antibiotics can exert significant selection pressure on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb however co selection effects for args the mobility of args and the identification of arg hosts under high antibiotic selection pressures are poorly understood here metagenomic assembly and binning approaches were used to comprehensively decipher the prevalence of args and their potential mobility and hosts in activated sludge reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater we found the abundance of different arg types in antibiotic treatments varied greatly and certain antibiotic pressure promoted the co selection for the non corresponding types of args antibiotic selection pressures significantly increased the abundance and proportions of args mediated by plasmids 57 9 which were more prevalent than those encoded in chromosomes 19 2 the results indicated that plasmids and chromosomes had a tendency to carry different types of args moreover higher co occurrence frequency of args and mges revealed that antibiotics enhanced the mobility potential of args mediated by both plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements among the 689 metagenome assembled genomes mags with high estimated quality 119 mags assigning to nine bacterial phyla were identified as the arg hosts and 33 mags exhibited possible multi resistance to antibiotics some arg types tended to be carried by certain bacteria e g bacitracin resistance genes carried by the family burkholderiaceae and thus showed a pronounced host specific pattern this study enhances the understanding of the mobility and hosts of args and provides important insights into the risk assessment and management of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic selection pressure antibiotic resistance genes mobility bacterial hosts metagenomic assembly binning 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a growing global health threat and the development rate of resistance is much faster than the rate of invention and discovery of new antibiotics lewis 2013 global antibiotic consumption increased by 65 between 2000 and 2015 klein et al 2018 and the consumption in animals is about threefold that of humans van boeckel et al 2019 the production and overuse of antibiotics increased their concentrations in both clinical and non clinical environments especially including antibiotic manufacturing sites hospitals livestock farming and aquaculture systems rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 thai et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 elevated levels of antibiotics in an environment can drive a selection pressure contributing to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb wellington et al 2013 args are often located on mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids integrative and conjugative elements ices transposons and integrons which are able to move within or between dna molecules and transfer between bacterial cells partridge et al 2018 these mges play a vital role in facilitating horizontal gene transfer hgt of args and thus promote the development of multi antibiotic resistance and bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection pressure gillings 2017 partridge et al 2018 consequently to better understand and control the dissemination of args in the environment with high concentrations of antibiotics the args associated with mges must be elucidated furthermore the hgt of args between different bacteria may contribute to the changes in bacterial hosts of args jia et al 2019 and subsequently affects the dynamic changes of resistome induced by antibiotic selection pressures this promotes the emergence and spread of pathogenic arb which pose genuine threats to human health baker et al 2018 thus it is critical to identify the hosts of args under antibiotic selection pressure for the risk assessment and control of antibiotic resistance traditionally efforts to investigate the mobility of args in the presence of antibiotics have been mainly focused on the culture based isolation of specific pathogenic bacteria leungtongkam et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the conjugative transfer of args carried by plasmids or ices between bacterial species has been well characterized by combining with dna sequencing genome wide rna sequencing or proteomic analysis brophy et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however owing to low proportions of culturable microorganisms and time consuming process manaia et al 2018 culture dependent methods preclude insights into the occurrence of args and the associated mges in complex microbial communities the development of metagenomics has made it possible to profile the entire community structure and characterize individual microbes without isolation chng et al 2020 therefore the metagenomic approaches provide a more comprehensive view of args in the environment and draw insights about the mobility and host association of args che et al 2019 kanger et al 2020 most previous metagenomic studies based on short reads have identified and quantified the diversity and abundance of args with little emphasis on the specific co existence structures between args and mges and on separating their genetic locations including plasmids and chromosomes li et al 2015a fresia et al 2019 notably as important mges for the spread of args wozniak and waldor 2010 the occurrence and mobility of ices in the recovered draft genomes from the environments under antibiotic selection pressures remain poorly understood additionally with growing multi antibiotic resistance the specific combination of args harbored in bacteria is of great concern from a clinical perspective chng et al 2020 although many studies using network analysis and metagenomic assembly have revealed the co existence patterns of args in different environments ma et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 chen et al 2019a little is known about the diversity of arg combinations co selection effects for resistance under antibiotic pressures and how antibiotics affecting the dynamics and genetic locations of args in previous studies correlation and network analyses have been used to identify the possible hosts of args xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the obtained host association information is limited and may have uncertain biases including both false positive and false negative results recently several studies used metagenomic assembly and binning methods to identify the hosts of args in clinical and natural settings ma et al 2016 jia et al 2019 kanger et al 2020 revealing new insights into the linkage of antibiotic resistance and microbial community strategies for recovering genomes from samples have been regarded as important complements to traditional microbiological techniques and provided access to the uncultured microbial diversity expanding the tree of life alneberg et al 2018 nayfach et al 2019 therefore metagenomic binning will enable a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and provide important insights into the mobilization of args under high antibiotic selection pressures in this study we used metagenomic assembly and binning methods to decipher and compare the prevalence of args and their potential mobility and hosts in activated sludge as reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater specifically the objectives were 1 to reveal the co selection effects of different antibiotics on antibiotic resistance by investigating the dynamics of co existence between args 2 to evaluate the potential mobility of args by identifying the genetic location patterns of args and mges and 3 to explore the host association of args by recovering large scale metagenome assembled genomes mags from as samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and metagenomic sequencing detailed information about batch experiments reactor operation process and sample preparation for dna extraction has been described in our previous study zhao et al 2019 in brief five antibiotics sigma aldrich usa i e cephalexin cel chloramphenicol chl kanamycin kan sulfamethazine smz and tetracycline tet belonging to five classes table s1 were selected as the targets to exert a selective pressure on microbial community seed activated sludge sas collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant was initially used as the inoculum 50 ml in each reactor to simulate as process for treating antibiotic production wastewater the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel for each antibiotic treatment with a working volume of 500 ml and a control treatment ck without antibiotic addition was performed simultaneously the concentrations of each antibiotic were step wise increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level table s2 according to their removal behaviors through successive stages the mixed liquor sample of 10 ml was taken before moving into the next stage from each reactor for dna extraction two sas and 36 as samples from stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 were selected for metagenomic sequencing zhao et al 2019 table s2 the reasons for selecting the three stages were summarized in text s1 dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna library was constructed using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa with an insert size of 350 bp and then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform with paired end pe 150 bp strategy at novogene tianjin china all the metagenomic sequencing data are available at ncbi bioproject database with the accession numbers of prjna634463 2 2 metagenomic assembly and identification of arg carrying contigs metagenomic sequencing of the 38 samples generated approximately 671 5 gb and 2245 million pe reads raw metagenomic reads were evaluated with fastqc v 0 11 6 the low quality sequences were removed and adaptors were trimmed using trimmomatic v 0 32 bolger et al 2014 to ensure a minimum quality score of 20 quality controlled reads from each sample were then assembled individually into contigs using megahit v 1 1 1 li et al 2015b with the following parameters k min 61 min contig len 1000 quality of assemblies was evaluated using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal v 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 the predicted orfs were identified as arg like orfs by searching nucleotide sequences against the structured arg sarg database v 2 0 yin et al 2018 using blastx with an e value 10 10 asimilarity 80 and a query coverage 70 ma et al 2016 the abundance coverage gb of arg like orfs in each sample was calculated as follows ma et al 2016 abundance coverage g b 1 n n mapped reads l reads l arg like orf s where nmapped reads is the number of the reads mapped to arg like orfs lreads is the sequence length of the illumina reads larg like orf is the sequence length of target arg like orfs n is the number of the arg like orfs belonging to the same arg type and s is the size of the data set gb the orfs on arg carrying contigs accs were annotated against the ncbi non redundant nr protein database retrieved 21 may 2018 using blastp with an e value 10 5 with an identity and query coverage threshold of 80 and 70 respectively ma et al 2016 the mges located on accs were identified according to the results of nr annotation annotations were categorized as mges based on string matches to one of the following keywords transposase transposon conjugative integrase integron recombinase conjugal mobilization recombination plasmid resolvase relaxase and invertase forsberg et al 2014 sáenz et al 2019 finally all orf annotations and orf arrangements on accs were obtained plasflow v 1 1 with default parameters was used to predict plasmid and chromosomal sequences from accs krawczyk et al 2018 according to whether they code the four components the origin of transfer orit relaxase the type iv coupling proteins t4cp and the type iv secretion system t4ss the mobility of plasmids can be classified into three categories conjugative mobilizable and non mobilizable smillie et al 2010 thus the potential mobility of args carried by plasmids was identified based on the above categories 2 3 metagenomic binning and quality control of mags following assembly the quality controlled reads from each sample were mapped to the assembled contigs using bowtie2 v 2 3 4 2 to generate a coverage score for individual contigs langmead and salzberg 2012 then the mags were recovered from each sample independently using three different tools with default options metabat2 v 2 12 1 kang et al 2015 maxbin v 2 2 4 wu et al 2016 and concoct v 0 9 0 alneberg et al 2014 thus a total of 1841 mags were recovered from the 38 samples table s3 the quality of all mags was assessed using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 the completeness and contamination of the mags were estimated using checkm v 1 0 7 with lineage specific markers genes and default parameters parks et al 2015 the merge method of checkm v1 0 7 was used to identify pairs of mags and to avoid producing chimaeric mags according to the criteria proposed by parks et al 2017 refinem v 0 0 22 was used to improve the completeness and reduce the contamination of a mag by identifying and filtering contigs with divergent genomic properties incongruent taxonomic classification and incongruent 16s rrna genes parks et al 2017 only mags with an estimated quality 50 defined as completeness 5 contamination were retained for pairwise dereplication comparison parks et al 2017 for each treatment the amino acid identity aai between genomes were determined using comparem v 0 0 23 with default parameters parks et al 2017 mags were considered as belonging to the same species with an aai 99 5 parks et al 2017 and only the mags from each cluster with the highest estimated quality were retained finally 689 dereplicated mags were obtained and used for the downstream analysis table s3 2 4 taxonomic assignment relative abundance calculation and functional annotation of mags taxonomic assignment of 689 obtained mags was performed and standardized taxonomic labels were produced using the software toolkit gtdb tk v 0 3 0 based on the genome taxonomy database with default parameters parks et al 2018 the quality controlled reads from each sample were mapped against each genome bin fasta file recovered from the samples using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 then based on the obtained mapping sam files the script calculate breadth py provided by olm et al 2017 was used to calculate the average coverage of each genome bin thus the relative abundance of each mag was calculated as the number of reads based on average coverage aligning to the mag normalized by the total number of reads in the sample pasolli et al 2019 the args carried by mags were identified using blastx against sarg database v 2 0 yin et al 2018 with an e value cutoff of 10 10 80 similarity and 70 query coverage to further estimate the transferability of args the ices integrative and mobilizable elements imes in the arg carrying mags were predicted by icefinder online tool with the default parameters liu et al 2019a those elements carrying integrase relaxase and t4ss gene clusters were considered as t4ss type ices while those without t4ss but with integrase and relaxase were identified as imes liu et al 2019a 2 5 statistical analysis the normality of data was evaluated before statistical analysis normally distributed data were analyzed using student s t test while non normally distributed data were analyzed using the nonparametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and the two sided wilcoxon rank sum test statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 20 spss chicago il usa a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 diversity and co selection of args revealed by metagenomic assembly the detailed information of 38 metagenomic datasets and the quality assessment results of assemblies were summarized in table s4 and described in text s2 a total of 2830 predicted orfs were annotated as arg like sequences and carried by 1681 contigs in the 38 samples table s5 the 2830 arg like orfs were assigned to 228 arg subtypes belonging to 15 arg types and eight types were shared by all samples fig 1 a the total arg abundance of the samples varied greatly with a range from 25 1 to 1839 1 gb fig s1a among these samples the top five most abundant arg types including tetracycline multidrug aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and sulfonamide resistance genes accounted for 50 2 99 5 of the total arg abundance fig 1a and fig s1b the kruskal wallis rank sum test indicated that the total arg abundance was significantly different among these treatments p 7 40e 05 and the arg abundance in antibiotic treatments except for smz treatment was much higher than that in control treatment p 0 03 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 1b moreover the composition of dominant arg types in different antibiotic treatments exhibited a clear difference for example the top three dominant types in cel treatment were multidrug aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes while the most abundant args were the types of chloramphenicol tetracycline and sulfonamide under smz selection pressure fig s2 except for the corresponding type of args the non corresponding types also accounted for a high abundance under a certain antibiotic selection pressure revealing the co selection effect of antibiotics specifically cel and kan tended to co select mainly multidrug resistance genes while chl and smz mostly promoted the co selection of tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance genes respectively fig s2 3 2 higher proportion of args is located on plasmids than chromosomes under antibiotic selection pressures for all samples on average 57 9 19 2 and 22 9 of the accs were classified as plasmid chromosomal and unclassified sequences respectively fig s3a generally all treatments had a much higher proportion of plasmid contigs than chromosomal contigs with args p 0 05 student s t test fig 2 a demonstrating the widespread occurrence of args on plasmids and their potential for hgt compared with the control treatment the presence of antibiotics except for cel in wastewater exhibited a significant increase in the proportion of accs located on plasmids p 0 05 student s t test and smz selective pressure resulted in the highest proportions with an average of 71 7 fig 2a furthermore the abundance of args located on plasmids accounting for an average of 68 2 of the total arg abundance was markedly higher than that on chromosomes across all samples p 1 74e 08 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s3b notably in terms of the number of args the genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside 80 4 beta lactam 71 7 bleomycin 86 4 chloramphenicol 79 3 sulfonamide 64 6 tetracycline 76 4 trimethoprim 84 6 and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 47 1 were more prevalent in plasmids while the arg types of bacitracin 69 5 multidrug 42 8 and vancomycin 92 9 were more frequently encoded in chromosomes fig 2b these results indicated that plasmids and chromosomes had different propensities to carry args and some arg types tended to be located on plasmids 3 3 antibiotic selection pressures increase the occurrence frequency and diversity of arg combinations as shown in fig s4a and table s6 the proportion of the detected accs carried only one arg ranged from 23 5 to 89 2 in different samples and these args were composed of 14 arg types in addition an average of 43 0 contigs with at least two args were detected across all samples and the args formed co occurring combinations fig s4a and table s7 the average proportions of accs carrying at least two args were significantly increased by the selection pressures of cel chl and kan compared to the control treatment p 0 03 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s4b the presence of antibiotics also increased the diversity of arg combinations including contiguous and discontiguous args belonging to various types on the one hand a set of arg combinations were dominated by a single arg type primarily including multidrug tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes and some of them were shared by different treatments table s7 for example aminoglycoside resistance genes stra and strb were found contiguously and stably co occurring in the plasmids from all samples table s7 the typical co occurrence patterns such as args encoding multidrug efflux systems e g hydrophobe amphiphile efflux 1 oprj mdta mdtb mdtc as well as tetracycline efflux pumps e g teta tetg tet33 tetz etc and the efflux regulatory gene tetr were also widely distributed in different treatments table s7 on the other hand some combinations were composed of args conferring resistance to different antibiotics thus the hosts harboring these genes might exhibit multi antibiotic resistance among these combinations we found a range of arg combinations shared by different treatments such as sul1 cmla sul1 flor aada cmla tetr acrr flor and sul1 small multidrug resistance efflux pump table s7 indicating the co selection effects of antibiotic pressures besides some arg combinations were only distributed in a certain antibiotic treatment for example a combination of five args conferring resistance to tetracycline tetx mls ered and ermfs aminoglycoside aadk and beta lactam blaoxa 347 was only identified in smz treatments at the concentration of 150 mg l 1 fig 3 a and table s7 moreover the changes in antibiotic types resulted in the integration of varied args into certain arg combinations and stra strb was one of the most representative combinations as illustrated in fig 3b and table s7 other args varying among different treatments were involved in stra strb cluster such as sul1 cmla in tet treatment blaaer 1 in chl treatment cmla in kan treatment and multidrug efflux genes in cel treatment these various arg combinations under different antibiotic selection pressures generally co existed with mges and were located on the plasmids 3 4 high co occurrence frequency of args and mges reveals the high mobility potential of args under antibiotic selection pressures to further evaluate the potential mobility of args the co occurrence of specific mges and args were investigated a wide range of mges were observed to co localize with args and there were 420 accs carrying mges in all samples accounting for 25 0 of all the detected accs table s5 and table s8 the abundance of the args co occurring with mges accounted for 13 9 96 7 of the total arg abundance across all samples fig 4 a the kruskal wallis test indicated that the proportions of abundance of these args varied greatly among different treatments p 0 00079 and the presence of chl kan and smz significantly increased the proportions of arg abundance compared to the control treatment p 0 045 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 4a among the 420 contigs carrying both args and mges 74 8 7 6 and 17 6 of the contigs were identified as plasmid chromosomal and unclassified sequences respectively fig 4b and table s5 the result demonstrated that the mges had a much higher occurrence frequency associated with args on plasmids than on chromosomes p 3 01e 09 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 4b many kinds of mges responsible for the hgt potentials were detected and the most frequently detected was transposase followed by integrase resolvase conjugal transfer proteins and dna invertase fig s5a and table s8 these transposases were mainly composed of is family and tn family and several kinds of integrases were also found located on the accs such as site specific integrase phage integrase and integron integrase table s8 the mges and args formed certain arg mge co existence patterns and were widely distributed in different treatments for example the arg cluster of stra and strb generally co existed with tn3 family transposase and dna invertase or resolvase on the plasmids in all treatments fig 3b fig s5b and table s8 likewise many arg mge combinations such as class a beta lactamase and dna invertase tetc together with tnpa resolvase or resolvase recombinase integrase were widely located on plasmids and variably co occurred with other genes including both args and mges table s8 a set of 66 plasmid contigs were identified carrying the conjugative or mobilizable genetic elements such as the relaxase conjugal transfer proteins plasmid mobilization relaxosome proteins table s9 the conjugative proteins on some contigs generally co occurred with some transposases or integrases for example the contig kan20 1 39883 carrying blages 2 and aac 6 ib were found associated with six transposases and several conjugative elements especially including the t4ss component of virb4 fig 4c and table s9 by classifying the args to types and subtypes 29 arg subtypes belonging to eight arg types were carried by these plasmid contigs and the three dominant types were aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance genes table s9 strikingly a few specific arg clusters co occurring with conjugal transfer proteins were observed present in different treatments and the variations of antibiotics resulted in the diverse occurrence and distribution patterns of conjugative elements and other mges located on the plasmids for example the arg combination of chloramphenicol efflux pump streptomycin resistance protein bleomycin binding protein and aph 3 in chl kan and tet treatments was found co occurring with variable conjugal transfer proteins and accessory genes fig 4c and table s9 it should be noted that the arg combinations conferring resistance to multiple antibiotic classes located on the potential conjugative or mobilizable plasmids may cause greater environmental and health risks 3 5 the recovered mags reveal the representative bacterial communities under antibiotic selection pressures a total of 1841 mags were reconstructed from all samples and 1112 mags met the filtering criteria with an estimated quality 50 after dereplication process 689 mags were retained for downstream analysis table s3 and the detailed information of the 689 mags were listed in table s10 as shown in fig 5 a a subset of 373 near complete mags were estimated to have 90 completeness and 5 contamination there were also 257 medium quality mags and 59 partial mags taxonomic identification of the 689 mags indicated that these mags were assigned to 19 bacterial phyla table s11 the total relative abundance of mags in each sample ranged from 22 9 to 69 6 which represented the bacterial community obtained by metagenomic binning method however the microbial community that could not be explained by the identified mags accounted for relatively high proportions in these samples fig 5c these recovered mags in control and antibiotic treatments had significantly higher relative abundance than that in sas p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 5b however no significant difference was observed among different treatments p 0 44 kruskal wallis rank sum test at the phylum level the four most abundant phyla across all samples were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria fig 5c there were marked differences in the relative abundance of mags assigning to the main phyla among different treatments p 0 032 kruskal wallis rank sum test fig s6 for example the mags belonging to the phylum actinobacteria in cel and smz treatments reached a higher relative abundance than those in other treatments p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 5c and fig s6d moreover some bacteria obviously enriched under antibiotic selection pressures such as proteobacteria in chl from 16 8 to 51 7 and tet from 19 0 to 32 6 treatments acidobacteria from 2 2 to 12 8 in kan treatment actinobacteria from 4 1 to 13 5 in smz treatment and bacteroidetes from 3 5 to 9 9 in cel treatment fig 5c these results showed that the composition and abundance of microbial community was highly variable and significantly affected by the presence of antibiotics 3 6 the arg hosts are diverse and exhibit a pronounced multiple resistance pattern as well as specific host association resistance pattern among the 689 recovered mags a total of 119 mags were identified carrying args table s3 these mags were assigned to nine phyla and the hosts of args mostly belonged to the phylum proteobacteria 75 mags which contained two classes gammaproteobacteria 63 mags and alphaproteobacteria 12 mags fig 6 fig s7a and table s12 in addition 113 and 64 arg carrying mags were classified to the family 30 specific families and genus 30 specific genera level respectively table s12 the relative abundance of arg carrying mags in each sample varied greatly with a range from 2 8 to 55 2 fig s7a and the average relative abundance of arg carrying mags was significantly higher under antibiotic selective pressures than that in ck treatment p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s7b as illustrated in fig 6 the 119 mags mainly carried 12 arg types and the five most frequently detected type was bacitracin tetracycline multidrug chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside moreover 38 mags were found carrying at least two args including 33 mags with multiple arg types fig 6 and table s13 for example a mag annotated as the genus thauera in kan treatment kan mag 48 harbored six args conferring resistance to sulfonamide sul1 chloramphenicol flor bacitracin undecaprenol kinase multidrug ompr2 beta lactam blages 2 and aminoglycoside aph 3 table s12 strikingly this mag had a higher relative abundance average 10 6 than other mags and contributed average 56 5 to the total relative abundance of the arg carrying mags in kan treatment fig 7 under antibiotic selection pressures some arg carrying bacteria enriched and accounted for a high proportion fig 7 particularly the family burkholderiaceae in cel treatment had the highest relative abundance of 45 0 at the concentration of 50 mg l 1 under tet selection pressure the relative abundance of this family gradually increased from 4 3 to 8 7 fig 7 in addition a mag in smz treatment smz mag 135 affiliated to the family micrococcaceae was identified as the host of cmxb and its relative abundance reached up to 14 3 at the highest concentration of 150 mg l 1 fig 7 and table s12 there were also some noteworthy families or genera identified as the hosts of args enriched with increasing antibiotic concentrations such as the family chitinophagaceae from 0 24 to 18 8 in smz treatment the genus variovorax from 0 26 to 14 4 in cel treatment the genus rudaea from 0 32 to 1 24 in tet treatment and the genera caballeronia from 1 17 to 6 71 and rhizobacter from 1 17 to 4 47 in chl treatment fig 7 among the detected arb it should be noted that some bacteria exhibited possible multi antibiotic resistance characteristics specifically four mags assigned to the family burkholderiaceae were resistant to the antibiotic types of aminoglycoside bacitracin chloramphenicol multidrug tetracycline and trimethoprim fig 6 table s12 and table s13 in addition five genera caballeronia comamonas cupriavidus ottowia and rubrivivax belonging to burkholderiaceae were also found resistant to multiple antibiotics fig 6 table s12 and table s13 in particular one mag belonging to the pathogenic genus mycobacterium in cel treatment average relative abundance 1 6 could confer multiple resistance to rifampin arr tetracycline tetv and aminoglycoside aac 2 ib fig 6 table s12 and table s13 the diverse hosts of args and the development of multiple antibiotic resistance under antibiotic selection pressures suggested that these bacteria are crucial reservoirs of args and may play a critical role in the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment in this study 36 mags belonging to the families burkholderiaceae 32 mags and rhodocyclaceae four mags were identified as the hosts of bacitracin resistance genes fig 6 and table s12 some of these mags were annotated to the genus level including alicycliphilus caballeronia ottowia variovorax comamonas cupriavidus and thauera fig 6 and table s12 notably all the detected hosts of bacitracin resistance genes were affiliated to the order betaproteobacteriales suggesting that this type of args tend to be carried by the betaproteobacteriales similarly other five mags belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae were identified as the hosts of multidrug abc transporter fig 6 and table s12 in addition we also detected several phyla tended to occur in specific treatments as the hosts of args take the phylum acidobacteria as an example of the six arg carrying mags belonging to this phylum five with an average relative abundance of 1 1 were found in smz treatment as the hosts of tet33 tetg aac 6 iia and rifampin adpribosyl transferase arr respectively fig 6 fig 7 and table s12 furthermore some args were detected only to be carried by specific bacteria even under different antibiotic selection pressures for instance the vancomycin resistance gene vanr were only carried by the genus microbacterium affiliated to the phylum actinobacteria in cel kan and tet treatments with an average abundance of 0 23 0 13 and 0 37 respectively figs 6 and 7 the findings indicated that some bacteria exhibited a pronounced tendency to carry specific args 3 7 antibiotic selection pressures obviously increase the occurrence frequency of ices and imes in arg carrying mags as summarized in table s14 39 t4ss type ices carrying integrase relaxase and t4ss gene clusters and 38 imes with integrase and relaxase were identified in 42 arg carrying mags of which 11 mags contained both ice and ime regions no ices or imes were detected in arg carrying mags recovered from sas while antibiotic selection pressures obviously increased the occurrence frequency of ices and imes for example a mag in cel treatment cel mag 60 carrying blaveb 9 aada7 aadb and rifampin adpribosyl transferase arr was annotated as the genus afipia and contained three ice regions and one ime region table s14 the arrangements of representative t4ss genes in several ice regions were shown in fig s8 all detected potential ices contained at least one gene with a homologue in a t4ss and these genes included tra trb vir tfc and other homologs belonging to different mating pair formation mpf classes the majority of detected integrases in potential ices and imes belonged to the phage integrase and tyrosine recombinase families for other components two ices and five imes in seven mags from chl cel kan and smz treatments were found containing an orit region a short dna sequence which is critical for the conjugation table s14 moreover the attachment sites attl and attr flanking most ice and ime regions were observed table s14 indicating their potential roles in site specific recombination events for the mags carrying ices imes they were assigned to five phyla including proteobacteria nitrospirae actinobacteria acidobacteria and armatimonadetes table s14 notably multiple types of args were found co occurring with ices or imes in some abundant mags increasing the mobility and risk of args for example three ices and one ime were detected in the above mentioned mag which was annotated as the genus thauera with an average abundance of 10 6 in kan treatment and might confer multi resistance to six types of antibiotics table s14 4 discussion 4 1 potential mobility of args mediated by plasmids under high antibiotic selection pressures based on metagenomic assembly approach the accs were classified and the co occurrence of args and mges were investigated to evaluate the mobility of args over half of the accs were classified as plasmid sequences with an obvious increase as a result of antibiotic selection pressures compared with sas and control treatment similarly a substantial increase in the abundance of arg carrying plasmids was observed in fish gut microbiome after florfenicol exposure sáenz et al 2019 and in the cohort treated with cotrimoxazole willmann et al 2019 the findings indicated that plasmids were an important part in the resistome under antibiotic selective pressures and could be considered as an indication of potential mobility thus contributing efficiently to the spread of antibiotic resistance as to the arg types there was a clear distinction between the args carried by plasmids and chromosomes the arg types prone to be carried by plasmids were closely related to the frequently used antibiotic classes such as aminoglycosides beta lactams amphenicols sulfonamides and tetracyclines which was consistent with other studies focusing on the plasmid borne args in wastewater treatment plants wwtps li et al 2015a che et al 2019 however some args especially the bacitracin and vancomycin resistance genes tended to be chromosomally encoded this might be attributed to the regulation of a two component system consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator localized on a chromosomal operon koteva et al 2010 charlebois et al 2012 accordingly in our study the commonly detected gene combinations of vanr with histidine kinase bacitracin resistance genes with histidine kinase and dna binding response regulator located on chromosomes supports the above findings in the present study we observed various specific mges co occurring with args on the plasmids and the diverse mge arg co occurrence patterns related to the antibiotic classes typically distributed in different treatments likewise che et al 2019 found that the transposons and integrons were more frequently associated with args on plasmids than on the chromosomes in the wwtps some of these mges can mobilize and insert themselves in a site specific or random manner throughout the plasmids of hosts further increasing the mobility of plasmids and driving the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance frost et al 2005 durrant et al 2019 as the two most frequently identified mge groups in this study transposases and integrases have also been revealed to be the most prevalent mges flanking args in different environments forsberg et al 2012 jia et al 2019 sáenz et al 2019 for example the tn3 family transposase detected in all antibiotic treatments has been proven to be one of the major families responsible for the dissemination of args nicolas et al 2015 with respect to the integrases phage integrase with a high detection frequency generally co occurred with site specific recombinase and flanked a set of genes encoding resistance to tetracycline chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside etc sáenz et al 2019 observed an increase in the abundance of phages and phage integrases highlighting their vital roles in the transfer of args under antibiotic selection pressures besides other closely linked mges including recombinases resolvases and invertases were also found commonly associated with args encoded by plasmids or chromosomes and tended to form co existing patterns in the presence of antibiotics previous studies demonstrated that these mges could drive the mobilization of various phages and transposons and were essential for the activity of integrons that capture args into complex functional units thus contributing to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance on a multitude of ways mazel 2006 smith 2015 rubio cosials et al 2018 although the above mentioned mges may further increase the mobility of plasmid mediated args it should be noted that half of the plasmids are non mobilizable and the transfer or conjugation of plasmids are generally associated with the sizes and the essential genetic elements coded by them smillie et al 2010 therefore the present study also focused on the occurrence of genetic elements responsible for the plasmid conjugation conjugative or self transmissible plasmids contain two modules with a mobility system relaxase and t4cp and an mpf system t4ss while the mobilizable plasmids do not contain the mpf system smillie et al 2010 guglielmini et al 2014 compared with the control treatment antibiotic selection pressures promoted the occurrence of these genetic elements with args on plasmids and increased the number of potential mobilizable or conjugative plasmids which could play a more critical role than non mobilizable plasmids in increasing environmental adaptation of microbiota to antibiotics and in acquiring and horizontally transferring args between the same microbial species or across species under antibiotic selection pressures fernandez lopez et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the hgt of plasmid mediated resistance to different antibiotics exacerbates antibiotic resistance challenges in clinical and natural environment this study confirmed that high concentrations of antibiotics could also increase the hgt potential possibly by activating the excision of transferrable genes or by inducing the expression of conjugation machinery beaber et al 2004 lopatkin et al 2016 in addition multiple mobile or conjugative genes associated with args were generally detected in the form of co existed clusters to respond to the antibiotics and be responsible for the conjugation however the co occurrence patterns varied greatly among different antibiotic treatments and this may be related to distinct selection effects on the microbial community posed by different antibiotics it should be of great concern to the potential transmissible plasmids carrying multiple args which may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of multi resistant bacteria including human pathogens thus resulting in the increase of health risk carnelli et al 2017 4 2 potential mobility of args mediated by ices under high antibiotic selection pressures particularly except for the mobility of args mediated by plasmids we also identified another type of mge referred to as the ices carried by the arg carrying mags the results revealed that antibiotic treatments clearly increased the occurrence frequency of ices compared to the control treatment ices are self transmissible mges that can integrate into replicate with and excise from the host chromosome and can encode the conjugation machinery of t4ss to enable their conjugative transfer from donor to recipient cells wozniak and waldor 2010 it has been widely reported that ices play an important role as vehicles for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different bacterial species and genera li et al 2016 baranowski et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the ices encoding args can confer the host with antibiotic selective advantages driving bacterial adaptation and evolution bellanger et al 2014 therefore the bacteria carrying ices and args simultaneously may exhibit a stronger adaption to high concentrations of antibiotics and have a higher risk resulting from the higher mobility potential of args than those not carrying ices johnson and grossman 2015 botelho et al 2020 in addition to the ices the chromosome borne imes were also found in some arg carrying mags in the presence of antibiotics imes encode their own excision and integration and use the conjugation machinery of unrelated co resident conjugative elements for their own transfer guédon et al 2017 the prevalence of these elements has probability of acquiring args and to be further selected and amplified due to antibiotic pressure in the environment botelho et al 2018 thus enhancing the selective fitness of their hosts and contributing to the bacterial evolution guédon et al 2017 recently great attention has been given to the identification of ices in pathogenic bacteria and the multi antibiotic resistance mediated by ices for example the sxt r391 ices encoding multi antibiotic resistance were found to be transferred between proteus and other enterobacteriaceae li et al 2016 similarly a novel ice named icessucz130302 carrying multiple types of args was identified and characterized from the streptococcus suis strains pan et al 2019 these findings highlighted the importance of ices in the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance however it was revealed that ices were not the major transmission mediators of args probably because many args were intrinsic and few of them were commonly transferred via conjugation or transformation he et al 2019 based on the above findings some args that co existed with ices in a genome such as bacitracin resistance genes may be intrinsic and antibiotic selection pressure may not activate their expressions and these args were less likely to be captured by ices in the present study the host genomes of ices and args were annotated to different taxonomic levels and some bacteria may include pathogenic species such as the family burkholderiaceae it is now known that many ices can transfer among a wide range of species wozniak and waldor 2010 in the future the category of the detected potential ices should be annotated and the factors regulating the transfer of ices between different species should be explored overall the present study revealed that the co occurrence of multiple mges and args enhanced the potential mobility of args under antibiotic selection pressures based on these results a more thorough exploration of the mobility of args should be conducted toward an improved understanding of the contribution of these mges to bacterial adaptation and evolution under high antibiotic selection pressures 4 3 arg combinations under antibiotic selection pressures compared with sas and control treatment antibiotic selection pressures resulted in a substantial increase of the diversity of arg combinations including contiguous and discontiguous args formed by a single type or multiple types this demonstrated the important effect of antibiotics on the emergence of co resistance however various arg combinations detected in sas and control treatment suggested the universality of arg arg co occurrence in the environment some specific arg combinations were found stably present in different treatments such as stra strb sul1 cmla sul1 flor and aada cmla and most have been confirmed in previous studies for example the shared arg combination of stra and strb was also detected in different environments and was generally located on plasmids associated with various args bengtsson palme et al 2014 shi et al 2018 the shared arg combinations may be intrinsic to the core species among the samples fernández and hancock 2012 and could synergistically enrich under antibiotic selection pressure in the present study the high abundance of args not corresponding to the added antibiotic by forming various arg combinations suggested that some args could be co selected under the selection pressure from different antibiotics generally the resistance genes of multidrug tetracycline sulfonamide aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol were more easily inducible than other arg types but there were also some differences between different antibiotic treatments the co selection effect was also reported for the resistome of animal and human gut as well as wastewater treatment systems gibson et al 2016 shi et al 2018 sáenz et al 2019 similar to our study these studies also mainly focused on the co selection effect of a single antibiotic on the development of args whilethe effects of the co existence of multiple antibiotics are still unclear consequently it is crucial to elucidate the co selection effects of the co existence of multiple antibiotics on antibiotic resistance in the future study among the arg combinations formed by a single type the multidrug resistance genes were more likely to co occur and were often chromosomally encoded consistently it has been demonstrated that clinically relevant multidrug efflux pump clusters generally reside on the chromosomes in bacteria martínez et al 2009 multidrug efflux pump genes on the chromosome can give many bacteria an intrinsic mechanism critical for survival in the presence of antibiotics webber and piddock 2003 and overexpression of these genes can lead to elevated resistance levels li and nikaido 2009 in the present study the genes encoding for tetracycline and multidrug efflux pump components were found usually linked to regulatory genes including tetr acrr marr and luxr which have been considered as args in the database the product of these regulatory genes may exert a repressor or activator role fernández and hancock 2012 for the most frequently detected regulatory gene in our study tetr was more easily to co occur with tetracycline resistance genes located on plasmids this type of combination has been reported to be present in various environment samples and may be carried by pathogenic bacteria forsberg et al 2012 ma et al 2016 tetr family transcriptional regulators are responsible for the regulation and induction of tetracycline resistance and involved in regulating the expression of multidrug efflux pumps cuthbertson and nodwell 2013 in agreement with these findings we also found the co occurrence of tetr or tetr acrr with multidrug efflux pumps such as acrb acrd acrf rnd and mate family transporters strikingly the co occurrence of tetr acrr family proteins with args conferring resistance to chloramphenicol or sulfonamide exhibited antibiotic specific patterns indicating the varied responses of their hosts to different antibiotic selection pressures furthermore we noted that the variations of antibiotic types resulted in unexpected antibiotic specific arg combinations which may be derived from the intrinsic args in bacteria or acquired through hgt ormutations blair et al 2015 for example the arg combination of sul1 and small multidrug efflux pump which was frequently carried by plasmid mediated class 1 integron buffet bataillon et al 2016 co occurred with the aminoglycoside resistance gene aada under chl selection pressure however catb conferring resistance to chloramphenicol was associated with this combination in the presence of kan the emergence of the above arg combinations might imply a temporary response to the changes of antibiotic types which was called adaptive resistance involving a temporary increase in the ability of a microorganism to survive and withstand a given antibiotic fernández and hancock 2012 4 4 bacterial hosts of args in this study metagenomic binning revealed the diverse bacterial composition and 119 mags belonging to nine bacterial phyla were identified to carry args in all samples although the presence of antibiotics increased the number of mags carrying args and promoted the enrichment of some arg hosts the prevalence of arb in sas and control treatment indicated that the bacterial hosts of args were also an important part of the microbial community among the arg carrying mags the shared mags by different treatments and the mags carried multiple types of args and ices should be of great concern because of their potential higher risks for example the genus thauera in kan chl and tet treatments could be resistant to five antibiotic classes while the ices and imes carried by thauera suggested the potential mobility of args a recent study revealed that thauera could be host of bacitracin resistance genes and might cause the prevalence of args during wastewater treatment tong et al 2019 in addition thauera were typical denitrifying bacteria in the wastewater treatment process and were shown to be capable of antibiotic biodegradation liu et al 2006 miran et al 2018 except for thauera some bacteria identified as the hosts of args could adapt to antibiotic selection pressures and may play imperative roles in the antibiotic wastewater treatment process such as rudaea alicycliphilus ideonella and thiobacillus these genera have been identified to be potential arb and are involved in denitrification or the biodegradation of some aromatic compounds and antibiotics çelik et al 2018 chen et al 2019b zheng et al 2019 our results indicated that some arg types tended to be carried by certain bacteria exhibiting a host specific pattern for example vanr was found to be carried by the gram positive bacterial genus microbacterium many microbacterium isolates were found expressed resistance to vancomycin bernard and pacheco 2015 and the isolate m resistens was reported to be intrinsically resistant to vancomycin gallois et al 2014 strikingly the hosts of bacitracin resistance genes consisted of two families burkholderiaceae and rhodocyclaceae indicating that the members of the two families might be intrinsically resistant to bacitracin additionally other 12 args conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics were also carried by burkholderiaceae suggesting this family was an important reservoir of args in agreement with our results liu et al 2019b found burkholderiaceae were the most important multi antibiotic resistant bacteria in activated sludge harboring 50 args xia et al 2019 also reported burkholderiaceae was one of the mainly potential hosts harboring args in wastewater treatment bioreactors particularly because the widespread family burkholderiaceae contains some pathogens for humans and animals coenye 2014 some bacteria belonging to burkholderiaceae in this study may be multi antibiotic resistant pathogens there were also some multi antibiotic resistant bacteria that may be pathogenic such as mycobacterium and afipia detected in cel treatment some species belonging to these two genera could cause a variety of diseases and have been shown to be resistant to a group of antibiotics schinsky 2004 lo et al 2013 under antibiotic selective pressures pathogenic species without args tend to acquire args while pathogenic species with args tend to survive and be enriched liang et al 2020 however a high proportion of bacterial hosts of args might be non pathogenic bacteria in this study consistently non pathogenic environmental species have been revealed to be important carriers of args berendonk et al 2015 non pathogenic arb can serve as a reservoir to transfer their args to pathogens via the carried ices or other mges and antibiotic selective pressure can enhance this potential suzuki et al 2017 after acquiring args the pathogens may be multi resistant to antibiotics and can pose a more serious threat to human health martínez et al 2015 in addition the relatively high proportions of microbial community that could not be explained by the identified mags may contain some arg hosts which need to be further explored using other methods and techniques such as nanopore sequencing along with hybrid metagenomic assembly of nanopore and illumina reads bertrand et al 2019 meanwhile it is necessary to isolate some arb from the reactors using the culture dependent methods for better understanding their roles in antibiotic resistance evolution and verifying some bacterial hosts of args overall accurate identification of the hosts of args is critical to estimate the real risk of dissemination of antibiotic resistance from environmental reservoirs to human pathogens 5 conclusion the presence of antibiotics in antibiotic production wastewater increased the stress response of microbial community by forming various arg co existence combinations to co select multi antibiotic resistance the high abundance of non corresponding args under one specific antibiotic selection pressure revealed the remarkable co selection effect of antibiotics which showed antibiotic type specific patterns besides high antibiotic selection pressures also promoted the potential mobility of args mediated by both conjugative plasmids and ices which could facilitate the horizontal transfer of args moreover the mag based analysis demonstrated that the arg hosts were taxonomically diverse and exhibited a pronounced multiple resistance pattern as well as specific host association resistance pattern these arg hosts belonged to nine phyla and included some potential pathogenic bacteria and functional bacteria related to wastewater treatment this comprehensive cultivation independent study could enhance our understanding of the mobility and hosts of args under high antibiotic selective pressures and provide important insights into the risk assessment and management of antibiotic resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17535,the presence of antibiotics can exert significant selection pressure on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb however co selection effects for args the mobility of args and the identification of arg hosts under high antibiotic selection pressures are poorly understood here metagenomic assembly and binning approaches were used to comprehensively decipher the prevalence of args and their potential mobility and hosts in activated sludge reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater we found the abundance of different arg types in antibiotic treatments varied greatly and certain antibiotic pressure promoted the co selection for the non corresponding types of args antibiotic selection pressures significantly increased the abundance and proportions of args mediated by plasmids 57 9 which were more prevalent than those encoded in chromosomes 19 2 the results indicated that plasmids and chromosomes had a tendency to carry different types of args moreover higher co occurrence frequency of args and mges revealed that antibiotics enhanced the mobility potential of args mediated by both plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements among the 689 metagenome assembled genomes mags with high estimated quality 119 mags assigning to nine bacterial phyla were identified as the arg hosts and 33 mags exhibited possible multi resistance to antibiotics some arg types tended to be carried by certain bacteria e g bacitracin resistance genes carried by the family burkholderiaceae and thus showed a pronounced host specific pattern this study enhances the understanding of the mobility and hosts of args and provides important insights into the risk assessment and management of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic selection pressure antibiotic resistance genes mobility bacterial hosts metagenomic assembly binning 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a growing global health threat and the development rate of resistance is much faster than the rate of invention and discovery of new antibiotics lewis 2013 global antibiotic consumption increased by 65 between 2000 and 2015 klein et al 2018 and the consumption in animals is about threefold that of humans van boeckel et al 2019 the production and overuse of antibiotics increased their concentrations in both clinical and non clinical environments especially including antibiotic manufacturing sites hospitals livestock farming and aquaculture systems rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 thai et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 elevated levels of antibiotics in an environment can drive a selection pressure contributing to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb wellington et al 2013 args are often located on mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids integrative and conjugative elements ices transposons and integrons which are able to move within or between dna molecules and transfer between bacterial cells partridge et al 2018 these mges play a vital role in facilitating horizontal gene transfer hgt of args and thus promote the development of multi antibiotic resistance and bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection pressure gillings 2017 partridge et al 2018 consequently to better understand and control the dissemination of args in the environment with high concentrations of antibiotics the args associated with mges must be elucidated furthermore the hgt of args between different bacteria may contribute to the changes in bacterial hosts of args jia et al 2019 and subsequently affects the dynamic changes of resistome induced by antibiotic selection pressures this promotes the emergence and spread of pathogenic arb which pose genuine threats to human health baker et al 2018 thus it is critical to identify the hosts of args under antibiotic selection pressure for the risk assessment and control of antibiotic resistance traditionally efforts to investigate the mobility of args in the presence of antibiotics have been mainly focused on the culture based isolation of specific pathogenic bacteria leungtongkam et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the conjugative transfer of args carried by plasmids or ices between bacterial species has been well characterized by combining with dna sequencing genome wide rna sequencing or proteomic analysis brophy et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however owing to low proportions of culturable microorganisms and time consuming process manaia et al 2018 culture dependent methods preclude insights into the occurrence of args and the associated mges in complex microbial communities the development of metagenomics has made it possible to profile the entire community structure and characterize individual microbes without isolation chng et al 2020 therefore the metagenomic approaches provide a more comprehensive view of args in the environment and draw insights about the mobility and host association of args che et al 2019 kanger et al 2020 most previous metagenomic studies based on short reads have identified and quantified the diversity and abundance of args with little emphasis on the specific co existence structures between args and mges and on separating their genetic locations including plasmids and chromosomes li et al 2015a fresia et al 2019 notably as important mges for the spread of args wozniak and waldor 2010 the occurrence and mobility of ices in the recovered draft genomes from the environments under antibiotic selection pressures remain poorly understood additionally with growing multi antibiotic resistance the specific combination of args harbored in bacteria is of great concern from a clinical perspective chng et al 2020 although many studies using network analysis and metagenomic assembly have revealed the co existence patterns of args in different environments ma et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 chen et al 2019a little is known about the diversity of arg combinations co selection effects for resistance under antibiotic pressures and how antibiotics affecting the dynamics and genetic locations of args in previous studies correlation and network analyses have been used to identify the possible hosts of args xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the obtained host association information is limited and may have uncertain biases including both false positive and false negative results recently several studies used metagenomic assembly and binning methods to identify the hosts of args in clinical and natural settings ma et al 2016 jia et al 2019 kanger et al 2020 revealing new insights into the linkage of antibiotic resistance and microbial community strategies for recovering genomes from samples have been regarded as important complements to traditional microbiological techniques and provided access to the uncultured microbial diversity expanding the tree of life alneberg et al 2018 nayfach et al 2019 therefore metagenomic binning will enable a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and provide important insights into the mobilization of args under high antibiotic selection pressures in this study we used metagenomic assembly and binning methods to decipher and compare the prevalence of args and their potential mobility and hosts in activated sludge as reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater specifically the objectives were 1 to reveal the co selection effects of different antibiotics on antibiotic resistance by investigating the dynamics of co existence between args 2 to evaluate the potential mobility of args by identifying the genetic location patterns of args and mges and 3 to explore the host association of args by recovering large scale metagenome assembled genomes mags from as samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and metagenomic sequencing detailed information about batch experiments reactor operation process and sample preparation for dna extraction has been described in our previous study zhao et al 2019 in brief five antibiotics sigma aldrich usa i e cephalexin cel chloramphenicol chl kanamycin kan sulfamethazine smz and tetracycline tet belonging to five classes table s1 were selected as the targets to exert a selective pressure on microbial community seed activated sludge sas collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant was initially used as the inoculum 50 ml in each reactor to simulate as process for treating antibiotic production wastewater the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel for each antibiotic treatment with a working volume of 500 ml and a control treatment ck without antibiotic addition was performed simultaneously the concentrations of each antibiotic were step wise increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level table s2 according to their removal behaviors through successive stages the mixed liquor sample of 10 ml was taken before moving into the next stage from each reactor for dna extraction two sas and 36 as samples from stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 were selected for metagenomic sequencing zhao et al 2019 table s2 the reasons for selecting the three stages were summarized in text s1 dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna library was constructed using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa with an insert size of 350 bp and then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform with paired end pe 150 bp strategy at novogene tianjin china all the metagenomic sequencing data are available at ncbi bioproject database with the accession numbers of prjna634463 2 2 metagenomic assembly and identification of arg carrying contigs metagenomic sequencing of the 38 samples generated approximately 671 5 gb and 2245 million pe reads raw metagenomic reads were evaluated with fastqc v 0 11 6 the low quality sequences were removed and adaptors were trimmed using trimmomatic v 0 32 bolger et al 2014 to ensure a minimum quality score of 20 quality controlled reads from each sample were then assembled individually into contigs using megahit v 1 1 1 li et al 2015b with the following parameters k min 61 min contig len 1000 quality of assemblies was evaluated using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal v 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 the predicted orfs were identified as arg like orfs by searching nucleotide sequences against the structured arg sarg database v 2 0 yin et al 2018 using blastx with an e value 10 10 asimilarity 80 and a query coverage 70 ma et al 2016 the abundance coverage gb of arg like orfs in each sample was calculated as follows ma et al 2016 abundance coverage g b 1 n n mapped reads l reads l arg like orf s where nmapped reads is the number of the reads mapped to arg like orfs lreads is the sequence length of the illumina reads larg like orf is the sequence length of target arg like orfs n is the number of the arg like orfs belonging to the same arg type and s is the size of the data set gb the orfs on arg carrying contigs accs were annotated against the ncbi non redundant nr protein database retrieved 21 may 2018 using blastp with an e value 10 5 with an identity and query coverage threshold of 80 and 70 respectively ma et al 2016 the mges located on accs were identified according to the results of nr annotation annotations were categorized as mges based on string matches to one of the following keywords transposase transposon conjugative integrase integron recombinase conjugal mobilization recombination plasmid resolvase relaxase and invertase forsberg et al 2014 sáenz et al 2019 finally all orf annotations and orf arrangements on accs were obtained plasflow v 1 1 with default parameters was used to predict plasmid and chromosomal sequences from accs krawczyk et al 2018 according to whether they code the four components the origin of transfer orit relaxase the type iv coupling proteins t4cp and the type iv secretion system t4ss the mobility of plasmids can be classified into three categories conjugative mobilizable and non mobilizable smillie et al 2010 thus the potential mobility of args carried by plasmids was identified based on the above categories 2 3 metagenomic binning and quality control of mags following assembly the quality controlled reads from each sample were mapped to the assembled contigs using bowtie2 v 2 3 4 2 to generate a coverage score for individual contigs langmead and salzberg 2012 then the mags were recovered from each sample independently using three different tools with default options metabat2 v 2 12 1 kang et al 2015 maxbin v 2 2 4 wu et al 2016 and concoct v 0 9 0 alneberg et al 2014 thus a total of 1841 mags were recovered from the 38 samples table s3 the quality of all mags was assessed using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 the completeness and contamination of the mags were estimated using checkm v 1 0 7 with lineage specific markers genes and default parameters parks et al 2015 the merge method of checkm v1 0 7 was used to identify pairs of mags and to avoid producing chimaeric mags according to the criteria proposed by parks et al 2017 refinem v 0 0 22 was used to improve the completeness and reduce the contamination of a mag by identifying and filtering contigs with divergent genomic properties incongruent taxonomic classification and incongruent 16s rrna genes parks et al 2017 only mags with an estimated quality 50 defined as completeness 5 contamination were retained for pairwise dereplication comparison parks et al 2017 for each treatment the amino acid identity aai between genomes were determined using comparem v 0 0 23 with default parameters parks et al 2017 mags were considered as belonging to the same species with an aai 99 5 parks et al 2017 and only the mags from each cluster with the highest estimated quality were retained finally 689 dereplicated mags were obtained and used for the downstream analysis table s3 2 4 taxonomic assignment relative abundance calculation and functional annotation of mags taxonomic assignment of 689 obtained mags was performed and standardized taxonomic labels were produced using the software toolkit gtdb tk v 0 3 0 based on the genome taxonomy database with default parameters parks et al 2018 the quality controlled reads from each sample were mapped against each genome bin fasta file recovered from the samples using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 then based on the obtained mapping sam files the script calculate breadth py provided by olm et al 2017 was used to calculate the average coverage of each genome bin thus the relative abundance of each mag was calculated as the number of reads based on average coverage aligning to the mag normalized by the total number of reads in the sample pasolli et al 2019 the args carried by mags were identified using blastx against sarg database v 2 0 yin et al 2018 with an e value cutoff of 10 10 80 similarity and 70 query coverage to further estimate the transferability of args the ices integrative and mobilizable elements imes in the arg carrying mags were predicted by icefinder online tool with the default parameters liu et al 2019a those elements carrying integrase relaxase and t4ss gene clusters were considered as t4ss type ices while those without t4ss but with integrase and relaxase were identified as imes liu et al 2019a 2 5 statistical analysis the normality of data was evaluated before statistical analysis normally distributed data were analyzed using student s t test while non normally distributed data were analyzed using the nonparametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and the two sided wilcoxon rank sum test statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 20 spss chicago il usa a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 diversity and co selection of args revealed by metagenomic assembly the detailed information of 38 metagenomic datasets and the quality assessment results of assemblies were summarized in table s4 and described in text s2 a total of 2830 predicted orfs were annotated as arg like sequences and carried by 1681 contigs in the 38 samples table s5 the 2830 arg like orfs were assigned to 228 arg subtypes belonging to 15 arg types and eight types were shared by all samples fig 1 a the total arg abundance of the samples varied greatly with a range from 25 1 to 1839 1 gb fig s1a among these samples the top five most abundant arg types including tetracycline multidrug aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and sulfonamide resistance genes accounted for 50 2 99 5 of the total arg abundance fig 1a and fig s1b the kruskal wallis rank sum test indicated that the total arg abundance was significantly different among these treatments p 7 40e 05 and the arg abundance in antibiotic treatments except for smz treatment was much higher than that in control treatment p 0 03 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 1b moreover the composition of dominant arg types in different antibiotic treatments exhibited a clear difference for example the top three dominant types in cel treatment were multidrug aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes while the most abundant args were the types of chloramphenicol tetracycline and sulfonamide under smz selection pressure fig s2 except for the corresponding type of args the non corresponding types also accounted for a high abundance under a certain antibiotic selection pressure revealing the co selection effect of antibiotics specifically cel and kan tended to co select mainly multidrug resistance genes while chl and smz mostly promoted the co selection of tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance genes respectively fig s2 3 2 higher proportion of args is located on plasmids than chromosomes under antibiotic selection pressures for all samples on average 57 9 19 2 and 22 9 of the accs were classified as plasmid chromosomal and unclassified sequences respectively fig s3a generally all treatments had a much higher proportion of plasmid contigs than chromosomal contigs with args p 0 05 student s t test fig 2 a demonstrating the widespread occurrence of args on plasmids and their potential for hgt compared with the control treatment the presence of antibiotics except for cel in wastewater exhibited a significant increase in the proportion of accs located on plasmids p 0 05 student s t test and smz selective pressure resulted in the highest proportions with an average of 71 7 fig 2a furthermore the abundance of args located on plasmids accounting for an average of 68 2 of the total arg abundance was markedly higher than that on chromosomes across all samples p 1 74e 08 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s3b notably in terms of the number of args the genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside 80 4 beta lactam 71 7 bleomycin 86 4 chloramphenicol 79 3 sulfonamide 64 6 tetracycline 76 4 trimethoprim 84 6 and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 47 1 were more prevalent in plasmids while the arg types of bacitracin 69 5 multidrug 42 8 and vancomycin 92 9 were more frequently encoded in chromosomes fig 2b these results indicated that plasmids and chromosomes had different propensities to carry args and some arg types tended to be located on plasmids 3 3 antibiotic selection pressures increase the occurrence frequency and diversity of arg combinations as shown in fig s4a and table s6 the proportion of the detected accs carried only one arg ranged from 23 5 to 89 2 in different samples and these args were composed of 14 arg types in addition an average of 43 0 contigs with at least two args were detected across all samples and the args formed co occurring combinations fig s4a and table s7 the average proportions of accs carrying at least two args were significantly increased by the selection pressures of cel chl and kan compared to the control treatment p 0 03 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s4b the presence of antibiotics also increased the diversity of arg combinations including contiguous and discontiguous args belonging to various types on the one hand a set of arg combinations were dominated by a single arg type primarily including multidrug tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes and some of them were shared by different treatments table s7 for example aminoglycoside resistance genes stra and strb were found contiguously and stably co occurring in the plasmids from all samples table s7 the typical co occurrence patterns such as args encoding multidrug efflux systems e g hydrophobe amphiphile efflux 1 oprj mdta mdtb mdtc as well as tetracycline efflux pumps e g teta tetg tet33 tetz etc and the efflux regulatory gene tetr were also widely distributed in different treatments table s7 on the other hand some combinations were composed of args conferring resistance to different antibiotics thus the hosts harboring these genes might exhibit multi antibiotic resistance among these combinations we found a range of arg combinations shared by different treatments such as sul1 cmla sul1 flor aada cmla tetr acrr flor and sul1 small multidrug resistance efflux pump table s7 indicating the co selection effects of antibiotic pressures besides some arg combinations were only distributed in a certain antibiotic treatment for example a combination of five args conferring resistance to tetracycline tetx mls ered and ermfs aminoglycoside aadk and beta lactam blaoxa 347 was only identified in smz treatments at the concentration of 150 mg l 1 fig 3 a and table s7 moreover the changes in antibiotic types resulted in the integration of varied args into certain arg combinations and stra strb was one of the most representative combinations as illustrated in fig 3b and table s7 other args varying among different treatments were involved in stra strb cluster such as sul1 cmla in tet treatment blaaer 1 in chl treatment cmla in kan treatment and multidrug efflux genes in cel treatment these various arg combinations under different antibiotic selection pressures generally co existed with mges and were located on the plasmids 3 4 high co occurrence frequency of args and mges reveals the high mobility potential of args under antibiotic selection pressures to further evaluate the potential mobility of args the co occurrence of specific mges and args were investigated a wide range of mges were observed to co localize with args and there were 420 accs carrying mges in all samples accounting for 25 0 of all the detected accs table s5 and table s8 the abundance of the args co occurring with mges accounted for 13 9 96 7 of the total arg abundance across all samples fig 4 a the kruskal wallis test indicated that the proportions of abundance of these args varied greatly among different treatments p 0 00079 and the presence of chl kan and smz significantly increased the proportions of arg abundance compared to the control treatment p 0 045 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 4a among the 420 contigs carrying both args and mges 74 8 7 6 and 17 6 of the contigs were identified as plasmid chromosomal and unclassified sequences respectively fig 4b and table s5 the result demonstrated that the mges had a much higher occurrence frequency associated with args on plasmids than on chromosomes p 3 01e 09 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 4b many kinds of mges responsible for the hgt potentials were detected and the most frequently detected was transposase followed by integrase resolvase conjugal transfer proteins and dna invertase fig s5a and table s8 these transposases were mainly composed of is family and tn family and several kinds of integrases were also found located on the accs such as site specific integrase phage integrase and integron integrase table s8 the mges and args formed certain arg mge co existence patterns and were widely distributed in different treatments for example the arg cluster of stra and strb generally co existed with tn3 family transposase and dna invertase or resolvase on the plasmids in all treatments fig 3b fig s5b and table s8 likewise many arg mge combinations such as class a beta lactamase and dna invertase tetc together with tnpa resolvase or resolvase recombinase integrase were widely located on plasmids and variably co occurred with other genes including both args and mges table s8 a set of 66 plasmid contigs were identified carrying the conjugative or mobilizable genetic elements such as the relaxase conjugal transfer proteins plasmid mobilization relaxosome proteins table s9 the conjugative proteins on some contigs generally co occurred with some transposases or integrases for example the contig kan20 1 39883 carrying blages 2 and aac 6 ib were found associated with six transposases and several conjugative elements especially including the t4ss component of virb4 fig 4c and table s9 by classifying the args to types and subtypes 29 arg subtypes belonging to eight arg types were carried by these plasmid contigs and the three dominant types were aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance genes table s9 strikingly a few specific arg clusters co occurring with conjugal transfer proteins were observed present in different treatments and the variations of antibiotics resulted in the diverse occurrence and distribution patterns of conjugative elements and other mges located on the plasmids for example the arg combination of chloramphenicol efflux pump streptomycin resistance protein bleomycin binding protein and aph 3 in chl kan and tet treatments was found co occurring with variable conjugal transfer proteins and accessory genes fig 4c and table s9 it should be noted that the arg combinations conferring resistance to multiple antibiotic classes located on the potential conjugative or mobilizable plasmids may cause greater environmental and health risks 3 5 the recovered mags reveal the representative bacterial communities under antibiotic selection pressures a total of 1841 mags were reconstructed from all samples and 1112 mags met the filtering criteria with an estimated quality 50 after dereplication process 689 mags were retained for downstream analysis table s3 and the detailed information of the 689 mags were listed in table s10 as shown in fig 5 a a subset of 373 near complete mags were estimated to have 90 completeness and 5 contamination there were also 257 medium quality mags and 59 partial mags taxonomic identification of the 689 mags indicated that these mags were assigned to 19 bacterial phyla table s11 the total relative abundance of mags in each sample ranged from 22 9 to 69 6 which represented the bacterial community obtained by metagenomic binning method however the microbial community that could not be explained by the identified mags accounted for relatively high proportions in these samples fig 5c these recovered mags in control and antibiotic treatments had significantly higher relative abundance than that in sas p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 5b however no significant difference was observed among different treatments p 0 44 kruskal wallis rank sum test at the phylum level the four most abundant phyla across all samples were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria fig 5c there were marked differences in the relative abundance of mags assigning to the main phyla among different treatments p 0 032 kruskal wallis rank sum test fig s6 for example the mags belonging to the phylum actinobacteria in cel and smz treatments reached a higher relative abundance than those in other treatments p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig 5c and fig s6d moreover some bacteria obviously enriched under antibiotic selection pressures such as proteobacteria in chl from 16 8 to 51 7 and tet from 19 0 to 32 6 treatments acidobacteria from 2 2 to 12 8 in kan treatment actinobacteria from 4 1 to 13 5 in smz treatment and bacteroidetes from 3 5 to 9 9 in cel treatment fig 5c these results showed that the composition and abundance of microbial community was highly variable and significantly affected by the presence of antibiotics 3 6 the arg hosts are diverse and exhibit a pronounced multiple resistance pattern as well as specific host association resistance pattern among the 689 recovered mags a total of 119 mags were identified carrying args table s3 these mags were assigned to nine phyla and the hosts of args mostly belonged to the phylum proteobacteria 75 mags which contained two classes gammaproteobacteria 63 mags and alphaproteobacteria 12 mags fig 6 fig s7a and table s12 in addition 113 and 64 arg carrying mags were classified to the family 30 specific families and genus 30 specific genera level respectively table s12 the relative abundance of arg carrying mags in each sample varied greatly with a range from 2 8 to 55 2 fig s7a and the average relative abundance of arg carrying mags was significantly higher under antibiotic selective pressures than that in ck treatment p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test fig s7b as illustrated in fig 6 the 119 mags mainly carried 12 arg types and the five most frequently detected type was bacitracin tetracycline multidrug chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside moreover 38 mags were found carrying at least two args including 33 mags with multiple arg types fig 6 and table s13 for example a mag annotated as the genus thauera in kan treatment kan mag 48 harbored six args conferring resistance to sulfonamide sul1 chloramphenicol flor bacitracin undecaprenol kinase multidrug ompr2 beta lactam blages 2 and aminoglycoside aph 3 table s12 strikingly this mag had a higher relative abundance average 10 6 than other mags and contributed average 56 5 to the total relative abundance of the arg carrying mags in kan treatment fig 7 under antibiotic selection pressures some arg carrying bacteria enriched and accounted for a high proportion fig 7 particularly the family burkholderiaceae in cel treatment had the highest relative abundance of 45 0 at the concentration of 50 mg l 1 under tet selection pressure the relative abundance of this family gradually increased from 4 3 to 8 7 fig 7 in addition a mag in smz treatment smz mag 135 affiliated to the family micrococcaceae was identified as the host of cmxb and its relative abundance reached up to 14 3 at the highest concentration of 150 mg l 1 fig 7 and table s12 there were also some noteworthy families or genera identified as the hosts of args enriched with increasing antibiotic concentrations such as the family chitinophagaceae from 0 24 to 18 8 in smz treatment the genus variovorax from 0 26 to 14 4 in cel treatment the genus rudaea from 0 32 to 1 24 in tet treatment and the genera caballeronia from 1 17 to 6 71 and rhizobacter from 1 17 to 4 47 in chl treatment fig 7 among the detected arb it should be noted that some bacteria exhibited possible multi antibiotic resistance characteristics specifically four mags assigned to the family burkholderiaceae were resistant to the antibiotic types of aminoglycoside bacitracin chloramphenicol multidrug tetracycline and trimethoprim fig 6 table s12 and table s13 in addition five genera caballeronia comamonas cupriavidus ottowia and rubrivivax belonging to burkholderiaceae were also found resistant to multiple antibiotics fig 6 table s12 and table s13 in particular one mag belonging to the pathogenic genus mycobacterium in cel treatment average relative abundance 1 6 could confer multiple resistance to rifampin arr tetracycline tetv and aminoglycoside aac 2 ib fig 6 table s12 and table s13 the diverse hosts of args and the development of multiple antibiotic resistance under antibiotic selection pressures suggested that these bacteria are crucial reservoirs of args and may play a critical role in the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment in this study 36 mags belonging to the families burkholderiaceae 32 mags and rhodocyclaceae four mags were identified as the hosts of bacitracin resistance genes fig 6 and table s12 some of these mags were annotated to the genus level including alicycliphilus caballeronia ottowia variovorax comamonas cupriavidus and thauera fig 6 and table s12 notably all the detected hosts of bacitracin resistance genes were affiliated to the order betaproteobacteriales suggesting that this type of args tend to be carried by the betaproteobacteriales similarly other five mags belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae were identified as the hosts of multidrug abc transporter fig 6 and table s12 in addition we also detected several phyla tended to occur in specific treatments as the hosts of args take the phylum acidobacteria as an example of the six arg carrying mags belonging to this phylum five with an average relative abundance of 1 1 were found in smz treatment as the hosts of tet33 tetg aac 6 iia and rifampin adpribosyl transferase arr respectively fig 6 fig 7 and table s12 furthermore some args were detected only to be carried by specific bacteria even under different antibiotic selection pressures for instance the vancomycin resistance gene vanr were only carried by the genus microbacterium affiliated to the phylum actinobacteria in cel kan and tet treatments with an average abundance of 0 23 0 13 and 0 37 respectively figs 6 and 7 the findings indicated that some bacteria exhibited a pronounced tendency to carry specific args 3 7 antibiotic selection pressures obviously increase the occurrence frequency of ices and imes in arg carrying mags as summarized in table s14 39 t4ss type ices carrying integrase relaxase and t4ss gene clusters and 38 imes with integrase and relaxase were identified in 42 arg carrying mags of which 11 mags contained both ice and ime regions no ices or imes were detected in arg carrying mags recovered from sas while antibiotic selection pressures obviously increased the occurrence frequency of ices and imes for example a mag in cel treatment cel mag 60 carrying blaveb 9 aada7 aadb and rifampin adpribosyl transferase arr was annotated as the genus afipia and contained three ice regions and one ime region table s14 the arrangements of representative t4ss genes in several ice regions were shown in fig s8 all detected potential ices contained at least one gene with a homologue in a t4ss and these genes included tra trb vir tfc and other homologs belonging to different mating pair formation mpf classes the majority of detected integrases in potential ices and imes belonged to the phage integrase and tyrosine recombinase families for other components two ices and five imes in seven mags from chl cel kan and smz treatments were found containing an orit region a short dna sequence which is critical for the conjugation table s14 moreover the attachment sites attl and attr flanking most ice and ime regions were observed table s14 indicating their potential roles in site specific recombination events for the mags carrying ices imes they were assigned to five phyla including proteobacteria nitrospirae actinobacteria acidobacteria and armatimonadetes table s14 notably multiple types of args were found co occurring with ices or imes in some abundant mags increasing the mobility and risk of args for example three ices and one ime were detected in the above mentioned mag which was annotated as the genus thauera with an average abundance of 10 6 in kan treatment and might confer multi resistance to six types of antibiotics table s14 4 discussion 4 1 potential mobility of args mediated by plasmids under high antibiotic selection pressures based on metagenomic assembly approach the accs were classified and the co occurrence of args and mges were investigated to evaluate the mobility of args over half of the accs were classified as plasmid sequences with an obvious increase as a result of antibiotic selection pressures compared with sas and control treatment similarly a substantial increase in the abundance of arg carrying plasmids was observed in fish gut microbiome after florfenicol exposure sáenz et al 2019 and in the cohort treated with cotrimoxazole willmann et al 2019 the findings indicated that plasmids were an important part in the resistome under antibiotic selective pressures and could be considered as an indication of potential mobility thus contributing efficiently to the spread of antibiotic resistance as to the arg types there was a clear distinction between the args carried by plasmids and chromosomes the arg types prone to be carried by plasmids were closely related to the frequently used antibiotic classes such as aminoglycosides beta lactams amphenicols sulfonamides and tetracyclines which was consistent with other studies focusing on the plasmid borne args in wastewater treatment plants wwtps li et al 2015a che et al 2019 however some args especially the bacitracin and vancomycin resistance genes tended to be chromosomally encoded this might be attributed to the regulation of a two component system consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator localized on a chromosomal operon koteva et al 2010 charlebois et al 2012 accordingly in our study the commonly detected gene combinations of vanr with histidine kinase bacitracin resistance genes with histidine kinase and dna binding response regulator located on chromosomes supports the above findings in the present study we observed various specific mges co occurring with args on the plasmids and the diverse mge arg co occurrence patterns related to the antibiotic classes typically distributed in different treatments likewise che et al 2019 found that the transposons and integrons were more frequently associated with args on plasmids than on the chromosomes in the wwtps some of these mges can mobilize and insert themselves in a site specific or random manner throughout the plasmids of hosts further increasing the mobility of plasmids and driving the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance frost et al 2005 durrant et al 2019 as the two most frequently identified mge groups in this study transposases and integrases have also been revealed to be the most prevalent mges flanking args in different environments forsberg et al 2012 jia et al 2019 sáenz et al 2019 for example the tn3 family transposase detected in all antibiotic treatments has been proven to be one of the major families responsible for the dissemination of args nicolas et al 2015 with respect to the integrases phage integrase with a high detection frequency generally co occurred with site specific recombinase and flanked a set of genes encoding resistance to tetracycline chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside etc sáenz et al 2019 observed an increase in the abundance of phages and phage integrases highlighting their vital roles in the transfer of args under antibiotic selection pressures besides other closely linked mges including recombinases resolvases and invertases were also found commonly associated with args encoded by plasmids or chromosomes and tended to form co existing patterns in the presence of antibiotics previous studies demonstrated that these mges could drive the mobilization of various phages and transposons and were essential for the activity of integrons that capture args into complex functional units thus contributing to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance on a multitude of ways mazel 2006 smith 2015 rubio cosials et al 2018 although the above mentioned mges may further increase the mobility of plasmid mediated args it should be noted that half of the plasmids are non mobilizable and the transfer or conjugation of plasmids are generally associated with the sizes and the essential genetic elements coded by them smillie et al 2010 therefore the present study also focused on the occurrence of genetic elements responsible for the plasmid conjugation conjugative or self transmissible plasmids contain two modules with a mobility system relaxase and t4cp and an mpf system t4ss while the mobilizable plasmids do not contain the mpf system smillie et al 2010 guglielmini et al 2014 compared with the control treatment antibiotic selection pressures promoted the occurrence of these genetic elements with args on plasmids and increased the number of potential mobilizable or conjugative plasmids which could play a more critical role than non mobilizable plasmids in increasing environmental adaptation of microbiota to antibiotics and in acquiring and horizontally transferring args between the same microbial species or across species under antibiotic selection pressures fernandez lopez et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the hgt of plasmid mediated resistance to different antibiotics exacerbates antibiotic resistance challenges in clinical and natural environment this study confirmed that high concentrations of antibiotics could also increase the hgt potential possibly by activating the excision of transferrable genes or by inducing the expression of conjugation machinery beaber et al 2004 lopatkin et al 2016 in addition multiple mobile or conjugative genes associated with args were generally detected in the form of co existed clusters to respond to the antibiotics and be responsible for the conjugation however the co occurrence patterns varied greatly among different antibiotic treatments and this may be related to distinct selection effects on the microbial community posed by different antibiotics it should be of great concern to the potential transmissible plasmids carrying multiple args which may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of multi resistant bacteria including human pathogens thus resulting in the increase of health risk carnelli et al 2017 4 2 potential mobility of args mediated by ices under high antibiotic selection pressures particularly except for the mobility of args mediated by plasmids we also identified another type of mge referred to as the ices carried by the arg carrying mags the results revealed that antibiotic treatments clearly increased the occurrence frequency of ices compared to the control treatment ices are self transmissible mges that can integrate into replicate with and excise from the host chromosome and can encode the conjugation machinery of t4ss to enable their conjugative transfer from donor to recipient cells wozniak and waldor 2010 it has been widely reported that ices play an important role as vehicles for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different bacterial species and genera li et al 2016 baranowski et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the ices encoding args can confer the host with antibiotic selective advantages driving bacterial adaptation and evolution bellanger et al 2014 therefore the bacteria carrying ices and args simultaneously may exhibit a stronger adaption to high concentrations of antibiotics and have a higher risk resulting from the higher mobility potential of args than those not carrying ices johnson and grossman 2015 botelho et al 2020 in addition to the ices the chromosome borne imes were also found in some arg carrying mags in the presence of antibiotics imes encode their own excision and integration and use the conjugation machinery of unrelated co resident conjugative elements for their own transfer guédon et al 2017 the prevalence of these elements has probability of acquiring args and to be further selected and amplified due to antibiotic pressure in the environment botelho et al 2018 thus enhancing the selective fitness of their hosts and contributing to the bacterial evolution guédon et al 2017 recently great attention has been given to the identification of ices in pathogenic bacteria and the multi antibiotic resistance mediated by ices for example the sxt r391 ices encoding multi antibiotic resistance were found to be transferred between proteus and other enterobacteriaceae li et al 2016 similarly a novel ice named icessucz130302 carrying multiple types of args was identified and characterized from the streptococcus suis strains pan et al 2019 these findings highlighted the importance of ices in the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance however it was revealed that ices were not the major transmission mediators of args probably because many args were intrinsic and few of them were commonly transferred via conjugation or transformation he et al 2019 based on the above findings some args that co existed with ices in a genome such as bacitracin resistance genes may be intrinsic and antibiotic selection pressure may not activate their expressions and these args were less likely to be captured by ices in the present study the host genomes of ices and args were annotated to different taxonomic levels and some bacteria may include pathogenic species such as the family burkholderiaceae it is now known that many ices can transfer among a wide range of species wozniak and waldor 2010 in the future the category of the detected potential ices should be annotated and the factors regulating the transfer of ices between different species should be explored overall the present study revealed that the co occurrence of multiple mges and args enhanced the potential mobility of args under antibiotic selection pressures based on these results a more thorough exploration of the mobility of args should be conducted toward an improved understanding of the contribution of these mges to bacterial adaptation and evolution under high antibiotic selection pressures 4 3 arg combinations under antibiotic selection pressures compared with sas and control treatment antibiotic selection pressures resulted in a substantial increase of the diversity of arg combinations including contiguous and discontiguous args formed by a single type or multiple types this demonstrated the important effect of antibiotics on the emergence of co resistance however various arg combinations detected in sas and control treatment suggested the universality of arg arg co occurrence in the environment some specific arg combinations were found stably present in different treatments such as stra strb sul1 cmla sul1 flor and aada cmla and most have been confirmed in previous studies for example the shared arg combination of stra and strb was also detected in different environments and was generally located on plasmids associated with various args bengtsson palme et al 2014 shi et al 2018 the shared arg combinations may be intrinsic to the core species among the samples fernández and hancock 2012 and could synergistically enrich under antibiotic selection pressure in the present study the high abundance of args not corresponding to the added antibiotic by forming various arg combinations suggested that some args could be co selected under the selection pressure from different antibiotics generally the resistance genes of multidrug tetracycline sulfonamide aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol were more easily inducible than other arg types but there were also some differences between different antibiotic treatments the co selection effect was also reported for the resistome of animal and human gut as well as wastewater treatment systems gibson et al 2016 shi et al 2018 sáenz et al 2019 similar to our study these studies also mainly focused on the co selection effect of a single antibiotic on the development of args whilethe effects of the co existence of multiple antibiotics are still unclear consequently it is crucial to elucidate the co selection effects of the co existence of multiple antibiotics on antibiotic resistance in the future study among the arg combinations formed by a single type the multidrug resistance genes were more likely to co occur and were often chromosomally encoded consistently it has been demonstrated that clinically relevant multidrug efflux pump clusters generally reside on the chromosomes in bacteria martínez et al 2009 multidrug efflux pump genes on the chromosome can give many bacteria an intrinsic mechanism critical for survival in the presence of antibiotics webber and piddock 2003 and overexpression of these genes can lead to elevated resistance levels li and nikaido 2009 in the present study the genes encoding for tetracycline and multidrug efflux pump components were found usually linked to regulatory genes including tetr acrr marr and luxr which have been considered as args in the database the product of these regulatory genes may exert a repressor or activator role fernández and hancock 2012 for the most frequently detected regulatory gene in our study tetr was more easily to co occur with tetracycline resistance genes located on plasmids this type of combination has been reported to be present in various environment samples and may be carried by pathogenic bacteria forsberg et al 2012 ma et al 2016 tetr family transcriptional regulators are responsible for the regulation and induction of tetracycline resistance and involved in regulating the expression of multidrug efflux pumps cuthbertson and nodwell 2013 in agreement with these findings we also found the co occurrence of tetr or tetr acrr with multidrug efflux pumps such as acrb acrd acrf rnd and mate family transporters strikingly the co occurrence of tetr acrr family proteins with args conferring resistance to chloramphenicol or sulfonamide exhibited antibiotic specific patterns indicating the varied responses of their hosts to different antibiotic selection pressures furthermore we noted that the variations of antibiotic types resulted in unexpected antibiotic specific arg combinations which may be derived from the intrinsic args in bacteria or acquired through hgt ormutations blair et al 2015 for example the arg combination of sul1 and small multidrug efflux pump which was frequently carried by plasmid mediated class 1 integron buffet bataillon et al 2016 co occurred with the aminoglycoside resistance gene aada under chl selection pressure however catb conferring resistance to chloramphenicol was associated with this combination in the presence of kan the emergence of the above arg combinations might imply a temporary response to the changes of antibiotic types which was called adaptive resistance involving a temporary increase in the ability of a microorganism to survive and withstand a given antibiotic fernández and hancock 2012 4 4 bacterial hosts of args in this study metagenomic binning revealed the diverse bacterial composition and 119 mags belonging to nine bacterial phyla were identified to carry args in all samples although the presence of antibiotics increased the number of mags carrying args and promoted the enrichment of some arg hosts the prevalence of arb in sas and control treatment indicated that the bacterial hosts of args were also an important part of the microbial community among the arg carrying mags the shared mags by different treatments and the mags carried multiple types of args and ices should be of great concern because of their potential higher risks for example the genus thauera in kan chl and tet treatments could be resistant to five antibiotic classes while the ices and imes carried by thauera suggested the potential mobility of args a recent study revealed that thauera could be host of bacitracin resistance genes and might cause the prevalence of args during wastewater treatment tong et al 2019 in addition thauera were typical denitrifying bacteria in the wastewater treatment process and were shown to be capable of antibiotic biodegradation liu et al 2006 miran et al 2018 except for thauera some bacteria identified as the hosts of args could adapt to antibiotic selection pressures and may play imperative roles in the antibiotic wastewater treatment process such as rudaea alicycliphilus ideonella and thiobacillus these genera have been identified to be potential arb and are involved in denitrification or the biodegradation of some aromatic compounds and antibiotics çelik et al 2018 chen et al 2019b zheng et al 2019 our results indicated that some arg types tended to be carried by certain bacteria exhibiting a host specific pattern for example vanr was found to be carried by the gram positive bacterial genus microbacterium many microbacterium isolates were found expressed resistance to vancomycin bernard and pacheco 2015 and the isolate m resistens was reported to be intrinsically resistant to vancomycin gallois et al 2014 strikingly the hosts of bacitracin resistance genes consisted of two families burkholderiaceae and rhodocyclaceae indicating that the members of the two families might be intrinsically resistant to bacitracin additionally other 12 args conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics were also carried by burkholderiaceae suggesting this family was an important reservoir of args in agreement with our results liu et al 2019b found burkholderiaceae were the most important multi antibiotic resistant bacteria in activated sludge harboring 50 args xia et al 2019 also reported burkholderiaceae was one of the mainly potential hosts harboring args in wastewater treatment bioreactors particularly because the widespread family burkholderiaceae contains some pathogens for humans and animals coenye 2014 some bacteria belonging to burkholderiaceae in this study may be multi antibiotic resistant pathogens there were also some multi antibiotic resistant bacteria that may be pathogenic such as mycobacterium and afipia detected in cel treatment some species belonging to these two genera could cause a variety of diseases and have been shown to be resistant to a group of antibiotics schinsky 2004 lo et al 2013 under antibiotic selective pressures pathogenic species without args tend to acquire args while pathogenic species with args tend to survive and be enriched liang et al 2020 however a high proportion of bacterial hosts of args might be non pathogenic bacteria in this study consistently non pathogenic environmental species have been revealed to be important carriers of args berendonk et al 2015 non pathogenic arb can serve as a reservoir to transfer their args to pathogens via the carried ices or other mges and antibiotic selective pressure can enhance this potential suzuki et al 2017 after acquiring args the pathogens may be multi resistant to antibiotics and can pose a more serious threat to human health martínez et al 2015 in addition the relatively high proportions of microbial community that could not be explained by the identified mags may contain some arg hosts which need to be further explored using other methods and techniques such as nanopore sequencing along with hybrid metagenomic assembly of nanopore and illumina reads bertrand et al 2019 meanwhile it is necessary to isolate some arb from the reactors using the culture dependent methods for better understanding their roles in antibiotic resistance evolution and verifying some bacterial hosts of args overall accurate identification of the hosts of args is critical to estimate the real risk of dissemination of antibiotic resistance from environmental reservoirs to human pathogens 5 conclusion the presence of antibiotics in antibiotic production wastewater increased the stress response of microbial community by forming various arg co existence combinations to co select multi antibiotic resistance the high abundance of non corresponding args under one specific antibiotic selection pressure revealed the remarkable co selection effect of antibiotics which showed antibiotic type specific patterns besides high antibiotic selection pressures also promoted the potential mobility of args mediated by both conjugative plasmids and ices which could facilitate the horizontal transfer of args moreover the mag based analysis demonstrated that the arg hosts were taxonomically diverse and exhibited a pronounced multiple resistance pattern as well as specific host association resistance pattern these arg hosts belonged to nine phyla and included some potential pathogenic bacteria and functional bacteria related to wastewater treatment this comprehensive cultivation independent study could enhance our understanding of the mobility and hosts of args under high antibiotic selective pressures and provide important insights into the risk assessment and management of antibiotic resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17536,predicting water quality and the human health risks associated with sewage derived microbes requires understanding the fate and transport of these contaminants sewage derived pathogen risks are typically assessed and monitored by measuring concentrations of fecal indicating bacteria fib like enterococcus sp previous research demonstrated that a high fraction of fib is particle associated which can alter fib dynamics within secondary water bodies in this study we experimentally quantified the effect of particle association on dark temperature and light dependent growth and sinking rates of enterococci particle association significantly increased dark growth rates light dependent growth rates i e decreased mortality and sinking rates relative to free living enterococci simulations using a novel 1 dimensional model parameterized by these rates indicate greater persistence t 90 for particle associated enterococci in water bodies across a wide range of diffuse attenuation coefficients of light k d and turbulent diffusivity d values in addition persistence of both fractions increased in simulated turbid and turbulent waters compared to clear and or quiescent conditions simulated persistence of both fractions also increased when enterococci discharges occurred later in a diel cycle towards sunset as opposed to sunrise especially for the free living population because later discharges under our model conditions allowed both fractions to mix deeper before inactivation via sunlight model sensitivity testing revealed that t 90 variability was greatest when dark growth rates were altered suggesting that future empirical studies should focus on quantifying these rates for free living and particle associated sewage derived microbes despite greater sensitivity of t 90 to variability in dark growth rates omitting light dependent growth rates from simulations dramatically influenced t 90 values our results demonstrate that particle association can increase enterococci persistence in receiving waters and highlight the importance of incorporating particle association in future water quality models graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage wastewater fecal indicator bacteria inactivation water quality t90 1 introduction sewage pollution of coastal environments is a common management concern due to the public health risks from contact with water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria protozoa and viruses horman et al 2004 fong and lipp 2005 with increasing urbanization particularly in coastal regions there is increased potential for degradation of surface waters by sewage discharges vermeulen et al 2015 management of health risks related to sewage pollution relies on in field monitoring programs and statistical or numerical modeling to predict water quality or untreated discharges fecal indicator bacteria fib include several types of bacteria used to indicate contamination by sewage and co occurring pathogens fib are generally assumed to have limited environmental persistence so have long been interpreted as indicating recent fecal pollution litsky et al 1953 however prolonged persistence reported under some conditions bordalo et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 chudoba et al 2013 complicates fib use as sewage pollution indicators commonly used fib include total coliforms fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococcus sp though only enterococcus sp is approved by the us environmental protection agency epa for testing water quality in brackish to salty water bodies us epa 2012 enterococci abundance in recreational waters correlates with increasing incidence of gastrointestinal illness in swimmers particularly when the source is sewage or other wastewater cabelli et al 1982 wade et al 2003 colford et al 2012 effectively predicting concentrations of fib and co occurring pathogens in surface waters requires considering their ecological dynamics when they transition from the gastrointestinal tract to secondary habitats gordon et al 2002 like storm water wastewater and receiving waters the extra enteric ecology boehm et al 2005 o mullan et al 2017 of fib is dominated by loss processes including inactivation evison 1988 howell et al 1996 predation mccambridge and mcmeekin 1981 menon et al 2003 transport cho et al 2010 and dispersion nevers and boehm 2011 while physical advection and diffusion are critical for understanding fib distributions models that omit fib inactivation typically perform poorly relative to observations even over very short time and space scales e g over a few hours and only 100s of meters rippy et al 2013a b such results suggest that fib inactivation or growth can be at least as important for predicting fib distributions as hydrodynamics in many fib models bacteria are transported with the water while the population decays according to a constant rate bedri et al 2011 banas et al 2015 wen et al 2017 or a decay rate that varies with temperature e g chen and liu 2017 and or light exposure cho et al 2010 along the flow path however if fib movement diverges from that of the water or if inactivation rates are incorrectly parameterized then numerical simulations will deviate from actual conditions even if the model accurately represents complex hydrodynamics light exposure causes inactivation of fib and associated pathogens evison 1988 sinton et al 2002 kay et al 2005 making photoinactivation rates critical to fib models light induced fib inactivation rates can be modified by suspended solids or turbidity whitman et al 2004 kay et al 2005 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 water column depth and time of day davies colley et al 1994 sinton et al 2002 sunlight can cause inactivation through two pathways 1 direct solar radiation damage to nucleic acids and other cellular components malloy et al 1997 schuch and menck 2010 and or 2 the photochemical generation of reactive oxygen species from organic matter maraccini et al 2012 appiani and mcneill 2015 both mechanisms are likely important for enterococci as both uv radiation and visible light cause enterococci decay i e negative light dependent growth davies colley et al 1994 fujioka and yoneyama 2002 sinton et al 2002 also critical to extra enteric ecology are fib growth rates in the absence of light exposure i e dark growth rates which encompass a wide variety of processes such as cell division rates predation and stress induced losses generally increasing temperatures are linked to higher fib inactivation auer and niehaus 1993 schulz and childers 2011 boehm et al 2018 while lower temperatures tend to increase fib persistence bordalo et al 2002 lleodel et al 2005 increased nutrients e g phosphate have been shown to enhance fib persistence and growth in the dark chudoba et al 2013 meanwhile elevated salinity has been reported to increase okabe and shimazu 2007 schulz and childers 2011 decrease bordalo et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 or minimally impact noble et al 2004 ahmed et al 2014 chen and liu 2017 growth rates of various fib net growth rate measurements in ambient waters in darkness thus encompass the effects of multiple abiotic and biotic properties impacting fib persistence high frequency of fib particle association fries et al 2006 krometis et al 2007 cizek et al 2008 walters et al 2014 often greater than that of the background bacterial community ducklow et al 1982 suter et al 2011 further complicates these dynamics particle association is thought to prolong fib environmental persistence o mullan et al 2017 because particles may provide a more favorable environment than the surrounding water lyons et al 2007 2010 due to increased nutrient or solute availability shanks and reeder 1993 kiørboe and jackson 2001 physical stability craig et al 2002 and protection from predation davies and bavor 2000 or other stressors like chemical disinfectants hess erga et al 2008 however bacterivory can also increase on particles lee et al 2011 potentially mitigating some advantages actual growth rate measurements separating particle associated and free living fib are rare garcia armisen and servais 2009 found particle associated e coli dark decay rates in river water to be about 2 5 times lower than rates for free living cells similar rates for enterococci or other fib have not previously been reported particle associated fib are also likely to have appreciable sinking rates auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 although many fib are associated with smaller particles auer and niehaus 1993 jamieson et al 2004 ahn et al 2005 mote et al 2012 implying relatively slow sinking any sinking could impact horizontal transport and eventually lead to deposition in sediments especially in shallow water it is now well established that sediments can constitute a reservoir of settled fib that can be resuspended jamieson et al 2005a fries et al 2008 o mullan et al 2019 highlighting the importance of fib particle association unfortunately the empirical observations needed to separately parameterize particle associated and free living fib populations within water quality models are very limited to date some models used for stream water quality assessment incorporate fib particle association using a free living fib population transported with the water and a second fib population transported with sediment jamieson et al 2005b yang et al 2008 wu et al 2009 kim et al 2010 however as pointed out in cho et al 2016 while different growth rates for these two fib populations could readily be included in such models investigations are not yet robust enough to effectively determine rate constants for both bacteria populations two recent estuarine fib distribution models de brauwere et al 2014 chen and liu 2017 included explicit representation of particle associated and free living populations however neither model included light inactivation both studies acknowledged the potential importance of light dependent rates but also cited a lack of information for appropriate parameterization we are aware of only one previous study investigating light inactivation in combination with particle association using artificial sunlight walters et al 2014 found greater light induced inactivation of fib that were free living or associated with small particles 12 μm in sewage effluent compared to those on larger particles 12 63 μm with the exception of the aforementioned e coli study garcia armisen and servais 2009 separate dark growth rates for particle associated and free living fib have also not been previously measured in addition while a few empirical fib sinking rate measurements are available auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 enterococci sinking rates have not yet been reported in this study we address the hypothesis that particle association increases the persistence of enterococci by providing a more favorable environment our study combines empirical quantification of growth and sinking rates with a 1 dimensional model simulating persistence according to those rates under conditions representing different types of water bodies this is the first work we are aware of that separately quantifies the rates of light dependent growth dark temperature dependent growth and sinking for both free living and particle associated fractions of enterococci further we use these rates in simulations to examine how water column persistence of each enterococci fraction could change in water bodies with different levels of turbidity and turbulence model sensitivity to growth and sinking rate parameterization was tested through additional simulations finally we use simulations to examine the potential impact of discharge timing within a diel cycle on overall enterococci persistence 2 methods 2 1 empirical rate determination 2 1 1 study site near surface water samples were collected from two sites along the piermont pier piermont ny usa that are subject to intermittent municipal sewage pollution 1 near the orangetown and rockland county sewer district wastewater treatment plant outfalls and 2 near a sewage pump station that occasionally overflows and a third nearby site along the frequently sewage contaminated tributary sparkill creek fig a1 o mullan et al 2019 provides additional information about these sites salinity near piermont pier ranged from 0 2 to 10 ppt consistent with its location in the brackish tidal portion of the hudson river estuary hre at each sample collection either a hydrolab hq 40d meter light and temperature growth rate experiments or hydrolab ds5 sinking rate experiments was used to measure temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen hq 40d or turbidity ds5 water clarity was measured using a 300 mm diameter secchi disk see tables a1 and a4 for environmental data for experiments 2 1 2 microbial culturing near surface water samples were collected via bucket cast and stored in sterile polypropylene bottles that were triple rinsed with sample water directly prior to collection samples were immediately transferred to dark coolers until laboratory processing within 2 h of sample collection the particle associated and free living bacterial fractions were separated following crump et al 1999 and suter et al 2011 water samples were filtered under gentle vacuum pressure through 47 mm diameter 3 μm pore polycarbonate membrane filters filtration was paused when a thin film of liquid remained above the filter the filtrate containing the free living fraction was collected then the particle associated fraction above the filter was diluted with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 1 m phosphate in 0 73 nacl and gently filtered again until a thin film of liquid once again remained above the filter the separation step resulted in small losses from both fractions in tests n 8 a mean of 12 8 of the total count passed through the filter on the second filtration step this minor loss from both fractions did not affect our experiments which only required consistently separating the two subpopulations from each other the particle associated fraction was rinsed from the filter tower three times with pbs and this supernatant was transferred into sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles on a shaker table 80 rpm for 6 min to detach microbes from particles the particle associated fraction was reconstituted to the original volume with pbs no viable cells remained on the rinsed polycarbonate membrane filters processed following epa method 1600 for enterococci enumeration us epa 2002 n 6 for each fraction 1 3 subsamples ranging 1 100 ml were filtered onto 0 45 μm gridded mixed ester cellulose membrane filters these filters were incubated on sterile solid mei media for 24 h at 41 c following epa method 1600 colony forming units cfus on each plate were normalized to cfu 100 ml in the original sample total enterococci counts the sum of both fractions were also calculated for each water sample for comparison with previous work 2 1 3 quantifying dark temperature dependent growth rates because fib concentrations typically decline over time in experiments other studies use terminology such as inactivation mortality die off or decay rates to describe the dynamics in our experiments counts occasionally increased over time so we use the term growth rate in this study negative growth rates imply a decline in enterococci concentration over time to quantify dark temperature dependent growth rates a water sample was mixed and divided into 3 sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles that were then placed into 3 dark incubators set to 5 18 and 28 c respectively aliquots 125 ml were removed from gently homogenized bottles after 24 and 48 h the free living and particle associated enterococci remaining in each aliquot were separated and enumerated as described above for every timepoint of each experiment multiple subsamples of different volumes were filtered to ensure some plates would be countable values used in rate calculations were then averaged from 2 to 3 plates per timepoint 2 1 4 quantifying light dependent growth rates for each experiment a water sample was mixed and subsamples approximately 250 ml were added to sterile uv permeable whirlpak sampling bags that were then placed into an outdoor 18 c water bath exposed to full sun this temperature was chosen for experiments because enterococci dark temperature dependent growth rates at 18 c are relatively low table 1 experiments were started near mid day on days with minimal cloud cover downwelling photosynthetically active radiation par was measured using a li cor quantum cosine corrected sensor recording to a li 1400 data logger for normalization between experiments table a3 subsamples collected from the bags after 1 and 2 h of sunlight exposure were processed to separate and enumerate free living and particle associated enterococci as described above also as described above for every timepoint of each experiment multiple subsamples of different volumes were filtered when multiple plates were countable the values were averaged 2 1 5 growth rate calculation for both temperature and light dependent growth rate experiments the concentrations of particle associated and free living enterococci in each container were natural log ln transformed and plotted against time the slope of the linear best fit to the ln transformed data provided the first order exponential growth rate day 1 as in other studies sinton et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 maraccini et al 2016 2 1 6 statistical analysis of growth rates statistical analysis was conducted using r statistical software normal distribution of empirically determined growth rates within each treatment was confirmed via a shapiro wilk test p 0 1 two way analysis of variance anova tests with α 0 05 were used to compare mean growth rates for temperature dependent experiments followed by fisher s least significant difference lsd post hoc pairwise comparisons an unequal variances t test without pairing due to unequal sample numbers was used to test the impact of light on mean growth rates of the two fractions 2 1 7 quantifying sinking rate distributions approximately 25 l of surface water was collected from the end of piermont pier fig a1 on 5 dates table a4 experiments began within 2 h of collection in a temperature controlled room set to match the original sample temperature 2 c following aumack and juhl 2015 we used a homogenous suspension bienfang et al 1977 chancelier et al 1998 approach to measure the sinking rates of inorganic particles organic particles particle associated and free living enterococci a series of replicate 0 4 m high 2 3 l total volume graduated cylinders were used as settling columns with one column per time point at each time point the upper 2 l portion of a given settling column was carefully pumped off leaving an undisturbed 300 ml bottom layer containing all particles that had settled by that time point particle mass accumulated in the bottom layer at each time point was measured using volumetric subsamples filtered onto pre weighed combusted whatman gf f filters 25 mm diameter a small volume of deionized water passed through the filter removed salts and dried filters 100 c for 24 h were reweighed to calculate the total particle mass collected inorganic and organic particle masses were then estimated by loss on ignition apha 2005 after combusting dried filters 450 c for 4 h inorganic and organic particle concentrations in the bottom layers of successive settling columns were calculated for each time point and used to calculate the percent of initial particle mass that remained in suspension 1 s e t t l e d m a s s t o t a l m a s s 100 at each time point to distinguish particle associated and free living enterococci a portion of the 300 ml bottom layer sample was processed for total enterococci and a second subsample was passed through a 3 μm pore diameter membrane filter free living enterococci were those that passed through the filter and the particle associated fraction was calculated by subtraction from the total count quantifying enterococci of both fractions used enterolert with quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories 2013 for most probable number sinking rate estimation began by plotting the percent of each particle or enterococci fraction that remained suspended through time in successive settling columns owen 1976 aumack and juhl 2015 best fit curves regressing the percent suspended against time pooling data across experiments were fit to each type of data statistical comparisons were based on the slopes of these best fit regressions the mean sinking velocity distribution for each type of particle was then calculated following owen 1976 jones and jago 1996 and malarkey et al 2013 2 2 1 dimensional persistence model 2 2 1 model framework to simulate the fate of enterococci in a 1 dimensional water column we employed an advection diffusion decay framework that incorporated the empirically determined first order growth rates consistent with previous studies fuchs et al 2007 rippy et al 2013a 2013b vertical mixing was simulated via turbulent diffusivity d and impacted both fractions sinking s represented as vertical advection only affected the particle associated fraction the general framework is represented by 1 c f l t d 2 c f l z 2 λ f l c f l 2 c p a t d 2 c p a z 2 s c p a z λ p a c p a where c f l or c p a the concentration of free living or particle associated enterococci d turbulent diffusivity meter 2 second z depth meter λ total growth rate second 1 and s sinking rate meter second in these equations both the light and temperature dependent growth rates were incorporated as λ f l o r p a λ l i g h t λ t e m p e r a t u r e simulations were run using a forward in time centered in space ftcs taylor expansion with 1 s time steps for high temporal resolution as an example the ftcs for free living enterococci not at the bottom or top boundary was 3 c t 1 z d t z 2 c t z 1 2 c t z c t z 1 1 t λ l i g h t z d i e l t λ t e m p c t z the diel t function was a light curve multiplier for the light induced loss parameter with a maximum value of 1 and minimum value of 0 diel t was constrained as a sinusoidal function for 16 h and had a value of 0 for the subsequent 8 h to simulate a realistic diel cycle e g summer at 45 latitude the default scenario was for a discrete enterococci discharge occurring immediately prior to sunrise without subsequent discharge discharge timing was manipulated in later simulation runs light dependent growth rates λ l i g h t throughout the water column were modeled similarly to diffuse light attenuation with depth k d such that light dependent growth was directly proportional to light level 4 λ l i g h t z λ l i g h t 0 e k d z where k d the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation par meter 1 and z depth meter note that we did not specify the wavelength for k d as the action spectrum for enterococci inactivation is not known to simulate enterococci persistence in conditions that represent many water body types the model was run over wide ranges of k d 0 2 meters 1 or infinite to 2 3 m depth of 1 light level and d 0 0 01 meters 2 second values that are consistent with literature values table 4 at t 0 the concentration of enterococci was 100 which then advected diffused and decayed following the empirically determined parameters we used t 90 defined as the time for 90 of the initial enterococci to decay to compare across model runs and with previous studies kay et al 2005 brooks and field 2016 concentrations were integrated throughout the water column and the first time point where z 0 m z 20 m c z 10 was t 90 the maximum t 90 was set at 100 h as other environmental factors such as horizontal transport would have a greater role in determining enterococci concentrations so long after introduction into a receiving water body accordingly enterococci populations that would require over 100 h to decay to 10 and those increasing in concentration i e growing were assigned t 90 100 h 2 2 2 sensitivity tests two different sensitivity tests addressed 1 how sensitive is model output to changes in individual parameter values growth and sinking rates and 2 given the observed variability in parameter values how robust is the conclusion that particle association results in longer modeled enterococci persistence for the first question one parameter light or temperature dependent growth or sinking rate was allowed to vary while other parameters were held constant at the experimentally determined mean values referred to as standard run values k d and d values in sensitivity tests were set to represent two environmentally relevant extremes a clear quiescent lake k d 0 087 m 1 d 1 34 10 4 meters 2 second using parameter values from lake tahoe abbott et al 1984 swift et al 2006 and a turbid turbulent estuary k d 2 0 m 1 d 0 01 meters 2 second like the hudson river estuary stross and sokol 1989 orton and kineke 2001 using means and standard deviations of the empirical data a vector of light dependent and temperature dependent growth rates with a normal distribution was generated light growth rates were represented as a truncated normal distribution with values constrained to 0 representing the assumption that light will not enhance enterococci growth sinking rates followed a gamma distribution of shape 0 5 and scale 2 a vector of randomly sampled rates from each distribution was generated and the mean and variances of each vector were compared to the empirical observations to ensure similarity for each of the 1000 simulations per parameter and per fraction 6000 total simulation runs a single growth or sinking rate was selected at random from this vector and then the model was run forward 96 h with all other parameters held constant at standard run values sensitivity was quantified using the deviation range normalized root mean squared deviation of sensitivity test simulation runs from standard run values yielding a measure of variability v in modeled t 90 based on n variations of the empirically determined parameters 5 v n 1 n n t 90 m e a n t 90 n 2 n t 90 max t 90 min a value of v 0 would indicate that the model output is fully insensitive to changes in a given parameter a second set of sensitivity tests assessed the importance of particle association on enterococci persistence throughout the parameter space defined by variability in all empirically measured parameters simultaneously in the 1000 simulations per condition and per fraction for these tests light and temperature dependent growth and sinking rates were all randomly selected from new vectors of the rates that had distributions similar to the empirical observations simulations were run for the lake and estuarine k d and d conditions with the difference in t 90 between particle associated and free living fractions as the output the distribution of these differences was then compared to simulations using standard value runs 3 results 3 1 empirical rates 3 1 1 dark temperature dependent growth rates environmental conditions for samples used in dark growth rate experiments are shown in table a1 table 2 shows mean dark growth rates of the free living particle associated and total enterococci at each experimental temperature raw data from each experiment are shown in table a2 a two

57 on enterococci growth rates post hoc testing confirmed that the particle associated fraction had significantly higher growth rates than the free living fraction 3 1 2 light dependent growth rates environmental conditions for samples used in light dependent growth rate experiments are shown in table a1 raw data incident light for normalization and normalized light dependent growth rates are shown in table a3 table 2 shows mean normalized light dependent growth rates for the free living particle associated and total enterococci at 18 c light dependent growth rates were all negative and 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than dark growth rates at the same temperature previous section using an unequal variances unpaired t test free living and particle associated light dependent growth rates were found to be significantly different t 11 9 2 4 p 0 032 from one another 3 1 3 sinking rates environmental conditions for samples used in sinking rate experiments are shown in table a4 inorganic and organic particles remaining in suspension declined significantly over time with organic particles sinking significantly slower f 1 50 28 24 p 0 001 fig 1 a a similar analysis for particle associated enterococci remaining in suspension fig 1b produced an exponential best fit with a significantly negative slope f 1 23 119 2 p 0 0001 in contrast a linear regression applied to free living enterococci indicated no significant change over time p 0 12 the best fit curves from fig 1a b were used to estimate the mean sinking rate spectra of inorganic particles organic particles and particle associated enterococci fig 1c free living cells did not sink appreciably during these experiments while at least some particle associated cells sank at rates greater than 1 m day though it is also likely that many particle associated cells had negligible sinking rates 3 2 model results 3 2 1 free living enterococci t 90 fl t 90 generally fl t 90 i e persistence of free living enterococci increased with diffuse light attenuation k d and turbulent diffusivity d fig 2 a when turbulent diffusivity was near 0 i e limiting vertical motion of free living enterococci variation in k d had minimal impact on fl t 90 1 increase however even slight increases in turbulent diffusivity above zero dramatically increased the effect of k d on prolonging fl t 90 meanwhile for most values of k d increasing d prolonged fl t 90 3 2 2 particle associated enterococci t 90 pa t 90 patterns of pa t 90 were similar to those of fl t 90 though for all combinations of k d and d pa t 90 was longer fig 2b in addition pa t 90 was more sensitive to changes in k d or d in the sense that a given change in k d or d increased pa t 90 more than fl t 90 above d 5 10 6 meters 2 second pa t 90 often exceeded the model s maximum simulation time of 100 h effectively reaching infinite persistence within the modeled domain indicated by the pink color contour 3 2 3 difference in enterococci t 90 δ t 90 the difference in simulated t 90 of each fraction δ t 90 p a t 90 f l t 90 was consistently greater than 0 indicating that particle associated enterococci persisted longer than free living enterococci in standard simulation runs at all values of k d and d fig 2c the difference in persistence between fractions ranged 1 7 96 h 1 5 13 x greater the difference between fractions was minimized overall when k d or d were near zero the difference between fractions was also most sensitive to changes in k d when d was low specifically under low to moderate d 0 5 10 5 meters 2 second pa t 90 increased more up to 15x greater than fl t 90 up to 6 5 x greater as k d increased from 0 to 2 meter 1 at higher d values changes in k d had less effect on the difference between fractions the greatest difference in t 90 between fractions blue contour fig 2c occurred with low d and moderate to high k d values a region of similar difference also extended throughout the diffusivity range at moderate k d values 3 2 4 diel cycle effects on enterococci t 90 in addition to the default discharge immediately prior to sunrise presented above simulations were run with inputs of enterococci occurring at different times throughout the 16 h day and 8 h night cycle simulated discharges occurring later in the day consistently increased t 90 of both free living and particle associated fractions fig 3 figs a3 and a4 relative to the default discharge scenario sunrise fig 2 with the greatest difference for discharge at 16 h sunset fig 3 simulated discharge at 16 h increased the minimum simulated t 90 for both free living 4 6 to 12 5 h and particle associated 6 4 to 14 5 h fractions later discharges had a greater effect on fl t 90 than on pa t 90 particularly in regions of moderate to high k d and low diffusivity in general fl t 90 was more variable across the range of k d and d values and over various discharge times than pa t 90 therefore patterns in the δ t 90 plots primarily reflect the patterns of fl t 90 3 2 5 sensitivity tests the first set of sensitivity tests that examined model sensitivity to changes in one set of rates at a time demonstrated a greater sensitivity i e increased variability v of t 90 to dark compared to light dependent growth rates in addition fl t 90 was more sensitive to rate changes than pa t 90 and sensitivity of both fractions was greater for the higher k d and d values representing estuarine conditions compared to the simulations representing a clear quiescent lake fig 4 for example allowing dark growth rates to vary under the estuarine conditions generated greater v for fl t 90 v 0 33 than pa t 90 v 0 24 variability in t 90 values was lower in sensitivity tests using the clear quiescent lake conditions though changes in dark growth rates still caused more variability in fl t 90 v 0 145 than in pa t 90 v 0 139 allowing light dependent growth rates to vary had the greatest impact on fl t 90 under estuarine conditions v 0 248 though persistence of the particle associated fraction was always infinite in those conditions resulting in 0 computed variability within the sensitivity runs in lake conditions free living v 0 081 and particle associated v 0 070 persistence was relatively insensitive to varying light dependent growth rates fig 4 only pa t 90 under lake conditions was measurably sensitive to varying sinking rates v 0 0897 as pa t 90 in turbid turbulent estuarine conditions consistently reached the maximum or infinite t 90 values regardless of sinking rate the simulated free living fraction did not sink so fl t 90 values did not change with different sinking rates in the second set of sensitivity tests where all rates were allowed to vary between successive simulation runs pa t 90 was greater than fl t 90 for 80 7 of lake trials and for 88 5 of estuarine trials in some runs t 90 of both fractions exceeded 100 h because of the negative mean dark growth rates for free living vs positive mean dark growth rates of particle associated enterococci trials with t 90 of both fractions exceeding 100 h δ t 90 0 were counted towards greater persistence by the particle associated fraction in the percentages given above fl t 90 and pa t 90 were more sensitive to rate changes under estuarine v 0 35 and v 0 28 respectively than lake v 0 09 and v 0 12 respectively conditions also using equation 5 for δ t 90 sensitivity of δ t 90 values to rate changes was lower for the lake vs estuarine conditions v 0 073 and 0 243 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 empirically determined growth and sinking rates while numerous studies have quantified growth or decay rates of enterococci and other fibs this is the first study to separately quantify growth rates for particle associated and free living enterococci populations the higher light dependent and dark growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci are consistent with arguments that particles provide a more favorable environment for bacteria including fib the two fractions also differed because particle associated enterococci had measurable sinking rates while the free living fraction remained suspended these quantitative differences in rates that are critical for fib ecological dynamics in receiving water bodies highlight the important distinctions between these two fractions 4 1 1 dark temperature dependent growth the temperature dependence of mean dark growth rates measured in this study for the total fraction of enterococci was consistent with previous empirical studies many studies have reported more negative dark growth rates at high temperatures and growth rates closer to 0 per day at low temperatures craig et al 2002 noble et al 2004 boehm et al 2018 further greater persistence of fib observed in winter than summer maïga et al 2009 maraccini et al 2016 ballesté et al 2018 has been partially attributed to lower temperatures however our results demonstrate that temperature dependence of total fraction growth rates in our experiments was primarily driven by the free living fraction as mean particle associated enterococci growth rates were more consistent across the temperature range note that mean dark growth rates of the particle associated fraction were positive at every temperature while those of the free living fraction became negative at higher temperatures therefore some of the variability of temperature dependent growth rates in previous studies may be due to the variable degree of particle association of fib in the population studied based on results of this study dark growth rates measured for a predominantly free living population of enterococci could show greater temperature dependence and overall be more negative while less temperature dependence and even positive growth rates could be found in a population of enterococci that was predominantly particle associated dark growth rates of total enterococci measured in this study were also comparable to the means and variability reported in other studies at similar temperatures table 3 in our data mean dark growth rates were towards the higher end of the range of values at each temperature presented in table 3 implying longer persistence this was most notable at 5 c where all fractions of enterococci experienced positive growth contrary to the low negative growth for fib commonly observed at this temperature e g evison 1988 menon et al 2003 positive extra enteric growth of enterococci has been observed in sediments e g jeng et al 2005 yamahara et al 2009 in association with organic rich substrates such as algae and vegetation e g byappanahalli et al 2003 byappanahalli and whitman 2009 imamura et al 2011 and in treated wastewater with high dissolved nutrients surbeck et al 2010 therefore our relatively high growth rates could be related to high levels of dissolved organic matter in the hudson river findlay 2005 similarly higher substrate availability on particles could contribute to the elevated dark growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci because dark growth rates aggregate numerous ecological and physiological processes other potential advantages of particle association davies and bavor 2000 craig et al 2002 hess erga et al 2008 may also drive differences in dark growth rates observed between the two fractions in any case our data support the hypothesis that particle association benefits enterococci survival similar to results reported for particle associated e coli garcia armisen and servais 2009 furthermore positive growth for the particle associated fraction of enterococci contradicts the general assumption that the extra enteric ecology of fib populations is dominated by loss it remains an open question if other sewage derived bacteria have similar particle association and ecological dynamics 4 1 2 light dependent growth consistent with previous studies enterococci growth rates under sunlight exposure were significantly more negative than dark growth rates the mean and variance of light dependent growth rates of total enterococci observed in this study fall within ranges reported in the literature table 3 high variability of reported rates within and between studies is unsurprising as different factors can interact with light to alter light induced inactivation rates davies colley et al 1994 maïga et al 2009 yeh et al 2011 furthermore our study is based on short experiments during maximum sunlight exposure and minimal cloud cover so the rates we report are likely the maximum for the day the more negative light dependent growth rates of free living enterococci in this study are consistent with size fractionation studies that report the most negative fib light dependent growth rates for the smallest size fractions which include free living cells qualls et al 1983 madge and jensen 2006 walters et al 2014 differing growth rates reported for various size fractions could relate to differences in shading efficacy however we cannot resolve the mechanism responsible for the higher mean light dependent growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci from our experiments indicating future research is warranted 4 1 3 sinking rate distribution direct observations of fib sinking rates are rare but the reported range of 0 5 1 6 m day for particle associated fecal coliforms and e coli auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 encompasses particle associated enterococci sinking rates found in this study some modeling studies have used ideal calculations of particle deposition and resuspension steets and holden 2003 sanders et al 2005 or stokes law cho et al 2010 for estimating sinking of fib much higher particle associated fib sinking rates have been estimated in streams where the particles are predominantly resuspended sediment jamieson et al 2005a particle size preference of fib likely influences sinking rates fib sinking rates that are slow relative to the rest of the particle field like in this study suggest dominant fib attachment to smaller particles previous studies have often found fib to be more frequently associated with fine sediments and particles davies and bavor 2000 jamieson et al 2004 walters et al 2014 though not always mote et al 2012 particle composition also very likely plays a role in altering sinking rates through particle density and structure by assessing a sinking rate distribution rather than a mean rate this study encompasses some of the variability in enterococci sinking due to particle composition further research on particle size or type preference of sewage microbes would better constrain sinking rates that should be used in models of fib persistence 4 2 simulated persistence of particle associated and free living enterococci recent fib modeling studies cite a lack of confidence in parameterizing distinct growth rates for particle associated and free living fib this is the first modeling study to 1 incorporate empirically quantified distinct growth rates for particle associated and free living enterococci and 2 simulate how variation in light exposure with time of day and depth could affect fib persistence results of these simulations demonstrate distinct ecological dynamics for particle associated vs free living enterococci stemming from quantitative differences in critical rates which supports measuring the two fractions as distinct populations and considering the impacts of fib particle association in water quality management 4 2 1 modeled dark growth many models represent fib growth via background rates that depend on temperature neitsch et al 2009 hipsey et al 2008 kim et al 2010 niazi et al 2015 and sometimes salinity chen and liu 2017 our total enterococci growth rates support the former though temperature influenced dark growth rates less than particle association salinity impacts were not included in our model because we found no impact of salinity in our experiments and literature reports of the impact of salinity are inconsistent suggesting lower enterococci sensitivity to salinity than other fib noble et al 2004 anderson et al 2005 4 2 2 modeled light dependent growth some previous fib models have highlighted the importance of light effects on fib growth rates including light variability due to day vs night sunlight intensity depth and water column turbidity auer and niehaus 1993 hellweger and masopust 2008 cho et al 2010 gao et al 2015 however light dependence was also omitted or not explicitly incorporated in other previous modeling studies russo et al 2011 chen and liu 2017 wen et al 2017 at least partly due to insufficient data including variable light dependent growth rates improved model validation against field data in some cases cho et al 2010 though not in others hellweger and masopust 2008 rippy et al 2013a in rippy et al 2013a the lack of impact of varying light dependent growth rates on model outputs could be due to the relatively short study duration 5 h sunlight exposure while hellweger and masopust 2008 argued that their model may have been biased by using a single water column k d throughout their study region our simulations indicated that varying k d notably altered fib persistence supporting the argument that use of a single k d value could weaken model validation against field data moreover the combined dependence in our model of light dependent growth rates on time of day light attenuation and depth in water column underscored the importance of including variability of light in fib persistence predictions 4 2 3 distinguishing particle associated and free living enterococci incorporation of subpopulations with different growth rates as in this study is rare in fib models uniform growth rate parameters are commonly imposed across total fib populations hipsey et al 2008 coffey et al 2010 bougeard et al 2011 pandey et al 2016 though some models have simulated fib populations of differential persistence sadeghi and arnold 2002 hellweger and masopust 2008 bucci et al 2012 rippy et al 2013b or distinguished particle associated and free living fib de brauwere et al 2014 chen and liu 2017 when included in fib fate models particle association is primarily linked to transport processes like resuspension and deposition to the sediments r c jamieson et al 2005 r jamieson et al 2005 yang et al 2008 cho et al 2010 kim et al 2010 feng et al 2016 though debrauwere et al 2014 included a positive impact of particle association on growth rates of e coli the divergent persistence between independently parameterized particle associated and free living fractions in our simulations suggests that future fib modeling studies should distinguish these subpopulations whether or not sediment resuspension is incorporated within the model 4 2 4 simulated impacts of k d and d on persistence in our model k d and d reflective of literature values table 4 control enterococci persistence as all fractions can be transported vertically via turbulent motion d and particle associated cells also sink both processes that alter light exposure in accordance with k d because solar inactivation of fib is caused by both uv and visible light fujioka et al 1981 davies colley et al 1994 sinton et al 2002 k d values in these simulations can be contextualized by comparisons to k d par however the conclusions of this study are not based on wavelength specific k d and predictions for any wavelength band could be extracted by selecting an appropriate k d value in our simulations high k d values lowered the effect of light exposure on growth rates at each depth making net growth rates more dependent on dark growth rates these trends are consistent with experiments demonstrating that light dependent growth rates of enterococci are less negative with increasing turbidity alkan et al 1995 whitman et al 2004 kay et al 2005 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 and that rates in turbid water were similar to dark growth rates kay et al 2005 in addition the proportionality of light dependent growth rates in our model as light exposure changes due to depth and time of day is supported by commensurate changes in fib growth rates with varying light exposure due to turbidity kay et al 2005 depth davies colley et al 1994 and exposure time auer and niehaus 1993 sinton et al 2002 turbulence as represented by d primarily affected enterococci persistence in our model by impacting their depth distribution which altered light exposure according to k d our simulations suggest interactive effects of k d and d as seen by the greater increase in t 90 of both fractions when k d and d increased together as opposed to separately impacts of turbulence on enterococci growth rates or water column concentrations in previous studies have also been linked to changes in turbidity palmateer et al 1989 whitman et al 2004 demonstrating empirical support for an interaction between turbulence and turbidity on fib direct effects of turbulence on fib growth rates have been suggested al homoud and hondzo 2008 though are not included in this model vertical mixing has also been previously connected to increased water column concentrations of fib through resuspension of sediment bound fib steets and holden 2003 craig et al 2004 while the source potential of longer persisting enterococci at depth is acknowledged in our model by the mixing up from deeper layers of both fractions we did not explicitly include deposition or resuspension from sediments at every value of k d and d in the standard run simulations particle associated enterococci persisted longer than free living enterococci minimal δ t 90 corresponded to when k d or d were close to 0 reflecting clear and or quiescent conditions while greater δ t 90 corresponded to higher k d and d representing more turbid and or turbulent waters variation in δ t 90 between fractions predominantly reflected patterns of fl t 90 and was greatest at the transitions from low to moderate values of both k d and d it is worth noting that the sharp contrast surrounding the regions of maximal δ t 90 transition from dark blue to lighter blue contours in the upper portion of fig 2c is partially due to the imposed maximum t 90 value of 100 h in these simulations had simulations been run longer the dark blue region of maximum difference would likely extend further along the axis of increasing k d 4 2 5 simulated diel cycle effects on persistence in urban areas where fib abundance is dominated by intermittent point source discharges e g combined sewer overflows sewage discharges can occur at different times throughout the diel cycle with correspondingly altered light exposure for discharged fib in this study persistence for both fractions increased for simulated discharges occurring closer to sunset 16 h due to the interaction between turbulence and light exposure for example simulated discharges at sunset 16 h allowed a portion of both enterococci fractions to be transported deeper in the water column before sunrise decreasing cumulative light induced inactivation and increasing t 90 values by at least 24 h compared to modeled sunrise discharge simulated free living enterococci benefited the most from mixing during dark period hours the greatest increase in simulated fl t 90 occurred at low to moderate d and high k d when some cells were transported into low light deep layers as in the sunrise discharge scenario at high d vertical transport increased cumulative light exposure of simulated enterococci and decreased persistence results from these simulations suggest that discharge timing within a diel cycle may be an important factor in predicting enterococci persistence future fib studies could include high frequency sampling within a diel cycle to test this hypothesis against field measurements 4 3 model sensitivity testing in model sensitivity tests fl t 90 was generally more variable than pa t 90 and simulated estuarine conditions led to greater fl t 90 variability than in the lake simulations higher variability under estuarine conditions was due to the steeper vertical gradient in light exposure with depth than in the lake conditions one caveat to these tests was that variability in pa t 90 was not calculated for the estuarine simulations because the time scale exceeded 100 h nevertheless in both estuarine and lake conditions 80 90 of simulations from the second set of sensitivity tests where all rates were allowed to vary resulted in greater persistence of particle associated than free living enterococci the consistency of this result across wide parameter ranges strongly supports the hypothesis that particle association can prolong fib environmental persistence in general of the parameters manipulated in sensitivity testing our model was most sensitive to changes in dark growth rate however the lower model sensitivity to variable light dependent growth rates does not indicate a lack of importance of these rates for predicting persistence in simulations where light dependent growth rates were omitted from our model t 90 was 100 hours for both fractions throughout the range of k d and d data not shown similarly the importance of light dependent growth rates on persistence is shown by the effect of k d on t 90 patterns of both fractions sinking rates only affected the particle associated fraction and under the lake conditions resulted in pa t 90 variability that fell between light and dark pa t 90 variability sinking rate sensitivity tests therefore suggest that empirically well constrained sinking rates are more important for predicting particle associated fib persistence under lake compared to estuarine conditions overall simulations in which sinking rate was omitted led to similar t 90 predictions of particle associated enterococci except at relatively low k d and d conditions fig a5 sensitivity tests where all rates were modified resulted in variability similar to sensitivity tests where only dark growth rates varied underscoring the relative importance of quantifying dark growth rates for modeling fib persistence 5 conclusions particle association of enterococci increased critical growth rates and induced sinking leading to longer simulated persistence of the particle associated vs free living fraction across a wide range of physically relevant values of diffuse light attenuation and turbulent diffusivity future experiments could especially focus on constraining fraction specific dark temperature dependent growth rates due to the high sensitivity of simulated persistence to this rate the generally higher sensitivity of simulated persistence to changes in all rates in the estuarine scenario suggests that empirical rate determination is especially critical in turbid and turbulent water bodies further increased simulated persistence of both enterococci fractions with discharges later in the day suggests that further research should examine the effects of sewage discharge time within the diel cycle on downstream fib persistence the important role of particle association in the extra enteric ecology of enterococci persistence revealed in this study suggests that future research should assess the impacts of particle association for other sewage

17536,predicting water quality and the human health risks associated with sewage derived microbes requires understanding the fate and transport of these contaminants sewage derived pathogen risks are typically assessed and monitored by measuring concentrations of fecal indicating bacteria fib like enterococcus sp previous research demonstrated that a high fraction of fib is particle associated which can alter fib dynamics within secondary water bodies in this study we experimentally quantified the effect of particle association on dark temperature and light dependent growth and sinking rates of enterococci particle association significantly increased dark growth rates light dependent growth rates i e decreased mortality and sinking rates relative to free living enterococci simulations using a novel 1 dimensional model parameterized by these rates indicate greater persistence t 90 for particle associated enterococci in water bodies across a wide range of diffuse attenuation coefficients of light k d and turbulent diffusivity d values in addition persistence of both fractions increased in simulated turbid and turbulent waters compared to clear and or quiescent conditions simulated persistence of both fractions also increased when enterococci discharges occurred later in a diel cycle towards sunset as opposed to sunrise especially for the free living population because later discharges under our model conditions allowed both fractions to mix deeper before inactivation via sunlight model sensitivity testing revealed that t 90 variability was greatest when dark growth rates were altered suggesting that future empirical studies should focus on quantifying these rates for free living and particle associated sewage derived microbes despite greater sensitivity of t 90 to variability in dark growth rates omitting light dependent growth rates from simulations dramatically influenced t 90 values our results demonstrate that particle association can increase enterococci persistence in receiving waters and highlight the importance of incorporating particle association in future water quality models graphical abstract image 1

physical advection and diffusion are critical for understanding fib distributions models that omit fib inactivation typically perform poorly relative to observations even over very short time and space scales e g over a few hours and only 100s of meters rippy et al 2013a b such results suggest that fib inactivation or growth can be at least as important for predicting fib distributions as

varies with temperature e g chen and liu 2017 and or light exposure cho et al 2010 along the flow path however if fib movement diverges from that of the water or if inactivation rates are incorrectly

multiple abiotic and biotic properties impacting fib persistence high frequency of fib particle association fries et al 2006 krometis et al 2007 cizek et al 2008 walters et al 2014 often greater than that of the background bacterial community ducklow et al 1982 suter et al 2011 further complicates these dynamics particle association is thought to prolong fib environmental persistence o mullan et al 2017 because particles may provide a more favorable environment than the surrounding water lyons et al 2007 2010 due to increased nutrient or solute availability shanks and reeder 1993 kiørboe and jackson 2001 physical stability craig et al 2002 and protection from predation davies and bavor 2000 or other stressors like chemical disinfectants hess erga et al 2008 however bacterivory can also increase on particles lee et al 2011 potentially mitigating some advantages actual growth rate measurements separating particle associated and free living fib are rare garcia armisen and servais 2009 found particle associated e coli dark decay rates in river water to be about 2 5 times lower than rates for free living cells similar rates for enterococci or other fib have not previously been reported particle associated fib are also likely to have appreciable sinking rates auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 although many fib are associated with smaller particles auer and niehaus 1993 jamieson et al 2004 ahn et al 2005 mote et al 2012 implying relatively slow sinking any sinking could impact horizontal transport and eventually lead to deposition in sediments especially in shallow water it is now well established that sediments can constitute a reservoir of settled fib that can be resuspended jamieson et al 2005a fries et al 2008 o mullan et al 2019 highlighting the importance of fib particle association unfortunately the empirical observations needed to separately parameterize particle associated and free living fib populations within water quality models are very limited to date some models used for stream water quality assessment incorporate fib particle association using a free living fib population transported with the water and a second fib population transported with sediment jamieson et al 2005b yang et al 2008 wu et al 2009 kim et al 2010 however as pointed out in cho et al 2016 while different growth rates for these two fib populations could readily be included in such models investigations are not yet robust enough to effectively determine rate constants for both bacteria populations two recent estuarine fib distribution models de brauwere et al 2014 chen and liu 2017 included explicit representation of particle associated and free living populations however neither model included light inactivation both studies acknowledged the potential importance of light dependent rates but also cited a lack of information for appropriate parameterization we are aware of only one previous study investigating light inactivation in combination with particle association using artificial sunlight walters et al 2014 found greater light induced inactivation of fib that were free living or associated with small particles 12 μm in sewage effluent compared to those on larger particles 12 63 μm with the exception of the aforementioned e coli study garcia armisen and servais 2009 separate dark growth rates for particle associated and free living fib have also not been previously measured in addition while a few empirical fib sinking rate measurements are available auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 enterococci sinking rates have not yet been reported in this study we address the hypothesis that particle association increases the persistence of enterococci by providing a more favorable environment our study combines empirical quantification of growth and sinking rates with a 1 dimensional model simulating persistence according to those rates under conditions representing different types of water bodies this is the first work we are aware of that separately quantifies the rates of light dependent growth dark temperature dependent growth and sinking for both free living and particle associated fractions of enterococci further we use these rates in simulations to examine how water column persistence of each enterococci fraction could change in water bodies with different levels of turbidity and turbulence model sensitivity to growth and sinking rate parameterization was tested through additional simulations finally we use simulations to examine the potential impact of discharge timing within a diel cycle on overall enterococci persistence 2 methods 2 1 empirical rate determination 2 1 1 study site near surface water samples were collected from two sites along the piermont pier piermont ny usa that are subject to intermittent municipal sewage pollution 1 near the orangetown and rockland county sewer district wastewater treatment plant outfalls and 2 near a sewage pump station that occasionally overflows and a third nearby site along the frequently sewage contaminated tributary sparkill creek fig a1 o mullan et al 2019 provides additional information about these sites salinity near piermont pier ranged from 0 2 to 10 ppt consistent with its location in the brackish tidal portion of the hudson river estuary hre at each sample collection either a hydrolab hq 40d meter light and temperature growth rate experiments or hydrolab ds5 sinking rate experiments was used to measure temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen hq 40d or turbidity ds5 water clarity was measured using a 300 mm diameter secchi disk see tables a1 and a4 for environmental data for experiments 2 1 2 microbial culturing near surface water samples were collected via bucket cast and stored in sterile polypropylene bottles that were triple rinsed with sample water directly prior to collection samples were immediately transferred to dark coolers until laboratory processing within 2 h of sample collection the particle associated and free living bacterial fractions were separated following crump et al 1999 and suter et al 2011 water samples were filtered under gentle vacuum pressure through 47 mm diameter 3 μm pore polycarbonate membrane filters filtration was paused when a thin film of liquid remained above the filter the filtrate containing the free living fraction was collected then the particle associated fraction above the filter was diluted with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 1 m phosphate in 0 73 nacl and gently filtered again until a thin film of liquid once again remained above the filter the separation step resulted in small losses from both fractions in tests n 8 a mean of 12 8 of the total count passed through the filter on the second filtration step this minor loss from both fractions did not affect our experiments which only required consistently separating the two subpopulations from each other the particle associated fraction was rinsed from the filter tower three times with pbs and this supernatant was transferred into sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles on a shaker table 80 rpm for 6 min to detach microbes from particles the particle associated fraction was reconstituted to the original volume with pbs no viable cells remained on the rinsed polycarbonate membrane filters processed following epa method 1600 for enterococci enumeration us epa 2002 n 6 for each fraction 1 3 subsamples ranging 1 100 ml were filtered onto 0 45 μm gridded mixed ester cellulose membrane filters these filters were incubated on sterile solid mei media for 24 h at 41 c following epa method 1600 colony forming units cfus on each plate were normalized to cfu 100 ml in the original sample total enterococci counts the sum of both fractions were also calculated for each water sample for comparison with previous work 2 1 3 quantifying dark temperature dependent growth rates because fib concentrations typically decline over time in experiments other studies use terminology such as inactivation mortality die off or decay rates to describe the dynamics in our experiments counts occasionally increased over time so we use the term growth rate in this study negative growth rates imply a decline in enterococci concentration over time to quantify dark temperature dependent growth rates a water sample was mixed and divided into 3 sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles that were then placed into 3 dark incubators set to 5 18 and 28 c respectively aliquots 125 ml were removed from gently homogenized bottles after 24 and 48 h the free living and particle associated enterococci remaining in each aliquot were separated and enumerated as described above for every timepoint of each experiment multiple subsamples of different volumes were filtered to ensure some plates would be countable values used in rate calculations were then averaged from 2 to 3 plates per timepoint 2 1 4 quantifying light dependent growth rates for each experiment a water sample was mixed and subsamples approximately 250 ml were added to sterile uv permeable whirlpak sampling bags that were then placed into an outdoor 18 c water bath exposed to full sun this temperature was chosen for experiments because enterococci dark temperature dependent growth rates at 18 c are relatively low table 1 experiments were started near mid day on days with minimal cloud cover downwelling photosynthetically active radiation par was measured using a li cor quantum cosine corrected sensor recording to a li 1400 data logger for normalization between experiments table a3 subsamples collected from the bags after 1 and 2 h of sunlight exposure were processed to separate and enumerate free living and particle associated enterococci as described above also as described above for every timepoint of each experiment multiple subsamples of different volumes were filtered when multiple plates were countable the values were averaged 2 1 5 growth rate calculation for both temperature and light dependent growth rate experiments the concentrations of particle associated and free living enterococci in each container were natural log ln transformed and plotted against time the slope of the linear best fit to the ln transformed data provided the first order exponential growth rate day 1 as in other studies sinton et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 maraccini et al 2016 2 1 6 statistical analysis of growth rates statistical analysis was conducted using r statistical software normal distribution of empirically determined growth rates within each treatment was confirmed via a shapiro wilk test p 0 1 two way analysis of variance anova tests with α 0 05 were used to compare mean growth rates for temperature dependent experiments followed by fisher s least significant difference lsd post hoc pairwise comparisons an unequal variances t test without pairing due to unequal sample numbers was used to test the impact of light on mean growth rates of the two fractions 2 1 7 quantifying sinking rate distributions approximately 25 l of surface water was collected from the end of piermont pier fig a1 on 5 dates table a4 experiments began within 2 h of collection in a temperature controlled room set to match the original sample temperature 2 c following aumack and juhl 2015 we used a homogenous suspension bienfang et al 1977 chancelier et al 1998 approach to measure the sinking rates of inorganic particles organic particles particle associated and free living enterococci a series of replicate 0 4 m high 2 3 l total volume graduated cylinders were used as settling columns with one column per time point at each time point the upper 2 l portion of a given settling column was carefully pumped off leaving an undisturbed 300 ml bottom layer containing all particles that had settled by that time point particle mass accumulated in the bottom layer at each time point was measured using volumetric subsamples filtered onto pre weighed combusted whatman gf f filters 25 mm diameter a small volume of deionized water passed through the filter removed salts and dried filters 100 c for 24 h were reweighed to calculate the total particle mass collected inorganic and organic particle masses were then estimated by loss on ignition apha 2005 after combusting dried filters 450 c for 4 h inorganic and organic particle concentrations in the

pooling data across experiments were fit to each type of data statistical comparisons were based on the slopes of these best fit regressions the mean sinking velocity distribution for each type of

consistent with literature values table 4 at t 0 the concentration of enterococci was 100 which then advected diffused and decayed following the empirically determined parameters we used t 90 defined as the time for 90 of the initial enterococci to decay to compare across model runs and with previous studies kay et al 2005 brooks and field 2016 concentrations were integrated throughout the water column and the first time point where z 0 m z 20 m c z 10 was t 90 the maximum t 90 was set at 100 h as other environmental factors such as horizontal transport would have a greater role in determining enterococci concentrations so long after introduction into a receiving water body accordingly enterococci populations that would require over 100 h to decay to 10 and those increasing in concentration i e growing were assigned t 90 100 h 2 2 2 sensitivity tests two different sensitivity tests addressed 1 how sensitive is model output to changes in individual parameter values growth and sinking rates and 2 given the observed variability in parameter values how robust is the conclusion that particle association results in longer modeled enterococci persistence for the first question one parameter light or temperature dependent growth or sinking rate was allowed to vary while other parameters were held constant at the experimentally determined mean values referred to as standard run values k d and d values in sensitivity tests were set to represent two environmentally relevant extremes a clear quiescent lake k d 0 087 m 1 d 1 34 10 4 meters 2 second using parameter values from lake tahoe abbott et al 1984 swift et al 2006 and a turbid turbulent estuary k d 2 0 m 1 d 0 01 meters 2 second like the hudson river estuary stross and sokol 1989 orton and kineke 2001 using means and standard deviations of the empirical data a vector of light dependent and temperature dependent growth rates with a normal distribution was generated light growth rates were represented as a truncated normal distribution with values constrained to 0 representing the assumption that light will not enhance enterococci growth sinking rates followed a gamma distribution of shape 0 5 and scale 2 a vector of randomly sampled rates from each distribution was generated and the mean and variances of each vector were compared to the empirical observations to ensure similarity for each of the 1000 simulations per parameter and per fraction 6000 total simulation runs a single growth or sinking rate was selected at random from this vector and then the model was run forward 96 h with all other parameters held constant at standard run values sensitivity was quantified using the deviation range normalized root mean squared deviation of sensitivity test simulation runs from standard run values yielding a measure of variability v in modeled t 90 based on n variations of the empirically determined parameters 5 v n 1 n n t 90 m e a n t 90 n 2 n t 90 max t 90 min a value of v 0 would indicate that the model output is fully insensitive to changes in a given parameter a second set of sensitivity tests assessed the importance of particle association on enterococci persistence throughout the parameter space defined by variability in all empirically measured parameters simultaneously in the 1000 simulations per condition and per fraction for these tests light and temperature dependent growth and sinking rates were all randomly selected from new vectors of the rates that had distributions similar to the empirical observations simulations were run for the lake and estuarine k d and d conditions with the difference in t 90 between particle associated and free living fractions as the output the distribution of these differences was then compared to simulations using standard value runs 3 results 3 1 empirical rates 3 1 1 dark temperature dependent growth rates environmental conditions for samples used in dark growth rate experiments are shown in

shown in table a3 table 2 shows mean normalized light dependent growth rates for the free living particle associated and total enterococci at 18 c light dependent growth rates were all negative and 1

associated enterococci fig 1c free living cells did not sink appreciably during these experiments while at least some particle associated cells sank at rates greater than 1 m day though it is also likely that many particle associated cells had negligible sinking rates 3 2 model results 3 2 1 free living enterococci t 90 fl t 90 generally fl t 90 i e persistence of free living enterococci increased with diffuse light attenuation k d and turbulent diffusivity d fig 2 a when turbulent diffusivity was near 0 i e limiting vertical motion of free living enterococci variation in k d had minimal impact on fl t 90 1 increase however even slight increases in turbulent diffusivity above zero dramatically increased the effect of k d on prolonging fl t 90 meanwhile for most values of k d increasing d prolonged fl t 90 3 2 2 particle associated enterococci t 90 pa t 90 patterns of pa t 90 were similar to those of fl t 90 though for all combinations of k d and d pa t 90 was longer fig 2b in addition pa t 90 was more sensitive to changes in k d or d in the sense that a given change in k d or d increased pa t 90 more than fl t 90 above d 5 10 6 meters 2 second pa t 90 often exceeded the model s maximum simulation time of 100 h effectively reaching infinite persistence within the modeled domain indicated by the pink color contour 3 2 3 difference in enterococci t 90 δ t 90 the difference in simulated t 90 of each fraction δ t 90 p a t 90 f l t 90 was consistently greater than 0 indicating that particle associated enterococci persisted longer than free living enterococci in standard simulation runs at all values of k d and d fig 2c the difference in persistence between fractions ranged 1 7 96 h 1 5 13 x greater the difference between fractions was minimized overall when k d or d were near zero the difference between fractions was also most sensitive to changes in k d when d was low specifically under low to moderate d 0 5 10 5 meters 2 second pa t 90 increased more up to 15x greater than fl t 90 up to 6 5 x greater as k d increased from 0 to 2 meter 1 at higher d values changes in k d had less effect on the difference between fractions the greatest difference in t 90 between fractions blue contour fig 2c occurred with low d and moderate to high k d values a region of similar difference also extended throughout the diffusivity range at moderate k d values 3 2 4 diel cycle effects on enterococci t 90 in addition to the default discharge immediately prior to sunrise presented above simulations were run with inputs of enterococci occurring at different times throughout the 16 h day and 8 h night cycle simulated discharges occurring later in the day consistently increased t 90 of both free living and particle associated fractions fig 3 figs a3 and a4 relative to the default discharge scenario sunrise fig 2 with the greatest difference for discharge at 16 h sunset fig 3 simulated discharge at 16 h increased the minimum simulated t 90 for both free living 4 6 to 12 5 h and particle associated 6 4 to 14 5 h fractions later discharges had a greater effect on fl t 90 than on pa t 90 particularly in regions of moderate to high k d and low diffusivity in general fl t 90 was more variable across the range of k d and d values and over various discharge times than pa t 90 therefore patterns in the δ t 90 plots primarily reflect the patterns of fl t 90 3 2 5 sensitivity tests the first set of sensitivity tests that examined model sensitivity to changes in one set of rates at a time demonstrated a greater sensitivity i e increased variability v of t 90 to dark compared to light dependent growth rates in addition fl t 90 was more sensitive to rate changes than pa t 90 and sensitivity of both fractions was greater for the higher k d and d values representing estuarine conditions compared to the simulations representing a clear quiescent lake fig 4 for example allowing dark growth rates to vary under the estuarine conditions generated greater v for fl t 90 v 0 33 than pa t 90 v 0 24 variability in t 90 values was lower in sensitivity tests using the clear quiescent lake conditions though changes in dark growth rates still caused more variability in fl t 90 v 0 145 than in pa t 90 v 0 139 allowing light dependent growth rates to vary had the greatest impact on fl t 90 under estuarine conditions v 0 248 though persistence of the particle associated fraction was always infinite in those conditions resulting in 0 computed variability within the sensitivity runs in lake conditions free living v 0 081 and particle associated v 0 070 persistence was relatively insensitive to varying light dependent growth rates fig 4 only pa t 90 under lake conditions was measurably sensitive to varying sinking rates v 0 0897 as pa t 90 in turbid turbulent estuarine conditions consistently reached the maximum or infinite t 90 values regardless of sinking rate the simulated free living fraction did not sink so fl t 90 values did not change with different sinking rates in the second set of sensitivity tests where all rates were allowed to vary between successive simulation runs pa t 90 was greater than fl t 90 for 80 7 of lake trials and for 88 5 of estuarine trials in some runs t 90 of both fractions exceeded 100 h because of the negative mean dark growth rates for free living vs positive mean dark growth rates of particle associated enterococci trials with t 90 of both fractions exceeding 100 h δ t 90 0 were counted towards greater persistence by the particle associated fraction in the percentages given above fl t 90 and pa t 90 were more sensitive to rate changes under estuarine v 0 35 and v 0 28 respectively than lake v 0 09 and v 0 12 respectively conditions also using equation 5 for δ t 90 sensitivity of δ t 90 values to rate changes was lower for the lake vs estuarine conditions v 0 073 and 0 243 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 empirically determined growth and sinking rates while numerous studies have quantified growth or decay rates of enterococci and other fibs this is the first study to separately quantify growth rates for particle associated and free living enterococci populations the higher light dependent and dark growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci are consistent with arguments that particles provide a more favorable environment for bacteria including fib the two fractions also differed because particle associated enterococci had measurable sinking rates while the free living fraction remained suspended these quantitative differences in rates that are critical for fib ecological dynamics in receiving water bodies highlight the important distinctions between these two fractions 4 1 1 dark temperature dependent growth the temperature dependence of mean dark growth rates measured in this study for the total fraction of enterococci was consistent with previous empirical studies many studies have reported more negative dark growth rates at high temperatures and growth rates closer to 0 per day at low temperatures craig et al 2002 noble et al 2004 boehm et al 2018 further greater persistence of fib observed in winter than summer maïga et al 2009 maraccini et al 2016 ballesté et al 2018 has been partially attributed to lower temperatures however our results demonstrate that temperature dependence of total fraction growth rates in our experiments was primarily driven by the free living fraction as mean particle associated enterococci growth rates were more consistent across the temperature range note that mean dark growth rates of the particle associated fraction were positive at every temperature while those of the free living fraction became negative at higher temperatures therefore some of the variability of temperature dependent growth rates in previous studies may be due to the variable degree of particle association of fib in the population studied based on results of this study dark growth rates measured for a predominantly free living population of enterococci could show greater temperature dependence and overall be more negative while less temperature dependence and even positive growth rates could be found in a population of enterococci that was predominantly particle associated dark growth rates of total enterococci measured in this study were also comparable to the means and variability reported in other studies at similar temperatures table 3 in our data mean dark growth rates were towards the higher end of the range of values at each temperature presented in table 3 implying longer persistence this was most notable at 5 c where all fractions of enterococci experienced positive growth contrary to the low negative growth for fib commonly observed at this temperature e g evison 1988 menon et al 2003 positive extra enteric growth of enterococci has been observed in sediments e g jeng et al 2005 yamahara et al 2009 in association with organic rich substrates such as algae and vegetation e g byappanahalli et al 2003 byappanahalli and whitman 2009 imamura et al 2011 and in treated wastewater with high dissolved nutrients surbeck et al 2010 therefore our relatively high growth rates could be related to high levels of dissolved organic matter in the hudson river findlay 2005 similarly higher substrate availability on particles could contribute to the elevated dark growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci because dark growth rates aggregate numerous ecological and physiological processes other potential advantages of particle association davies and bavor 2000 craig et al 2002 hess erga et al 2008 may also drive differences in dark growth rates observed between the two fractions in any case our data support the hypothesis that particle association benefits enterococci survival similar to results reported for particle associated e coli garcia armisen and servais 2009 furthermore positive growth for the particle associated fraction of enterococci contradicts the general assumption that the extra enteric ecology of fib populations is dominated by loss it remains an open question if other sewage derived bacteria have similar particle association and ecological dynamics 4 1 2 light dependent growth consistent with previous studies enterococci growth rates under sunlight exposure were significantly more negative than dark growth rates the mean and variance of light dependent growth rates of total enterococci observed in this study fall within ranges reported in the literature table 3 high variability of reported rates within and between studies is unsurprising as different factors can interact with light to alter light induced inactivation rates davies colley et al 1994 maïga et al 2009 yeh et al 2011 furthermore our study is based on short experiments during maximum sunlight exposure and minimal cloud cover so the rates we report are likely the maximum for the day the more negative light dependent growth rates of free living enterococci in this study are consistent with size fractionation studies that report the most negative fib light dependent growth rates for the smallest size fractions which include free living cells qualls et al 1983 madge and jensen 2006 walters et al 2014 differing growth rates reported for various size fractions could relate to differences in shading efficacy however we cannot resolve the mechanism responsible for the higher mean light dependent growth rates of particle associated vs free living enterococci from our experiments indicating future research is warranted 4 1 3 sinking rate distribution direct observations of fib sinking rates are rare but the reported range of 0 5 1 6 m day for particle associated fecal coliforms and e coli auer and niehaus 1993 garcia armisen and servais 2009 encompasses particle associated enterococci sinking rates found in this study some modeling studies have used ideal calculations of particle deposition and resuspension steets and holden 2003 sanders et al 2005 or stokes law cho et al 2010 for estimating sinking of fib much higher particle associated fib sinking rates have been estimated in streams where the particles are predominantly resuspended sediment jamieson et al 2005a particle size preference of fib likely influences sinking rates fib sinking rates that are slow relative to the rest of the particle field like in this study suggest dominant fib attachment to smaller particles previous studies have often found fib to be more frequently associated with fine sediments and particles davies and bavor 2000 jamieson et al 2004 walters et al 2014 though not always mote et al 2012 particle composition also very likely plays a role in altering sinking rates through particle density and structure by assessing a sinking rate distribution rather than a mean rate this study encompasses some of the variability in enterococci sinking due to particle composition further research on particle size or type preference of sewage microbes would better constrain sinking rates that should be used in models of fib persistence 4 2 simulated persistence of particle associated and free living enterococci recent fib modeling studies cite a lack of confidence in parameterizing distinct growth rates for particle associated and free living fib this is the first modeling study to 1 incorporate empirically quantified distinct growth rates for particle associated and free living enterococci and 2 simulate how variation in light exposure with time of day and depth could affect fib persistence results of these simulations demonstrate distinct ecological dynamics for particle associated vs free living enterococci stemming from quantitative differences in critical rates which supports measuring the two fractions as distinct populations and considering the impacts of fib particle association in water quality management 4 2 1 modeled dark growth many models represent fib growth via background rates that depend on temperature neitsch et al 2009 hipsey et al 2008 kim et al 2010 niazi et al 2015 and sometimes salinity chen and liu 2017 our total enterococci growth rates support the former though temperature influenced dark growth rates less than particle association salinity impacts were not included in our model because we found no impact of salinity in our experiments and literature reports of the impact of salinity are inconsistent suggesting lower enterococci sensitivity to salinity than other fib noble et al 2004 anderson et al 2005 4 2 2 modeled light dependent growth some previous fib models have highlighted the importance of light effects on fib growth rates including light variability due to day vs night sunlight intensity depth and water column turbidity auer and niehaus 1993 hellweger and masopust 2008 cho et al 2010 gao et al 2015 however light dependence was also omitted or not explicitly incorporated in other previous modeling studies russo et al 2011 chen and liu 2017 wen et al 2017 at least partly due to insufficient data including variable light dependent growth rates improved model validation against field data in some cases cho et al 2010 though not in others hellweger and masopust 2008 rippy et al 2013a in rippy et al 2013a the lack of impact of varying light dependent growth rates on model outputs could be due to the relatively short study duration 5 h sunlight exposure while hellweger and masopust 2008 argued that their model may have been biased by using a single water column k d throughout their study region our simulations indicated that varying k d notably altered fib persistence supporting the argument that use of a single k d value could weaken model validation against field data moreover the combined dependence in our model of light dependent growth rates on time of day light attenuation and depth in water column underscored the importance of including variability of light in fib persistence predictions 4 2 3 distinguishing particle associated and free living enterococci incorporation of subpopulations with different growth rates as in this study is rare in fib models uniform growth rate parameters are commonly imposed across total fib populations hipsey et al 2008 coffey et al 2010 bougeard et al 2011 pandey et al 2016 though some models have simulated fib populations of differential persistence sadeghi and arnold 2002 hellweger and masopust 2008 bucci et al 2012 rippy et al 2013b or distinguished particle associated and free living fib de brauwere et al 2014 chen and liu 2017 when included in fib fate models particle association is primarily linked to transport processes like resuspension and deposition to the sediments r c jamieson et al 2005 r jamieson et al 2005 yang et al 2008 cho et al 2010 kim et al 2010 feng et al 2016 though debrauwere et al 2014 included a positive impact of particle association on growth rates of e coli the divergent persistence between independently parameterized particle associated and free living fractions in our simulations suggests that future fib modeling studies should distinguish these subpopulations whether or not sediment resuspension is incorporated within the model 4 2 4 simulated impacts of k d and d on persistence in our model k d and d reflective of literature values table 4 control enterococci persistence as all fractions can be transported vertically via turbulent motion d and particle associated cells also sink both processes that alter light exposure in accordance with k d because solar inactivation of fib is caused by both uv and visible light fujioka et al 1981 davies colley et al 1994 sinton et al 2002 k d values in these simulations can be contextualized by comparisons to k d par however the conclusions of this study are not based on wavelength specific k d and predictions for any wavelength band could be extracted by selecting an appropriate k d value in our simulations high k d values lowered the effect of light exposure on growth rates at each depth making net growth rates more dependent on dark growth rates these trends are consistent with experiments demonstrating that light dependent growth rates of enterococci are less negative with increasing turbidity alkan et al 1995 whitman et al 2004 kay et al 2005 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 and that rates in turbid water were similar to dark growth rates kay et al 2005 in addition the proportionality of light dependent growth rates in our model as light exposure changes due to depth and time of day is supported by commensurate changes in fib growth rates with varying light exposure due to turbidity kay et al 2005 depth davies colley et al 1994 and exposure time auer and niehaus 1993 sinton et al 2002 turbulence as represented by d primarily affected enterococci persistence in our model by impacting their depth distribution which altered light exposure according to k d our simulations suggest interactive effects of k d and d as seen by the greater increase in t 90 of both fractions when k d and d increased together as opposed to separately impacts of turbulence on enterococci growth rates or water column concentrations in previous studies have also been linked to changes in turbidity palmateer et al 1989 whitman et al 2004 demonstrating empirical support for an interaction between turbulence and turbidity on fib direct effects of turbulence on fib growth rates have been suggested al homoud and hondzo 2008 though are not included in this model vertical mixing has also been previously connected to increased water column concentrations of fib through resuspension of sediment bound fib steets and holden 2003 craig et al 2004 while the source potential of longer persisting enterococci at depth is acknowledged in our model by the mixing up from deeper layers of both fractions we did not explicitly include deposition or resuspension from sediments at every value of k d and d in the standard run simulations particle associated enterococci persisted longer than free living enterococci minimal δ t 90 corresponded to when k d or d were close to 0 reflecting clear and or quiescent conditions while greater δ t 90 corresponded to higher k d and d representing more turbid and or turbulent waters variation in δ t 90 between fractions predominantly reflected patterns of fl t 90 and was greatest at the transitions from low to moderate values of both k d and d it is worth noting that the sharp contrast surrounding the regions of maximal δ t 90 transition from dark blue to lighter blue contours in the upper portion of fig 2c is partially due to the imposed maximum t 90 value of 100 h in these simulations had simulations been run longer the dark blue region of maximum difference would likely extend further along the axis of increasing k d 4 2 5 simulated diel cycle effects on persistence in urban areas where fib abundance is dominated by intermittent point source discharges e g combined sewer overflows sewage discharges can occur at different times throughout the diel cycle with correspondingly altered light exposure for discharged fib in this study persistence for both fractions increased for simulated discharges occurring closer to sunset 16 h due to the interaction between turbulence and light exposure for example simulated discharges at sunset 16 h allowed a portion of both enterococci fractions to be transported deeper in the water column before sunrise decreasing cumulative light induced inactivation and increasing t 90 values by at least 24 h compared to modeled sunrise discharge simulated free living enterococci benefited the most from mixing during dark period hours the greatest increase in simulated fl t 90 occurred at low to moderate d and high k d when some cells were transported into low light deep layers as in the sunrise discharge scenario at high d vertical transport increased cumulative light exposure of simulated enterococci and decreased persistence results from these simulations suggest that discharge timing within a diel cycle may be an important factor in predicting enterococci persistence future fib studies could include high frequency sampling within a diel cycle to test this hypothesis against field measurements 4 3 model sensitivity testing in model sensitivity tests fl t 90 was generally more variable than pa t 90 and simulated estuarine conditions led to greater fl t 90 variability than in the lake simulations higher variability under estuarine conditions was due to the steeper vertical gradient in light exposure with depth than in the lake conditions one caveat to these tests was that variability in pa t 90 was not calculated for the estuarine simulations because the time scale exceeded 100 h nevertheless in both estuarine and lake conditions 80 90 of simulations from the second set of sensitivity tests where all rates were allowed to vary resulted in greater persistence of particle associated than free living enterococci the consistency of this result across wide parameter ranges strongly supports the hypothesis that particle association can prolong fib environmental persistence in general of the parameters manipulated in sensitivity testing our model was most sensitive to changes in dark growth rate however the lower model sensitivity to variable light dependent growth rates does not indicate a lack of importance of these rates for predicting persistence in simulations where light dependent growth rates were omitted from our model t 90 was 100 hours for both fractions throughout the range of k d and d data not shown similarly the importance of light dependent growth rates on persistence is shown by the effect of k d on t 90 patterns of both fractions sinking rates only affected the particle associated fraction and under the lake conditions resulted in pa t 90 variability that fell between light and dark pa t 90 variability sinking rate sensitivity tests therefore suggest that empirically well constrained sinking rates are more important for predicting particle associated fib persistence under lake compared to estuarine conditions overall simulations in which sinking rate was omitted led to similar t 90 predictions of particle associated enterococci except at relatively low k d and d conditions fig a5 sensitivity tests where all rates were modified resulted in variability similar to sensitivity tests where only dark growth rates varied underscoring the relative importance of quantifying dark growth rates for modeling fib persistence 5 conclusions particle association of enterococci increased critical growth rates and induced sinking leading to longer simulated persistence of the particle associated vs free living fraction across a wide range of physically relevant values of diffuse light attenuation and turbulent diffusivity future experiments could especially focus on constraining fraction specific dark temperature dependent growth rates due to the high sensitivity of simulated persistence to this rate the generally higher sensitivity of simulated persistence to changes in all rates in the estuarine scenario suggests that empirical rate determination is especially critical in turbid and turbulent water bodies further increased simulated persistence of both enterococci fractions with discharges later in the day suggests that further research should examine the effects of sewage discharge time within the diel cycle on downstream fib persistence the important role of particle association in the extra enteric ecology of enterococci persistence revealed in this study suggests that future research should assess the impacts of particle association for other sewage

diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of sources of these compounds attributed to terrestrial submerged and floating plant material as well as petrogenic and pyrogenic combustion inlet middle and upper segment site clustering was observed with non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis hca mainly driven by the prevalence of pahs at the inlet sites and n alkanes

1 introduction many countries conduct monitoring programs that evaluate temporal and spatial trends in the physicochemical and biological aspects of environmental systems particularly of freshwater resources abbaspour 2011 gazzaz et al 2012 while risks posed by man made chemicals can be directly evaluated by applying targeted mitigation strategies those that are derived from biogenic terrestrial as well as anthropogenic sources are difficult to determine and trace back to initial sources gazzaz et al 2012 these include n alkanes and pahs which occur naturally as complex mixtures ficken et al 2000 yunker et al 2002 neff et al 2005 wang et al 2013 chevalier et al 2015 wang et al 2018 these contaminants have been detected in water fish coals floodplain soils and river sediments in the vicinity of coal mines and processing industries by numerous researchers micić et al 2011 seopela et al 2016 wang et al 2018 their inherent physicochemical properties make their detection and source apportionment challenging but crucial in addition the assessment of these compounds in aquatic systems is of particular importance since they may pose a risk to a range of organisms gazzaz et al 2012 venturini et al 2015 the traditional approach for evaluating the sources of contaminants in the environment is through the use of indices these include individual compound abundances as a proxy to estimate the sources venturini et al 2015 wang et al 2018 pinheiro et al 2017 the most widely applied and well studied compounds for source apportionment are n alkanes and pahs yunker et al 2002 de

et al 1998 el nemr et al 2016 n alkanes provide insight into compositional differences of plant material whether terrestrial marine or aquatic and petrogenic sources in contrast pahs are limited to

these may be valuable tools in providing detailed information from complex environmental data that is otherwise not possible with diagnostic ratios since all individual compounds abundances are included in the analysis the loskop dam is an arch gravity dam covering 24 3 km2 and is located in loskop dam nature reserve a national heritage key point crafford et al 2011 this water body is not only an important link in ensuring food security for the country but nurtures a wide variety of flora as well as wildlife including birds hippopotamus crocodile rhinoceros impala wildebeest and zebra crafford et al 2011 in addition the area supports eco tourism and recreational activities loskop dam is sourced from the historically contaminated olifants river which flows through areas where extensive human processes occur including coal mining and power generation steel industries agricultural and domestic activities the water from loskop dam is distributed to the agricultural town of groblersdal where it plays a key role in serving the farmers and community s needs crafford et al 2011 moja et al 2017 however loskop dam is sensitive to environmental change demonstrated by the sharp decline in fish and crocodile populations since 2008 huchzermeyer et al 2009 seopela et al 2016 determined the levels of pahs in water sediment and fish from loskop dam and conducted toxicity tests the results indicated that this water system is under severe stress as a result of the anthropogenic activities occurring in the area as highlighted in the report by chimuka et al 2016 research on pah contamination of south african water bodies is limited while no study has determined n alkanes the study was aimed at determining the concentrations spatial variations and sources of n alkanes and pahs in water and sediment from loskop dam the species abundance at each site were correlated to the key pollution drivers and consequent susceptivity of this water system long term source apportionment data and the combined used of n alkanes and pahs ratios for this water system and similar aquatic bodies are sparse it is hoped that the results may provide insight into the key driving factors impacting water quality changes that threaten ecosystem services 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and sample collection the loskop dam is situated in a summer rainfall

results and discussion 3 1 quality control the average recoveries n 3 of individual n alkanes and pahs from spiked ultrapure water are included in table s1 n alkane recoveries ranged from 32 7 0 385

within the predicted and certified confidence intervals as per certificate of analysis table 1 the reproducibility of n alkane analysis in sediment were acceptable at relative standard deviation values of 5 wang et al 2018 3 2 n alkanes the annual average and total n alkane and pah concentrations detected in loskop dam water and sediment between 2015 and 2017 are presented in table 2 statistical analysis indicated that the data distribution was not symmetrical since kurtosis and skewness for all compounds were 1 and were leptokurtic for both sample types these differences can be attributed to site location seasonal contributions sampling frequency input sources and water levels annual average and total c8 c40 n alkane levels in water samples ranged from 0 0287 0 00855 to 0 687 0 0391 µg l and 0 574 to 18 8 µg l respectively table 2 these compounds were present in sediment at average concentrations between 69 8 772 and 317 9 69 µg kg and total levels ranging from 8092 3 18 to 29100 445 µg kg the average concentrations of n alkanes in loskop dam water were within the ranges reported by peake and hodgson 1966 for a variety of water systems including sea 0 2 µg l river 1 5 µg l and lake waters 0 5 µg l however compared to other lakes in environments with similar activities the total n alkane levels in loskop dam water were lower than those reported in water from taihu lake 45 0 and 281 µg l ji xiang and jia 2012 and in water 61 5 and 472 7 µg l collected in the vicinity of a bitumen field in nigeria olajire et al 2008 similarly loskop dam sediment contained average and n alkane concentrations table 2 that were lower than those reported in water systems located in the vicinity of intense human activities but were higher than those in pristine water bodies these include mangroves in the south of brazil 1 9 to 55 6 µg g assunção et al 2017 kharg and lark reefs in iran 31 2 to 272 µg g jafarabadi et al 2018 the yellow river estuary 356 and 572 µg kg in china wang et al 2018 and the bay of fundy 30 to 25 000 µg kg in canada yang et al 2018 these differences may be due to the proximity of the activities occurring in the surrounding area to the receiving waters loskop dam is located in a nature reserve receiving water from the olifants river where the majority of coal mining industrial domestic and agricultural activities occur crafford et al 2011 while the studies by assunção et al 2017 and references therein as well as jafarabadi et al 2018 were conducted in highly urbanised areas wang et al 2018 described and demonstrated the impact of local and regional activities as well as environmental change on the levels of n alkanes on the yellow river estuary china they found that the concentrations in surface sediment decreased towards sites further from human activities and found that sediment cores reflected local activities they attributed these variations to diversion of the yellow river mouth high flow velocity and large water volume as well as loss of organic matter from the point source to sites further upstream the results included in table 2 demonstrate this spatial dependency of n alkane levels within a water body for both water fcrit 2 29 p 1 61e 55 and sediments fcrit 2 42 p 2 10e 12 the levels of n alkanes varied significantly at each site p α and increased annually from the inlet to the upper reaches of the dam spatial differences can be attributed to the prevailing vegetative environment activities and the topography of the dam which broadens from the narrow inlet resulting in differences in water flow rates across the dam fig s1 furthermore during the sampling period water levels dropped significantly 50 particularly in 2016 with slow recoveries in 2017 donnenfeld et al 2018 these lowered water levels with the accompanying recession of the shoreline affected the sampling points within an area and may have compounded the differences observed in addition the majority of samples were collected in cooler seasons i e winter and autumn chen et al 2014 noted that biogenic processes including pollination and senescence occur in seasons preceding summer contributing to higher n alkane concentrations in the environment nonetheless compared to pristine and highly impacted environments the results demonstrate that the contamination of loskop dam sediment with n alkanes is low to moderate comparison of long hydrocarbon chain lhc 23 carbons to short hydrocarbon chain shc 23 carbons n alkane dominance in loskop dam water and sediments indicated that the distribution of these compounds displayed site specific trends samples from sites 1 to 7 and camp were characterised by shc these represented between 52 1 and 86 7 of the total n alkane concentrations the remaining sites 7a 12 as well as sites 8 to 11 comprised a higher proportion 60 7 to 95 0 of lhc compounds the prevalence of shc at the inlet and middle segment sites and lhc at points at the upper reaches implied that petrogenic input and terrestrial plant material were the major source respectively patnaik 2010 these findings were reiterated by the ratio of lhc to shc which was 1 for most of the water and sediment samples table 3 collected at the inlet sites this indicated that petrogenic input had strongly impacted the receiving water of loskop dam however these values were 1 in sediments from upper segment sites 8 9 10 11 12 and 7a and water collected from the canal suggesting that plant decay was the predominant source of these compounds in these regions the nar ratio across loskop dam sites were 0 table 3 implying that petrogenic input was the main source mille et al 2007 el nemr et al 2016 this may be due to the use of boats to navigate the water body by holiday makers and park officials the cpi ratio which discerns between petrogenic and natural sources mille et al 2007 el nemr et al 2016 had values ranging from 0 675 1 99 and from 0 829 1 69 table 3 in loskop dam water and sediment carbon preference index values close to 1 are associated with vehicle emissions and other activities when 1 with terrestrial vegetation and 1 with petroleum xie et al 2009 de souza et al 2011 ji xiang and jia 2012 in addition simoneit 2002 demonstrated that a cpi 5 comprises a larger portion of odd numbered n alkanes which are derived from the cracking and dehydration of n alkanes and n alcohols respectively by combining the assessments made in these studies and comparison of the cpi values obtained for loskop dam samples the presence of n alkanes in this water body was primarily driven by petrogenic input since 56 3 and 78 6 of water and sediment samples had values 1 which supports nar with the exception of water from site 7 7a 11 dam wall and 12 as well as sediments from sites 3 and 7 the tar indices were 1 which indicated that the majority of n alkanes were derived from terrestrial plants el nemr et al 2016 assunção et al 2017 the differences in tar values were correlated to sedimentation rates environmental parameters as well as vegetation type these effects are reflected by the conditions at the loskop dam since the water is exposed to water hyacinth blooms and contains algae and other aquatic plants as well as trees which are associated with high tar indices el nemr et al 2016 assunção et al 2017 the paq proxy discriminates between aquatic and terrestrial vegetation where values 0 4 are attributed to floating or submerged aquatic plant decay while those in the range 0 1 to 0 4 and 0 1 are indicative of emergent and terrestrial plants respectively wang et al 2018 in this study the paq values obtained ranged from 0 372 to 1 54 for water and 0 493 to 1 13 for sediment apportioning the presence of higher n alkanes to a mixture of emergent and terrestrial submerged as well as floating vegetation wang et al 2018 this is not surprising since the dam in located in a nature reserve rich in terrestrial and aquatic flora overall the n alkane proxies indicated that the presence of these compounds in water and sediment from the study area were derived from largely petrogenic and a variety of terrestrial floating and submerging vegetation 3 3 pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were present at total average concentrations of between 0 150 00494 and 49 8 6 86 µg l in water and 61 6 5 95 to 2618 300 µg kg in sediments table 2 generally the levels of pahs in water samples increased each year from 2015 to 2017 with average concentrations of 0 254 0 391 and 0 679 µg l in sediment the levels of these compounds decreased annually averaging 39 4 15 9 and 7 14 µg kg in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively there were statistically significant differences in the annual concentrations of pahs in water fcrit 2 29 p 3 02e 52 and sediment fcrit 2 42 p 9 60e 25 globally the pah content in highly polluted river water including the cauca river in colombia sarria villa et al 2016 and the yellow li et al 2006 tianjin shi et al 2005 xijiang deng et al 2006 and daliao guo et al 2007 rivers in china are in the range 0 00458 to 474 µg l zhi et al 2015 determined the presence of these compounds in a similar freshwater system poyong lake located downstream of the yangtze river china this water body is used extensively for agricultural residential industrial and tourism purposes the total pah concentrations determined in poyong lake were between 0 00556 and 0 266 µg l lower than the values obtained for loskop dam table 2 compared to south african water bodies chimuka et al 2016 as well as in findings from a previous study conducted at loskop dam seopela et al 2016 where pah levels ranged from 28 7 3192 6 µg l and 0 102 0 643 µg l respectively the concentrations in loskop dam water was within the reported values table 2 furthermore seopela et al 2016 found that at total concentrations ranging from 1 17 to 14 5 µg l embryotoxicity occurred in organisms exposed to water from loskop dam the total levels found in the present study are higher which infers that environmental concern is warranted loskop dam sediments had lower concentrations of pahs than those reported by nieuwoudt et al 2011 in samples collected from agricultural and industrial areas in south africa which were between 44 and 39 000 µg kg the report compiled by chimuka et al 2016 which indicated that the typical ranges of pahs in sediment collected from freshwater systems in south africa were between 44 5 and 2798 µg kg globally the concentrations determined in sediments collected from rivers in the vicinity of anthropogenic activities in china guo et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 japan onozato et al 2016 russia dahle et al 2003 france bertrand et al 2015 mexico wang et al 2014 nigeria tongo et al 2017 canada yunker and macdonald 2003 and india dhananjayan et al 2012 were comparable to those determined in this study as described by assunção et al 2017 references therein and pinheiro et al 2017 pah contamination may be subdivided into four categories namely low 0 to 100 µg kg moderate 100 to 1000 µg kg high 1000 to 5000 µg kg and very high 5000 µg kg based on the concentration ranges in sediment similarly total pah levels may be used to predict the potential effects using guideline values for the threshold effect level tel effects low range erl and probable effect level pel set at 1684 1 4022 0 and 16770 4 µg kg respectively in a previous study at loskop dam the total pah concentrations in sediment ranged from 292 to 2170 µg kg seopela et al 2016 which are above the lowest and below the highest total levels determined in this study these authors found that exposure of this sediment to zebrafish embryos induced developmental toxicity from the results obtained for pah concentrations in sediment table 2 the contamination at loskop dam can be classified as low to moderate the total pah levels for all samples were below the tel erl and pel quality guideline values which imply that no adverse biological changes would be induced by exposure to these samples however considering the findings from seopela et al 2016 there is risk associated with loskop dam sediment for both water and sediment the impact of the climatic conditions and consequent water levels on the points of sample collection and contaminant concentrations are reflected by the results the reduced concentrations may be related to decreased water levels and flow rate during the 2016 drought donnenfeld et al 2018 particularly for water samples the subsequent increase in 2017 is a reflection of higher rainfall and increased recreational activities in the main body of the dam in the case of sediment the shoreline recession had a greater impact on the pah concentrations detected since the sampling points were significantly different as a result of changes in water levels as described in numerous studies sediment is subject to spatial variations demonstrated by differences in concentrations within a study area in addition wang et al 2018 and references therein highlighted these differences by profiling sediment cores while surface sediment indicated current pollution levels they were able to trace n alkane contaminations at each sampling point to between 1925 and 2012 the results from the present and other studies cement the fact that the extent of contamination is highly dependent on activities occurring in the immediate surroundings the annual and site specific variations in pah concentrations may be a direct reflection of the variation in input sources to tease the sources of pahs the abundance of 2 to 6 ring compounds was assessed by evaluating their average percentage distribution in water and sediments these pah types have been shown to differentiate between petrogenic and pyrogenic sources respectively el nemr et al 2016 as illustrated by the ternary plot in fig 1 water and sediments were dominated by 2 and 3 ring pahs while 6 ring pahs were the least abundant however there were marked differences in the seasonal distribution of these compounds quantitative data derived from table 2 indicated that 2 to 4 ring pahs dominated water and sediments throughout all seasons corresponding to input sources that are derived from petrogenic and pyrogenic sources four ring pahs were dominant in autumn while 2 3 ring compounds were the most abundant in summer and winter the distribution of pahs in these samples is not surprising since this water body is located in a nature reserve frequented by holidaymakers the use of motorboats using petrol for fuel may be the source of low molecular weight lmw and medium molecular weight mmw compounds in this water system while the presence of high molecular weight hmw molecules were attributed to veld fires as well as combustion of fossil fuels for energy as with the ternary plots pah ratios lmw hmw flu pyr flu flu pyr phe ant nap phe ant ant phe inp inp bghip chr bant and bant bant chr table 3 are restricted to classifying these compounds as being derived from either petrogenic or pyrogenic input nonetheless these ratios can be used to deduce whether the spread of 2 to 6 ring pah source contributions were masked by the total percentage values the presence of these compounds were associated with combustion or direct input sources were employed these ratios make use of only 2 to 3 ring and 5 to 6 ring pahs in the calculation to account for the thermodynamic stabilities of individual compounds in the environment baumard et al 1998 ficken et al 2000 yunker et al 2002 yunker and macdonald 2003 neff et al 2005 with the exception of sites 1 and 12 sediments values for lmw hmw table 3 were 1 for all sites demonstrating that petrogenic sources were impacting this aquatic system these values were higher than those obtained by qiao et al 2006 who found that pyrogenic input was the source of these compounds in sediments from meiling bay china the dominance of petrogenic input was reaffirmed by the indices fln pyr 1 fln fln pyr 0 50 nap phe 1 and phe ant 0 50 table 3 in addition the apportionment of sources with bant bant chr and inp inp bghip indicated that petroleum 0 20 petroleum combustion 0 20 0 50 and fossil fuel combustion 0 35 were similar across water and sediments from loskop dam fossil fuel combustion was corroborated by the indices ant ant phe and chr bant for which the values were 0 50 comparison of indices ant ant phe to fln fln pyr and phe ant with fln pyr fig 2 demonstrated that the sources of pahs in loskop dam water and sediments were characterised by a mixture of petrogenic input and fossil fuel combustion including the burning of coal grass and wood 3 4 chemometric analysis individual concentrations of n alkanes and pahs determined in water and sediments were used to determine the key drivers of contamination in the different sections of the dam and to support the spatial distribution of the source apportionment of these compounds non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis indicated that euclidean distances best described the natural dissimilarity measure for target analyte data associated with loskop dam water and sediment samples oksanen 2015 fig 3 strong species similarity and correlations between sites were observed for the majority of samples particularly among sediment with the exception of samples collected at the inlet sites 1 to 4 water samples for the inlet sites were dominated by pahs while n alkanes were the main driving force behind clustering at the middle and upper segment sites sites 4 6 and the canal had the least association with other sampling locations across the dam the nmds fig 3b analysis for sediment reiterated the observation made with water samples related to site clustering stress 0 136 sediment from sites 3 and 7 were outliers while reference sites 11 and 12 were strongly associated with each other the nmds ordinations for the distribution of target analytes in loskop dam water and sediment were supported by the strong correlation r2 0 97 between ecological data and ordination distances as shown in the shepard plots fig s2 as discussed by oksanen et al 2018 goodness of fit measures in nmds are described by distance values 1 where identical sites 0 and those 1 infer that the data have no common features further classification of loskop dam water and sediment samples corresponding with target analyte presence and absence was achieved by conducting hierarchical cluster analysis hca with the r base package hclust based on dissimilarities oksanen et al 2018 for neutral grouping and best fit average linkages were applied to n alkane and pah distribution in loskop dam water and sediment with the general principle that nearest neighbour as well as height being the measures of similarities and dissimilarities oksanen et al 2018 three major clusters were generated for both sample types fig 4 these represented the inlet middle and upper reaches of the loskop dam the chemical composition of reference sites 10 and 11 were more related to upper segments sites than to those at the inlet this implied that similar factors may be influencing the levels of the target analytes in these areas of the dam these findings support site clustering observed with source apportionment of both n alkanes and pahs it is evident that spatial and temporal trends exist influenced by prevailing activities nonetheless the data demonstrates that customized strategies for each section must be put in place to counteract the variations in contamination throughout the dam as previously stated by abbaspour 2011 developing countries are highly dependent on industries for their economic growth but tend to underscore the importance of water quality while over emphasizing quantity in addition issues related to environmental contamination are also influenced by the pollution regulation policy of a country and how well it is implemented furthermore these data may be used to model the transportation of contaminants in this water body allowing predictions to be made on their ultimate fate and factors influencing their translocation 4 conclusions the olifants river has been exposed to anthropogenic stressors over a long period which has previously culminated in mass mortalities of aquatic organisms in various regions of the loskop dam this area is an important water source for many commercial farmers and communities in the vicinity effects stemming from years of continuing contamination have to be corrected however it is only through knowledge of the contamination sources that efficient mitigation procedures can be implemented the results from water and sediments indicate that some mixing and filtering effects occur in loskop dam since clustering of sampling points was observed after chemometric analysis of the data it follows that higher levels of pahs were detected in water from the inlet sites while these compounds were greatest in sediments collected at the upstream sites due to compound deposition from inflowing water reference sites 10 and 11 displayed similarity with other sampling points particularly with sites 8 7a and 12 this implies that the variability in contaminant distribution in the sediments is derived from a combination of sources either directly or indirectly traditional diagnostic proxies revealed that a mixture of petrogenic and pyrogenic sources were responsible for the presence of these compounds in loskop dam water and sediments chemometric analysis confirmed that the key driving factor responsible for the clustering of inlet water and sediment sites was driven by the dominance of pahs while n alkanes were prevalent in the upper reaches of the dam this combination of sources was expected for water samples mixing is facilitated by water flow which explains temporal distribution while the composition in sediments is dependent on the location of each sampling point the variation in source apportionment was more pronounced in sediments throughout the study partly due to the recession of the water line caused by drought conditions these findings may be used to address and implement counteractive strategies to preserve this water body for future human health and economic sustainability this study has highlighted the importance of taking seasonal variations and

17537,in this study the spatial and temporal variations in the levels of c8 c40 n alkanes and 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in water and sediment from loskop dam mpumalanga province south africa were investigated between 2015 and 2017 in addition their sources which have not been well defined were also studied over the period this water body is sourced from a historically contaminated water body the olifants river which flows through areas where a range of industrial and agricultural activities take place mass crocodile and fish mortalities have been recorded in this aquatic system and contamination by organic pollutants were highlighted as a contributing factor the total average n alkane concentrations in water and sediments ranged from 0 574 00811 to 18 8 1 39 µg l and 4760 243 to 30700 906 µg kg respectively similarly pahs were detected at total average concentrations of between 0 150 00494 and 49 8 6 86 µg l in water and 61 6 5 95 to 2618 300 µg kg n alkane and pah diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of sources of these compounds attributed to terrestrial submerged and floating plant material as well as petrogenic and pyrogenic combustion inlet middle and upper segment site clustering was observed with non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis hca mainly driven by the prevalence of pahs at the inlet sites and n alkanes in the upper reaches by using indicator compounds the sources of contamination could be predicted the strategy described here can be applied to any water body for continuous long term monitoring of pollutant levels and to identify sources attributing to water pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source apportionment n alkanes pahs diagnostic ratios chemometric analysis 1 introduction many countries conduct monitoring programs that evaluate temporal and spatial trends in the physicochemical and biological aspects of environmental systems particularly of freshwater resources abbaspour 2011 gazzaz et al 2012 while risks posed by man made chemicals can be directly evaluated by applying targeted mitigation strategies those that are derived from biogenic terrestrial as well as anthropogenic sources are difficult to determine and trace back to initial sources gazzaz et al 2012 these include n alkanes and pahs which occur naturally as complex mixtures ficken et al 2000 yunker et al 2002 neff et al 2005 wang et al 2013 chevalier et al 2015 wang et al 2018 these contaminants have been detected in water fish coals floodplain soils and river sediments in the vicinity of coal mines and processing industries by numerous researchers micić et al 2011 seopela et al 2016 wang et al 2018 their inherent physicochemical properties make their detection and source apportionment challenging but crucial in addition the assessment of these compounds in aquatic systems is of particular importance since they may pose a risk to a range of organisms gazzaz et al 2012 venturini et al 2015 the traditional approach for evaluating the sources of contaminants in the environment is through the use of indices these include individual compound abundances as a proxy to estimate the sources venturini et al 2015 wang et al 2018 pinheiro et al 2017 the most widely applied and well studied compounds for source apportionment are n alkanes and pahs yunker et al 2002 de souza et al 2011 wang et al 2018 pinheiro et al 2017 their relative abundances are used to explicate differences between natural and anthropogenic input of these compounds in water ji xiang and jia

et al 1998 el nemr et al 2016 n alkanes provide insight into compositional differences of plant material whether terrestrial marine or aquatic and petrogenic sources in contrast pahs are limited to apportioning sources to petrogenic and pyrogenic combustion processes the combination of these diagnostic tools provides an overall view of the environment under study as well as insight into the factors that affect it el nemr et al 2016 assunção et al 2017 pinheiro et al 2017 chemometric methods are multivariate methods that are widely applied to evaluate temporal and spatial trends in water quality gazzaz et al 2012 syakti et al 2017 wang et al 2017 chemometric techniques include principal component analysis pca non metric dimensional scaling nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis hca these may be valuable tools in providing detailed information from complex environmental data that is otherwise not possible with diagnostic ratios since all individual compounds abundances are included in the analysis the loskop dam is an arch gravity dam covering 24 3 km2 and is located in loskop dam nature reserve a national heritage key point crafford et al 2011 this water body is not only an important link in ensuring food security for the country but nurtures a wide variety of flora as well as wildlife including birds hippopotamus crocodile rhinoceros impala wildebeest and zebra crafford et al 2011 in addition the area supports eco tourism and recreational activities loskop dam is sourced from the historically contaminated olifants river which flows through areas where extensive human processes occur including coal mining and power generation steel industries agricultural and domestic activities the water from loskop dam is distributed to the agricultural town of groblersdal where it plays a key role in serving the farmers and community s needs crafford et al 2011 moja et al 2017 however loskop dam is sensitive to environmental change demonstrated by the sharp decline in fish and crocodile populations since 2008 huchzermeyer et al 2009 seopela et al 2016 determined the levels of pahs in water sediment and fish from loskop dam and conducted toxicity tests the results indicated that this water system is under severe stress as a result of the anthropogenic activities occurring in the area as highlighted in the report by chimuka et al 2016 research on pah contamination of south african water bodies is limited while no study has determined n alkanes the study was aimed at determining the concentrations spatial variations and sources of n alkanes and pahs in water and sediment from loskop dam the species abundance at each site were correlated to the key pollution drivers and consequent susceptivity of this water system long term source apportionment data and the combined used of n alkanes and pahs ratios for this water system and similar aquatic bodies are sparse it is hoped that the results may provide insight into the key driving factors impacting water quality changes that threaten ecosystem services 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and sample collection the loskop dam is situated in a summer rainfall area and located in mpumalanga province a hub of agricultural and industrial activities samples were collected three times a year over the period 2015 to 2017 from the inlet sites 1 4 middle segment

results and discussion 3 1 quality control the average recoveries n 3 of individual n alkanes and pahs from spiked ultrapure water are included in table s1 n alkane recoveries ranged from 32 7 0 385 to 129 0 535 while pahs were between 75 9 0 123 and 115 0 721 the results obtained for the pah sediment 1 crm used for verifying the sediment extraction procedure mae with 1 1 acetone hexane were within the predicted and certified confidence intervals as per certificate of analysis table 1 the reproducibility of n alkane analysis in sediment were acceptable at relative standard deviation values of 5 wang et al 2018 3 2 n alkanes the annual average and total n alkane and pah concentrations detected in loskop dam water and sediment between 2015 and 2017 are presented in table 2 statistical analysis indicated that the data distribution was not symmetrical since kurtosis and skewness for all compounds were 1 and were leptokurtic for both sample types these differences can be attributed to site location seasonal contributions sampling frequency input sources and water levels annual average and total c8 c40 n alkane levels in water samples ranged from 0 0287 0 00855 to 0 687 0 0391 µg l and 0 574 to 18 8 µg l respectively table 2 these compounds were present in sediment at average concentrations between 69 8 772 and 317 9 69 µg kg and total levels ranging from 8092 3 18 to 29100 445 µg kg the average concentrations of n alkanes in loskop dam water were within the ranges reported by peake and hodgson 1966 for a variety of water systems including sea 0 2 µg l river 1 5 µg l and lake waters 0 5 µg l however compared to other lakes in environments with similar activities the total n alkane levels in loskop dam water were lower than those reported in water from taihu lake 45 0 and 281 µg l ji xiang and jia 2012 and in water 61 5 and 472 7 µg l collected in the vicinity of a bitumen field in nigeria olajire et al 2008 similarly loskop dam sediment contained average and n alkane concentrations table 2 that were lower than those reported in water systems located in the vicinity of intense human activities but were higher than those in pristine water bodies these include mangroves in the south of brazil 1 9 to 55 6 µg g assunção et al 2017 kharg and lark reefs in iran 31 2 to 272 µg g jafarabadi et al 2018 the yellow river estuary 356 and 572 µg kg in china wang et al 2018 and the bay of fundy 30 to 25 000 µg kg in canada yang et al 2018 these differences may be due to the proximity of the activities occurring in the surrounding area to the receiving waters loskop dam is located in a nature reserve receiving water from the olifants river where the majority of coal mining industrial domestic and agricultural activities occur crafford et al 2011 while the studies by assunção et al 2017 and references therein as well as jafarabadi et al 2018 were conducted in highly urbanised areas wang et al 2018 described and demonstrated the impact of local and regional activities as well as environmental change on the levels of n alkanes on the yellow river estuary china they found that the concentrations in surface sediment decreased towards sites further from human activities and found that sediment cores reflected local activities they attributed these variations to diversion of the yellow river mouth high flow velocity and large water volume as well as loss of organic matter from the point source to sites further upstream the results included in table 2 demonstrate this spatial dependency of n alkane levels within a water body for both water fcrit 2 29 p 1 61e 55 and sediments fcrit 2 42 p 2 10e 12 the levels of n alkanes varied significantly at each site p α and increased annually from the inlet to the upper reaches of the dam spatial differences can be attributed to the prevailing vegetative environment activities and the topography of the dam which broadens from the narrow inlet resulting in differences in water flow rates across the dam fig s1 furthermore during the sampling period water levels dropped significantly 50 particularly in 2016 with slow recoveries in 2017 donnenfeld et al 2018 these lowered water levels with the accompanying recession of the shoreline affected the sampling points within an area and may have compounded the differences observed in addition the majority of samples were collected in cooler seasons i e winter and autumn chen et al 2014 noted that biogenic processes including pollination and senescence occur in seasons preceding summer contributing to higher n alkane concentrations in the environment nonetheless compared to pristine and highly impacted environments the results demonstrate that the contamination of loskop dam sediment with n alkanes is low to moderate comparison of long hydrocarbon chain lhc 23 carbons to short hydrocarbon chain shc 23 carbons n alkane dominance in loskop dam water and sediments indicated that the distribution of these compounds displayed site specific trends samples from sites 1 to 7 and camp were characterised by shc these represented between 52 1 and 86 7 of the total n alkane concentrations the remaining sites 7a 12 as well as sites 8 to 11 comprised a higher proportion 60 7 to 95 0 of lhc compounds the prevalence of shc at the inlet and middle segment sites and lhc at points at the upper reaches implied that petrogenic input and terrestrial plant material were the major source respectively patnaik 2010 these findings were reiterated by the ratio of lhc to shc which was 1 for most of the water and sediment samples table 3 collected at the inlet sites this indicated that petrogenic input had strongly impacted the receiving water of loskop dam however these values were 1 in sediments from upper segment sites 8 9 10 11 12 and 7a and water collected from the canal suggesting that plant decay was the predominant source of these compounds in these regions the nar ratio across loskop dam sites were 0 table 3 implying that petrogenic input was the main source mille et al 2007 el nemr et al 2016 this may be due to the use of boats to navigate the water body by holiday makers and park officials the cpi ratio which discerns between petrogenic and natural sources mille et al 2007 el nemr et al 2016 had values ranging from 0 675 1 99 and from 0 829 1 69 table 3 in loskop dam water and sediment carbon preference index values close to 1 are associated with vehicle emissions and other activities when 1 with terrestrial vegetation and 1 with petroleum xie et al 2009 de souza et al 2011 ji xiang and jia 2012 in addition simoneit 2002 demonstrated that a cpi 5 comprises a larger portion of odd numbered n alkanes which are derived from the cracking and dehydration of n alkanes and n alcohols respectively by combining the assessments made in these studies and comparison of the cpi values obtained for loskop dam samples the presence of n alkanes in this water body was primarily driven by petrogenic input since 56 3 and 78 6 of water and sediment samples had values 1 which supports nar with the exception of water from site 7 7a 11 dam wall and 12 as well as sediments from sites 3 and 7 the tar indices were 1 which indicated that the majority of n alkanes were derived from terrestrial plants el nemr et al 2016 assunção et al 2017 the differences in tar values were correlated to sedimentation rates environmental parameters as well as vegetation type these effects are reflected by the conditions at the loskop dam since the water is exposed to water hyacinth blooms and contains algae and other aquatic plants as well as trees which are associated with high tar indices el nemr et al 2016 assunção et al 2017 the paq proxy discriminates between aquatic and terrestrial vegetation where values 0 4 are attributed to floating or submerged aquatic plant decay while those in the range 0 1 to 0 4 and 0 1 are indicative of emergent and terrestrial plants respectively wang et al 2018 in this study the paq values obtained ranged from 0 372 to 1 54 for water and 0 493 to 1 13 for sediment apportioning the presence of higher n alkanes to a mixture of emergent and terrestrial submerged as well as floating vegetation wang et al 2018 this is not surprising since the dam in located in a nature reserve rich in terrestrial and aquatic flora overall the n alkane proxies indicated that the presence of these compounds in water and sediment from the study area were derived from largely petrogenic and a variety of terrestrial floating and submerging vegetation 3 3 pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were present at total average concentrations of between 0 150 00494 and 49 8 6 86 µg l in water and 61 6 5 95 to 2618 300 µg kg in sediments table 2 generally the levels of pahs in water samples increased each year from 2015 to 2017 with average concentrations of 0 254 0 391 and 0 679 µg l in sediment the levels of these compounds decreased annually averaging 39 4 15 9 and 7 14 µg kg in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively there were statistically significant differences in the annual concentrations of pahs in water fcrit 2 29 p 3 02e 52 and sediment fcrit 2 42 p 9 60e 25 globally the pah content in highly polluted river water including the cauca river in colombia sarria villa et al 2016 and the yellow li et al 2006 tianjin shi et al 2005 xijiang deng et al 2006 and daliao guo et al 2007 rivers in china are in the range 0 00458 to 474 µg l zhi et al 2015 determined the presence of these compounds in a similar freshwater system poyong lake located downstream of the yangtze river china this water body is used extensively for agricultural residential industrial and tourism purposes the total pah concentrations determined in poyong lake were between 0 00556 and 0 266 µg l lower than the values obtained for loskop dam table 2 compared to south african water bodies chimuka et al 2016 as well as in findings from a previous study conducted at loskop dam seopela et al 2016 where pah levels ranged from 28 7 3192 6 µg l and 0 102 0 643 µg l respectively the concentrations in loskop dam water was within the reported values table 2 furthermore seopela et al 2016 found that at total concentrations ranging from 1 17 to 14 5 µg l embryotoxicity occurred in organisms exposed to water from loskop dam the total levels found in the present study are higher which infers that environmental concern is warranted loskop dam sediments had lower concentrations of pahs than those reported by nieuwoudt et al 2011 in samples collected from agricultural and industrial areas in south africa which were between 44 and 39 000 µg kg the report compiled by chimuka et al 2016 which indicated that the typical ranges of pahs in sediment collected from freshwater systems in south africa were between 44 5 and 2798 µg kg globally the concentrations determined in sediments collected from rivers in the vicinity of anthropogenic activities in china guo et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 japan onozato et al 2016 russia dahle et al 2003 france bertrand et al 2015 mexico wang et al 2014 nigeria tongo et al 2017 canada yunker and macdonald 2003 and india dhananjayan et al 2012 were comparable to those determined in this study as described by assunção et al 2017 references therein and pinheiro et al 2017 pah contamination may be subdivided into four categories namely low 0 to 100 µg kg moderate 100 to 1000 µg kg high 1000 to 5000 µg kg and very high 5000 µg kg based on the concentration ranges in sediment similarly total pah levels may be used to predict the potential effects using guideline values for the threshold effect level tel effects low range erl and probable effect level pel set at 1684 1 4022 0 and 16770 4 µg kg respectively in a previous study at loskop dam the total pah concentrations in sediment ranged from 292 to 2170 µg kg seopela et al 2016 which are above the lowest and below the highest total levels determined in this study these authors found that exposure of this sediment to zebrafish embryos induced developmental toxicity from the results obtained for pah concentrations in sediment table 2 the contamination at loskop dam can be classified as low to moderate the total pah levels for all samples were below the tel erl and pel quality guideline values which imply that no adverse biological changes would be induced by exposure to these samples however considering the findings from seopela et al 2016 there is risk associated with loskop dam sediment for both water and sediment the impact of the climatic conditions and consequent water levels on the points of sample collection and contaminant concentrations are reflected by the results the reduced concentrations may be related to decreased water levels and flow rate during the 2016 drought donnenfeld et al 2018 particularly for water samples the subsequent increase in 2017 is a reflection of higher rainfall and increased recreational activities in the main body of the dam in the case of sediment the shoreline recession had a greater impact on the pah concentrations detected since the sampling points were significantly different as a result of changes in water levels as described in numerous studies sediment is subject to spatial variations demonstrated by differences in concentrations within a study area in addition wang et al 2018 and references therein highlighted these differences by profiling sediment cores while surface sediment indicated current pollution levels they were able to trace n alkane contaminations at each sampling point to between 1925 and 2012 the results from the present and other studies cement the fact that the extent of contamination is highly dependent on activities occurring in the immediate surroundings the annual and site specific variations in pah concentrations may be a direct reflection of the variation in input sources to tease the sources of pahs the abundance of 2 to 6 ring compounds was assessed by evaluating their average percentage distribution in water and sediments these pah types have been shown to differentiate between petrogenic and pyrogenic sources respectively el nemr et al 2016 as illustrated by the ternary plot in fig 1 water and sediments were dominated by 2 and 3 ring pahs while 6 ring pahs were the least abundant however there were marked differences in the seasonal distribution of these compounds quantitative data derived from table 2 indicated that 2 to 4 ring pahs dominated water and sediments throughout all seasons corresponding to input sources that are derived from petrogenic and pyrogenic sources four ring pahs were dominant in autumn while 2 3 ring compounds were the most abundant in summer and winter the distribution of pahs in these samples is not surprising since this water body is located in a nature reserve frequented by holidaymakers the use of motorboats using petrol for fuel may be the source of low molecular weight lmw and medium molecular weight mmw compounds in this water system while the presence of high molecular weight hmw molecules were attributed to veld fires as well as combustion of fossil fuels for energy as with the ternary plots pah ratios lmw hmw flu pyr flu flu pyr phe ant nap phe ant ant phe inp inp bghip chr bant and bant bant chr table 3 are restricted to classifying these compounds as being derived from either petrogenic or pyrogenic input nonetheless these ratios can be used to deduce whether the spread of 2 to 6 ring pah source contributions were masked by the total percentage values the presence of these compounds were associated with combustion or direct input sources were employed these ratios make use of only 2 to 3 ring and 5 to 6 ring pahs in the calculation to account for the thermodynamic stabilities of individual compounds in the environment baumard et al 1998 ficken et al 2000 yunker et al 2002 yunker and macdonald 2003 neff et al 2005 with the exception of sites 1 and 12 sediments values for lmw hmw table 3 were 1 for all sites demonstrating that petrogenic sources were impacting this aquatic system these values were higher than those obtained by qiao et al 2006 who found that pyrogenic input was the source of these compounds in sediments from meiling bay china the dominance of petrogenic input was reaffirmed by the indices fln pyr 1 fln fln pyr 0 50 nap phe 1 and phe ant 0 50 table 3 in addition the apportionment of sources with bant bant chr and inp inp bghip indicated that petroleum 0 20 petroleum combustion 0 20 0 50 and fossil fuel combustion 0 35 were similar across water and sediments from loskop dam fossil fuel combustion was corroborated by the indices ant ant phe and chr bant for which the values were 0 50 comparison of indices ant ant phe to fln fln pyr and phe ant with fln pyr fig 2 demonstrated that the sources of pahs in loskop dam water and sediments were characterised by a mixture of petrogenic input and fossil fuel combustion including the burning of coal grass and wood 3 4 chemometric analysis individual concentrations of n alkanes and pahs determined in water and sediments were used to determine the key drivers of contamination in the different sections of the dam and to support the spatial distribution of the source apportionment of these compounds non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis indicated that euclidean distances best described the natural dissimilarity measure for target analyte data associated with loskop dam water and sediment samples oksanen 2015 fig 3 strong species similarity and correlations between sites were observed for the majority of samples particularly among sediment with the exception of samples collected at the inlet sites 1 to 4 water samples for the inlet sites were dominated by pahs while n alkanes were the main driving force behind clustering at the middle and upper segment sites sites 4 6 and the canal had the least association with other sampling locations across the dam the nmds fig 3b analysis for sediment reiterated the observation made with water samples related to site clustering stress 0 136 sediment from sites 3 and 7 were outliers while reference sites 11 and 12 were strongly associated with each other the nmds ordinations for the distribution of target analytes in loskop dam water and sediment were supported by the strong correlation r2 0 97 between ecological data and ordination distances as shown in the shepard plots fig s2 as discussed by oksanen et al 2018 goodness of fit measures in nmds are described by distance values 1 where identical sites 0 and those 1 infer that the data have no common features further classification of loskop dam water and sediment samples corresponding with target analyte presence and absence was achieved by conducting hierarchical cluster analysis hca with the r base package hclust based on dissimilarities oksanen et al 2018 for neutral grouping and best fit average linkages were applied to n alkane and pah distribution in loskop dam water and sediment with the general principle that nearest neighbour as well as height being the measures of similarities and dissimilarities oksanen et al 2018 three major clusters were generated for both sample types fig 4 these represented the inlet middle and upper reaches of the loskop dam the chemical composition of reference sites 10 and 11 were more related to upper segments sites than to those at the inlet this implied that similar factors may be influencing the levels of the target analytes in these areas of the dam these findings support site clustering observed with source apportionment of both n alkanes and pahs it is evident that spatial and temporal trends exist influenced by prevailing activities nonetheless the data demonstrates that customized strategies for each section must be put in place to counteract the variations in contamination throughout the dam as previously stated by abbaspour 2011 developing countries are highly dependent on industries for their economic growth but tend to underscore the importance of water quality while over emphasizing quantity in addition issues related to environmental contamination are also influenced by the pollution regulation policy of a country and how well it is implemented furthermore these data may be used to model the transportation of contaminants in this water body allowing predictions to be made on their ultimate fate and factors influencing their translocation 4 conclusions the olifants river has been exposed to anthropogenic stressors over a long period which has previously culminated in mass mortalities of aquatic organisms in various regions of the loskop dam this area is an important water source for many commercial farmers and communities in the vicinity effects stemming from years of continuing contamination have to be corrected however it is only through knowledge of the contamination sources that efficient mitigation procedures can be implemented the results from water and sediments indicate that some mixing and filtering effects occur in loskop dam since clustering of sampling points was observed after chemometric analysis of the data it follows that higher levels of pahs were detected in water from the inlet sites while these compounds were greatest in sediments collected at the upstream sites due to compound deposition from inflowing water reference sites 10 and 11 displayed similarity with other sampling points particularly with sites 8 7a and 12 this implies that the variability in contaminant distribution in the sediments is derived from a combination of sources either directly or indirectly traditional diagnostic proxies revealed that a mixture of petrogenic and pyrogenic sources were responsible for the presence of these compounds in loskop dam water and sediments chemometric analysis confirmed that the key driving factor responsible for the clustering of inlet water and sediment sites was driven by the dominance of pahs while n alkanes were prevalent in the upper reaches of the dam this combination of sources was expected for water samples mixing is facilitated by water flow which explains temporal distribution while the composition in sediments is dependent on the location of each sampling point the variation in source apportionment was more pronounced in sediments throughout the study partly due to the recession of the water line caused by drought conditions these findings may be used to address and implement counteractive strategies to preserve this water body for future human health and economic sustainability this study has highlighted the importance of taking seasonal variations and

17538,a novel pilot scale system based on aerobic granular sludge ags as a biological treatment step was proposed to treat refractory wastewater from a membrane manufacturer the components of the system included a microelectrolysis fe c filter a hydrolysis acidification bioreactor ha sequence batch reactor 1 ags sbr1 sequence batch reactor 2 ags sbr2 and a membrane bioreactor mbr the fe c filter effectively improved the biodegradability of the wastewater components and introduced some byproducts such as fe2 fe3 and fe minerals that are beneficial for the cultivation and stability of the ags ideal conditions for aerobic granulation were maintained in the sbr such as alternating feast and famine conditions a selection pressure including a hydraulic shear force and settling time was also created therein the results showed that the ags was formed successfully in both sbr1 and sbr2 the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 and mean particle size reached 34 2 ml g and 720 µm and 36 7 ml g and 610 µm respectively and a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was achieved in the system during the entire experimental period the microbial community changed significantly enrichment of microbes with the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps granule stabilization functions in the ags and the differentiation of microbes corresponding to the function of each unit were observed the use of fe c application of sbrs and use of dewatered sludge as an inoculant played key roles in the cultivation and stability of the ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe c filter aerobic granular sludge refractory wastewater microelectrolysis pilot scale coupling 1 introduction with the ever increasing level of technological standards industrial production has grown extensively during the present century leading to the production of large amounts of refractory wastewater in both developed and developing countries wastewater from membrane manufacturers is one such type of wastewater which contains refractory and biotoxic substances such as n n dimethylformamide dmf n n dimethylacetamide dmac heterocyclic nitrogen compounds and a small amount of polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf dexter et al 1979 peng et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in a traditional activated sludge process when the initial feed contains dmf or dmac the sludge gradually self digests because of its weak biodegradability generating a small amount of biogas and the decayed cells release ammonium kong et al 2019 however when the functional dmf degrading bacterial communities were developed dmf or dmac rapidly biodegraded nisha et al 2015 as a result the probable intermediates of dmf or dmac biotransformation such as formamide dimethylamine and formic acid were released and accumulated yang et al 2011 some intermediates of dmf or dmac may have higher biological toxicity than that of the original dmf or dmac peng et al 2018 therefore multi level treatment is needed to gradually improve the biodegradability of wastewater aerobic granular sludge ags has received widespread attention since its first patent was granted to heijnen and van loosdrecht heijnen and van loosdrecht 2003 it offers advantages over conventional activated sludge as it has a compact microbial structure high settleability high biological tolerance to high organic loads and toxicity and can degrade organic carbon and nutrients simultaneously zhang et al 2016 the application of ags in industrial wastewater has also shown excellent results corsino et al 2017 lochmatter and holliger 2014 however the main bottleneck in expanding the application of ags is the difficulty in its cultivation and stabilization to date most reactors for ags cultivation are sequence batch reactors sbrs as these provide ideal conditions for aerobic granulation li et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 xu et al 2020 such as alternating feast and famine conditions and creating a selection pressure including hydraulic shear forces and settling times that can be easily controlled arrojo et al 2004 beun et al 1999 other strategies including the addition of metal cation s jiang et al 2003 sajjad and kim 2015 organic loading rate rollemberg et al 2018 addition of coagulants or inert carriers liu et al 2014 and seeding pellets or granular sludge xu et al 2011 zou et al 2019 have also been found to be beneficial for the cultivation and stabilization of ags the fe c microelectrolysis has been proposed as an alternative for the pretreatment of bio refractory organic wastewater because of its operational simplicity economic feasibility and reusability ju and hu 2011 raju et al 2008 in the past decades extensive research on the use of fe c microelectrolysis to remove refractory or toxic components in wastewater has been conducted yang et al 2017 raju et al 2008 and full scale applications have also been reported ma et al 2018 the high redox potential 1 2 v between iron and carbon chips in combination with an electrolyte wastewater offers several strong electron acceptors the free hydrogen h and o produced during the microelectrolysis process have a strong redox activity which can break the carbon chains of several organic contaminants and increase the biodegradability of refractory wastewater zhang et al 2018 some organic pollutants can also be removed through coagulation and flocculation with fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 which are formed by the oxidation and precipitation of fe2 cheng et al 2007 in the process fe c microelectrolysis also introduces some byproducts such as fe2 fe3 and fe minerals in this context the byproducts of the fe c pretreatment may be beneficial for the cultivation and stability of ags and the process may also solve the problem of byproducts first fe3 and fe2 can promote floc sludge agglomeration and the generation of tiny aggregates and second the minerals formed by iron may promote the initial attachment of the floc sludge fe3 and fe2 have a positive effect on the cultivation and stability of ags ren et al 2018a therefore we built a novel coupling synergy system based on ags for treating wastewater from a membrane manufacturer in situ aiming at the characteristic pollutants in wastewater a hydrolysis acidification unit was added to hydrolyze dmf and dmac zhou et al 2018 the system included an initial fe c filter followed by a hydrolysis acidification bioreactor ha sequence batch reactor 1 sbr1 sequence batch reactor 2 sbr2 and a membrane bioreactor mbr the aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using the byproducts of fe c to promote ags formation while coupling the fe c and ags systems for efficient refractory wastewater treatment the performance of the pilot scale system was evaluated in terms of the sludge characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen removal efficiency and microbial community furthermore the granulation mechanism of ags and the coupled synergistic mechanism in the system were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and inoculation sludge the wastewater used in the system was obtained from a local membrane manufacturing company and the main parameters of the wastewater were as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 4100 1000 mg l total nitrogen tn 150 30 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 15 2 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod5 900 100 mg l and ph 5 3 0 4 the four bioreactors were inoculated with 150 kg of dewatered sludge obtained from the yuhang wastewater treatment plant in hangzhou china each bioreactor was inoculated with 10 l of domesticated sludge from the membrane manufacturer s original sewage treatment facility the system was then fed with the wastewater marking the beginning of the operational period 2 2 system setup and operation the process flow diagram and operating mode are shown in fig 1 the fe c filter was made of plexiglass and the other four bioreactors were made of stainless steel the fe c filter had a working volume of 1 5 m3 and was filled with 1000 kg of fe c particles the bioreactors ha sbr1 sbr2 and mbr had the same working volume of 3 m3 height 3 m each the fe c particles were purchased from an environmental enterprise and were characterized by an oval porous structure an average particle size of 30 mm and an iron content of more than 75 the mbr used four groups of hollow curtain membranes where the membrane material was pvdf the aperture was 0 1 µm the total membrane surface area was 80 m2 and the membrane module size was 1250 30 1200 mm wastewater entered the system from an adjusting tank after being pretreated by the fe c filter the wastewater flowed to an intermediate tank 3 m3 from the intermediate tank the wastewater was fed to the biological stage equipped with the four bioreactors ha sbr1 sbr2 and mbr the treated effluent was directly discharged from the mbr to the sewer via four groups of hollow curtain membranes surplus sludge was discharged from the mbr during the aeration stage where the amount and period of the sludge discharge were determined by the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the mbr the fe c filter was operated as a continuous fed process and the hydraulic retention time hrt and airflow rate were 3 h and 2 m3 h respectively four bioreactors were operated as a sequencing fed batch process with one cycle of 12 h consisting of an anaerobic feeding period a reaction period and a settling withdrawal idle period and the volume exchange rate was 50 furthermore the total hrt in the biological stage was 4 d and the anaerobic feeding phase in the two sbrs was 10 min further details of the system operation mode can be found in fig 1 the power of the submersible agitator in the ha was 0 85 kw and the airflow rate was 25 m3 h in the two sbrs and the mbr 2 3 analysis methods the water quality parameters cod bod5 tn fe and nh4 n and sludge properties mixed liquid suspended solids mlss sludge volume index after 5 min svi5 and sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the ph was monitored using a ph meter phs 3d shanghai the sludge morphology was examined using an optical microscope eclipse ni nikon japan and the size of the aerobic granules was determined by image pro plus analysis 6 0 olympus soft imaging solution the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed using an x pert pro pnalytical netherlands with ceramic tube scattering from 10 to 80 at 2θ the x ray fluorescence xrf analysis was performed using arl advant x intellipowertm 4200 thermofisher usa to remove the organic fraction sludge samples analyzed by xrd and xrf were dried and calcined in an oven at 500 c for 2 h the statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 2 4 dna extraction polymerase chain reaction amplification and high throughput sequencing eleven sludge samples acquired from the inoculation sludge and sludge from four bioreactors sampled on days 30 and 70 were freeze dried for nucleotide extraction details of the samples are shown in table 1 genomic dna was extracted from the sludge samples using the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit m5635 02 omega usa following the manufacturer s protocols extracted dna was integrated with the universal primer forward primer 341f and reverse primer 805r targeting the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene pcr was performed

using usearch microbial alpha diversity indices such as shannon simpson chao and abundance based coverage estimator ace were analyzed using the mothur program the rdp classifier with a confidence threshold of 70 was used to classify effective sequences into different taxonomy units while the community composition was analyzed at different taxonomy levels the raw sequence data were uploaded to the genbank database under accession numbers srr11348773 to srr113487783 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the sludge characteristics of the four bioreactors especially the ags in the two sbrs the sludge granulation process was carried out in conjunction with changes in the sludge properties and morphology the sludge properties include the mlss svi fig 2 and particle size distribution psd fig 3 e the morphology of the sludge is shown in fig 3 aerobic granulation in the system was successfully achieved at the sedimentation time of 5 min for both sbr1 and sbr2 and the settling time of the ha was set at 2 h to ensure that the sludge in the ha did not leak to subsequent units from days 1 to 75 of the operational phase i the mlss of the ha fig 2a initially decreased sharply due to the high toxicity and high loading rate then entered a period of stability and finally reached 3548 mg l the mlss of sbr1 fig 2b decreased more significantly than that of sbr2 during the start up period as sbr2 fig 2c was supplemented with sbr1 selected sludge and sbr1 and sbr2 then entered a period of constant increase on days 50 60 of operational phase i to improve the mlss of sbr1 and sbr2 part of the sludge from the mbr and some dewatered sludge was added to sbr1 subsequently the mlss increased significantly in sbr1 and sbr2 and finally reached 5416 and 3778 mg l respectively the mlss of the mbr fig 2d kept rising steadily and stabilized at 5337 mg l due to the low loading rate and supplementation of washed out sludge from sbr2 the svi initially increased in the four biological units due to reactivation of the dewatered sludge then the svi30 in the ha fig 2a dropped to 32 9 ml g on day 70 in sbr1 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2b sharply decreased after the reactivation of the dewatered sludge and then stabilized at 44 3 and 53 5 ml g respectively the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 83 similarly in sbr2 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2c sharply decreased after the reactivation of the dewatered sludge and then stabilized at 39 7 and 60 9 ml g respectively the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 65 the svi30 in the mbr fig 2d remained relatively constant from days 76 to 265 of operational phase ii which was a stable system operation period the effluent quality was found to be satisfactory from days 266 to 280 of operational phase iii the mlss of the ha sbr1 and sbr2 fig 2a b c stabilized at 3400 80 6000 150 and 5500 170 mg l respectively the svi30 stabilized at 38 2 ml g in ha in sbr1 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2b stabilized at 35 3 1 1 and 39 5 0 6 ml g respectively and the ratio of svi30 to svi5 stabilized at 0 89 in sbr2 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2c stabilized at 37 5 0 6 and 46 5 0 7 ml g respectively and the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 80 due to the use of dewatered sludge as an inoculant sludge aggregates had already appeared during the system start up period 0 5 days but they were agitated and aerated during the initial operation the particle size distribution psd was mainly within the range of 0 0 5 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 fig 3e and the average particle size was 0 26 and 0 27 mm respectively with the continued operation of the system the sludge morphology in the ha did not change significantly and remained flocculent fig 3a the sludge in sbr1 continued to grow after being broken up the lighter sludge was washed to sbr2 and the heavy sludge remained in sbr1 in sbr2 the dispersed sludge grew together with the sludge from sbr1 the lighter sludge was washed to the mbr and the heavy sludge remained in sbr2 the mbr received the wash out sludge from sbr2 and eventually accumulated a large number of tiny sludge aggregates fig 3d on day 50 the average particle size of the granules increased significantly to 0 56 and 0 44 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively and the psd 0 2 mm in sbr1 decreased to 25 2 while at the psds between 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased to 36 6 and 22 8 respectively in sbr2 the psd 0 2 mm decreased to 27 3 while those at 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased to 35 6 and 25 8 respectively as described in previous studies aerobic granulation of the sludge occurred when more than half of the particles were larger than 0 34 mm bhunia and ghangrekar 2007 tiwari et al 2005 afterwards the particle sizes of the ags reached 0 72 and 0 61 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively on day 70 and in sbr1 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 17 8 and 21 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 27 6 and 24 3 respectively in sbr2 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 20 3 and 31 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 27 1 and 14 3 respectively it was observed that the particle size and quantity of the ags in sbr2 were smaller than those in sbr1 fig 3c d e which was likely because sbr1 accumulated more fe and sbr2 received the wash out sludge from sbr1 in general each type of sludge in the bioreactor we studied showed a high settleability during operation and ags was formed successfully in sbr1 and sbr2 3 2 performance of the system the functional stability of the pilot scale system was defined and quantified by the concentration of eight indicators including cod bod5 fe ammonia nitrate nitrogen tn and ph fig 4 shows the concentration range of the indictors along the treatment train the data are mean values together with the standard deviation for days 20 to 70 the cod removal during the operation period fig 4a was approximately 98 1 with average cod concentrations in the raw water fe c filter ha sbr1 sbr2 and mbr effluent of 4153 3559 2727 274 138 and 78 mg l respectively the residual refractory organics were hydrolyzed in the fe c filter and the following ha to improve the bod5 cod ratio for further aerobic removal the fe c filter improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 22 to 0 30 the ha improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 30 to 0 39 and most biodegradable compounds were degraded in sbr1 fig 4a the concentration of fe fig 4a reached 120 9 mg l in the effluent of the fe c filter in the effluent of the ha this concentration reduced to 67 8 mg l reduced to 9 mg l after sbr1 and could not be detected in the final effluent these results indicate that the fe c filter had no negative impact on the effluent quality the variation of the fe concentration indicates that the influx of fe may be related to a reduction in the svi value of the sludge in the ha unit and the sludge granulation in the two sbrs as discussed in the sections below the large accumulation of fe in ha and sbr1 might increase the inert material within the biomass but the operational effect showed that there was no decrease in sludge activity fig 4b shows the variations of organic n no3 n no2 n nh4 n and ph in the effluent of each unit of the system in the fe c filter effluent the ph increased and the concentration of organic n no3 n and tn decreased previous studies showed that the no3 n could be reduced by zero valent iron and the decrease in organic n may be due to the coagulation of organic by fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 cheng et al 2007 ren et al 2017 in the ha effluent except for the reduction in ph no other parameters varied significantly however in the effluent of sbr1 the concentration of organic n and no3 n decreased rapidly and the concentration of nh4 n and the ph increased significantly indicating that the main reaction in sbr1 was the deamination reaction where organic n was converted into nh4 n and this process was accompanied by an increase in ph in the sbr2 effluent the nh4 n concentration and the ph decreased no3 n concentration increased and no2 n appeared at the same time indicating that nitrification was the main reaction in sbr2 resulting in the conversion of nh4 n into no3 n and no2 n additionally the reduction of tn was observed in both sbr1 and sbr2 and the reduction of tn in sbr1 and sbr2 was significantly higher than that of nox n in the influent indicating that denitrification in the influent anoxic phase contributed to n removal simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd based on the ags also occurred in sbr1 and sbr2 mass balance table s1 showed that the contributions of snd to n removal in sbr1 and sbr2 were higher than 15 0 and 14 8 respectively the synergistic effects of snd in sbr1 and sbr2 optimized the n removal capacity in the system in the mbr effluent the concentration of nh4 n and the ph continued to decrease and the concentration of no3 n continued to increase indicating that nitrification continued in the mbr in summary the system showed a satisfactory treatment effect which met the local standards of drainage into municipal pipelines in the following sections we illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in the different bioreactors in the system 3 3 microbial community characterization the microbial community was analyzed through high throughput sequencing across the 11 samples from the four bioreactors of the pilot scale system sampling time and spots are provided in the lower row of fig 5 a total of 635 732 effective sequences were retrieved from the samples yielding 29 490 69 614 effective sequences for each sample the good s coverage of the 11 samples was higher than 99 table 2 indicating that the microbial diversities were basically covered by the obtained sequence libraries the richness and diversity of the microorganisms could be indicated by the chao ace shannon and simpson indices shown in table 2 the similarities and differences among the microbial communities at the genus level are shown in fig 5 3 3 1 responses in taxonomic composition of microbial communities in four bioreactors the diversity indices shannon or simpson index showed that except in the mbr the diversity increased with the progression of treatment in the system the diversity trend implicating the type and concentration of contaminants in the wastewater determined the bacterial diversity which showed that the diversity increased with the biological treatment progress the decrease in the microbial diversity in the mbr may be attributed to the extremely low nutrient concentrations to identify the microbial community structure and function in the biological treatment process the classified operational taxonomic units otus were analyzed at the genus level and the bacterial diversity of the bioreactor samples significantly differed fig 5 in the ha the genera peectinatus megasphaera and novophingobium were dominant the genera peectinatus and megasphaera belong to the family veilonellaceae which can tolerate high concentrations of organic acids and can be considered as helpers in bioh2 reactors stabilizing the process among the mixed cultures pachiega et al 2019 the genus novophingobium is known for its ability to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants segura et al 2017 the major genera detected in sbr1 were norank rhodocyclaceae sphingobium and novophingobium the genus norank rhodocyclaceae belongs to the family rhodocyclaceae which consists of bacteria that remove refractory pollutants produce extracellular polymeric substances eps and perform denitrification xia et al 2018 the genus sphingobium is known for its ability to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants saiphet et al 2006 the major genera detected in sbr2 were pseudochelatococcus and sphingobium the genus pseudochelatococcus which consists of bacteria associated with nitrification emerged as the predominant group dasgupta et al 2019 ren et al 2020 the major genera recovered in the mbr appeared to be quite different from those in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 showing the dominance of the genera norank cytophagales env ops 17 and ferruginibacter which are closer to the genera previously observed in wwtps ye and zhang 2013 overall the results of microbial community analysis support the degradation trend of pollutants in different units the refractory pollutants were first hydrolyzed in ha to improve biodegradability then they were further degraded in sbr1 the main nitrification occurred in sbr2 and sbr1 and sbr2 had a certain denitrification capacity and finally water sludge separation occurred in the mbr 3 3 2 the variations of microbial community characterization in ags the shannon and simpson indices table 2 for sbr1 30 d the floc sludge of sbr1 sbr1f 70 d the ags of sbr1 sbr1g 70 d sbr2 30 d the floc sludge of sbr2 sbr2f 70 d and the ags of sbr2 sbr2g 70 d indicate that the microbial diversity decreased in the granulation process in sbr1 but increased in sbr2 this may be attributed to the different organic loading rates in sbr1 4 5 kg cod m³d and sbr2 0 5 kg cod m³d previous studies have shown that the microbial community diversity declined after granulation under a high organic loading rate and increased in low strength wastewater chen et al 2019 zou et al 2018 compared to the inoculum sludge the microbial community changed significantly in the granulation process of both sbr1 and sbr2 the microbial community structure and function in the granulation process of sbr1 and sbr2 were analyzed at the genus level as shown in fig 5 the genera azotobacter and norank rhodocyclaceae exhibited an increasing trend in the granulation process and enrichment in the ags including sbr1 and sbr2 the family rhodobacteraceae of the genus norank rhodocyclaceae consists of denitrifying and eps producing bacteria and the genus azotobacter can produce exopolysaccharide alginates alginate like eps that are one of the major exopolysaccharides in the aerobic granules lin et al 2010 sutherland 1990 however thauera and zoogloea showed a different trend a significant increasing trend in the first 30 days in sbr1 and sbr2 and then a decline after complete granulation which is consistent with previous report liu et al 2018 the genus thauera consists of facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacteria that can produce excess extracellular polysaccharides and proteins and thus help maintain the granular structure liu et al 2018 lv et al 2014 wan et al 2015 the genus zoogloea consists of floc forming bacteria that can promote the secretion of eps that can bind cells together liu et al 2018 lv et al 2014 ren et al 2018b wan et al 2015 therefore based on the results from this study and previous research it was speculated that the family rhodobacteraceae and the genus azotobacter play an important role in the granulation process and the enrichment of rhodobacteraceae greatly enhances the nitrogen removal capacity of the ags we then compared the microbial communities in sbr1g 70 d with those in sbr2g 70 d sphingobium and novophingobium decreased significantly from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d which corresponds to the degradation of various refractory pollutants ren et al 2020 xia et al 2018 the genus pseudochelatococcus increased significantly from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d which indicates nitrification specifically the major genus of the family chitinophagaleae which consists of ammonia oxidizing bacteria increased from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d gomez alvarez et al 2013 these results confirm that the structure and function of the ags in sbr1 was different from that in sbr2 the main role of the ags in sbr1 was to degrade organic matter while in sbr2 it was to oxidize ammonia and nitrite into nitrite and nitrate these activities corresponded to the effluent quality of the two sbrs 3 4 mineral analysis of fe c particles and ags to further investigate the role of fe c particles xrf and xrd were used to analyze the collected fe c particle samples including unused fe c particle powder unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and used fe c particle after 70 days surface scraped powder as shown in fig 6 a the content of fe in the unused fe c particle powder unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and used fe c particle surface scraped powder evaluated using the xrf spectrometer were 42 5 41 6 and 41 3 respectively the changes in the other elements were not evident in the three samples in the xrd analysis fig 6b the diffraction peaks of zero valent iron were only observed in the unused fe c particle powder and the unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and as the main form of fe c particles the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 were observed in all samples these results indicate that the zero valent iron in the fe c filter played an important role as a cathode the zero valent iron in the fe c filter was consumed in a small amount after 70 days of operation and the leakage of other elements was maintained at a lower level which was consistent with previous studies zhu et al 2018 the xrf and xrd analyses were also carried out on the sludge samples from is ha sbr1 and sbr2 fig 6c shows the composition of the mineral elements in the sludge samples as measured using xrf as compared to the is the content of fe si and al increased significantly in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 in particular fe increased from 8 1 wt in is to 26 3 17 9 and 18 8 wt in ha sbr1 and sbr2 respectively thus the accumulation of fe in the ha was the highest due to the fe from the influent or the selected sludge sbr1 and sbr2 also accumulated a substantial amount of fe in the xrd analysis fig 6d the diffraction peaks of sio2 were observed in all the four samples and the diffraction peaks of lepidocrocite γ feo oh were only observed in the sludge samples from the ha sbr1 and sbr2 interestingly recent studies have reported that the genus dechloromonas and the order xanthomonadaceae detected in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 could induce the formation of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides by oxidizing fe ii kiskira et al 2017 straub and buchholz cleven 1998 subsequently ferric oxyhydroxides could mature into a variety of fe oxides such as goethite lepidocrocite and magnetite in the presence of oxygen wilfert et al 2015 the mineral precipitates formed by fe can bind with eps and cells similar to the cell eps mineral interrelationships widely investigated in the field of geomicrobiology mccutcheon and southam 2018 these results suggest that mineral deposits formed by the mineral elements especially fe within an ags matrix have a positive effect on sludge granulation 3 5 proposed synergy degradation model of industrial wastewater in the pilot system and sludge granulation mechanism 3 5 1 proposed synergy degradation model of wastewater in the pilot system combining the obtained results including the structure and function of the microbes the characteristics of the wastewater the operational parameters and the relevant data from previous studies yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 we proposed a comprehensive degradation model for the pilot scale system fig 7 which could help understand the interactions between water quality operational parameters and microbial structure and function first the treatment occurred in the fe c filter and the major function of the fe c filter is to improve the bod5 cod ratio reduce biotoxicity and coagulate some of the organics through internal electrolysis and the zero valent iron process jiricek et al 2007 the results show that fe c can efficiently improve the bod5 cod ratio to 0 28 0 32 and remove 594 gcod m3d second the major function of ha is hydrolytic acidification further improvement of the bod5 cod ratio and a reduction in biotoxicity hydrolytic conditions contribute to the hydrolysis of large molecular contaminants into biodegradable small molecular substances previous studies have shown that the type and concentration of refractory contaminants decreased significantly in the h stages and were followed by an increase in ph value xu et al 2015 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 the genera peectinatus megasphaera novophingobium and related groups can decompose refractory contaminants into readily biodegradable substances saiphet et al 2006 xia et al 2018 consequently the bod5 cod ratio increased to 0 36 0 41 and the ph value decreased significantly in the ha unit third the cultivation of ags for efficient aerobic biotransformation of the organics and nitrogen removal was expected in sbr1 and sbr2 the genera sphingobium and novophingobium were recruited in sbr1 to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants saiphet et al 2006 the genus pseudochelatococcus and related groups were recruited from sbr2 for nitrification moreover the genus from the family rhodocyclaceae detected in both sbr1 and sbr2 contributed to denitrification and the promotion of granulation zou et al 2018 the high settleability high biological tolerance to high organic loads and toxicity of ags were found to be beneficial to the efficient biotransformation of pollutants and the maintaining stability lochmatter and holliger 2014 the longer sludge retention time srt of ags is beneficial to the growth of nitrifying microbes which can promote nitrification graham et al 2007 the compact microbial structure of ags created an oxygen concentration gradient inside which provided the conditions for the occurrence of snd and enhanced nitrogen removal coma et al 2012 the results show that svi30 reached 44 3 and 39 7 ml g in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively and the tn removal rates were 42 gtn m3d and 20 gtn m3d respectively the cod removal rate reached 2452 gcod m3d in sbr1 and significant degradation of nh4 n from 55 8 to 33 1 mg l was observed in sbr2 finally the mbr was expected to accept all the washed out sludge and conduct sludge water separation with the progression of granulation the washed out sludge also consisted of ags which may have reduced the clogging of the membrane the results also show the degradation of nh4 n from 33 1 to 20 4 mg l and cod 60 gcod m3d in the mbr and that the effluent quality met the local standards of drainage into municipal pipelines in summary the information gathered from this model improved our understanding of the coupled synergistic mechanism in the novel pilot scale system for example the fe c filter improved the bod5 cod ratio reduced biotoxicity to decrease the impact on the ha and generated byproducts to promote granulation in the sbrs the ha further improved the bod5 cod ratio and reduced biotoxicity which facilitated subsequent treatment the sbr1 and sbr2 cultivated ags for efficient treatment while eliminating the byproducts from fe c and the mbr accepted all the washed out sludge from sbr2 and conducted sludge water separation 3 5 2 proposed sludge granulation mechanism although there have been many reports on the successful cultivation of ags at a pilot scale or in full scale sbrs the slow startup speed and poor stability of ags hindered its further development li et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 our study aimed to cultivate the ags in a two stage sbr coupled with an fe c filter during the treatment of industrial wastewater the coupling system was successful in cultivating ags in sbr1 and sbr2 with a large particle size 720 and 610 µm respectively and good settling properties low svi30 of 44 3 and 39 7 ml g respectively in contrast to the addition of external nucleating agents e g micropowder and naturally drying sludge the byproducts of fe c in this study acted as a nucleating agent for the system promoting rapid sludge granulation in the coupling system mineral analysis of ags fig 6c d showed that the byproducts of the fe c filter contributed to the granulation of ags the fe2 fe3 and fe minerals decreased the negative charges on the microbes and could act as a nucleus for bacterial attachment binding eps and microbes into denser microbial aggregates ren et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 moreover the genus dechloromonas and the order xanthomonadaceae detected in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 could induce the formation of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides by oxidizing fe ii kiskira et al 2017 straub and buchholz cleven 1998 subsequently ferric oxyhydroxides could mature into a variety of fe oxides such as goethite lepidocrocite and magnetite in the presence of oxygen wilfert et al 2015 the mineral precipitates formed by fe can bind to eps and cells similar to the cell eps mineral interrelationships widely investigated in the field of geomicrobiology mccutcheon and southam 2018 as the byproducts of fe c continuously entered into the two sbrs a long term mechanism was formed that continuously promoted the formation of ags thereby ensuring the stability of the ags system additionally the enrichment of minerals helped in maintaining the stability of ags franca et al 2018 sludge size is strongly correlated with settling velocity and the eps synthesis which are crucial for the granulation and settling ability of sludge corsino et al 2016b zhang et al 2016 during the granulation process eps is synthesized by the aggregated microorganisms after exposure to the elevated influent organic loading rate olr in the anaerobic feeding phase gao et al 2011 microbes related to eps production will form aggregates granules with better settling capability together with other microbes in addition the selective pressure of sbr promoted the retention of aggregates granules with higher eps production microbes the genera thauera and zoogloea in the sbr and the withdrawal of flocs with lower eps producing microbes from the sbr fig 2c a higher content of eps facilitates the adhesion of cell cell or cell particulates into a microbial aggregate in which the particulates e g chemical precipitation and influent particulate materials act as nuclei for cell attachment sarma et al 2017 furthermore the use of dewatered sludge as inoculation sludge also plays an important role in the rapid start up of the ags system as it introduces several small eps rich aggregates solving the problem of random aggregation disintegration during rapid sludge granulation in the start up stage liu et al 2020 lv et al 2014 therefore by coupling with fe c providing fe2 fe3 and fe minerals applying the sbr feast and famine conditions creating selection pressure and using dewatered sludge as an inoculant accelerating the appearance of aggregates ags could be formed rapidly the sludge granulation mechanism is schematized in fig 7 4 conclusion in this study a pilot scale system with an initial fe c filter followed by an ha sbr1 sbr2 and an mbr was developed to investigate the formation of ags and the coupled synergistic mechanism the byproducts of the fe c filter fe2 fe3 and fe minerals and the feast and famine conditions and selection pressure of sbr resulted in svi30 eventually reaching 34 2 and 36 7 ml g in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was also achieved in the system with removal rates of 4074 7 gcod m3d and 83 7 gtn m3d and the removal rate reached 2588 8 gcod m3d and 62 6 gtn m3d in the ags of sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the microbial community showed enrichment of microbes with eps secretion and granule stabilization functions in ags and the differentiation of microbes corresponded to the function of each unit furthermore mineral analyses suggested that the mineral deposits formed by the mineral elements especially fe within an ags matrix had a positive effect on sludge granulation the coupling system provided new information on the application of ags by using the byproducts continuously generated in the process to achieve a long term mechanism of ags granulation and stability and optimizing the nutrient removal performance by sludge granulation declaration of competing

17538,a novel pilot scale system based on aerobic granular sludge ags as a biological treatment step was proposed to treat refractory wastewater from a membrane manufacturer the components of the system included a microelectrolysis fe c filter a hydrolysis acidification bioreactor ha sequence batch reactor 1 ags sbr1 sequence batch reactor 2 ags sbr2 and a membrane bioreactor mbr the fe c filter effectively improved the biodegradability of the wastewater components and introduced some byproducts such as fe2 fe3 and fe minerals that are beneficial for the cultivation and stability of the ags ideal conditions for aerobic granulation were maintained in the sbr such as alternating feast and famine conditions a selection pressure including a hydraulic shear force and settling time was also created therein the results showed that the ags was formed successfully in both sbr1 and sbr2 the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 and mean particle size reached 34 2 ml g and 720 µm and 36 7 ml g and 610 µm respectively and a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was achieved in the system during the entire experimental period the microbial community changed significantly enrichment of microbes with the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps granule stabilization functions in the ags and the differentiation of microbes corresponding to the function of each unit were observed the use of fe c application of sbrs and use of dewatered sludge as an inoculant played key roles in the cultivation and stability of the ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe c filter aerobic granular sludge refractory wastewater microelectrolysis pilot scale coupling 1 introduction with the ever increasing level of technological standards industrial production has grown extensively during the present century leading to the production of large amounts of refractory wastewater in both developed and developing countries wastewater from membrane manufacturers is one such type of wastewater which contains refractory and biotoxic substances such as n n dimethylformamide dmf n n dimethylacetamide dmac heterocyclic nitrogen compounds and a small amount of polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf dexter et al 1979 peng et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in a traditional activated sludge process when the initial feed contains dmf or dmac the sludge gradually self digests because of its weak biodegradability generating a small amount of biogas and the decayed cells release ammonium kong et al 2019 however when the functional dmf degrading bacterial communities were developed dmf or dmac rapidly biodegraded nisha et al 2015 as a result the probable intermediates of dmf or dmac biotransformation such as formamide dimethylamine and formic acid were released and accumulated yang et al 2011 some intermediates of dmf or dmac may have higher biological toxicity than that of the original dmf or dmac peng et al 2018 therefore multi level treatment is needed to gradually improve the biodegradability of wastewater aerobic granular sludge ags has received widespread attention since its first patent was granted to heijnen and van loosdrecht heijnen and van loosdrecht 2003 it offers advantages over conventional activated sludge as it has a compact microbial structure high settleability high biological tolerance to high organic loads and toxicity and can degrade organic carbon and nutrients simultaneously zhang et al 2016 the application of ags in industrial wastewater has also shown excellent results corsino et al 2017 lochmatter and holliger 2014 however the main bottleneck in expanding the application of ags is the difficulty in its cultivation and stabilization to date most reactors for ags cultivation are sequence batch reactors sbrs as these provide ideal conditions for aerobic granulation li et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 xu et al 2020 such as alternating feast and famine conditions and creating a selection pressure including hydraulic shear forces and settling times that can be easily controlled arrojo et al 2004 beun et al 1999 other strategies including the addition of metal cation s jiang et al 2003 sajjad and kim 2015 organic loading rate rollemberg et al 2018 addition of coagulants or inert carriers liu et al 2014 and seeding pellets or granular sludge xu et al 2011 zou et al 2019 have also been found to be beneficial for the cultivation and stabilization of ags the fe c microelectrolysis has been proposed as an alternative for the pretreatment of bio refractory organic wastewater because of its operational simplicity economic feasibility and reusability ju and hu 2011 raju et al 2008 in the past decades extensive research on the use of fe c microelectrolysis to remove refractory or toxic components in wastewater has been conducted yang et al 2017 raju et al 2008 and full scale applications have also been reported ma et al 2018 the high redox potential 1 2 v between iron and carbon chips in combination with an electrolyte wastewater offers several strong electron acceptors the free hydrogen h and o produced during the microelectrolysis process have a strong redox activity which can break the carbon chains of several organic contaminants and increase the biodegradability of refractory wastewater zhang et al 2018 some organic pollutants can also be removed through coagulation and flocculation with fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 which are formed by the oxidation and precipitation of fe2 cheng et al 2007 in the process fe c microelectrolysis also introduces some byproducts such as fe2 fe3 and fe minerals in this context the byproducts of the fe c pretreatment may be beneficial for the cultivation and stability of ags and the process may also solve the problem of byproducts first fe3 and fe2 can promote floc sludge agglomeration and the generation of tiny aggregates and second the minerals formed by iron may promote the initial attachment of the floc sludge fe3 and fe2 have a positive effect on the cultivation and stability of ags ren et al 2018a therefore we built a novel coupling synergy system based on ags for treating wastewater from a membrane manufacturer in situ aiming at the characteristic pollutants in wastewater a hydrolysis acidification unit was added to hydrolyze dmf and dmac zhou et al 2018 the system included an initial fe c filter followed by a hydrolysis acidification bioreactor ha sequence batch reactor 1 sbr1 sequence batch reactor 2 sbr2 and a membrane bioreactor mbr the aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using the byproducts of fe c to promote ags formation while coupling the fe c and ags systems for efficient refractory wastewater treatment the performance of the pilot scale system was evaluated in terms of the sludge characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen removal efficiency and microbial community furthermore the granulation mechanism of ags and the coupled synergistic mechanism in the system were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and inoculation sludge the wastewater used in the system was obtained from a local membrane manufacturing company and the

adjusting tank after being pretreated by the fe c filter the wastewater flowed to an intermediate tank 3 m3 from the intermediate tank the wastewater was fed to the biological stage equipped with the four bioreactors ha sbr1 sbr2 and mbr the treated effluent was directly discharged from the mbr to the sewer via four groups of hollow curtain membranes surplus sludge was discharged from the mbr during the aeration stage where the amount and period of the sludge discharge were determined by the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the mbr the fe c filter was operated as a continuous fed

the genbank database under accession numbers srr11348773 to srr113487783 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the sludge characteristics of the four bioreactors especially the ags in the two sbrs the sludge granulation process was carried out in conjunction with changes in the sludge properties and morphology the sludge properties include the mlss svi fig 2 and particle size distribution psd fig 3 e the morphology of the sludge is shown in fig 3 aerobic granulation in the system was successfully achieved at the sedimentation time of 5 min for both sbr1 and sbr2 and the settling time of the ha was set at 2 h to ensure that the sludge in the ha did not leak to subsequent units from days 1 to 75 of the operational phase i the mlss of the ha fig 2a initially decreased sharply due to the high toxicity and high loading rate then entered a period of stability and finally reached 3548 mg l the mlss of sbr1 fig 2b decreased more significantly than that of sbr2 during the start up period as sbr2 fig 2c was supplemented with sbr1 selected sludge and sbr1 and sbr2 then entered a period of constant increase on days 50 60 of operational phase i to improve the mlss of sbr1 and sbr2 part of the sludge from the mbr and some dewatered sludge was added to sbr1 subsequently the mlss increased significantly in sbr1 and sbr2 and finally reached 5416 and 3778 mg l respectively the mlss of the mbr fig 2d kept rising steadily and stabilized at 5337 mg l due to the low loading rate and supplementation of washed out sludge from sbr2 the svi initially increased in the four biological units due to reactivation of the dewatered sludge then the svi30 in the ha fig 2a dropped to 32 9 ml g on day 70 in sbr1 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2b sharply decreased after the reactivation of the dewatered sludge and then stabilized at 44 3 and 53 5 ml g respectively the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 83 similarly in sbr2 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2c sharply decreased after the reactivation of the dewatered sludge and then stabilized at 39 7 and 60 9 ml g respectively the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 65 the svi30 in the mbr fig 2d remained relatively constant from days 76 to 265 of operational phase ii which was a stable system operation period the effluent quality was found to be satisfactory from days 266 to 280 of operational phase iii the mlss of the ha sbr1 and sbr2 fig 2a b c stabilized at 3400 80 6000 150 and 5500 170 mg l respectively the svi30 stabilized at 38 2 ml g in ha in sbr1 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2b stabilized at 35 3 1 1 and 39 5 0 6 ml g respectively and the ratio of svi30 to svi5 stabilized at 0 89 in sbr2 the svi30 and svi5 fig 2c stabilized at 37 5 0 6 and 46 5 0 7 ml g respectively and the ratio of svi30 to svi5 increased to 0 80 due to the use of dewatered sludge as an inoculant sludge aggregates had already appeared during the system start up period 0 5 days but they were agitated and aerated during the initial operation the particle size distribution psd was mainly within the range of 0 0 5 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 fig 3e and the average particle size was 0 26 and 0 27 mm respectively with the continued operation of the system the sludge morphology in the ha did not change significantly and remained flocculent fig 3a the sludge in sbr1 continued to grow after being broken up the lighter sludge was washed to sbr2 and the heavy sludge remained in sbr1 in sbr2 the dispersed sludge grew together with the sludge from sbr1 the lighter sludge was washed to the mbr and the heavy sludge remained in sbr2 the mbr received the wash out sludge from sbr2 and eventually accumulated a large number of tiny sludge aggregates fig 3d on day 50 the average particle size of the granules increased significantly to 0 56 and 0 44 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively and the psd 0 2 mm in sbr1 decreased to 25 2 while at the psds between 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased to 36 6 and 22 8 respectively in sbr2 the psd 0 2 mm decreased to 27 3 while those at 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased to 35 6 and 25 8 respectively as described in previous studies aerobic granulation of the sludge occurred when more than half of the particles were larger than 0 34 mm bhunia and ghangrekar 2007 tiwari et al 2005 afterwards the particle sizes of the ags reached 0 72 and 0 61 mm in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively on day 70 and in sbr1 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 17 8 and 21 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 27 6 and 24 3 respectively in sbr2 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 20 3 and 31 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 27 1 and 14 3 respectively it was observed that the particle size and quantity of the ags in sbr2 were smaller than those in sbr1 fig 3c d e which was likely because sbr1 accumulated more fe and sbr2 received the wash out sludge from sbr1 in general each type of sludge in the bioreactor we studied showed a high settleability during operation and ags was formed successfully in sbr1 and sbr2 3 2 performance of the system the functional stability of the pilot scale system was defined and quantified by the concentration of eight indicators including cod bod5 fe ammonia nitrate nitrogen tn and ph fig 4 shows the concentration range of the indictors along the treatment train the data are mean values together with the standard deviation for days 20 to 70 the cod removal during the operation period fig 4a was approximately 98 1 with average cod concentrations in the raw water fe c filter ha sbr1 sbr2 and mbr effluent of 4153 3559 2727 274 138 and 78 mg l respectively the residual refractory organics were hydrolyzed in the fe c filter and the following ha to improve the bod5 cod ratio for further aerobic removal the fe c filter improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 22 to 0 30 the ha improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 30 to 0 39 and most biodegradable compounds were degraded in sbr1 fig 4a the concentration of fe fig 4a reached 120 9 mg l in the effluent of the fe c filter in the effluent of the ha this concentration reduced to 67 8 mg l reduced to 9 mg l after sbr1 and could not be detected in the final effluent these results indicate that the fe c filter had no negative impact on the effluent quality the variation of the fe concentration indicates that the influx of fe may be related to a reduction in the svi value of the sludge in the ha unit and the sludge granulation in the two sbrs as discussed in the sections below the large accumulation of fe in ha and sbr1 might increase the inert material within the biomass but the operational effect showed that there was no decrease in sludge activity fig 4b shows the variations of organic n no3 n no2 n nh4 n and ph in the effluent of each unit of the system in the fe c filter effluent the ph increased and the concentration of organic n no3 n and tn decreased previous studies showed that the no3 n could be reduced by zero valent iron and the decrease in organic n may be due to the coagulation of organic by fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 cheng et al 2007 ren et al 2017 in the ha effluent except for the reduction in ph no other parameters varied significantly however in the effluent of sbr1 the concentration of organic n and no3 n decreased rapidly and the concentration of nh4 n and the ph increased significantly indicating that the main reaction in sbr1 was the deamination reaction where organic n was converted into nh4 n and this process was accompanied by an increase in ph in the sbr2 effluent the nh4 n concentration and the ph decreased no3 n concentration increased and no2 n appeared at the same time indicating that nitrification was the main reaction in sbr2 resulting in the conversion of nh4 n into no3 n and no2 n additionally the reduction of tn was observed in both sbr1 and sbr2 and the reduction of tn in sbr1 and sbr2 was significantly higher than that of nox n in the influent indicating that denitrification in the influent anoxic phase contributed to n removal simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd based on the ags also occurred in sbr1 and sbr2 mass balance table s1 showed that the contributions of snd to n removal in sbr1 and sbr2 were higher than 15 0 and 14 8 respectively the synergistic effects of snd in sbr1 and sbr2 optimized the n removal capacity in the system in the mbr effluent the concentration of nh4 n and the ph continued to decrease and the concentration of no3 n continued to increase indicating that nitrification continued in the mbr in summary the system showed a satisfactory treatment effect which met the local standards of drainage into municipal pipelines in the following sections we illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in the different bioreactors in the system 3 3 microbial community characterization the microbial community was analyzed through high throughput sequencing across the 11 samples from the four bioreactors of the pilot scale system sampling time and spots are provided in the lower row of fig 5 a total of 635 732 effective sequences were retrieved from the samples yielding 29 490 69 614 effective sequences for each sample the good s coverage of the 11 samples was higher than 99 table 2 indicating that the microbial diversities were basically covered by the obtained sequence libraries the richness and diversity of the microorganisms could be indicated by the chao ace shannon and simpson indices shown in table 2 the similarities and differences among the microbial communities at the genus level are shown in fig 5 3 3 1 responses in taxonomic composition of microbial communities in four bioreactors the diversity indices shannon or simpson index showed that except in the mbr the diversity increased with the progression of treatment in the system the diversity trend implicating the type and concentration of contaminants in the wastewater determined the bacterial diversity which showed that the diversity increased with the biological treatment progress the decrease in the microbial diversity in the mbr may be attributed to the extremely low nutrient concentrations to identify the microbial community structure and function in the biological treatment process the classified operational taxonomic units otus were analyzed at the genus level and the bacterial diversity of the bioreactor samples significantly differed fig 5 in the ha the genera peectinatus megasphaera and novophingobium were dominant the genera peectinatus and megasphaera belong to the family veilonellaceae which can tolerate high concentrations of organic acids and can be considered as helpers in bioh2 reactors stabilizing the process among the mixed cultures pachiega et al 2019 the genus novophingobium is known for its ability to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants segura et al 2017 the major genera detected in sbr1 were norank rhodocyclaceae sphingobium and novophingobium the genus norank rhodocyclaceae belongs to the family rhodocyclaceae which consists of bacteria that remove refractory pollutants produce extracellular polymeric substances eps and perform denitrification xia et al 2018 the genus sphingobium is known for its ability to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants saiphet et al 2006 the major genera detected in sbr2 were pseudochelatococcus and sphingobium the genus pseudochelatococcus which consists of bacteria associated with nitrification emerged as the predominant group dasgupta et al 2019 ren et al 2020 the major genera recovered in the mbr appeared to be quite different from those in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 showing the dominance of the genera norank cytophagales env ops 17 and ferruginibacter which are closer to the genera previously observed in wwtps ye and zhang 2013 overall the results of microbial community analysis support the degradation trend of pollutants in different units the refractory pollutants were first hydrolyzed in ha to improve biodegradability then they were further degraded in sbr1 the main nitrification occurred in sbr2 and sbr1 and sbr2 had a certain denitrification capacity and finally water sludge separation occurred in the mbr 3 3 2 the variations of microbial community characterization in ags the shannon and simpson indices table 2 for sbr1 30 d the floc sludge of sbr1 sbr1f 70 d the ags of sbr1 sbr1g 70 d sbr2 30 d the floc sludge of sbr2 sbr2f 70 d and the ags of sbr2 sbr2g 70 d indicate that the microbial diversity decreased in the granulation process in sbr1 but increased in sbr2 this may be attributed to the different organic loading rates in sbr1 4 5 kg cod m³d and sbr2 0 5 kg cod m³d previous studies have shown that the microbial community diversity declined after granulation under a high organic loading rate and increased in low strength wastewater chen et al 2019 zou et al 2018 compared to the inoculum sludge the microbial community changed significantly in the granulation process of both sbr1 and sbr2 the microbial community structure and function in the granulation process of sbr1 and sbr2 were analyzed at the genus level as shown in fig 5 the genera azotobacter and norank rhodocyclaceae exhibited an increasing trend in the granulation process and enrichment in the ags including sbr1 and sbr2 the family rhodobacteraceae of the genus norank rhodocyclaceae consists of denitrifying and eps producing bacteria and the genus azotobacter can produce exopolysaccharide alginates alginate like eps that are one of the major exopolysaccharides in the aerobic granules lin et al 2010 sutherland 1990 however thauera and zoogloea showed a different trend a significant increasing trend in the first 30 days in sbr1 and sbr2 and then a decline after complete granulation which is consistent with previous report liu et al 2018 the genus thauera consists of facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacteria that can produce excess extracellular polysaccharides and proteins and thus help maintain the granular structure liu et al 2018 lv et al 2014 wan et al 2015 the genus zoogloea consists of floc forming bacteria that can promote the secretion of eps that can bind cells together liu et al 2018 lv et al 2014 ren et al 2018b wan et al 2015 therefore based on the results from this study and previous research it was speculated that the family rhodobacteraceae and the genus azotobacter play an important role in the granulation process and the enrichment of rhodobacteraceae greatly enhances the nitrogen removal capacity of the ags we then compared the microbial communities in sbr1g 70 d with those in sbr2g 70 d sphingobium and novophingobium decreased significantly from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d which corresponds to the degradation of various refractory pollutants ren et al 2020 xia et al 2018 the genus pseudochelatococcus increased significantly from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d which indicates nitrification specifically the major genus of the family chitinophagaleae which consists of ammonia oxidizing bacteria increased from sbr1g 70 d to sbr2g 70 d gomez alvarez et al 2013 these results confirm that the structure and function of the ags in sbr1 was different from that in sbr2 the main role of the ags in sbr1 was to degrade organic matter while in sbr2 it was to oxidize ammonia and nitrite into nitrite and nitrate these activities corresponded to the effluent quality of the two sbrs 3 4 mineral analysis of fe c particles and ags to further investigate the role of fe c particles xrf and xrd were used to analyze the collected fe c particle samples including unused fe c particle powder unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and used fe c particle after 70 days surface scraped powder as shown in fig 6 a the content of fe in the unused fe c particle powder unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and used fe c particle surface scraped powder evaluated using the xrf spectrometer were 42 5 41 6 and 41 3 respectively the changes in the other elements were not evident in the three samples in the xrd analysis fig 6b the diffraction peaks of zero valent iron were only observed in the unused fe c particle powder and the unused fe c particle surface scraped powder and as the main form of fe c particles the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 were observed in all samples these results indicate that the zero valent iron in the fe c filter played an important role as a cathode the zero valent iron in the fe c filter was consumed in a small amount after 70 days of operation and the leakage of other elements was maintained at a lower level which was consistent with previous studies zhu et al 2018 the xrf and xrd analyses were also carried out on the sludge samples from is ha sbr1 and sbr2 fig 6c shows the composition of the mineral elements in the sludge samples as measured using xrf as compared to the is the content of fe si and al increased significantly in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 in particular fe increased from 8 1 wt in is to 26 3 17 9 and 18 8 wt in ha sbr1 and sbr2 respectively thus the accumulation of fe in the ha was the highest due to the fe from the influent or the selected sludge sbr1 and sbr2 also accumulated a substantial amount of fe in the xrd analysis fig 6d the diffraction peaks of sio2 were observed in all the four samples and the diffraction peaks of lepidocrocite γ feo oh were only observed in the sludge samples from the ha sbr1 and sbr2 interestingly recent studies have reported that the genus dechloromonas and the order xanthomonadaceae detected in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 could induce the formation of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides by oxidizing fe ii kiskira et al 2017 straub and buchholz cleven 1998 subsequently ferric oxyhydroxides could mature into a variety of fe oxides such as goethite lepidocrocite and magnetite in the presence of oxygen wilfert et al 2015 the mineral precipitates formed by fe can bind with eps and cells similar to the cell eps mineral interrelationships widely investigated in the field of geomicrobiology mccutcheon and southam 2018 these results suggest that mineral deposits formed by the mineral elements especially fe within an ags matrix have a positive effect on sludge granulation 3 5 proposed synergy degradation model of industrial wastewater in the pilot system and sludge granulation mechanism 3 5 1 proposed synergy degradation model of wastewater in the pilot system combining the obtained results including the structure and function of the microbes the characteristics of the wastewater the operational parameters and the relevant data from previous studies yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 we proposed a comprehensive degradation model for the pilot scale system fig 7 which could help understand the interactions between water quality operational parameters and microbial structure and function first the treatment occurred in the fe c filter and the major function of the fe c filter is to improve the bod5 cod ratio reduce biotoxicity and coagulate some of the organics through internal electrolysis and the zero valent iron process jiricek et al 2007 the results show that fe c can efficiently improve the bod5 cod ratio to 0 28 0 32 and remove 594 gcod m3d second the major function of ha is hydrolytic acidification further improvement of the bod5 cod ratio and a reduction in biotoxicity hydrolytic conditions contribute to the hydrolysis of large molecular contaminants into biodegradable small molecular substances previous studies have shown that the type and concentration of refractory contaminants decreased significantly in the h stages and were followed by an increase in ph value xu et al 2015 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 the genera peectinatus megasphaera novophingobium and related groups can decompose refractory contaminants into readily biodegradable substances saiphet et al 2006 xia et al 2018 consequently the bod5 cod ratio increased to 0 36 0 41 and the ph value decreased significantly in the ha unit third the cultivation of ags for efficient aerobic biotransformation of the organics and nitrogen removal was expected in sbr1 and sbr2 the genera sphingobium and novophingobium were recruited in sbr1 to degrade hydrocarbon components in various refractory pollutants saiphet et al 2006 the genus pseudochelatococcus and related groups were recruited from sbr2 for nitrification moreover the genus from the family rhodocyclaceae detected in both sbr1 and sbr2 contributed to denitrification and the promotion of granulation zou et al 2018 the high settleability high biological tolerance to high organic loads and toxicity of ags were found to be beneficial to the efficient biotransformation of pollutants and the maintaining stability lochmatter and holliger 2014 the longer sludge retention time srt of ags is beneficial to the growth of nitrifying microbes which can promote nitrification graham et al 2007 the compact microbial structure of ags created an oxygen concentration gradient inside which provided the conditions for the occurrence of snd and enhanced nitrogen removal coma et al 2012 the results show that svi30 reached 44 3 and 39 7 ml g in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively and the tn removal rates were 42 gtn m3d and 20 gtn m3d respectively the cod removal rate reached 2452 gcod m3d in sbr1 and significant degradation of nh4 n from 55 8 to 33 1 mg l was observed in sbr2 finally the mbr was expected to accept all the washed out sludge and conduct sludge water separation with the progression of granulation the washed out sludge also consisted of ags which may have reduced the clogging of the membrane the results also show the degradation of nh4 n from 33 1 to 20 4 mg l and cod 60 gcod m3d in the mbr and that the effluent quality met the local standards of drainage into municipal pipelines in summary the information gathered from this model improved our understanding of the coupled synergistic mechanism in the novel pilot scale system for example the fe c filter improved the bod5 cod ratio reduced biotoxicity to decrease the impact on the ha and generated byproducts to promote granulation in the sbrs the ha further improved the bod5 cod ratio and reduced biotoxicity which facilitated subsequent treatment the sbr1 and sbr2 cultivated ags for efficient treatment while eliminating the byproducts from fe c and the mbr accepted all the washed out sludge from sbr2 and conducted sludge water separation 3 5 2 proposed sludge granulation mechanism although there have been many reports on the successful cultivation of ags at a pilot scale or in full scale sbrs the slow startup speed and poor stability of ags hindered its further development li et al 2014 ni et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 our study aimed to cultivate the ags in a two stage sbr coupled with an fe c filter during the treatment of industrial wastewater the coupling system was successful in cultivating ags in sbr1 and sbr2 with a large particle size 720 and 610 µm respectively and good settling properties low svi30 of 44 3 and 39 7 ml g respectively in contrast to the addition of external nucleating agents e g micropowder and naturally drying sludge the byproducts of fe c in this study acted as a nucleating agent for the system promoting rapid sludge granulation in the coupling system mineral analysis of ags fig 6c d showed that the byproducts of the fe c filter contributed to the granulation of ags the fe2 fe3 and fe minerals decreased the negative charges on the microbes and could act as a nucleus for bacterial attachment binding eps and microbes into denser microbial aggregates ren et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 moreover the genus dechloromonas and the order xanthomonadaceae detected in the ha sbr1 and sbr2 could induce the formation of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides by oxidizing fe ii kiskira et al 2017 straub and buchholz cleven 1998 subsequently ferric oxyhydroxides could mature into a variety of fe oxides such as goethite lepidocrocite and magnetite in the presence of oxygen wilfert et al 2015 the mineral precipitates formed by fe can bind to eps and cells similar to the cell eps mineral interrelationships widely investigated in the field of geomicrobiology mccutcheon and southam 2018 as the byproducts of fe c continuously entered into the two sbrs a long term mechanism was formed that continuously promoted the formation of ags thereby ensuring the stability of the ags system additionally the enrichment of minerals helped in maintaining the stability of ags franca et al 2018 sludge size is strongly correlated with settling velocity and the eps synthesis which are crucial for the granulation and settling ability of sludge corsino et al 2016b zhang et al 2016 during the granulation process eps is synthesized by the aggregated microorganisms after exposure to the elevated influent organic loading rate olr in the anaerobic feeding phase gao et al 2011 microbes related to eps production will form aggregates granules with better settling capability together with other microbes in addition the selective pressure of sbr promoted the retention of aggregates granules with higher eps production microbes the genera thauera and zoogloea in the sbr and the withdrawal of flocs with lower eps producing microbes from the sbr fig 2c a higher content of eps facilitates the adhesion of cell cell or cell particulates into a microbial aggregate in which the particulates e g chemical precipitation and influent particulate materials act as nuclei for cell attachment sarma et al 2017 furthermore the use of dewatered sludge as inoculation sludge also plays an important role in the rapid start up of the ags system as it introduces several small eps rich aggregates solving the problem of random aggregation disintegration during rapid sludge granulation in the start up stage liu et al 2020 lv et al 2014 therefore by coupling with fe c providing fe2 fe3 and fe minerals applying the sbr feast and famine conditions creating selection pressure and using dewatered sludge as an inoculant accelerating the appearance of aggregates ags could be formed rapidly the sludge granulation mechanism is schematized in fig 7 4 conclusion in this study a pilot scale system with an initial fe c filter followed by an ha sbr1 sbr2 and an mbr was developed to investigate the formation of ags and the coupled synergistic mechanism the byproducts of the fe c filter fe2 fe3 and fe minerals and the feast and famine conditions and selection pressure of sbr resulted in svi30 eventually reaching 34 2 and 36 7 ml g in sbr1 and sbr2 respectively a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was also achieved in the system with removal rates of 4074 7 gcod m3d and 83 7 gtn m3d and the removal rate reached 2588 8 gcod m3d and 62 6 gtn m3d in the ags of sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the microbial community showed enrichment of microbes with eps secretion and granule stabilization functions in ags and the differentiation of microbes corresponded to the function of each unit furthermore mineral analyses suggested that the mineral deposits formed by the mineral elements especially fe within an ags matrix had a positive effect on sludge granulation the coupling system provided new information on the application of ags by using the byproducts continuously generated in the process to achieve a long term mechanism of ags granulation and stability and optimizing the nutrient removal performance by sludge granulation declaration of competing

17539,this study establishes a new understanding of the contributions of al residue in a megalopolitan drinking water supply system with mixed water sources the different influences and contributions of foreign water source resident migration and season changing to al residue in drinking water were investigated especially the role of southern water transferred over 1200 km via the south to north water diversion project in the al residue of drinking water supply system of a northern megalopolitan were revealed for the first time comparisons of big data on al residue in the water supply system with sole and mixed water sources showed that the introduction of southern water enhanced the al residue in drinking water by over 35 the world s largest annual residents migration during chinese lunar new year and the changes of season affect the water pipework hydrodynamics which were embodied as the periodic changes of particulate aluminium and the relations with resident s temporal spatial distribution in the megalopolitan because of the differences in water quality southern water promotes the release of historically deposited al and facilitates the cleaning of old pipes graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords al residue mixed water sources big data analysis megalopolitan drinking water 1 introduction to avoid excessive al contamination many countries and organizations have established strict guidelines and standards to control residual al e g 0 05 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l in the united states japan and china respectively dietrich and burlingame 2015 jiao et al 2015 kimura et al 2013 however the residual al in the drinking water supply system is not optimal and the cases of residual al contamination in drinking water have been widely reported afonne et al 2020 agarwal et al 2016 cui 2002 patton et al 2020 the situation is more severe in low and middle income countries bain et al 2014 many studies have shown that al intake through drinking water can cause kidney disorders and nerve damage and disturbs cholinergic systems in different regions of the brain hamed 2019 kinawy 2019 li et al 2020a and the toxicities varied from al species and clusters existed in aqueous wu et al 2019b after the connection between al contamination and neurodegenerative disease has been revealed laabbar et al 2019 lukiw et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 the source and process control of neurotoxic al contamination in tap water has become a hot topic since the al based coagulants are widely used as water treatment decontaminant in drinking water purification considerable attention has been paid to the progress of coagulation to minimize al residue edzwald 1993 through coagulant optimization gaikwad and munavalli 2019 kimura et al 2013 ph value adjustment okuda et al 2014 and membrane filtration gabelich et al 2002 several measures have been shown to be effective at controlling al residue however poor source water quality caused by heavy metals and organic contamination have led to the extensive use of al based coagulants cheng et al 1994 yan et al 2006 to reduce organic matter colour turbidity suspended particles and pathogens which inevitably causes more severe residual al contamination edition 2011 sillanpaa et al 2018 in water treatment plants wtps that use surface water supplies the dosage of coagulants is closely related to the dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen ph value hardness and temperature davis and edwards 2014 edzwald and van benschoten 1990 holbrook et al 2010 hu et al 2006 lee and westerhoff 2006 o melia 1998 van benschoten and edzwald 1990 yan et al 2006 moreover al species can combine with organic or inorganic compounds and the composition changes of water source could increase the amount of al residue during coagulation and cause excessive residue in tap water the al residue in coagulation caused by qualities fluctuation of sole water source could be controlled easier compared with mixed water sources however the imbalance between the geospatial distribution of water resource and societal development exist all over the world and more cities have been applying foreign water transferred by water diversion projects kendy et al 2017 nagler et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in china to meet the needs of urban water consumption in northern regions kattel et al 2019 the south to north water diversion project was designed in 2002 and began operations in 2014 over 9 500 000 000 m3 of fresh water was transported every year from southern china rivers through a 1267 km length open air trunk canal to north china to date tremendous efforts have been made to determine the ecological response and water qualities following water diversion projects li et al 2016 ma et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 however relatively less attention has been focused on the impacts of these projects on public drinking water as foreign water is introduced into the local water supply systems the mixed water sources with severe water quality fluctuations could disturb the coagulation process in drinking water treatment plants and the coagulants overdosed often occurred causing al residue exceeds standard wu et al 2019a with the operation of the south to north water diversion project the introduction of foreign water from the southern region into the water treatment plants changed the water quality of the drinking water distribution system dwds the fluctuating physiochemical properties of tap water in the dwds also influenced pipe scale and biofilm formation which led to the collection of a variety of al residue species liu et al 2017 makris et al 2014 with changes in the hydrodynamics and water composition caused by uneven population distribution the loose pipe scale and transformed biofilm community can influence the tap water quality as well as the al residue makris et al 2014 teng et al 2008 moreover as pipe scale ages al is mainly distributed in the lower portion of the pipe scale liu et al 2016 and a large amount of particulate al has the potential to be released han et al 2018 especially under the conditions of hydraulic disturbance and flushing li et al 2018 overall the phenomenon of al residue in the water supply system is complex and numerous studies have focused on the mechanism of al residues and associated influencing factors in water treatment plants or dwdss in laboratory conditions few studies investigated the al contamination of typical megapolitan drinking water in real situation and from the aspect of the whole system from water sources to tap water moreover the residual al distribution and contributions of each water supply segment i e from the water sources to the wtps to the dwds have seldom been investigated especially under the background of mixing between foreign water and different types of local water thus in this study the contributions of mixed water sources resident migration and seasons changing to al residue in drinking water were revealed for the first time a statistical analysis of big sampling data was performed and a typical region was selected to analyse the influence of the fluctuating hydrodynamic conditions and physicochemical properties of water sources the results will establish a new understanding of the different species of al that remain in megalopolitan drinking water supply systems with mixed water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the megalopolitan of this study has a typical temperate and monsoonal climate with four clearly distinct seasons and located at northern china the temperature is high in summer from mid may to early august and low in winter from november to early march the study area is shown in fig s1 the water samples were collected from the inlets and outlets of 5 major drinking water treatment plants and 252 sampling sites in the drinking water distribution system for each month based on the different water sources used in the water treatment plants of each area the study area was divided into six parts areas a to f and the boundaries of six area were determined by the distribution of primary pipework the water source of area a is local ground water mixed with southern water area b is local ground water area c is local reservoir mixed with southern water area d is local reservoir area e is southern water water samples of water sources were collected at the inlets of five water treatment plants and the water samples of water treatment plants wtps were collected at the outlets of all the five water treatment plants the water samples of drinking water distribution system dwds were collected at the 252 sampling sites in the whole study area all samples were collected in 100 ml cuboid plastic bottles once a month over an eight months period from august 2016 to october 2016 and from january 2017 to july 2017 before analysis the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and they were analysed within 15 days after collection moreover 13 sites in area c were selected and 26 physicochemical parameters within the same sampling period were also analysed 2 2 al species concentration analysis three kinds of residual al species total al t al soluble al s al and particulate al p al were analysed with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp optima 8300 perkinelmer inc under optimized conditions with a wavelength of 396 153 nm federation and association 2005 each water sample was analysed three times and the relative standard deviation was controlled under 5 different pre treatments were used for the t al and s al analysis according to the different dissolution characteristics driscoll and postek 1995 for the t al analysis 8 ml of the sampled water was collected in a 25 ml flask 2 ml of hydrogen nitrate v v 0 2 analytical reagent was added and then the flask was shaken for 30 min to digest the colloid and particles after digestion the samples were diluted with ultra pure water to 10 ml and filtered through a fibreglass membrane 0 45 μm pore size for the s al analysis the water sample was first filtered by using a fibreglass membrane 0 45 μm pore size then 8 ml of this filtered water was transferred to a 25 ml flask 2 ml of hydrogen nitrate v v 0 2 analytical reagent was added and the flask was shaken for 30 min to digest the colloid and particles after digestion the samples were diluted with ultra pure water to 10 ml and filtered through a fibreglass membrane 0 45 μm pore size p al was calculated from the concentration of t al minus that of s al all samples were analysed with an icp oes 2 3 data analysis and quality control the physicochemical parameters were analyzed following the standard examination methods for drinking water gb t5750 2006 china the ph was analyzed by ph meter pb10 sartorius the turbidity was analyzed by turbidity meter 2100n hach the codmn was analyzed by titration method the ion chromatography ics 2100 thermo fisher scientific was applied to analyse sulphate fluoride chloride nitrite and nitrate the spectrophotometry was applied to analyse ammonia the icp oes icp optima 8300 perkinelmer inc was applied to analyse potassium magnesium calcium ferric manganese zinc and sodium as part of the data quality assurance process laboratory reagent blanks were analysed and one replicate sample was established for each batch of 10 samples standard reference solutions which were designated by the institute of geophysical and geochemical exploration igge chinese academy of geological sciences were also systematically and routinely analysed to examine the accuracy of the method reproducibility was found at the 95 confidence level different multivariate statistical analysis methods were used for the interpretation of large and complicated data the statistical and correlation analyses were performed by using the pasw 18 0 statistical package spss inc chicago il usa the one year temporal spatial distribution of residual al in the dwds was described using arcmap 10 5 with kriging interpolation spherical semi variogram model the fluctuation degrees of different residual al species were described with the coefficient of variation which was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 contribution of mixed water sources on al residue in the drinking water supply system based on the differences in water sources the study area of the northern megalopolis was divided into six typical water supply areas areas a to f and detailed information is provided in fig s1 for each area the contribution of three segments namely the water sources water treatment plants wtps and pipes of the dwds to residual al in the tap water was statistically analysed although the concentration of residual al in the three segments varied in the different areas of the same megalopolis shown in fig 1 a the same increasing trend was observed along the water supply system from the water source to the dwds the average al concentrations of the three water sources local groundwater local reservoir and south to north diversion water simplified as southern water were generally less than 0 02 mg l and accounted for 9 1 of the residual al in tap water at the end of dwds in the wtps due to the inevitable addition of al coagulants in the coagulation and flocculation processes the concentration of residual al obviously increased from 0 007 mg l in the water sources to 0 048 mg l in the finished water of seven major wtps in whole area on average which accounted for 52 6 of the residual al in tap water at the end of dwds in the expanded dwds secondary al contamination released from ageing pipes and loose scale zhou et al 2016 led to increases in the residual al concentration of up to 0 078 mg l on average which accounted for 38 3 of the residual al in the tap water at the dwds output since there is no wtp in area f the concentrations and contributions of residual al in the water source wtp and dwds from areas a to e are primarily discussed and they are shown in fig 2 in area a area b and area e shown in fig 2a the water sources are groundwater mixed with southern water groundwater and sole southern water respectively and the addition of southern water made some differences in area a the residual al concentration increased more at the dwds than wtp and the contributions of residual al in the three segments water source wtp and dwds were 12 5 20 7 and 66 8 in area b the residual al is not detected at wtp outlet and the residual al in the water source was removed at wtp since the local ground water was the only water source of the wtp in area b the filtration was a major treatment measurement without adding al coagulants the particulate al in water source would be removed through filtrations wang et al 2007 and could not be detected in the finished water thus the residual al in finished water was completely released from the dwds with a final concentration of 0 057 mg l compared with the water source of sole groundwater the mixed water sources with southern water increased 36 8 of al residuals in dwds in area c shown in fig 2b the water source is a mix of southern water and reservoir water the increasing of residual al concentration in dwds is less than wtp the contributions of the al residue in the three segments water source wtp and dwds were 3 4 73 3 and 23 3 respectively the residual al in finished water with the mixed water source of southern water is 37 2 higher than that with sole local reservoir water source at the end of dwds on average of one year in area d the water source is sole local reservoir water the concentration of residual al in the wtp outlet was almost the same with that in the dwds outlet proving that the dwds is well adapted to the water source of local reservoir and that no obvious secondary al contamination release occurred in dwds the stable water quality could promote residual al deposition as pipe scales and reduce the al residual concentration compared with that of wtp outlets gao et al 2019 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in area e shown both in fig 2a and fig 2b where southern water is used as the only water source the residual al concentrations increased obviously from the water source to the wtp and dwds showing an intense increase in the residual al concentrations in the dwds due to the different material and ages of the pipes and taps in buildings the factors and mechanisms of residual al release from a dwds are complex and require additional observations generally southern water has less of an impact on the al residual concentrations at the outlet of wtps than local water but had a worse impact on residual al in the dwds thus it can be drawn that the water sources wtps and pipes of dwds are all sources of residual al in tap water obviously wtps are often the main source of residual al because of the addition of al based coagulants during the water treatment process as shown in fig 1b as inferred from fig 1 and fig 2 the dwds is also an indirect source because al originates from the water sources and wtps thus dwds often serve as reserves and buffer banks for al and the deposition of residual al from wtps occurs in addition to the release of historically deposited al as inferred from fig 2 there is an increase in the concentration of al residue from wtps to the dwds in most sampling areas especially when southern water is used as the water source this finding might indicate that the introduction of foreign water or the mixing of different water sources could increase the release of historically deposited al through the intense fluctuation of water qualities and facilitate the cleaning of old pipes with the processes of release and deposition which were similar with other metallic circulations happened in dwds li et al 2018 li et al 2019 when the local reservoir was used as the sole water source a decrease in residual al was observed which means there was an excess of residual al in the wtps this finding represents normal behaviour for al transportation along a water distribution system with a sole water source conversely this phenomenon also further proves that introducing a foreign water source e g southern water can encourage the release of deposited al in the dwds which makes it an important source of residual al in tap water however the al residue in wtps or the dwds is mainly influenced by water quality and hydrodynamic fluctuations in wtps water quality could affect the coagulation process due to its ph ionic strength and organics liu et al 2017 in a dwds the fluctuations in water quality and hydrodynamics could affect the formation of biofilm and loose pipe scale in the dwds gao et al 2019 liu et al 2017 thereby causing al to be released from scale and transformed into soluble or particulate species makris et al 2014 with the influence of introducing southern water as the sole water source the residual al released in the dwds contributes 66 1 of residual al in the tap water while the water source and wtps contribute only 14 9 and 19 0 of residual al respectively fig 1 indeed southern water increased the concentrations of al residuals in the dwds when comparing foreign southern water with local water the use of southern water as the sole source increased residual al by 36 2 and 25 3 compared with the use of local groundwater alone and local reservoir water alone respectively moreover the combination of groundwater with southern water and reservoir water with southern water also increased the release of al by 36 8 and 38 1 respectively at the end of the dwds after mixing southern water with local water sources the residual al contributions were increased comparing with local water sources alone from 36 2 to 36 8 for groundwater and from 25 3 to 38 1 for local reservoir water fig 2 shows that the influence of southern water on the wtp is dependent on the quality of the local water sources although it is obvious that the significant release of historically deposited al was mainly ascribed to the introduction of southern water into the dwds focusing on areas a and b southern water sources mixed with local groundwater and groundwater alone the mixed water source caused the residual al concentrations of area a from wtps to be much higher than that of area b 3 2 influence of mixed water sources on the fluctuation in residual al speciation the one year total and soluble al concentrations of 252 sampling sites in the dwds are shown in fig 3 area f represents the supply area of mixed water sources where water is mainly supplied by the facilities in areas a b c and e in the box diagrams in fig 3 a and b the boxplots represent the different al residue species that were monitored each month at the 252 sites in areas a c and f the long upper leads of the boxplots indicated that the total al concentrations of those sites greatly fluctuated the water sources of areas a and c are both mixed with southern water compared with area e using only southern water as the source the upper lead of the total al concentration boxplots is longer moreover the concentration levels of al residue in areas a and c are also obviously higher than those in areas b d and e thus mixing local water with southern water as the water source regardless of whether it was groundwater or surface water could increase the amount of al residue this finding is consistent with the conclusions inferred from fig 2 in fig 3 b the soluble al concentration has the same fluctuating tendency as the total al concentration the difference between fig 3 a and b is shown by the upper leads of the boxplots the shorter upper leads of soluble al indicated that the monthly concentrations of soluble al at the 252 sites were more stable than those of the total al concentrations the stability difference between total and soluble al was ascribed to the presence of particulate al the stability difference also indicated that the mixed water sources had a greater influence on particulate al in the dwds mixing southern water with local water led to instability in the dwds and the instantaneous release of more al to further compare the fluctuation in different al species from the sampling sites in the dwds a coefficient of variation coordinate was described in fig 3 c the coefficient of variation cv was the ratio of standard deviation and average value cv σ μ which used to compare the measures of dispersion the x axis is the coefficient of variation of the particulate al species pcv and the y axis is the coefficient of variation of the soluble al species scv fig 3 c shows that the pcvs at most sites are greater than 1 and fluctuate more dramatically than the scvs at those sites these results are consistent with the boxplot figure distribution shown in fig 3 a and b in the dwds particulate al species are mainly controlled by hydraulic flushing in pipes and lead to fluctuations in the quality of tap water while the concentrations of soluble al are mainly determined by that in the wtp outlets driscoll and letterman 1995 it is worth noting that most of the sites in the rectangle which contribute the most scv and pcv in fig 3 c belong to area f when comparing area f with areas a and c although areas a and c both have constant mixed water sources the tap water in the dwds is more stable than that in area f the complex tap water sources in area f are difficult to explain and the quality of tap water fluctuates more severely in this area leading to a great amount of al residue in addition to the area f sites some sites from areas c d and e appear in the pcv rectangle which indicates that southern water also increases the amount of particulate al species released in the dwds to determine the influence of the mixed water source on the changes in residual al speciation the sampling sites were classified into different clusters via cluster analysis as fig 3 d shows three clusters were assembled from the three kinds of water sources in the study area after counting the sites in each cluster the results showed that 80 7 of the sites in areas b d and e the area with the sole water source and 18 5 of the sites in areas a and c fall into cluster 1 red region 39 5 of the sites in areas a and c fall into cluster 2 green region and 42 0 of the sites in areas a and c and 13 8 of the sites in areas d and e fall into cluster 3 blue region the distribution results of the three clusters indicate that cluster 1 mainly consists of sites from areas with sole water sources and clusters 2 and 3 mainly consist of sites from areas with mixed water sources even with the same mixed water sources in area a the sites can also be separated into cluster 2 and cluster 3 indicating that the characteristics of soluble and particulate al residue are different a similar result was also found in area c although the characteristics of residual al in the dwds is complex in expanded interconnecting pipes the grouping of sampling sites coincides with the current situation of the different water sources used in the wtps all the conclusions inferred from the abovementioned methods are consistent with each other which indicates that the introduction of southern water influences the residual speciation of al especially particulate al 3 3 impact of hydrodynamic fluctuation caused by season and population changes on al residue in expanded dwds the alternating seasons impacted the al residue in dwds through water consumptions and resident s distribution through the big data analysis based on 252 sites of the city in one year the fig 4 a has shown the residual al in the dwds from august to july during four seasons the total al first row is higher at the end of winter and spring and the beginning of summer the highest concentration in the whole area was observed at the beginning of summer then decreased and ultimately normalizing at summer of next year the distribution of particulate al third row had a similar trend as the total al with a higher in concentration at the end of autumn winter and spring compared with these two al species the distribution of soluble al second row easily fluctuated throughout the year as the temperature changed with alternating seasons fluctuations in the total al distribution occurred from winter to spring and worsened from spring to summer which was similar for soluble al and particulate al the worst fluctuation of soluble al was occurred in may and june moreover the distributions of total and particulate al species were mainly concentrated at the northern and southern poles of the megalopolis which was associated with the population distribution as shown in fig 4 b as spring ended and summer began the temperature rapidly increased water consumption instantly increased and the hydraulic load became heavier the loose scale in the pipes was flushed out leading to excess particulate al as well as total al in the dwds gao et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the reactions that occur during corrosion and scaling lead manganese oxide to adsorb soluble and particulate al which helps form the surface of manganese oxide jones and knocke 2017 moreover as pipe scale ages al is mainly distributed in the lower portion of the pipe scale liu et al 2016a and a large amount of particulate al has the potential to be released han et al 2018 especially under the conditions of hydraulic disturbance and flushing li et al 2018 despite temperature changes the round trip made by over 30 million residents during the lunar chinese new year also causes hydrodynamic changes in the dwds this large scale resident migration has effects on the distribution of al species according to data on the three al species between january and march a higher concentration of soluble al appears in the northeast as shown in fig 4 a and before the migration particulate al was distributed in the southwest of the whole area which was similar to the population distribution as shown in fig 4 b when the residents returned the soluble al and particulate al were mainly distributed in the southeast northeast and northwest of the area which are areas with lower populations as shown in fig 4 b and the concentrations in these areas were higher than those in january before the lunar chinese new year the slow moving production and living activities of residents during winter led to less water consumption and were favourable to the occurrence of scale on the inner surface of the dwds after the new year residents who live further from the central area returned home thereby increasing the hydraulic load in the dwds and flushing out loose scale on pipes which increased the particulate al concentration in march since it was hard to measure the hydrodynamic fluctuation in dwds the population distribution of each block area gathered through the megalopolis statistical yearbook was used to estimate the hydraulic load of corresponding area to further investigated the impacts of hydraulic load to residual al in dwds the monthly distribution of the soluble and particulate al concentrations in the sampling year were shown in fig 4 c the relation between the climate temperature and the changes in the coefficients of variation for the two al residue species was shows in fig 4 d the concentration of soluble al fluctuates greatly throughout the year and the soluble al coefficient of variation scv decreases from summer to autumn and increases from winter to summer with decreasing temperatures the fluctuation degree decreases as the scv decreases and the fluctuation degree increases as the temperature increases the particulate al concentration is lower in autumn and winter but higher in spring and summer and the particulate al coefficient of variation pcv shows trends of decreasing from spring to summer with increasing temperature and increasing from summer to winter with decreasing temperature to further reveal the influence of population on the total al soluble al and particulate al concentrations in the dwds a correlation analysis was performed and the results are shown in fig 5 a the distributions of total al soluble al and turbidity had similar trends and were different from those of particulate al as shown above the diagonal line in the figure the concentration of total al had significant positive correlations with soluble al and particulate al with coefficients of variation of 0 704 and 0 671 respectively this result indicates that both species contribute to the accumulation of total al in the dwds and that soluble al correlates more with the total al concentration in addition the negative correlation between soluble al and particulate al indicates that the concentration of particulate al was inversely influenced by soluble al these two species could transform into each other in the dwds depending on the ph temperature turbidity and electric potential zhang et al 2016 moreover population had a significant and positive correlation with soluble al and a negative correlation with particulate al indicating that higher water consumption will increase the concentration of soluble al and decrease the concentration particulate al in the dwds with the increase in water consumption the hydraulic fluctuation in the dwds would result in al being released from the scale in pipes over a short period of time which would exacerbate soluble al contamination in the system however population had no significant correlation with particulate al since the amount of al in the pipe is determined by the formation rate physicochemical environment and long term equilibrium water consumption in addition the short time of load fluctuations would cause an instantaneous not a constant excess of particulate al only in addition focusing on the rectangles of the scatter diagrams below the diagonal line the distribution between turbidity and total al indicates that excess total al is not correlated with turbidity and sites with total al had turbidity values that varied from 0 25 to 0 9 ntu which is similar to the other sites a comparison of the site distributions of total al and population with those of particulate al and population indicates that both species have a trend of exceeding the appropriate concentrations at sites with a lower population furthermore the distribution of particulate al with the monthly average temperature showed that excess particulate al easily occurs when temperature increasing as shown in the heat map in fig 5 b the three clusters were grouped as particulate al with the monthly average temperature total al with soluble al and turbidity with population which indicates that the six groups have some relationship when the monthly average temperatures are highest and lowest blue and rose colours in the heatmap column of average t respectively the concentrations of all al species are low and fewer red regions occur which shows that increasing and decreasing temperatures could impact the hydrodynamics and influence residual al in the dwds in a megalopolis with tens of millions of residents hydrodynamic fluctuations caused by season and temperature changes and by migration during the lunar new year increases al residue in wtps which impacts the dwds and such changes are associated with fluctuations in water quality fig 4b and 4c the fluctuation in water consumption caused by seasonal changes results in an increase in al residue in the dwds especially particulate al in areas with a lower population and soluble al in areas with a higher population the population varies from 30547 to 359415 in different blocks the fluctuating hydrodynamic conditions caused by the large scale migration of residents during the chinese spring festival increases soluble and total residual al in the dwds which can be obviously inferred from the significantly positive correlations fig 5a of the residual character of the two al species with the change in regional population for the three al species studied here total al soluble al and particulate al mixing foreign water with local water e g local groundwater local reservoir water results in more severe soluble al contamination in wtps but results in particulate al contamination in the dwds 3 4 impact of physiochemical properties of different water sources on al residue in the drinking water distribution system as inferred before southern water can aggravate the al concentration and fluctuations in al contamination in the dwds previous studies have shown that the water quality and physicochemical properties of water sources could determine the residual al in tap water srinivasan et al 1999 moreover the different treatment processes used in different water plants result in disparities in the residual al concentrations in the dwds the water quality of southern water is different from that of local water sources table 1 and the quality fluctuates irregularly after water is transported over 1200 km through an open air trunk canal the fluctuation water quality of southern water could impact the coagulation in wtps and dwds with different natural organic matters song et al 2019 yu et al 2018 ph ionic strength li et al 2020b etc which increases the difficulty of purification treatments and as well as the fluctuations in residual al yu et al 2018 in particular compared with local water the higher codmn higher summer temperatures lower winter temperatures higher ph values and different total nitrogen and ion strengths of southern water could increase the amount of al residue in wtps by causing an excess amount of traditional al salt to be used during the coagulation process thereby leading to an inevitable increase in the residual al concentrations the differences in the water quality between southern water and local reservoir water are shown in table 1 the higher phosphorous concentration ph value and codmn value and the lower nitrogen concentration especially ammonia which is 0 08 mg l in local water but 0 13 mg l in southern water can increase decrease al based coagulant use and al residue moreover the different conductivities inorganics and hardness values liu et al 2017 of the introduced southern water can change and worsen the effectiveness of coagulants which can cause coagulant overdosing leading to excessive residual al as cement lined iron pipes are commonly used in dwdss the excess residual al could be exacerbated by the abundant al oxide and manganese oxide deposited non uniformly over the non metallic pipe surface li et al 2018 lytle and nadagouda 2010 a comparison of the concentrations of fluoride nitrate chloride and sulphate among the southern water groundwater and surface water table 1 shows that southern water has the lowest concentrations the ion strength of southern water is much lower than that of local ground and surface waters leading to chemical destabilization in the dwds which will impact the remobilization of al bound by pipe scale on metal pipes via desorption and or dissolution in areas a c and e peng et al 2010 sly et al 1990 wang et al 2009 to further investigate the influence of southern water in the dwds the following correlation analysis mainly focuses on area c using the applied southern water and local reservoirs as water sources in particular the area c is the largest distribution area except for the mixing in area f and area c is also less controlled by the head pressures of other areas thus the interior physicochemical environment of the distribution system in area c is more regular than that in other areas to reveal the relationship between residual al and water quality 13 sites in area c were selected every month for analysis and the results of the correlation analysis between the al concentrations and 26 physicochemical parameters are shown in table 2 a significant correlation is observed between total al and chcl3 in the drinking water treatment process organics are difficult to remove via traditional coagulation and a higher concentration of organics will increase the dosage of al coagulant required to remove contaminants resulting in a higher concentration of al in the distribution system and a higher concentration of chcl3 additionally total al also has significant correlations with nitrate ph value temperature and soluble al this finding is consistent with the results inferred from the previous three sections combining the correlation analysis results of t al s al and p al and the 26 physicochemical parameters in the dwds significant negative correlations are observed between the ph value and soluble al residue water temperature and total al chcl3 and total al and nitrate and soluble al as discussed above the introduction of southern water could necessitate higher amounts al coagulants which would decrease the ph of the wtp outlets the al species mainly consist of al oh 4 and species transformation easily occurs in aqueous solution at ph values of approximately 7 to 9 driscoll and schecher 1990 thus the effect of introducing southern water to the dwds is the increase in residual soluble monomeric al species such as al oh 4 which are created in the effluents of the wtps yang et al 2010 and increase the chemical destabilization of scale in pipes liu et al 2017 however a decrease in the ph in the pipes would also cause al oh 4 to transform into sol gel al oh 3 which is an important particulate al species thereby influencing the particulate al concentration the ph changes caused by the mixtures of the various water sources also constitute an important factor that influences fluctuations in the three al species in the dwds as shown in figs 3a and 4a similarly the higher concentration of residual organics after coagulation and flocculation will cause more disinfection by products such as chcl3 crafton et al 2014 to remain in the water distribution system and the higher concentration of disinfection by products results from the higher concentration of total residual al shen et al 2017 a higher temperature will cause a higher concentration of residual al to occur in the system which is correlated with water consumption fluctuations and seasonal changes as shown in fig 4a although the influence of metallic ions and inorganic anions on residual al species in the dwds has been widely reported liu et al 2017 yang et al 2014 there are no significant correlations among ions or anions with residual al noted in table 2 for the sustained mixed water sources moreover after coagulation and flocculation the metallic ions and anions would increase the ionic strength and promote al deposition on the internal wall of the water distribution pipes liu et al 2016 which would result in a small amount of al residue in the dwds under the condition of mixed water sources the formation of pipe scale is different yang et al 2012 and the decomposition processes are influenced by hydrodynamics and fluctuating physiochemical properties in the dwds 4 conclusions the introducing of southern water as a foreign water source into northern megalopolitan drinking water supply system enhanced the al residue in wtps and dwds the worse al residue caused by mixed water sources could be alleviated in wtps and the southern water had a worse impact on residual al in the dwds the al residue in dwds is influenced by water physicochemical properties and hydrodynamics of pipes the al residue in dwds is less influenced by source water physicochemical properties like ion strength and organics but ph value the hydrodynamics fluctuant caused by water consumption changing enhances particulate al residue in less populated region and soluble al residue in more populated region the large scale resident migration during chinese spring festival enhanced the soluble and total residual al in dwds which can be obviously indicated from the significantly positive correlations of two residual al species with the population of regions in megalopolis this work would give a hint in the megalopolitan drinking water safety control and management with the background of mixed water sources declaration of competing interest the

17539,this study establishes a new understanding of the contributions of al residue in a megalopolitan drinking water supply system with mixed water sources the different influences and contributions of foreign water source resident migration and season changing to al residue in drinking water were investigated especially the role of southern water transferred over 1200 km via the south to north water diversion project in the al residue of drinking water supply system of a northern megalopolitan were revealed for the first time comparisons of big data on al residue in the water supply system with sole and mixed water sources showed that the introduction of southern water enhanced the al residue in drinking water by over 35 the world s largest annual residents migration during chinese lunar new year and the changes of season affect the water pipework hydrodynamics which were embodied as the periodic changes of particulate aluminium and the relations with resident s temporal spatial distribution in the megalopolitan because of the differences in water quality southern water promotes the release of historically deposited al and facilitates the cleaning of old pipes graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords al residue mixed water sources big data analysis megalopolitan drinking water 1 introduction to avoid excessive al contamination many countries and organizations have established strict guidelines and standards to control residual al e g 0 05 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l in the united states japan and china respectively dietrich and burlingame 2015 jiao et al 2015 kimura et al 2013 however the residual al in the drinking water supply system is not optimal and the cases of residual al contamination in drinking water have been widely reported afonne et al 2020 agarwal et al 2016 cui 2002 patton et al 2020 the situation is more severe in low and middle income countries bain et al 2014 many studies have shown that al intake through drinking water can cause kidney disorders and nerve damage and disturbs cholinergic systems in different regions of the brain hamed 2019 kinawy 2019 li et al 2020a and the toxicities varied from al species and clusters existed in aqueous wu et al 2019b after the connection between al contamination and neurodegenerative disease has been revealed laabbar et al 2019 lukiw et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 the source and process control of neurotoxic al contamination in tap water has become a hot topic since the al based coagulants are widely used as water treatment decontaminant in drinking water purification considerable attention has been paid to the progress of coagulation to minimize al residue edzwald 1993 through coagulant optimization gaikwad and munavalli 2019 kimura et al 2013 ph value adjustment okuda et al 2014 and membrane filtration gabelich et al 2002 several measures have been shown to be effective at controlling al residue however poor source water quality caused by heavy metals and organic contamination have led to the extensive use of al based coagulants cheng et al 1994 yan et al 2006 to reduce organic matter colour turbidity suspended particles and pathogens which inevitably causes more severe residual al contamination edition 2011 sillanpaa et al 2018 in water treatment plants wtps that use surface water supplies the dosage of coagulants is closely related to the dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen ph value hardness and temperature davis and edwards 2014 edzwald and van benschoten 1990 holbrook et al 2010 hu et al 2006 lee and westerhoff 2006 o melia 1998 van benschoten and edzwald 1990 yan et al 2006 moreover al species can combine with organic or inorganic compounds and the composition changes of water source could increase the amount of al residue during coagulation and cause excessive residue in tap water the al residue in coagulation caused by qualities fluctuation of sole water source could be controlled easier compared with mixed water sources however the imbalance between the geospatial distribution of water resource and societal development exist all over the world and more cities have been applying foreign water transferred by water diversion projects kendy et al 2017 nagler et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in china to meet the needs of urban water consumption in northern regions kattel et al 2019 the south to north water diversion project was designed in 2002 and began operations in 2014 over 9 500 000 000 m3 of fresh water was transported every year from southern china rivers through a 1267 km length open air trunk canal to north china to date tremendous efforts have been made to determine the ecological response and water qualities following water diversion projects li et al 2016 ma et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 however relatively less attention has been focused on the impacts of these projects on public drinking water as foreign water is introduced into the local water supply systems the mixed water sources with severe water quality fluctuations could disturb the coagulation process in drinking water treatment plants and the coagulants overdosed often occurred causing al residue exceeds standard wu et al 2019a with the operation of the south to north water diversion project the introduction of foreign water from the southern region into the water treatment plants changed the water quality of the drinking water distribution system dwds the fluctuating physiochemical properties of tap water in the dwds also influenced pipe scale and biofilm formation which led to the collection of a variety of al residue species liu et al 2017 makris et al 2014 with changes in the hydrodynamics and water composition caused by uneven population distribution the loose pipe scale and transformed biofilm community can influence the tap water quality as well as the al residue makris et al 2014 teng et al 2008 moreover as pipe scale ages al is mainly distributed in the lower portion of the pipe scale liu et al 2016 and a large amount of particulate al has the potential to be released han et al 2018 especially under the conditions of hydraulic disturbance and flushing li et al 2018 overall the phenomenon of al residue in the water supply system is complex and numerous studies have focused on the mechanism of al residues and associated influencing factors in water treatment plants or dwdss in laboratory conditions few studies investigated the al contamination of typical megapolitan drinking water in real situation and from the aspect of the whole system from water sources to tap water moreover the residual al distribution and contributions of each water supply segment i e from the water sources to the wtps to the dwds have seldom been investigated especially under the background of mixing between foreign water and different types of local water thus in this study the contributions of mixed water sources resident migration and seasons changing to al residue in drinking water were revealed for the first time a statistical analysis of big sampling data was performed and a typical region was selected to analyse the influence of the fluctuating hydrodynamic conditions and physicochemical properties of water sources the results will establish a new understanding of the different species of al that remain in megalopolitan drinking water supply systems with mixed water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the megalopolitan of this study has a typical temperate and monsoonal climate with four clearly distinct seasons and located at northern china the temperature is high in summer from mid may to early august and low in winter from november to early march the study area is shown in fig s1 the water samples were collected from the inlets and outlets of 5 major drinking water treatment plants and 252 sampling sites in the drinking water distribution system for each month based on the different water sources used in the water treatment plants of each area the study area was divided into six parts areas a to f and the boundaries of six area were determined by the distribution of primary pipework the water source of area a is local ground water mixed with southern water area b is local ground water area c is local reservoir mixed with southern water area d is local reservoir area e is southern water water samples of water sources were collected at the inlets of five water treatment plants and the water samples of water treatment plants wtps were collected at the outlets of all the five water treatment plants the water samples of drinking water distribution system dwds were collected at the 252 sampling sites in the whole study area all samples were collected in 100 ml cuboid plastic bottles once a month over an eight months period from august 2016 to october 2016 and from january 2017 to july 2017 before analysis the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and they were analysed within 15 days after collection moreover 13 sites in area c were selected and 26 physicochemical parameters within the same sampling period were also analysed 2 2 al species concentration analysis three kinds of residual al species total al t al soluble al s al and particulate al p al were analysed with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp optima 8300 perkinelmer inc under optimized conditions with a wavelength of 396 153 nm federation and association 2005 each water sample was analysed three times and the relative standard deviation was controlled under 5 different pre treatments were used for the t al and s al analysis according to the different dissolution characteristics driscoll and postek 1995 for the t al analysis 8 ml of the sampled water was collected in a 25 ml flask 2 ml of hydrogen nitrate v v 0 2 analytical reagent was added and then the flask was shaken for 30 min to digest the colloid

statistical analysis methods were used for the interpretation of large and complicated data the statistical and correlation analyses were performed by using the pasw 18 0 statistical package spss inc chicago il usa the one year temporal spatial distribution of residual al in the dwds was described using arcmap 10 5 with kriging interpolation spherical semi variogram model the fluctuation degrees of different residual al species were described with the coefficient of variation which was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 contribution of mixed water sources on al residue in the drinking water supply system based on the differences in water sources the study area of the northern megalopolis was divided into six typical water supply areas areas a to f and detailed information is provided in fig s1 for each area the contribution of three segments namely the water sources water treatment plants wtps and pipes of the dwds to residual al in the tap water was statistically analysed although the concentration of residual al in the three segments varied in the different areas of the same megalopolis shown in fig 1 a the same increasing trend was observed along the water supply system from the water source to the dwds the average al concentrations of the three water sources local groundwater local reservoir and south to north diversion water simplified as southern water were generally less than 0 02 mg l and accounted for 9 1 of the residual al in tap water at the end of dwds in the wtps due to the inevitable addition of al coagulants in the coagulation and flocculation processes the concentration of residual al obviously increased from 0 007 mg l in the water sources to 0 048 mg l in the finished water of seven major wtps in whole area on average which accounted for 52 6 of the residual al in tap water at the end of dwds in the expanded dwds secondary al contamination released from ageing pipes and loose scale zhou et al 2016 led to increases in the residual al concentration of up to 0 078 mg l on average which accounted for 38 3 of the residual al in the tap water at the dwds output since there is no wtp in area f the concentrations and contributions of residual al in the water source wtp and dwds from areas a to e are primarily discussed and they are shown in fig 2 in area a area b and area e shown in fig 2a the water sources are groundwater mixed with southern water groundwater and sole southern water respectively and the addition of southern water made some differences in area a the residual al concentration increased more at the dwds than wtp and the contributions of residual al in the three segments water source wtp and dwds were 12 5 20 7 and 66 8 in area b the residual al is not detected at wtp outlet and the residual al in the water source was removed at wtp since the local ground water was the only water source of the wtp in area b the filtration was a major treatment measurement without adding al coagulants the particulate al in water source would be removed through filtrations wang et al 2007 and could not be detected in the finished water thus the residual al in finished water was completely released from the dwds with a final concentration of 0 057 mg l compared with the water source of sole groundwater the mixed water sources with southern water increased 36 8 of al residuals in dwds in area c shown in fig 2b the water source is a mix of southern water and reservoir water the increasing of residual al concentration in dwds is less than wtp the contributions of the al residue in the three segments water source wtp and dwds were 3 4 73 3 and 23 3 respectively the residual al in finished water with the mixed water source of southern water is 37 2 higher than that with sole local reservoir water source at the end of dwds on average of one year in area d the water source is sole local reservoir water the concentration of residual al in the wtp outlet was almost the same with that in the dwds outlet proving that the dwds is well adapted to the water source of local reservoir and that no obvious secondary al contamination release occurred in dwds the stable water quality could promote residual al deposition as pipe scales and reduce the al residual concentration compared with that of wtp outlets gao et al 2019 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in area e shown both in fig 2a and fig 2b where southern water is used as the only water source the residual al concentrations increased obviously from the water source to the wtp and dwds showing an intense increase in the residual al concentrations in the dwds due to the different material and ages of the pipes and taps in buildings the factors and mechanisms of residual al release from a dwds are complex and require additional observations generally southern water has less of an impact on the al residual concentrations at the outlet of wtps than local water but had a worse impact on residual al in the dwds thus it can be drawn that the water sources wtps and pipes of dwds are all sources of residual al in tap water obviously wtps are often the main source of residual al because of the addition of al based coagulants during the water treatment process as shown in fig 1b as inferred from fig 1 and fig 2 the dwds is also an indirect source because al originates from the water sources and wtps thus dwds often serve as reserves and buffer banks for al and the deposition of residual al from wtps occurs in addition to the release of historically deposited al as inferred from fig 2 there is an increase in the concentration of al residue from wtps to the dwds in most sampling areas especially when southern water is used as the water source this finding might indicate that the introduction of foreign water or the mixing of different water sources could increase the release of historically deposited al through the intense fluctuation of water qualities and facilitate the cleaning of old pipes with the processes of release and deposition which were similar with other metallic circulations happened in dwds li et al 2018 li et al 2019 when the local reservoir was used as the sole water source a decrease in residual al was observed which means there was an excess of residual al in the wtps this finding represents normal behaviour for al transportation along a water distribution system with a sole water source conversely this phenomenon also further proves that introducing a foreign water source e g southern water can encourage the release of deposited al in the dwds which makes it an important source of residual al in tap water however the al residue in wtps or the dwds is mainly influenced by water quality and hydrodynamic fluctuations in wtps water quality could affect the coagulation process due to its ph ionic strength and organics liu et al 2017 in a dwds the fluctuations in water quality and hydrodynamics could affect the formation of biofilm and loose pipe scale in the dwds gao et al 2019 liu et al 2017 thereby causing al to be released from scale and transformed into soluble or particulate species makris et al 2014 with the influence of introducing southern water as the sole water source the residual al released in the dwds contributes 66 1 of residual al in the tap water while the water source and wtps contribute only 14 9 and 19 0 of residual al respectively fig 1 indeed southern water increased the concentrations of al residuals in the dwds when comparing foreign southern water with local water the use of southern water as the sole source increased residual al by 36 2 and 25 3 compared with the use of local groundwater alone and local reservoir water alone respectively moreover the combination of groundwater with southern water and reservoir water with southern water also increased the release of al by 36 8 and 38 1 respectively at the end of the dwds after mixing southern water with local water sources the residual al contributions were increased comparing with local water sources alone from 36 2 to 36 8 for groundwater and from 25 3 to 38 1 for local reservoir water fig 2 shows that the influence of southern water on the wtp is dependent on the quality of the local water sources although it is obvious that the significant release of historically deposited al was mainly ascribed to the introduction of southern water into the dwds focusing on areas a and b southern water sources mixed with local groundwater and groundwater alone the mixed water source caused the residual al concentrations of area a from wtps to be much higher than that of area b 3 2 influence of mixed water sources on the fluctuation in residual al speciation the one year total and soluble al concentrations of 252 sampling sites in the dwds are shown in fig 3 area f represents the supply area of mixed water sources where water is mainly supplied by the facilities in areas a b c and e in the box diagrams in fig 3 a and b the boxplots represent the different al residue species that were monitored each month at the 252 sites in areas a c and f the long upper leads of the boxplots indicated that the total al concentrations of those sites greatly fluctuated the water sources of areas a and c are both mixed with southern water compared with area e using only southern water as the source the upper lead of the total al concentration boxplots is longer moreover the concentration levels of al residue in areas a and c are also obviously higher than those in areas b d and e thus mixing local water with southern water as the water source regardless of whether it was groundwater or surface water could increase the amount of al residue this finding is consistent with the conclusions inferred from fig 2 in fig 3 b the soluble al concentration has the same fluctuating tendency as the total al concentration the difference between fig 3 a and b is shown by the upper leads of the boxplots the shorter upper leads of soluble al indicated that the monthly concentrations of soluble al at the 252 sites were more stable than those of the total al concentrations the stability difference between total and soluble al was ascribed to the presence of particulate al the stability difference also indicated that the mixed water sources had a greater influence on particulate al in the dwds mixing southern water with local water led to instability in the dwds and the instantaneous release of more al to further compare the fluctuation in different al species from the sampling sites in the dwds a coefficient of variation coordinate was described in fig 3 c the coefficient of variation cv was the ratio of standard deviation and average value cv σ μ which used to compare the measures of dispersion the x axis is the coefficient of variation of the particulate al species pcv and the y axis is the coefficient of variation of the soluble al species scv fig 3 c shows that the pcvs at most sites are greater than 1 and fluctuate more dramatically than the scvs at those sites these results are consistent with the boxplot figure distribution shown in fig 3 a and b in the dwds particulate al species are mainly controlled by hydraulic flushing in pipes and lead to fluctuations in the quality of tap water while the concentrations of soluble al are mainly determined by that in the wtp outlets driscoll and letterman 1995 it is worth noting that most of the sites in the rectangle which contribute the most scv and pcv in fig 3 c belong to area f when comparing area f with areas a and c although areas a and c both have constant mixed water sources the tap water in the dwds is more stable than that in area f the complex tap water sources in area f are difficult to explain and the quality of tap water fluctuates more severely in this area leading to a great amount of al residue in addition to the area f sites some sites from areas c d and e appear in the pcv rectangle which indicates that southern water also increases the amount of particulate al species released in the dwds to determine the influence of the mixed water source on the changes in residual al speciation the sampling sites were classified into different clusters via cluster analysis as fig 3 d shows three clusters were assembled from the three kinds of water sources in the study area after counting the sites in each cluster the results showed that 80 7 of the sites in areas b d and e the area with the sole water source and 18 5 of the sites in areas a and c fall into cluster 1 red region 39 5 of the sites in areas a and c fall into cluster 2 green region and 42 0 of the sites in areas a and c and 13 8 of the sites in areas d and e fall into cluster 3 blue region the distribution results of the three clusters indicate that cluster 1 mainly consists of sites from areas with sole water sources and clusters 2 and 3 mainly consist of sites from areas with mixed water sources even with the same mixed water sources in area a the sites can also be separated into cluster 2 and cluster 3 indicating that the characteristics of soluble and particulate al residue are different a similar result was also found in area c although the characteristics of residual al in the dwds is complex in expanded interconnecting pipes the grouping of sampling sites coincides with the current situation of the different water sources used in the wtps all the conclusions inferred from the abovementioned methods are consistent with each other which indicates that the introduction of southern water influences the residual speciation of al especially particulate al 3 3 impact of hydrodynamic fluctuation caused by season and population changes on al residue in expanded dwds the alternating seasons impacted the al residue in dwds through water consumptions and resident s distribution through the big data analysis based on 252 sites of the city in one year the fig 4 a has shown the residual al in the dwds from august to july during four seasons the total al first row is higher at the end of winter and spring and the beginning of summer the highest concentration in the whole area was observed at the beginning of summer then decreased and ultimately normalizing at summer of next year the distribution of particulate al third row had a similar trend as the total al with a higher in concentration at the end of autumn winter and spring compared with these two al species the distribution of soluble al second row easily fluctuated throughout the year as the temperature changed with alternating seasons fluctuations in the total al distribution occurred from winter to spring and worsened from spring to summer which was similar for soluble al and particulate al the worst fluctuation of soluble al was occurred in may and june moreover the distributions of total and particulate al species were mainly concentrated at the northern and southern poles of the megalopolis which was associated with the population distribution as shown in fig 4 b as spring ended and summer began the temperature rapidly increased water consumption instantly increased and the hydraulic load became heavier the loose scale in the pipes was flushed out leading to excess particulate al as well as total al in the dwds gao et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the reactions that occur during corrosion and scaling lead manganese oxide to adsorb soluble and particulate al which helps form the surface of manganese oxide jones and knocke 2017 moreover as pipe scale ages al is mainly distributed in the lower portion of the pipe scale liu et al 2016a and a large amount of particulate al has the potential to be released han et al 2018 especially under the conditions of hydraulic disturbance and flushing li et al 2018 despite temperature changes the round trip made by over 30 million residents during the lunar chinese new year also causes hydrodynamic changes in the dwds this large scale resident migration has effects on the distribution of al species according to data on the three al species between january and march a higher concentration of soluble al appears in the northeast as shown in fig 4 a and before the migration particulate al was distributed in the southwest of the whole area which was similar to the population distribution as shown in fig 4 b when the residents returned the soluble al and particulate al were mainly distributed in the southeast northeast and northwest of the area which are areas with lower populations as shown in fig 4 b and the concentrations in these areas were higher than those in january before the lunar chinese new year the slow moving production and living activities of residents during winter led to less water consumption and were favourable to the occurrence of scale on the inner surface of the dwds after the new year residents who live further from the central area returned home thereby increasing the hydraulic load in the dwds and flushing out loose scale on pipes which increased the particulate al concentration in march since it was hard to measure the hydrodynamic fluctuation in dwds the population distribution of each block area gathered through the megalopolis statistical yearbook was used to estimate the hydraulic load of corresponding area to further investigated the impacts of hydraulic load to residual al in dwds the monthly distribution of the soluble and particulate al concentrations in the sampling year were shown in fig 4 c the relation between the climate temperature and the changes in the coefficients of variation for the two al residue species was shows in fig 4 d the concentration of soluble al fluctuates greatly throughout the year and the soluble al coefficient of variation scv decreases from summer to autumn and increases from winter to summer with decreasing temperatures the fluctuation degree decreases as the scv decreases and the fluctuation degree increases as the temperature increases the particulate al concentration is lower in autumn and winter but higher in spring and summer and the particulate al coefficient of variation pcv shows trends of decreasing from spring to summer with increasing temperature and increasing from summer to winter with decreasing temperature to further reveal the influence of population on the total al soluble al and particulate al concentrations in the dwds a correlation analysis was performed and the results are shown in fig 5 a the distributions of total al soluble al and turbidity had similar trends and were different from those of particulate al as shown above the diagonal line in the figure the concentration of total al had significant positive correlations with soluble al and particulate al with coefficients of variation of 0 704 and 0 671 respectively this result indicates that both species contribute to the accumulation of total al in the dwds and that soluble al correlates more with the total al concentration in addition the negative correlation between soluble al and particulate al indicates that the concentration of particulate al was inversely influenced by soluble al these two species could transform into each other in the dwds depending on the ph temperature turbidity and electric potential zhang et al 2016 moreover population had a significant and positive correlation with soluble al and a negative correlation with particulate al indicating that higher water consumption will increase the concentration of soluble al and decrease the concentration particulate al in the dwds with the increase in water consumption the hydraulic fluctuation in the dwds would result in al being released from the scale in pipes over a short period of time which would exacerbate soluble al contamination in the system however population had no significant correlation with particulate al since the amount of al in the pipe is determined by the formation rate physicochemical environment and long term equilibrium water consumption in addition the short time of load fluctuations would cause an instantaneous not a constant excess of particulate al only in addition focusing on the rectangles of the scatter diagrams below the diagonal line the distribution between turbidity and total al indicates that excess total al is not correlated with turbidity and sites with total al had turbidity values that varied from 0 25 to 0 9 ntu which is similar to the other sites a comparison of the site distributions of total al and population with those of particulate al and population indicates that both species have a trend of exceeding the appropriate concentrations at sites with a lower population furthermore the distribution of particulate al with the monthly average temperature showed that excess particulate al easily occurs when temperature increasing as shown in the heat map in fig 5 b the three clusters were grouped as particulate al with the monthly average temperature total al with soluble al and turbidity with population which indicates that the six groups have some relationship when the monthly average temperatures are highest and lowest blue and rose colours in the heatmap column of average t respectively the concentrations of all al species are low and fewer red regions occur which shows that increasing and decreasing temperatures could impact the hydrodynamics and influence residual al in the dwds in a megalopolis with tens of millions of residents hydrodynamic fluctuations caused by season and temperature changes and by migration during the lunar new year increases al residue in wtps which impacts the dwds and such changes are associated with fluctuations in water quality fig 4b and 4c the fluctuation in water consumption caused by seasonal changes results in an increase in al residue in the dwds especially particulate al in areas with a lower population and soluble al in areas with a higher population the population varies from 30547 to 359415 in different blocks the fluctuating hydrodynamic conditions caused by the large scale migration of residents during the chinese spring festival increases soluble and total residual al in the dwds which can be obviously inferred from the significantly positive correlations fig 5a of the residual character of the two al species with the change in regional population for the three al species studied here total al soluble al and particulate al mixing foreign water with local water e g local groundwater local reservoir water results in more severe soluble al contamination in wtps but results in particulate al contamination in the dwds 3 4 impact of physiochemical properties of different water sources on al residue in the drinking water distribution system as inferred before southern water can aggravate the al concentration and fluctuations in al contamination in the dwds previous studies have shown that the water quality and physicochemical properties of water sources could determine the residual al in tap water srinivasan et al 1999 moreover the different treatment processes used in different water plants result in disparities in the residual al concentrations in the dwds the water quality of southern water is different from that of local water sources table 1 and the quality fluctuates irregularly after water is transported over 1200 km through an open air trunk canal the fluctuation water quality of southern water could impact the coagulation in wtps and dwds with different natural organic matters song et al 2019 yu et al 2018 ph ionic strength li et al 2020b etc which increases the difficulty of purification treatments and as well as the fluctuations in residual al yu et al 2018 in particular compared with local water the higher codmn higher summer temperatures lower winter temperatures higher ph values and different total nitrogen and ion strengths of southern water could increase the amount of al residue in wtps by causing an excess amount of traditional al salt to be used during the coagulation process thereby leading to an inevitable increase in the residual al concentrations the differences in the water quality between southern water and local reservoir water are shown in table 1 the higher phosphorous concentration ph value and codmn value and the lower nitrogen concentration especially ammonia which is 0 08 mg l in local water but 0 13 mg l in southern water can increase decrease al based coagulant use and al residue moreover the different conductivities inorganics and hardness values liu et al 2017 of the introduced southern water can change and worsen the effectiveness of coagulants which can cause coagulant overdosing leading to excessive residual al as cement lined iron pipes are commonly used in dwdss the excess residual al could be exacerbated by the abundant al oxide and manganese oxide deposited non uniformly over the non metallic pipe surface li et al 2018 lytle and nadagouda 2010 a comparison of the concentrations of fluoride nitrate chloride and sulphate among the southern water groundwater and surface water table 1 shows that southern water has the lowest concentrations the ion strength of southern water is much lower than that of local ground and surface waters leading to chemical destabilization in the dwds which will impact the remobilization of al bound by pipe scale on metal pipes via desorption and or dissolution in areas a c and e peng et al 2010 sly et al 1990 wang et al 2009 to further investigate the influence of southern water in the dwds the following correlation analysis mainly focuses on area c using the applied southern water and local reservoirs as water sources in particular the area c is the largest distribution area except for the mixing in area f and area c is also less controlled by the head pressures of other areas thus the interior physicochemical environment of the distribution system in area c is more regular than that in other areas to reveal the relationship between residual al and water quality 13 sites in area c were selected every month for analysis and the results of the correlation analysis between the al concentrations and 26 physicochemical parameters are shown in table 2 a significant correlation is observed between total al and chcl3 in the drinking water treatment process organics are difficult to remove via traditional coagulation and a higher concentration of organics will increase the dosage of al coagulant required to remove contaminants resulting in a higher concentration of al in the distribution system and a higher concentration of chcl3 additionally total al also has significant correlations with nitrate ph value temperature and soluble al this finding is consistent with the results inferred from the previous three sections combining the correlation analysis results of t al s al and p al and the 26 physicochemical parameters in the dwds significant negative correlations are observed between the ph value and soluble al residue water temperature and total al chcl3 and total al and nitrate and soluble al as discussed above the introduction of southern water could necessitate higher amounts al coagulants which would decrease the ph of the wtp outlets the al species mainly consist of al oh 4 and species transformation easily occurs in aqueous solution at ph values of approximately 7 to 9 driscoll and schecher 1990 thus the effect of introducing southern water to the dwds is the increase in residual soluble monomeric al species such as al oh 4 which are created in the effluents of the wtps yang et al 2010 and increase the chemical destabilization of scale in pipes liu et al 2017 however a decrease in the ph in the pipes would also cause al oh 4 to transform into sol gel al oh 3 which is an important particulate al species thereby influencing the particulate al concentration the ph changes caused by the mixtures of the various water sources also constitute an important factor that influences fluctuations in the three al species in the dwds as shown in figs 3a and 4a similarly the higher concentration of residual organics after coagulation and flocculation will cause more disinfection by products such as chcl3 crafton et al 2014 to remain in the water distribution system and the higher concentration of disinfection by products results from the higher concentration of total residual al shen et al 2017 a higher temperature will cause a higher concentration of residual al to occur in the system which is correlated with water consumption fluctuations and seasonal changes as shown in fig 4a although the influence of metallic ions and inorganic anions on residual al species in the dwds has been widely reported liu et al 2017 yang et al 2014 there are no significant correlations among ions or anions with residual al noted in table 2 for the sustained mixed water sources moreover after coagulation and flocculation the metallic ions and anions would increase the ionic strength and promote al deposition on the internal wall of the water distribution pipes liu et al 2016 which would result in a small amount of al residue in the dwds under the condition of mixed water sources the formation of pipe scale is different yang et al 2012 and the decomposition processes are influenced by hydrodynamics and fluctuating physiochemical properties in the dwds 4 conclusions the introducing of southern water as a foreign water source into northern megalopolitan drinking water supply system enhanced the al residue in wtps and dwds the worse al residue caused by mixed water sources could be alleviated in wtps and the southern water had a worse impact on residual al in the dwds the al residue in dwds is influenced by water physicochemical properties and hydrodynamics of pipes the al residue in dwds is less influenced by source water physicochemical properties like ion strength and organics but ph value the hydrodynamics fluctuant caused by water consumption changing enhances particulate al residue in less populated region and soluble al residue in more populated region the large scale resident migration during chinese spring festival enhanced the soluble and total residual al in dwds which can be obviously indicated from the significantly positive correlations of two residual al species with the population of regions in megalopolis this work would give a hint in the megalopolitan drinking water safety control and management with the background of mixed water sources declaration of competing interest the
