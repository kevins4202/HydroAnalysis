11985,this paper develops a model to delineate groundwater potential zones by integrating tools of remote sensing geographical information system gis and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp to achieve multi attribute decision making choice among various thematic layers which affect the groundwater resources such as geology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density land use land cover normalized difference vegetation index and elevation in the region of prayagraj uttar pradesh india using saaty s scale suitable weights are allotted to the physical properties and their significant features according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence the allotted weights of the thematic layers and their significant features were then normalized by using fahp finally the estimated ten thematic maps from satellite images and conventional data are combined in a gis platform to yield a groundwater potential zones map thus seven groundwater potential zones are identified and demarcated in the study area as excellent very strong to excellent strong to very strong moderate to strong moderate equal to moderate and equal the groundwater potential zones map is finally justified using the well annual discharge data and the result is found tolerable this study clearly provides groundwater potential zones and offers future planning managing and forecasting of groundwater resources in the study area information from remote sensing analysis also reduces the expenditure time and risk to human life during the groundwater related research work graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fahp remote sensing gis 1 introduction the need for sustainable development is a key to the future of mankind now we are more concerned with our environment than ever before since the industrial revolution over time rapid increase in world population simultaneous economic progress through globalization and imitation of lifestyles from exposure to social media networks globally has put pressure on environment and natural resources which are altering the capacity of planets natural support system as individual consumption of water increased both for human and modern agricultural practices it is leading to depletion of groundwater it is high time to look for ways and means to find cost effective techniques to search groundwater bearing zones satellite image processing techniques by way of remote sensing can provide essential information about a large area which can be further justified by other field techniques remote sensing analysis reduces the expenditure time and risk to human life during the groundwater related research work groundwater is an important and finite resource essential for life on the earth water bearing horizons with good porosity and permeability are called aquifers porous lithological horizons may store water in voids voids or pores are the open space in the rock where no solid matter is found and only water can accumulate dai et al 2001 the percentage of voids is called porosity porosity is primarily developed along with the formation of rock at secondary stage porosity is constituted by fractures joints sheared zones solution opening etc normally groundwater aquifers are known as confined or unconfined unconfined aquifers are also recognized as water table aquifers under constant atmospheric circumstances there exists a normal water table the water is enclosed under slightly higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure in confined aquifers the principal sources of groundwater boost are rainfall and surface water depending upon atmospheric conditions there are other sources as well such as meteoric water condensational water connate water and juvenile or magmatic water horton 1932 edet et al 1998 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 groundwater normally occurs at depths whereas remote sensing detects only surface information the depth penetration of electromagnetic radiation is hardly a tiny proportion of a millimeter in visible region hoffman et al 2001 gupta 2003 microwave region penetrates hardly few meters in hyper arid environment in normal environmental conditions remote sensing processing is incapable to grant any straight information on groundwater satellite remote sensing combined with gis is very beneficial for demarcation of groundwater identification kang et al 2012 krishnamurthy et al 1996 integration of remote sensing with gis techniques are not new to analyze and understand microlevel regional analysis saraf and choudhary 1998 physical geological morphological and hydrological properties of surface and subsurface water environment can be calculated using remote sensing data the surface features indicators can be grouped into two different groups i direct indicators or first order and ii indirect indicators or second order the first order indicators such as recharge or discharge zones moisture content of soil and vegetation are directly related to the groundwater system the second order indicators are rock types soil structures fractures landforms drainage and anthropogenic activities on surface these are a fair number of surface indicators which can provide information for groundwater hobbs 1912 campbell 1987 lillesand and kiefer 2000 as noted earlier that remote sensing procedure for groundwater is dependent on certain indicators which are easily observed on surface thematic maps of different indicators are created for groundwater investigation so one has to consider several thematic maps for a particular unit of area for this purpose there is a need of an integration function which can deal with such a complex set of data demicco and klir 2004 kumar et al 2008 this requires some integration function or method there are two fundamental types of integration functions i arithmetic and ii logical arithmetic operation includes multiplication division subtraction or addition of each layer in one data layer respectively by a value at the corresponding location in the second data layer the logical operations involve determination of such an area of interest where a particular condition is fulfilled such integration can be done by different multi criteria decision making methods and machine learning algorithms the weighted overlay is a common method applied by many researchers a weight is a value allotted to an assessment criterion that indicates its importance with respect to the criterion under consideration saraf and choudhary 1998 saraf et al 2004 amreesh 2006 frantazoa et al 2010 chavara et al 2011 preeja et al 2011 bera and bandhyopadhyay 2012 patil et al 2013 murugiah and venkatraman 2013 mishra 2013 muthukrishnan et al 2013 kumar and karuppannam 2014 waiker and nilawar 2014 palaka and sankar 2015 ramamoorthy and rammohan 2015 dinesan et al 2015 pani et al 2016 a modest method for valuing the criterion weights is to rank the criteria in the order of the decision marker s preference saravanan 2012 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 radhakrishnan et al 2014 when the decision maker estimates weights on the basis of a predetermined scale such as a scale of 0 100 or lowest to highest such process is known as rating the given weights are normalized by dividing all weights to the total sum of weights choudhury et al 2009 the pair wise comparisons are organized into a matrix which depends on the scale from 1 to 9 rates the preferences with respect to a pair of criteria nagaraju et al 2011 arkoprovo et al 2012 aneesh et al 2015 frequency ratio takes into accounts the probability of occurrence of a certain event or attribute probability naghibi et al 2014 fuzzy overlap operation is also applied in multi criteria decision based remote sensing problems by many researchers dixon et al 2005 ghayoumian et al 2007 kumar et al 2010 riad et al 2011 rather and andrabi 2012 muthukrishnan et al 2012 bhowmick et al 2014 the analytical hierarchy process ahp is another powerful tool to simultaneously evaluate multiple criteria it is a subjective method the ahp was developed by saaty 1980 and relies on the judgment of the experts to determine scales of priority the weight of a criteria is made using a scale of absolute judgements that signifies by how much more one component dominates over the other with respect to a given attribute for each problem a hierarchical model consisting of alternatives sub criteria criteria and goals is used in the ahp model the final solution to a problem by ahp is accomplished by using the priorities of the pairwise comparisons tweed et al 2006 ho 2008 ganapuram et al 2009 thusan and herbert 2010 palaka and sankar 2015 aneesh et al 2015 sener et al 2018a b while making pairwise comparisons of the criteria some inconsistencies may occur at a certain level in such cases the logical consistency of pairwise comparisons should be checked the notion of fahp is a very broad subject that was adopted world wide in a number of hydrology related research areas while some studies are focused only on groundwater water potential zones but others are directly associated to the environment li et al 2009 applied the fahp methods to assess the ecosystem in the danjiangkou reservoir area china jabraeili and zarei 2018 integrated the ahp fuzzy method to evaluate suitable land for flood spreading in the shourdasht watershed in the ghahavand hamadan province iran results proved that the soil erosion was controlled and the flood waters end up being stored in the aquifers saravanan et al 2020 using remote sensing techniques successfully implemented analytical hierarchy process in the hard rock region of gundihalla watershade bellary karnataka india it confirms that fuzzy ahp is a suitable method to delineate groundwater potential even in hard rock formation chabak et al 2016 applied gis and ahp for the selection of suitable landfill site in babylon iraq the selected area of landfill site can accommodate solid waste from 2020 to 2030 based on requirement without harming the environment dar et al 2020 applied ahp in the inter montane valley of kashmir india which is surrounded by the great himalayan range towards northwest and pir panjab range to the southwest to delineate potential groundwater area after validation the obtained results suggested that the method was significant and reliable from the above discussion it is easily deciphered that the present technique is universal and adapted successfully in different geographic regions of the world fahp integrated with gis and remote sensing techniques have provided usefull results in different parts of the crust such as semi arid mountainous watershed region of saudi arabia mallic et al 2019 beysehir lake basin turkey sener et al 2018a b new zealand singh et al 2018a b middle atlas platues of morocco aouragh et al 2017 maysan governorate iraq al abadi et al 2017 al wala basin jordan al bakri and al jahmany 2013 basilicata region italy caniani et al 2015 tigray ethiopia gebre et al 2015 eritrea which is located in the horn of africa solomon and quiel 2006 southeastern australia tweed et al 2006 occidental lebanan shaban et al 2006 and southeastern nigeria edet et al 1998 within india from inter montane valley of kashmir situated in northwastern region to hard rock region of bellary karnataka located in the south dar et al 2020 saravanan et al 2020 this methodology was effectively applied in the delineation of groundwater recharge potential integration of gis remote sensing fuzzy ahp with conventional field data is an important tool for acquiring information from a very large area and offers synoptic and quick repetitive region coverage as a result for the first time fuzzy ahp fahp method of analysis which is a fuzzy extension of ahp was proposed by van laarhoven and pedryez in 1983 to signify confident decision making since then several research scholars have applied this methodology in different areas for solutions towards decision making an et al 1991 chang 1996 tseng et al 2008 dadhwal 2013 mallick 2016 eliades et al 2018 azimi et al 2018 the present research work adapts a unique method of fahp which includes selection of an alternative and systematic approaches weighting and uses the concept of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis to achive multi attribute decision making choice by integrating the geo spatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing and gis 1 1 objectives the term prospective or potential groundwater zone could be described as the probability of groundwater occurring presence of aquifer shallow water table or favorable environmental conditions for recharge the above discussion summarises the following objective of the present research work 1 to develop a model to demarcate groundwater prospective zones by integrating tools of remote sensing geographical information system gis and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp to achieve multi attribute decision making choice among many thematic layers which affect the groundwater in the region of prayagraj uttar pradesh india 2 to display that in the current modified environment geo information technology as a powerful tool for groundwater related studies 3 to divulge that the growing population and urbanization are putting pressure on the storage of groundwater there are certain areas which naturally provides a healthy environment for the storage or recharge of groundwater but excess logging and urbanization are diminishing and shrinking the capacity of the groundwater storage over time all of the above objectives are demonstrated in the present case study 2 study area the study area is the prayagraj in the state of uttar pradesh india lies at a latitude 24 47 n and 25 43 n and longitude 81 31 and 82 21 e in survey of india toposheets no 63 g 11 and 63 g 12 at an elevation of 9 8 km it covers the area about 5212 48 km2 in south eastern part of uttar pradesh state on confluence of mighty river ganga and yamuna and invisible river saraswati therefore referred as sangam the prayagraj district is divided into three parts i e trans ganga doab and trans yamuna portion the present area is situated in indo gangetic plain a broad monotonous built up of quaternary alluvium the crust of the study area represents mostly alluvial with some exposures of hard rocks this area can be divided into three natural features active flood plain very fertile older alluvial plain and denudational hills or rocky surface the active flood plain is of low relief with heavy deposition of silt clay calcretes gravel and kankars of quaternary age older alluvial plain composed of silt sandy clay gravel and pebbles which lies along river ganga the denudational hills comprised of limestone and shale of proterozoic age are quite important in trans yamuna area such as manda meja koraon and some parts of shankargarh wadia 1975 singh and tripathi 2009 pati et al 2013 singh et

rectified and projected on universal mercator utm projection wgs 1984 zone 44 north 3 2 method in order to differentiate the groundwater prospective zones of study area many thematic maps are prepared either from digital images or from conventional surface data total ten thematic layers of physical properties such as geology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density land use land cover ndvi and elevation are prepared the fahp method is used to evaluate the different thematic maps according to their categorization on the basis of ground water involvement delft 2000 rather et al 2012 gholami et al 2017 different steps of research work are summarized in fig 2 in the next section fahp and description of thematic layers are discussed 3 2 1 fuzzy ahp method the method of fahp is developed from the combination of traditional ahp and fuzzy the multi criteria decision making problems are efficiently solved by fuzzy ahp saaty 2008 for the alternative selection many researchers have tried to decide the best option with multi criteria decision making via fuzzy logic and hierarchical structure analysis van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 proposed for the first time a study on the fuzzy ahp in this initial study the fuzzy rates were expressed by triangular fuzzy numbers over time this method was further modified by several researchers and still being frequently used for different decision making problems an et al 1991 iqbal and sajjad 2013 dadhwal 2013 singh et al 2019 for the present research work the fahp developed by chang 1996 is applied the pairwise comparisons scale used in fahp triangular method is explained and given in tables 1 4 tseng et al 2008 the strength of preference for one element over another are expressed by the fuzzy scaling ratios of 2 3 1 3 2 2 5 2 3 7 2 4 and 9 2 interval values the pairwise comparisons in the judgment matrix are fuzzy numbers in a fahp method they may also be modified by the designer s prominence azimi et al 2018 the following steps are adopted to determine weights for fahp caniani et al 2015 step 1 pairwise comparison matrices were created using all the criteria in the extents of the hierarchy system pairwise matrix is created by the help of scale of relative importance called saaty s scale table 1 3 2 2 fuzzy scale fuzzy logic normally known as multivalued logic is applied to solve the problems which consist of vague and imprecise data a fuzzy knowledge base exemplifies the linguistic variables on the basis of fuzzy set theory to make satisfactory decisions the knowledge base defines the interaction which are defined by if then rules between conditional fuzzy propositions these rules are developed as per human expert knowledge and generally express in natural human language all defined linguistic variables are assigned appropriate membership functions using fuzzy linguistic variables such as very high high medium low and very low zadeh 1978 zimmerman and zysno 1980 description of fuzzy scale is given in table 2 linguistic terms are assigned to the pairwise comparisons after examining in each case which of the two criteria is more important a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 1 1 a 21 a 1 n 1 a 21 1 a 2 n 1 a n 1 1 a n 2 1 where a i j may be explained as let 1 be 1 1 1 when i j if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 measure that criterion i is reasonably significant to criterion j and then 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 measure that criterion j is reasonably significant to criterion i table 3 by the help of fuzzification process all crisp values are changed into fuzzy values as shown in table 4 step 2 estimation of fuzzy geometric mean and fuzzy weights of each criterion sener et al 2018a b fuzzy geometric mean r i r i a i 1 a i 2 a in 1 n fuzzy weight w

may also be specified by a tfn w i lw i mw i uw i step 3 this step involves defuzzification in defuzzification fuzzified value changed into crisp value centre of area coa w i l m u 3 here w i is weight after weight calculate the normalized weight normalized weight j 1 n w i 1 i 1 n w i w i 2 i 1 n w i w in i 1 n w i 1 the following steps were utilized to compute the final weights of all the thematic layers 1 sum all the values in respective column of the pair wise matrix l i j n 1 n c i j where l i j is the total column value of the pair wise matrix and c i j is the criteria used in the analysis i e lithology geology lineament density etc 2 to generate a normalized pair wise matrix each element in the matrix is divided by its row total x i j c i j n 1 n c i j where x i j normalized pair wise matrix 3 to generate standard weights the sum of the normalized row of matrix is divided by the number of criteria used n w i j j 1 n x i j n where w i j standard weights 4 for calculating the consistency vector values following formula was used λ i 1 n c v i j where λ consistency vector 5 deviation or degree of consistency is estimated by consistency index ci ci λ n n 1 where ci consistency index n number of criteria used 6 cr is consistency ratio cr c i r i where ri random inconsistency if the consistency ratio is less than or just equal to 0 1 the inconsistency is acceptable if not we need to revise the subjective judgment patil 2018 scale for the pair wise comparison is shown in table 4 and random inconsistency values for any n numbers of criteria are shown in table 5 here n denotes the number of criteria used and r denotes the random inconsistency the perception of ahp and fahp is primarily the same but the basic difference is that the fahp analyses the numbers in terms of fuzzy number and for ahp the numbers analyzed are crisp numbers 3 2 3 assessment of groundwater prospective zones the groundwater prospective index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity which helps in the calculation of groundwater prospective zones in a region kumari and krishna 2013 the weighted linear combination technique is applied to recognize groundwater prospective zones muralitharan and palanivel 2015 estimated the total scores ts by multiplying weights of features in each thematic layer by the weights of the thematic layers and summed the products of all the attributes ts w r here the total score is ts w is the weights of the thematic layers r is the weights of the features in thematic layers the ground water prospective index gwpi is an integrated layer which is prepared by considering the rating and weights values determined with fahp method for each of the parameters gwpi gg w gg r ld w ld r ge w ge r sl w sl r so w so r rf w rf r ndvi w ndvi r el

present study ten different physical properties or influencing factors such as geology gg lineament density ld geomorphology ge slope sl rainfall rf soil so normalized difference vegetation index ndvi drainage density dd digital elevation model dem and land use land cover lulc have been identified in order to demarcate groundwater prospective zones of the study area fuzzy weights and ranking of considered geological parameters and their sub classes are given in table 7 3 4 1 geology the present study area is mostly covered by alluvium soil with exposures of vindhyan super group comprising with shale and lime stone which formed basement shale is greenish grey in colour and easily cleavable whereas lime stones are hard grey in colour and chert like appearance the area is mostly covered by alluvial deposits of pleistocene to recent age which contains younger alluvium older alluvium and kaimur sandstone kaimur sandstone with bijagarh shale and colluviums with bijagarh shale the exposed lithology of area is mainly composed with clay calcretes silt and kankar of quaternary age quaternary sediments over vindhyan supergroup have been divided into two units of older and newer alluvium the older alluvium is classified into banda and varanasi alluvium and the newer alluvium into terrace and channel alluvium the banda older alluvium developed over kaimur and rewa group of rocks is residual along with fluvial sediment and is exposed in the areas of south of yamuna it comprises yellowish brown motley silt clay with pervasive kankar at the base and coarse to fine sand and reddish brown silt in the upper part the varanasi older alluvium is exposed in the north of yamuna in a form of a polycyclic sequence of yellowish brown clay silt and fine sand with dissemination of large amount of kankar the fresher alluvium is described by grey colored sediments which consists predominantly of micaceous sand silt and clay and unoxidised khaki it has been separated into channel alluvium and terrac the area covered mainly by six types of lithological units namely clay sand sandstone silt kankar and silica as shown in fig 3 and table 8 most of the study region is covered with older alluvial plain 2973 68 km2 followed by bedded sandstone 1639 61 km2 younger alluvial plain 381 89 km2 and sand silt 80 65 km2 respectively comparison matrix and significance weighting values of all attributes of geology are shown in table 9 3 4 2 geomorphology geomorphic features such as flat areas are more capable of holding the precipitation and assist to recharge the ground water as compared to steep slope region where water moves as runoff quickly flood plains are good for groundwater and consist of coarse fine sand silt and gravels flood plains are formed when a river turns and travel downstream alluvial zones structural plateau of gondwana rocks middle level and lower level of deccan traps as moderate in water bearing capacity slope of proterozoic rocks are considered as poor in case of water bearing capacity on the basis of the different geomorphic structures the study area consists of alluvial plain younger and older flood plain denudational hills and pediplain weathered buried shown in fig 4 the study area is mainly described with ganga yamuna alluvial plain and the rocks of vindhyan system attributes of geomorphology and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 10 and 11 respectively 3 4 3 soil soil is one of the fundamental natural resource that is basis of our agriculture it is the mixture of some organic material rocks and minerals different types of gases and liquids and large numbers of micro organisms that can maintain life on the planet it is a natural body that exists as a part of the earth s surface in dynamic equilibrium and it performs many important functions as it is a medium for plant growth groundwater is also an important means of water storage supply purification and modifier of the atmosphere soil is a habitat for organisms that take part in decomposition and life cycle of other organisms it is formed due to gradual breakdown of rocks from the process of weathering and erosion soil is an important factor for finding the groundwater prospective zones the water stock capacity of any area depends upon the soil types and permeability total eight soil attributes are considered in the soil map for the study area as shown in fig 5 and table 12 comparison matrix and import weighting values of all attributes of soil are shown in table 13 3 4 4 land use land cover land use is one of the important criteria for ground water mapping land uses include parameters that are directly disturbing the ground water occurrence and movement some important land use parameters are naturally occurring forest agriculture and other green land natural and artificial water body built up areas and waste land land use land cover map of the study region is shown in fig 6 all these parameters are very important for identification of ground water prospective zones land use parameters for study area are mentioned in table 14 and their comparison matrix is shown in table 15 the lulc map of the study area was prepared by landsat 8 oli satellite images through supervised classification using maximum likelihood algorithm in erdas imagine the accuracy assessment of lulc was done through ground truth verification using 24 ground control points in arcgis 3 4 5 slope slope is a degree of change in elevation of a particular area it is a critical factor in many predictive models used for environmental management including the soil loss and erosion or non point source pollution models there is a direct and indirect effect of slope on agriculture and sometimes both the most obvious direct effect of slope is accessibility of water in different parts of any region the indirect effect of slope influences the position of water table drainage system development of soils air drainage and other environmental conditions the rate of infiltration of surface water is not the same in each region slope is one of the aspects monitoring the infiltration of water into subsurface region the gentle slope area shows a slow surface runoff and high rate of infiltration but a high runoff and less infiltration is observed in the high slope area prasad et al 2008 rank has been given on the basis of their infiltration rate of soil a large part of the area is having less than 14 860 of slope as shown in fig 7 different attributes of slope in study area and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 16 and 17 respectively fig 8 a indicates 0 2 860 b indicates 2 86 4 650 c indicates 4 65 7 880 d indicates 7 88 14 860 and e indicates 14 86 30 680 of slope slope map is made to understand the local and regional slope variation of the terrain which help in the identification of structural disturbances it also highlights the presence of fault scarps and tilting of strata it is prepared by using surface tool which is present in spatial analyst tool of arc tool box 3 4 6 rainfall rainfall has the major contribution towards groundwater recharge rainfall determines the quantity of water that would be accessible to infiltrate into the groundwater organization additional rainfall on any specific area means higher possibilities of recharge machiwal et al 2011 the rainfall accessibility is always reflected as a major source of recharge magesh et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2014 the rainfall data of about 12 years was used in the study as shown in fig 9 the assessments of average annual rainfall based at 8 point locations were used to generate rainfall map by inverse distance weighted interpolation method in arcgis attributes of rainfall and their comparison matrix are given in tables 18 and 19 respectively a indicates 679 70 882 14 mm b indicates 882 14 1028 34 mm c indicates 1028 34 1185 79 mm d indicates 1185 79 1373 23 mm and e indicates 1373 23 1635 64 mm of rainfall the maximum rainfall was 1373 70 mm 1635 64 mm found in the north east and middle region of the district while minimum rainfall occurred is found in the west to south west region and it is 679 70 mm 882 14 mm 3 4 7 drainage density drainage is one of the most significant signs of hydrogeological features it is governed by the topography of land or rock types the length of drainage is based on the strahler s method strahler 2013 strahler s method is the international standard system of stream ordering drainage density is the ratio of the stream segment per unit area groundwater recharge is interrelated with drainage density the low level of groundwater recharge follows in the area having high drainage density prasad et al 2008 magesh et al 2012 pandey and das 2016 the drainage density of the study area is estimated by the line density option in spatial analyst tool in arcgis software the estimated drainage pattern was digitized and after that the drainage density has been displayed on map as shown in fig 10 it varies from 0 11 to 1 22 of km km2 and high drainage density is recorded in the eastern and northern parts of the study area the rating and area of different ranges of drainage densities and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 20 and 21 respectively a indicates 0 11 0 48 km km2 b indicates 0 48 0 63 km km2 c indicates 0 63 0 77 km km2 d indicates 0 77 0 90 km km2 and e indicates 0 90 1 22 km km2 of drainage density 3 4 8 lineament density lineaments can be demarcated as the linear or curvilinear features on the surface of the earth lineament density is more scientifically related with groundwater productivity before individual lineaments thushan and herbert 2010 it plays a major role in the infiltration process mapping of lineament is the first and foremost step which directly or indirectly gives information about the different tectonic activities of the study area the prominent directions of the lineaments are nw and ne in the study area as shown in fig 11 the highest lineament density 0 011 0 020 km km2 is found in the north west to south east side of the basin the lowest lineament density 0 0 01 km km2 is noted in the central region of the basin the final weights of the lineament density feature are shown in table 22 in this study lineament density was classified into five classes of equal intervals and comparison matrix for all of the classes is given in table 23 a indicates 0 00 0 001 km km2 b indicates 0 001 0 004 km km2 c indicates 0 004 0 007 km km2 d indicates 0 007 0 011 km km2 and e indicates 0 011 0 020 km km2 of lineament density 3 4 9 normalized different vegetation index ndvi normalized difference vegetation index is totally depends upon the vegetation pigment it is also used as an indirect indicator of the accessibility of groundwater through the advent of satellite remote sensing it is now possible to understand the green leaf concentration chlorophyll status of vegetation for a large or small area of the earth surface with the support of a single digital image the health and growth of a plant is totally dependent on numerous environmental factors the health of vegetation largely depends on the moisture which is available to the root zone of the plants soil moisture and water availability are key factors which controls the green vegetation of a particular area higher ndvi values are directly related to the availability of sufficient shallow groundwater it also stimulates vegetation growth and also supports local water requirements ndvi is expressed as ndvi rnir rred rnir rred this may also be expressed as ndvi dnnir dnred dnnir dnred where dnnir reflectance values in the near infrared band and dnred reflectance values in the red bands reflectance values are taken after atmospheric corrections theoretical values of ndvi ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates dense green forest and a 1 value indicates a water body in present study ndvi ranges from 0 62 to 0 85 as shown in fig 12 and table 24 a indicates 0 62 0 04 b indicates 0 04 0 21 c indicates 0 21 0 29 d indicates 0 29 0 42 and e indicates 0 42 0 85 ndvi ranges the higher vegetation cover found is found in an area of about 370 930 km2 comparison matrix of different ranges of ndvi is given in table 25 3 4 10 elevation it provides a plane view of the land with graphical representation topography is a very significant factor influencing nearly all surface processes such as solar radiation amount of rainfall water runoff natural drainage system microclimate vegetation distribution and soil development it is also related to the groundwater occurrence in a particular area the preparation of elevation map has many steps including generating a phase difference image and phase unwrapping converting it into relative height difference and geocoding the study region lies in the indo gangetic plain thus elevation is low as shown in fig 13 attributes and comparison matrix of elevation are shown in tables 26 and 27 respectively a indicates 13 100 m b indicates 100 124 m c indicates 124 175 m d indicates 175 259 m and e indicates 259 376 m of elevation the elevation map of study region shows the minimum elevation of 13 m and maximum elevation of 376 m the area lies between 13 and 100 is 2066 12 km2 100 124 is 1779 15 km2 124 175 is 898 25 km2 175 259 km2 is 98 26 km2 and 259 379 km2 is in 85 80 km2 area 4 results and discussion 4 1 ground water prospective zones after computing the final fuzzy ahp weights of all the thematic layers and rating of their individual attributes total thematic layers are converted into raster format and added with one another using fahp overlay operation in arcgis software in order to delineate groundwater prospective zone in the present study area seven categories are obtained for ground water potential as excellent 208 79 km2 very strong to excellent 294 41 km2 strong to very strong 459 31 km2 moderate to strong 501 50 km2 moderate 1872 82 equal to moderate 1118 73 km2 and equal 703 15 km2 zones whose extent and distribution are shown in fig 14 and table 28 the outcomes of the present research revealed that excellent potential zones are found to be in the north eastern part of the study region the good potential zone comprises along north eastern regions the moderate groundwater potential zone seen in central western region the north west area comprises moderate to equal groundwater potential zones region due to high settlement and urbanization 4 2 validation of model the validation of the findings and results is the most important part of any geological research as remote sensing is a nascent branch of geology it is necessary to check the accuracy of model the validation of the models is significant part of research and relates the theoretical model with ground truth data in the literature different methods are used to validate the models related to groundwater associated studies such as analysis of receiver operating characteristics study of area under curve estimation of groundwater yield of wells during field visits or by available water table data the total area studied in the present research work is not very large so an attempt has been made to justify the model with the help of well data a vital attempt has been made to find some relationship between seven estimated groundwater prospective zones and the available well data wells are normally used as a proxy of the groundwater yield in the present study area sufficient number of wells are found but the well in the excellent to moderate zones are having high groundwater yield throughout the year the record of well data is organized by the available records in the study area from central groundwater board prayagraj and presented on the survey of india topographical map approximately 50 wells are found in post monsoon season as shallow water table and high yield in excellent to moderate prospective zones summary of well data is shown in fig 15 besides the validation with available well data ground truth data is also collected by the geological field survey the field survey states that the wells within the excellent to moderate zones of final map provides good amount of water in pre monsoon and post monsoon times of the year such results provide strength to the model the depth of water table is also studied fig 16 shows average water table depth of the study area which is prepared by the help of well data the verification of the groundwater potential map with the well discharge data reveals that three of the five very high discharge wells exist in the excellent zone whereas 2 3 very high discharge wells exist in the very strong to excellent zones thus maximum share of discharges of the wells falling in the excellent very strong to excellent strong to very strong and moderate to strong zones as shown in fig 16 from the validation of model with the help of well records and related water table depth is can be clearly understood that the predicted groundwater prospective zones for the study area are indicating satisfactory level of accuracy therefore the resultant maps must be useful for better development and management of groundwater in the study area the results of the present research could contribute effectively for sustainable groundwater management the fuzzy ahp is one of the widely acceptable technique for multi criterion decision making in various groundwater related applications such as groundwater harvesting groundwater quality groundwater recharge potential and groundwater potential zones latest studies conducted in different parts of the world have successfully applied and appreciated the fuzzy ahp methodology for example fuzzy ahp with other geoinformation techniques was applied for groundwater potential zones in a semi arid region of aseer soudi arabia by mallick et al 2019 this study concludes that the results could enhance the understanding of regional planners to the replenishment of groundwater das and pal in 2019 combined the gis and fuzzy ahp for delineation of groundwater research zone in west bengal india and determined that the fuzzy ahp is a suitable approach the fuzzy ahp method was also applied for extracting the groundwater quality indicators in the extent of iran by azimi et al in 2018 while sener et al in the same year 2018 completed fuzzy ahp for groundwater potential mapping in beysehir lake basin turkey gis based integrated fuzzy logic and ahp model was applied for assessing water harvesting zones in northeast maysan governorate iraq al abadi et al 2017 hence research from these several countries once again resolves that the fuzzy ahp model is the most efficient tool to delineate groundwater potential zones and for other groundwater related studies al abadi et al 2017 azimi et al 2018 sener et al 2018a b das and pal 2019 mallick et al 2019 5 conclusion the present study area is situated on an alluvial plain an alluvial plain is a mostly flat landform created by the deposition of sediment over a long period of time by one or more rivers coming from mountains or highland regions but the proposed methodology would also be suitable for mountain belts which covers a significant area of the earth s surface the groundwater and glaciers of mountains are important contributors to lowland aquifers and rivers mallick et al 2019 applied fuzzy ahp methodology in semi arid mountainous watershed region of saudi arabia and resolved that slope and lineament density played an essential role in the groundwater potential recharge zone process in such areas the method of fuzzy ahp is successfully applied in some mountainous regions mallick et al 2014 mallick 2016 eliades et al 2018 present study ascertains that the fuzzy ahp technique is very effective under gis environment for prediction of ground water potential zones in the study region comparison between groundwater potential index and well discharge point provided very good relation which indicated successful application of remote sensing gis and fahp techniques the present fahp modeling of remote sensing data can be applied in other regions for the generation of the ground water potential maps in this study region a total of 208 79 km2 area have been identified as the excellent ground water prospective zone the basis of present study is to generate different thematic layers of different properties such as soil geology geomorphology land use changes slope lineament density rainfall ndvi elevation and drainage density of the area integration of all geological attributes provides an effective tool in groundwater studies remote sensing applications are beneficial only when applied at the early stage of survey it may provide a smaller area for further investigations i e resistivity survey borehole drilling etc results of remote sensing processing may enhance the drilling success rate and reduce the exploration costs it also reduces the time factor expenditure and risk to human life during the groundwater related processing some areas of the present study that are very near to the surface water bodies are not showing a very good groundwater potential zone therefore the geological conditions are very favorable but in urban areas the upper surface is not helping in the process of infiltration it is noted that in cities and towns or urban areas sufficient volume of water is not percolating through the surface into the aquifer by gravity for future storage the results of the present study could also create a general awareness among the legislators or researchers that the urban areas should be encouraged for rain water harvesting vegetation or other suitable techniques for proper recharge the overall findings of the research work has uniquely demonstrated that by integrating the geo spatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing and gis with fuzzy ahp technique delivers a powerful raised area for study of groundwater prospective zones in prayagraj district of uttar pradesh india this approach is also suitable to make appropriate groundwater exploration strategies for different purposes the integrated map could be beneficial for sustainable development of groundwater as well as identification of priority areas for implementation of water conservation in government and private projects and programs in future the groundwater prospective zones must be monitored regularly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11985,this paper develops a model to delineate groundwater potential zones by integrating tools of remote sensing geographical information system gis and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp to achieve multi attribute decision making choice among various thematic layers which affect the groundwater resources such as geology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density land use land cover normalized difference vegetation index and elevation in the region of prayagraj uttar pradesh india using saaty s scale suitable weights are allotted to the physical properties and their significant features according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence the allotted weights of the thematic layers and their significant features were then normalized by using fahp finally the estimated ten thematic maps from satellite images and conventional data are combined in a gis platform to yield a groundwater potential zones map thus seven groundwater potential zones are identified and demarcated in the study area as excellent very strong to excellent strong to very strong moderate to strong moderate equal to moderate and equal the groundwater potential zones map is finally justified using the well annual discharge data and the result is found tolerable this study clearly provides groundwater potential zones and offers future planning managing and forecasting of groundwater resources in the study area information from remote sensing analysis also reduces the expenditure time and risk to human life during the groundwater related research work graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fahp remote sensing gis 1 introduction the need for sustainable development is a key to the future of mankind now we are more concerned with our environment than ever before since the industrial revolution over time rapid increase in world population simultaneous economic progress through globalization and imitation of lifestyles from exposure to social media networks globally has put pressure on environment and natural resources which are altering the capacity of planets natural support system as individual consumption of water increased both for human and modern agricultural practices it is leading to depletion of groundwater it is high time to look for ways and means to find cost effective techniques to search groundwater bearing zones satellite image processing techniques by way of remote sensing can provide essential information about a large area which can be further justified by other field techniques remote sensing analysis reduces the expenditure time and risk to human life during the groundwater related research work groundwater is an important and finite resource essential for life on the earth water bearing horizons with good porosity and permeability are called aquifers porous lithological horizons may store water in voids voids or pores are the open space in the rock where no solid matter is found and only water can accumulate dai et al 2001 the percentage of voids is called porosity porosity is primarily developed along with the formation of rock at secondary stage porosity is constituted by fractures joints sheared zones solution opening etc normally groundwater aquifers are known as confined or unconfined unconfined aquifers are also recognized as water table aquifers under constant atmospheric circumstances there exists a normal water table the water is enclosed under slightly higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure in confined aquifers the principal sources of groundwater boost are rainfall and surface water depending upon atmospheric conditions there are other sources as well such as meteoric water condensational water connate water and juvenile or magmatic water horton 1932 edet et al 1998 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 groundwater normally occurs at depths whereas remote sensing detects only surface information the depth penetration of electromagnetic radiation is hardly a tiny proportion of a millimeter in visible region hoffman et al 2001 gupta 2003 microwave region penetrates hardly few meters in hyper arid environment in normal environmental conditions remote sensing processing is incapable to grant any straight information on groundwater satellite remote sensing combined with gis is very beneficial for demarcation of groundwater identification kang et al 2012 krishnamurthy et al 1996 integration of remote sensing with gis techniques are not new to analyze and understand microlevel regional analysis saraf and choudhary 1998 physical geological morphological and hydrological properties of surface and subsurface water environment can be calculated using remote sensing data the surface features indicators can be grouped into two different groups i direct indicators or first order and ii indirect indicators or second order the first order indicators such as recharge or discharge zones moisture content of soil and vegetation are directly related to the groundwater system the second order indicators are rock types soil structures fractures landforms drainage and anthropogenic activities on surface these are a fair number of surface indicators which can provide information for groundwater hobbs 1912 campbell 1987 lillesand and kiefer 2000 as noted earlier that remote sensing procedure for groundwater is dependent on certain indicators which are easily observed on surface thematic maps of different indicators are created for groundwater investigation so one has to consider several thematic maps for a particular unit of area for this purpose there is a need of an integration function which can deal with such a complex set of data demicco and klir 2004 kumar et al 2008 this requires some integration function or method there are two fundamental types of integration functions i arithmetic and ii logical arithmetic operation includes multiplication division subtraction or addition of each layer in one data layer respectively by a value at the corresponding location in the second data layer the logical operations involve determination of such an area of interest where a particular condition is fulfilled such integration can be done by different multi criteria decision making methods and machine learning algorithms the weighted overlay is a common method applied by many researchers a weight is a value allotted to an assessment criterion that indicates its importance with respect to the criterion under consideration saraf and choudhary 1998 saraf et al 2004 amreesh 2006 frantazoa et al 2010 chavara et al 2011 preeja et al 2011 bera and bandhyopadhyay 2012 patil et al 2013 murugiah and venkatraman 2013 mishra 2013 muthukrishnan et al 2013 kumar and karuppannam 2014 waiker and nilawar 2014 palaka and sankar 2015 ramamoorthy and rammohan 2015 dinesan et al 2015 pani et al 2016 a modest method for valuing the criterion weights is to rank the criteria in the order of the decision marker s preference saravanan 2012 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 radhakrishnan et al 2014 when the decision maker estimates weights on the basis of a predetermined scale such as a scale of 0 100 or lowest to highest such process is known as rating the given weights are normalized by dividing all weights to the total sum of weights choudhury et al 2009 the pair wise comparisons are organized into a matrix which depends on the scale from 1 to 9 rates the preferences with respect to a pair of criteria nagaraju et al 2011 arkoprovo et al 2012 aneesh et al 2015 frequency ratio takes into accounts the probability of occurrence of a certain event or attribute probability naghibi et al 2014 fuzzy overlap operation is also applied in multi criteria decision based remote sensing problems by many researchers dixon et al 2005 ghayoumian et al 2007 kumar et al 2010 riad et al 2011 rather and andrabi 2012 muthukrishnan et al 2012 bhowmick et al 2014 the analytical hierarchy process ahp is another powerful tool to simultaneously evaluate multiple criteria it is a subjective method the ahp was developed by saaty 1980 and relies on the judgment of the experts to determine scales of priority the weight of a criteria is made using a scale of absolute judgements that signifies by how much more one component dominates over the other with respect to a given attribute for each problem a hierarchical model consisting of alternatives sub criteria criteria and goals is used in the ahp model the final solution to a problem by ahp is accomplished by using the priorities of the pairwise comparisons tweed et al 2006 ho 2008 ganapuram et al 2009 thusan and herbert 2010 palaka and sankar 2015 aneesh et al 2015 sener et al 2018a b while making pairwise comparisons of the criteria some inconsistencies may occur at a certain level in such cases the logical consistency of pairwise comparisons should be checked the notion of fahp is a very broad subject that was adopted world wide in a number of hydrology related research areas while some studies are focused only on groundwater water potential zones but others are directly associated to the environment li et al 2009 applied the fahp methods to assess the ecosystem in the danjiangkou reservoir area china jabraeili and zarei 2018 integrated the ahp fuzzy method to evaluate suitable land for flood spreading in the shourdasht watershed in the ghahavand hamadan province iran results proved that the soil erosion was controlled and the flood waters end up being stored in the aquifers saravanan et al 2020 using remote sensing techniques successfully implemented analytical hierarchy process in the hard rock region of gundihalla watershade bellary karnataka india it confirms that fuzzy ahp is a suitable method to delineate groundwater potential even in hard rock formation chabak et al 2016 applied gis and ahp for the selection of suitable landfill site in babylon iraq the selected area of landfill site can accommodate solid waste from 2020 to 2030 based on requirement without harming the environment dar et al 2020 applied ahp in the inter montane valley of kashmir india which is surrounded by the great himalayan range towards northwest and pir panjab range to the southwest to delineate potential groundwater area after validation the obtained results suggested that the method was significant and reliable from the above discussion it is easily deciphered that the present technique is universal and adapted successfully in different geographic regions of the world fahp integrated with gis and remote sensing techniques have provided usefull results in different parts of the crust such as semi arid mountainous watershed region of saudi arabia mallic et al 2019 beysehir lake basin turkey sener et al 2018a b

saravanan et al 2020 this methodology was effectively applied in the delineation of groundwater recharge potential integration of gis remote sensing fuzzy ahp with conventional field data is an important tool for acquiring information from a very large area and offers synoptic and quick repetitive region coverage as a result for the first time fuzzy ahp fahp method of analysis which is a fuzzy extension of ahp was proposed by van laarhoven and pedryez in 1983 to signify confident decision making since then several research scholars have applied this methodology in different areas for solutions towards decision making an et al 1991 chang 1996 tseng et al 2008 dadhwal 2013 mallick 2016 eliades et al 2018 azimi et al 2018 the present research work adapts a unique method of fahp which includes selection of an alternative and systematic approaches weighting and uses the concept of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis to achive multi attribute decision making choice by integrating the geo spatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing and gis 1 1 objectives the term prospective or potential groundwater zone could be described as the probability of groundwater occurring presence of aquifer shallow water table or favorable environmental conditions for recharge the above discussion summarises the following objective of the present research work 1 to develop a model to demarcate groundwater prospective zones by integrating tools of remote sensing geographical information system gis and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp to achieve multi attribute decision making choice among many thematic layers which affect the groundwater in the region of prayagraj uttar pradesh india 2 to display that in the current modified environment geo information technology as a powerful tool for groundwater related studies 3 to divulge that the growing population and urbanization are putting pressure on the storage of groundwater there are certain areas which naturally provides a healthy environment for the storage or recharge of groundwater but excess logging and urbanization are diminishing and shrinking the capacity of the groundwater storage over time all of the above objectives are demonstrated in the present case study 2 study area the study area is the prayagraj in the state of uttar pradesh india lies at a latitude 24 47 n and 25 43 n and longitude 81 31 and 82 21 e in survey of india toposheets no 63 g 11 and 63 g 12 at an elevation of 9 8 km it covers the area about 5212 48 km2 in south eastern part of uttar pradesh state on confluence of mighty river ganga and yamuna and invisible river saraswati therefore referred as sangam the prayagraj district is divided into three parts i e trans ganga doab and trans yamuna portion the present area is situated in indo gangetic plain a broad monotonous built up of quaternary alluvium the crust of the study area represents mostly alluvial with some exposures of hard rocks this area can be divided into three natural features active flood plain very fertile older alluvial plain and denudational hills or rocky surface the active flood plain is of low relief with heavy deposition of silt clay calcretes gravel and kankars of quaternary age older alluvial plain composed of silt sandy clay gravel and pebbles which lies along river ganga the denudational hills comprised of limestone and shale of proterozoic age are quite important in trans yamuna area such as manda meja koraon and some parts of shankargarh wadia 1975 singh and tripathi 2009 pati et al 2013 singh et

either from digital images or from conventional surface data total ten thematic layers of physical properties such as geology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density land use land cover ndvi and elevation are prepared the fahp method is used to evaluate the different thematic maps according to their categorization on the basis of ground water involvement delft 2000 rather et al 2012 gholami et al 2017 different steps of research work are summarized in fig 2 in the next section fahp and description of thematic layers are discussed 3 2 1 fuzzy ahp method the method of fahp is developed from the combination of traditional ahp and fuzzy the multi criteria decision making problems are efficiently solved by fuzzy ahp saaty 2008 for the alternative selection many researchers have tried to decide the best option with multi criteria decision making via fuzzy logic and hierarchical structure analysis van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 proposed for the first time a study on the fuzzy ahp in this initial study the fuzzy rates were expressed by triangular fuzzy numbers over time this method was further modified by several researchers and still being frequently used for different decision making problems an et al 1991 iqbal and sajjad 2013 dadhwal 2013 singh et al 2019 for the present research work the fahp developed by chang 1996 is applied the pairwise comparisons scale used in fahp triangular method is explained and given in tables 1 4 tseng et al 2008 the strength of preference for one element over another are expressed by the fuzzy scaling ratios of 2 3 1 3 2 2 5 2 3 7 2 4 and 9 2 interval values the pairwise comparisons in the judgment matrix are fuzzy numbers in a fahp method they may also be modified by the designer s prominence azimi et al 2018 the following steps are adopted to determine weights for fahp caniani et al 2015 step 1 pairwise comparison matrices were created using all the criteria in the extents of the hierarchy system pairwise matrix is created by the help of scale of relative importance called saaty s scale table 1 3 2 2 fuzzy scale fuzzy logic normally known as multivalued logic is applied to solve the problems which consist of vague and imprecise data a fuzzy knowledge base exemplifies the linguistic variables on the basis of fuzzy set theory to make satisfactory decisions the knowledge base defines the interaction which are defined by if then rules between conditional fuzzy propositions these rules are developed as per human expert knowledge and generally express in natural human language all defined linguistic variables are assigned appropriate membership functions using fuzzy linguistic variables such as very high high medium low and very low zadeh 1978 zimmerman and zysno 1980 description of fuzzy scale is given in table 2 linguistic terms are assigned to the pairwise comparisons after examining in each case which of the two criteria is more important a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 1 1 a 21 a 1 n 1 a 21 1 a 2 n 1 a n 1 1 a n 2 1 where a i j may be explained as let 1 be 1 1 1 when i j if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 measure that criterion i is reasonably significant to criterion j and then 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 measure that criterion j is reasonably significant to criterion i table 3 by the help of fuzzification process all crisp values are changed into fuzzy values as shown in table 4 step 2 estimation of fuzzy geometric mean and fuzzy weights of each criterion sener et al 2018a b fuzzy geometric mean r i r i a i 1 a i 2 a in 1 n fuzzy weight w

may also be specified by a tfn w i lw i mw i uw i step 3 this step involves defuzzification in defuzzification fuzzified value changed into crisp value centre of area coa w i l m u 3 here w i is weight after weight calculate the normalized weight normalized weight j 1 n w i 1 i 1 n w i w i 2 i 1 n w i w in i 1 n w i 1 the following steps were utilized to compute the final weights of all the thematic layers 1 sum all the values in respective column of the pair wise matrix l i j n 1 n c i j where l i j is the total column value of the pair wise matrix and c i j is the criteria used in the analysis i e lithology geology lineament density etc 2 to generate a normalized pair wise matrix each element in the matrix is divided by its row total x i j c i j n 1 n c i j where x i j normalized pair wise matrix 3 to generate standard weights the sum of the normalized row of matrix is divided by the number of criteria used n w i j j 1 n x i j n where w i j standard weights 4 for calculating the consistency vector values following formula was used λ i 1 n c v i j where λ consistency vector 5 deviation or degree of consistency is estimated by consistency index ci ci λ n n 1 where ci consistency index n number of criteria used 6 cr is consistency ratio cr c i r i where ri random inconsistency if the consistency ratio is less than or just equal to 0 1 the inconsistency is acceptable if not we need to revise the subjective judgment patil 2018 scale for the pair wise comparison is shown in table 4 and random inconsistency values for any n numbers of criteria are shown in table 5 here n denotes the number of criteria used and r denotes the random inconsistency the perception of ahp and fahp is primarily the same but the basic difference is that the fahp analyses the numbers in terms of fuzzy number and for ahp the numbers analyzed are crisp numbers 3 2 3 assessment of groundwater prospective zones the groundwater prospective index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity which helps in the calculation of groundwater prospective zones in a region kumari and krishna 2013 the weighted linear combination technique is applied to recognize groundwater prospective zones muralitharan and palanivel 2015 estimated the total scores ts by multiplying weights of features in each thematic layer by the weights of the thematic layers and summed the products of all the attributes ts w r here the total score is ts w is the weights of the thematic layers r is the weights of the features in thematic layers the ground water prospective index gwpi is an integrated layer which is prepared by considering the rating and weights values determined with fahp method for each of the parameters gwpi gg w gg r ld w ld r ge w ge r sl w sl r so w so r rf w rf r ndvi w ndvi r el

drainage density dd digital elevation model dem and land use land cover lulc have been identified in order to demarcate groundwater prospective zones of the study area fuzzy weights and ranking of considered geological parameters and their sub classes are given in table 7 3 4 1 geology the present study area is mostly covered by alluvium soil with exposures of vindhyan super group comprising with shale and lime stone which formed basement shale is greenish grey in colour and easily cleavable whereas lime stones are hard grey in colour and chert like appearance the area is mostly covered by alluvial deposits of pleistocene to recent age which contains younger alluvium older alluvium and kaimur sandstone kaimur sandstone with bijagarh shale and colluviums with bijagarh shale the exposed lithology of area is mainly composed with clay calcretes silt and kankar of quaternary age quaternary sediments over vindhyan supergroup have been divided into two units of older and newer alluvium the older alluvium is classified into banda and varanasi alluvium and the newer alluvium into terrace and channel alluvium the banda older alluvium developed over kaimur and rewa group of rocks is residual along with fluvial sediment and is exposed in the areas of south of yamuna it comprises yellowish brown motley silt clay with pervasive kankar at the base and coarse to fine sand and reddish brown silt in the upper part the varanasi older alluvium is exposed in the north of yamuna in a form of a polycyclic sequence of yellowish brown clay silt and fine sand with dissemination of large amount of kankar the fresher alluvium is described by grey colored sediments which consists predominantly of micaceous sand silt and clay and unoxidised khaki it has been separated into channel alluvium and terrac the area covered mainly by six types of lithological units namely clay sand sandstone silt kankar and silica as shown in fig 3 and table 8 most of the study region is covered with older alluvial plain 2973 68 km2 followed by bedded sandstone 1639 61 km2 younger alluvial plain 381 89 km2 and sand silt 80 65 km2 respectively comparison matrix and significance weighting values of all attributes of geology are shown in table 9 3 4 2 geomorphology geomorphic features such as flat areas are more capable of holding the precipitation and assist to recharge the ground water as compared to steep slope region where water moves as runoff quickly flood plains are good for groundwater and consist of coarse fine sand silt and gravels flood plains are formed when a river turns and travel downstream alluvial zones structural plateau of gondwana rocks middle level and lower level of deccan traps as moderate in water bearing capacity slope of proterozoic rocks are considered as poor in case of water bearing capacity on the basis of the different geomorphic structures the study area consists of alluvial plain younger and older flood plain denudational hills and pediplain weathered buried shown in fig 4 the study area is mainly described with ganga yamuna alluvial plain and the rocks of vindhyan system attributes of geomorphology and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 10 and 11 respectively 3 4 3 soil soil is one of the fundamental natural resource that is basis of our agriculture it is the mixture of some organic material rocks and minerals different types of gases and liquids and large numbers of micro organisms that can maintain life on the planet it is a natural body that exists as a part of the earth s surface in dynamic equilibrium and it performs many important functions as it is a medium for plant growth groundwater is also an important means of water storage supply purification and modifier of the atmosphere soil is a habitat for organisms that take part in decomposition and life cycle of other organisms it is formed due to gradual breakdown of rocks from the process of weathering and erosion soil is an important factor for finding the groundwater prospective zones the water stock capacity of any area depends upon the soil types and permeability total eight soil attributes are considered in the soil map for the study area as shown in fig 5 and table 12 comparison matrix and import weighting values of all attributes of soil are shown in table 13 3 4 4 land use land cover land use is one of the important criteria for ground water mapping land uses include parameters that are directly disturbing the ground water occurrence and movement some important land use parameters are naturally occurring forest agriculture and other green land natural and artificial water body built up areas and waste land land use land cover map of the study region is shown in fig 6 all these parameters are very important for identification of ground water prospective zones land use parameters for study area are mentioned in table 14 and their comparison matrix is shown in table 15 the lulc map of the study area was prepared by landsat 8 oli satellite images through supervised classification using maximum likelihood algorithm in erdas imagine the accuracy assessment of lulc was done through ground truth verification using 24 ground control points in arcgis 3 4 5 slope slope is a degree of change in elevation of a particular area it is a critical factor in many predictive models used for environmental management including the soil loss and erosion or non point source pollution models there is a direct and indirect effect of slope on agriculture and sometimes both the most obvious direct effect of slope is accessibility of water in different parts of any region the indirect effect of slope influences the position of water table drainage system development of soils air drainage and other environmental conditions the rate of infiltration of surface water is not the same in each region slope is one of the aspects monitoring the infiltration of water into subsurface region the gentle slope area shows a slow surface runoff and high rate of infiltration but a high runoff and less infiltration is observed in the high slope area prasad et al 2008 rank has been given on the basis of their infiltration rate of soil a large part of the area is having less than 14 860 of slope as shown in fig 7 different attributes of slope in study area and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 16 and 17 respectively fig 8 a indicates 0 2 860 b indicates 2 86 4 650 c indicates 4 65 7 880 d indicates 7 88 14 860 and e indicates 14 86 30 680 of slope slope map is made to understand the local and regional slope variation of the terrain which help in the identification of structural disturbances it also highlights the presence of fault scarps and tilting of strata it is prepared by using surface tool which is present in spatial analyst tool of arc tool box 3 4 6 rainfall rainfall has the major contribution towards groundwater recharge rainfall determines the quantity of water that would be accessible to infiltrate into the groundwater organization additional rainfall on any specific area means higher possibilities of recharge machiwal et al 2011 the rainfall accessibility is always reflected as a major source of recharge magesh et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2014 the rainfall data of about 12 years was used in the study as shown in fig 9 the assessments of average annual rainfall based at 8 point locations were used to generate rainfall map by inverse distance weighted interpolation method in arcgis attributes of rainfall and their comparison matrix are given in tables 18 and 19 respectively a indicates 679 70 882 14 mm b indicates 882 14 1028 34 mm c indicates 1028 34 1185 79 mm d indicates 1185 79 1373 23 mm and e indicates 1373 23 1635 64 mm of rainfall

882 14 mm 3 4 7 drainage density drainage is one of the most significant signs of hydrogeological features it is governed by the topography of land or rock types the length of drainage is based on the strahler s method strahler 2013 strahler s method is the international standard system of stream ordering drainage density is the ratio of the stream segment per unit area groundwater recharge is interrelated with drainage density the low level of groundwater recharge follows in the area having high drainage density prasad et al 2008 magesh et al 2012 pandey and das 2016 the drainage density of the study area is estimated by the line density option in spatial analyst tool in arcgis software the estimated drainage pattern was digitized and after that the drainage density has been displayed on map as shown in fig 10 it varies from 0 11 to 1 22 of km km2 and high drainage density is recorded in the eastern and northern parts of the study area the rating and area of different ranges of drainage densities and their comparison matrix are shown in tables 20 and 21 respectively a indicates 0 11 0 48 km km2 b indicates 0 48 0 63 km km2 c indicates 0 63 0 77 km km2 d indicates 0 77 0 90 km km2 and e indicates 0 90 1 22 km km2 of drainage density 3 4 8 lineament density lineaments can be demarcated as the linear or curvilinear features on the surface of the earth lineament density is more scientifically related with groundwater productivity before individual lineaments thushan and herbert 2010 it plays a major role in the infiltration process mapping of lineament is the first and foremost step which directly or indirectly gives information about the different tectonic activities of the study area the prominent directions of the lineaments are nw and ne in the study area as shown in fig 11 the highest lineament density 0 011 0 020 km km2 is found in the north west to south east side of the basin the lowest lineament density 0 0 01 km km2 is noted in the central region of the basin the final weights of the lineament density feature are shown in table 22 in this study lineament density was classified into five classes of equal intervals and comparison matrix for all of the classes is given in table 23 a indicates 0 00 0 001 km km2 b indicates 0 001 0 004 km km2 c indicates 0 004 0 007 km km2 d indicates 0 007 0 011 km km2 and e indicates 0 011 0 020 km km2 of lineament density 3 4 9 normalized different vegetation index ndvi normalized difference vegetation index is totally depends upon the vegetation pigment it is also used as an indirect indicator of the accessibility of groundwater through the advent of satellite remote sensing it is now possible to understand the green leaf concentration chlorophyll status of vegetation for a large or small area of the earth surface with the support of a single digital image the health and growth of a plant is totally dependent on numerous environmental factors the health of vegetation largely depends on the moisture which is available to the root zone of the plants soil moisture and water availability are key factors which controls the green vegetation of a particular area higher ndvi values are directly related to the availability of sufficient shallow groundwater it also stimulates vegetation growth and also supports local water requirements ndvi is expressed as ndvi rnir rred rnir rred this may also be expressed as ndvi dnnir dnred dnnir dnred where dnnir reflectance values in the near infrared band and dnred reflectance values in the red bands reflectance values are taken after atmospheric corrections theoretical values of ndvi ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates dense green forest and a 1 value indicates a water body in present study ndvi ranges from 0 62 to 0 85 as shown in fig 12 and table 24 a indicates 0 62 0 04 b indicates 0 04 0 21 c indicates 0 21 0 29 d indicates 0 29 0 42 and e indicates 0 42 0 85 ndvi ranges the higher vegetation cover found is found in an area of about 370 930 km2 comparison matrix of different ranges of ndvi is given in table 25 3 4 10 elevation it provides a plane view of the land with graphical representation topography is a very significant factor influencing nearly all surface processes such as solar radiation amount of rainfall water runoff natural drainage system microclimate vegetation distribution and soil development it is also related to the groundwater occurrence in a particular area the preparation of elevation map has many steps including generating a phase difference image and phase unwrapping converting it into relative height difference and geocoding the study region lies in the indo gangetic plain thus elevation is low as shown in fig 13 attributes and comparison matrix of elevation are shown in tables 26 and 27 respectively a indicates 13 100 m b indicates 100 124 m c indicates 124 175 m d indicates 175 259 m and e indicates 259 376 m of elevation the elevation map of study region shows the minimum elevation of 13 m and maximum elevation of 376 m the area lies between 13 and 100 is 2066 12 km2 100 124 is 1779 15 km2 124 175 is 898 25 km2 175 259 km2 is 98 26 km2 and 259 379 km2 is in 85 80 km2 area 4 results and discussion 4 1 ground water prospective zones after computing the final fuzzy ahp weights of all the thematic layers and rating of their individual attributes total thematic layers are converted into raster format and added with one another using fahp overlay operation in arcgis software in order to delineate groundwater prospective zone in the present study area seven categories are obtained for ground water potential as excellent 208 79 km2 very strong to excellent 294 41 km2 strong to very strong 459 31 km2 moderate to strong 501 50 km2 moderate 1872 82 equal to moderate 1118 73 km2 and equal 703 15 km2 zones whose extent and distribution are shown in fig 14 and table 28 the outcomes of the present research revealed that excellent potential zones are found to be in the north eastern part of the study region the good potential zone comprises along north eastern regions the moderate groundwater potential zone seen in central western region the north west area comprises moderate to equal groundwater potential zones region due to high settlement and urbanization 4 2 validation of model the validation of the findings and results is the most important part of any geological research as remote sensing is a nascent branch of geology it is necessary to check the accuracy of model the validation of the models is significant part of research and relates the theoretical model with ground truth data in the literature different methods are used to validate the models related to groundwater associated studies such as analysis of receiver operating characteristics study of area under curve estimation of groundwater yield of wells during field visits or by available water table data the total area studied in the present research work is not very large so an attempt has been made to justify the model with the help of well data a vital attempt has been made to find some relationship between seven estimated groundwater prospective zones and the available well data wells are normally used as a proxy of the groundwater yield in the present study area sufficient number of wells are found but the well in the excellent to moderate zones are having high groundwater yield throughout the year the record of well data is organized by the available records in the study area from central groundwater board prayagraj and presented on the survey of india topographical map approximately 50 wells are found in post monsoon season as shallow water table and high yield in excellent to moderate prospective zones summary of well data is shown in fig 15 besides the validation with available well data ground truth data is also collected by the geological field survey the field survey states that the wells within the excellent to moderate zones of final map provides good amount of water in pre monsoon and post monsoon times of the year such results provide strength to the model the depth of water table is also studied fig 16 shows average water table depth of the study area which is prepared by the help of well data the verification of the groundwater potential map with the well discharge data reveals that three of the five very high discharge wells exist in the excellent zone whereas 2 3 very high discharge wells exist in the very strong to excellent zones thus maximum share of discharges of the wells falling in the excellent very strong to excellent strong to very strong and moderate to strong zones as shown in fig 16 from the validation of model with the help of well records and related water table depth is can be clearly understood that the predicted groundwater prospective zones for the study area are indicating satisfactory level of accuracy therefore the resultant maps must be useful for better development and management of groundwater in the study area the results of the present research could contribute effectively for sustainable groundwater management the fuzzy ahp is one of the widely acceptable technique for multi criterion decision making in various groundwater related applications such as groundwater harvesting groundwater quality groundwater recharge potential and groundwater potential zones latest studies conducted in different parts of the world have successfully applied and appreciated the fuzzy ahp methodology for example fuzzy ahp with other geoinformation techniques was applied for groundwater potential zones in a semi arid region of aseer soudi arabia by mallick et al 2019 this study concludes that the results could enhance the understanding of regional planners to the replenishment of groundwater das and pal in 2019 combined the gis and fuzzy ahp for delineation of groundwater research zone in west bengal india and determined that the fuzzy ahp is a suitable approach the fuzzy ahp method was also applied for extracting the groundwater quality indicators in the extent of iran by azimi et al in 2018 while sener et al in the same year 2018 completed fuzzy ahp for groundwater potential mapping in beysehir lake basin turkey gis based integrated fuzzy logic and ahp model was applied for assessing water harvesting zones in northeast maysan governorate iraq al abadi et al 2017 hence research from these several countries once again resolves that the fuzzy ahp model is the most efficient tool to delineate groundwater potential zones and for other groundwater related studies al abadi et al 2017 azimi et al 2018 sener et al 2018a b das and pal 2019 mallick et al 2019 5 conclusion the present study area is situated on an alluvial plain an alluvial plain is a mostly flat landform created by the deposition of sediment over a long period of time by one or more rivers coming from mountains or highland regions but the proposed methodology would also be suitable for mountain belts which covers a significant area of the earth s surface the groundwater and glaciers of mountains are important contributors to lowland aquifers and rivers mallick et al 2019 applied fuzzy ahp methodology in semi arid mountainous watershed region of saudi arabia and resolved that slope and lineament density played an essential role in the groundwater potential recharge zone process in such areas the method of fuzzy ahp is successfully applied in some mountainous regions mallick et al 2014 mallick 2016 eliades et al 2018 present study ascertains that the fuzzy ahp technique is very effective under gis environment for prediction of ground water potential zones in the study region comparison between groundwater potential index and well discharge point provided very good relation which indicated successful application of remote sensing gis and fahp techniques the present fahp modeling of remote sensing data can be applied in other regions for the generation of the ground water potential maps in this study region a total of 208 79 km2 area have been identified as the excellent ground water prospective zone the basis of present study is to generate different thematic layers of different properties such as soil geology geomorphology land use changes slope lineament density rainfall ndvi elevation and drainage density of the area integration of all geological attributes provides an effective tool in groundwater studies remote sensing applications are beneficial only when applied at the early stage of survey it may provide a smaller area for further investigations i e resistivity survey borehole drilling etc results of remote sensing processing may enhance the drilling success rate and reduce the exploration costs it also reduces the time factor expenditure and risk to human life during the groundwater related processing some areas of the present study that are very near to the surface water bodies are not showing a very good groundwater potential zone therefore the geological conditions are very favorable but in urban areas the upper surface is not helping in the process of infiltration it is noted that in cities and towns or urban areas sufficient volume of water is not percolating through the surface into the aquifer by gravity for future storage the results of the present study could also create a general awareness among the legislators or researchers that the urban areas should be encouraged for rain water harvesting vegetation or other suitable techniques for proper recharge the overall findings of the research work has uniquely demonstrated that by integrating the geo spatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing and gis with fuzzy ahp technique delivers a powerful raised area for study of groundwater prospective zones in prayagraj district of uttar pradesh india this approach is also suitable to make appropriate groundwater exploration strategies for different purposes the integrated map could be beneficial for sustainable development of groundwater as well as identification of priority areas for implementation of water conservation in government and private projects and programs in future the groundwater prospective zones must be monitored regularly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

kalyan industrial belt is the center of highly sophisticated modern industries geologically the area is dominated by deccan volcanic province volcanic rocks formed by extrusive igneous basaltic lava flows approx 65 million years ago with near horizontal flood basalts which exists in compound and simple pahoehoe type flow deolankar 1980 deshmukh 1988 this kind of flow results in creation of horizontal banding of mountains and characteristic landscape of plateaus with flat top jared bueno et al 2016 the lithology of the area consists of alternating layers of compact dense basalt inter exits with beds of relatively porous or vesicular sections the depth of weathered mantle ranges from 1 to 8 m and potential fractures normally are limited to 20 60 m depth range ground water information 2013 naturally the water conductivity of vesicular fractured and jointed basalt is much more compared to the compacted basalts deolankar and kulkarni 1987 this results in forming of aquifer by weathered vesicular fractured and jointed basalt of deccan trap where as the compact basalt acts as impermeable limiting layer springs are formed when groundwater accumulated in this porous basalt gradually seeps through it and move in according to pizometric surface to make appearance on the surface naik et al 2002 the hydro chemical analysis of water is the pre eminent vital part

samples were collected from the 11 different locations from the study area the standard sampling methods were used giggenbach and gougel 1989 there were three samples collected from each water source purging was done in order to prevent the water from changes like temperature escape or dissolution of different gases oxidation biological activity precipitation of metals reactions with well casing etc which may result into the alteration of composition koterba et al 1995 the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the

ca2 mg2 f k hco3 br so4 2 sio2 according to table 1 ph exceeds the permissible limit as per indian standard in some well like sativali akloli dasgaon and aravali it is one of the most important operational water quality parameter with the optimum ph required often being in the range of 7 04 8 78 fig 2a ph is highly dependent on the temperature as temperature increases the ph also increases high temperature decreases the solubility of co2 and increase the basicity sativali has highest ph might be due to gasification of co2 unhavre farare v and tural has high temperature because of hydrodynamic influence of ground water movement in area might be resulted from the deccan volcanism which carries heat from one place to other place and transfer the heat and rise in temperature can be observed fig 2b total dissolved solids tds is a parameter that is interconnected with electrical conductivity the significance of ec and tds lies in their impact on the corrosive potential of a groundwater samples fig 2 showthe spatial distribution for values of ph tds na cl temperature sio2 ec na and cl are the most influencing parameters in tds and ec tds and ec are ranging from the 95 34

that are visually represent in fig 2 d sativali akloli unhavre farare v and aravali tw have the highest ec na and cl may be because of seawater intrusion by the arabian sea cl is exceeding the permissible limit given by is which can create problem like precipitation of salt fig 3 show the spatial distribution for values of k co3 2 mg 2 f 1 ca 2 so4 2 br 1 sign suggests the charge of particular ion potassium ions are ranging from 0 to 18 mg l with an average of 6 16 mg l fig 3a bicarbonates shows variation from 9 to 1410 mg l with an average of 341 mg l fig 3b bicarbonates over 200 mg l may pose potential hazards as higher carbonates causes calcium to precipitate resulting in comparative increase in sodium ion concentration fig 3c shows distribution of magnesium ion concentration that varies from 0 to 10 mg l with average of 3 5 mg l the maximum permissible limit for mg 2 ions as per indian standards is 30 mg l for industry water with this concentration of magnesium is not likely to create any problem for industrial use fig 3d is showing distribution of fluoride ion that ranges from 0 15 to 3 4 mg l with most of the samples are not falling in the range of desired limit of fluoride concentration i e 1 0 mg l calcium ion concentration varies in between 11 1 and 420 mg l fig 3e from the point of view for industrial usage permissible limit of ca 2 in water for industry use is 500 mg l as per indian standards making no issues for water to be used in industrial purposes main concern with the calcium ion is scaling on the wall of machinery like scaling in boiler sulphate ion varies between 2 8 and 275 mg l which is exceeding the limit in indian standard for industry sulphate causes scaling and it is hard to remove fig 3f br varies between 1 27 and 4 59 mg l which seen normal for industrial operation fig 3g table 1 compares the limits for the parameters of water to be used in industries as per indian standards with the parameters of the water sample collected from our study area except cl f and so4 2 all parameter falls within the permissible limit 5 water quality characterization 5 1 hydrochemcialfacies to thoroughly evaluate variation in hydro chemical facies and study the hydro chemical evolution grouping and areal distribution the graphical representations of major ions dissolved in the water has been done in present study 5 2 piper plots graphical representation of major cations and anions can be done by piper plot the relative abundance of cations and anions discretely and grouped delineation of them as a whole is studied in the present study the cations and anions are graphed by different ternary plots traditionally piper 1994 plots have been utilized to evaluate hydro chemical facies and thus allow us to understand the percolation history involved in it the percolation history includes the lithology solution kinematics and flow patterns of aquifer and other mundane systems which are chemically certain to the system chlorine is good candidate to use as indicator for detection the mingling of water bodies shah m et al 2018 the soil conditions precipitation from air subsurface strata topography are factors affecting water quality ravikumar et al 2015 the relative abundance of sodium calcium magnesium and potassium has been shown by ternary plot at left bottom of piper plot piper 1944 from the ternary plot it is observed that concentration of mg2 ca2 and so4 2 are less compare to other ions and cl has high concentration in the thermal water so there is high chance of corrosively in the

diagram showing hierarchical clustering relationships between similar sets of data the several chemical characteristics of water can be clustered based on their dependency routroy et al 2013 the samples can be clustered based on chemical similarity in samples collected from various sites in the study area singh et al 2005 shrestha and kazama 2006 the water samples from various fields have been clustered according to their chemical composition which is represented by dendogram horizontal axis in dendogram shows the dissimilarity in the set of properties of data the clusters linked at height near to zero have a strong correlation in the data is less than the other clusters at comparatively more height in the present study water samples have been collected from the eleven geothermal fields from konkan region of maharashtra and the dendrograms are prepared for water quality parametersand sampling locations fig 9 fig 9 shows the dendrogram linking the properties measured in the water from eleven wells from the diagram it is inferred that variation in values of f and ph k and so4 2 and ca2 and mg2 are compatible with each other while the variation in the values of na cl tds and ec is comparatively much more than the variation in values of former one standard deviation of all parameters in different wells are as shown in table 2 the major concern lies with the values of salinity owing to fluctuation of tds and ec also thus tests for salinity must be carried prior to any use and accordingly measures should be taken this also implies the variation in subsurface geology as intrusion of seawater is not same over the area resulting in high variation of na and cl fig 9 is the dendrogram linking the wells based on their properties it can be deduced that kajli and amba sov and aravali shows good linkage as do wells akloli and sativali tural and aravali while there is high variation in measured properties of water from well kajli amba sov and aravali as compared to others these are either river or ground water rajapur unhale shows maximum variation from other thermal springs this variation also pertains to the subsurface geology and seawater influence thus the linkage diagram or dendrogram helps in associating areas with similar water properties 7 water quality indices 7 1 langelier saturation index lsi langelier saturation index lsi index is the indicator for capability of water to dissolve or to precipitate the carbonates langlier 1936 lsi is difference in ph measured and ph at saturation with respect to calcium carbonate at particular temperature calculations for the same are as follows lsi ph phs langlier 1936 phs 9 3 a b c d where a log10 tds 1 10 0 15 b 13 12 x log10 c 273 34 55 c log10 ca2 as caco3 0 4 d log10 alkalinity as caco3 it is also worth that the lsi is temperature sensitive the lsi becomes more positive as the water temperature increases this increase in temperature can cause scaling especially in cases such as geothermal waters haritash et al 2016 lsi of water samples of study area shows that as water is under saturated with respect to concentration of calcium carbonate so it has tendency to dissolve the scales from viewpoint of scale deposition water quality will not pose a problem of scaling but on contrary it will increase the direct contact of water with metal which increases or enhances corrosion based on the material of the pipe and other ions present in water the same is the case with study area water has potential for scale formation but it rates of scale formation may be low the interpretation of lsi index has been show in table 3 and table 4 7 2 puckorius scaling index psi other indices do not account for two other critical parameters the buffering capacity of the water and the maximum quantity of precipitate that can form in bringing water to equilibrium the psi attempts to quantify the relationship between saturation state and scale formation by incorporating an estimate of

exceptionally high but they are less than the permissible limit given by indian standard for industrial water from cluster analysis i e dendrogram representation parameters are the ones found varying over the region the values of the other parameters do not deviate too much but the values pose a major concern with utilization of expensive equipment in industry high tds values can be attributed to seawater from arabian sea which is very near to study areas as appeared in fig 1 the salt concentration is too high to be used for industry but to make it useful for any other direct applications like geothermal hvac or orc it must be treated so as to bring the salt concentration down to the level at which problems of salt water corrosion in the pipelines may be cut down moreover saline water has found great use in cooling of thermoelectric power equipment nuclear power plant and in mining therefore we can use this geothermal water in the space heating and cooling technology and extract geothermal energy by orc for commercial and industrial basis it can be decrease dependencies on the fresh water from piper plot also it is clearly being inferred that water is rich in salts and majorly due to na and cl ions thus the need is to focus on effects and measures to be taken to control the concentration of na and cl by cation exchange and absorber higher tds leads to foaming and scale deposition in boilers as well as in the sharp corner of equipment and narrow orifice in the pipeline excess chloride content is likely to increase corrosion rate of steel and aluminum solution to this can be use of copper galvanized steel and cast iron pipes ascribing their property to high inhibition to salt water corrosion however exposure over time can still cause damage therefore paint chemical coating chemical inhibitors and electrical coating can be utilizing thus before planning the strategies for exploitation of groundwater near this area for industrial purpose care for controlling tds especially na and cl ions has to be taken into account surface facilities for hvac or orc by using geothermal groundwater should be designed with grade of pipes manifolds and valves in accordance with high cl concentration water can find its great utility if desalinated at or near well before circulating through pipelines seawater fish cultivation can find its development with prevailing quality of water thus the use of groundwater of such quality for industrial purpose power generation by hot geothermal water space heating and cooling plants fish culture and water for flushing in toilets for mining will result in less dependency on fresh 9 conclusion the hydro chemical analysis of water is the pre eminent vital part before it is taken in the industrial applications the physical and chemical properties were evaluated to examine geothermal water quality for straightforward applications in the industry of proposed study sources the corrosively indices like lsi and psi were calculated from the given ion concentration of water based on the lsi and psi results it can be concluded that the groundwater in this area is not suitable for industrial applications as well in thermal spring sativali akloli dasgaon and unhavre farare v are suitable for industrial application high na and cl concentrations ultimately result in high tds and high ec these obtained parameters would be useful during planning and assortment of material for industrial applications however the water can be utilized industrial applications after essential processes such as primary and secondary treatments such as desalination the proposed geothermal sources can be a potential aid to the supply for industrial utilization in dighi industrial park rajapur refinery and petrochemical complex

diagram gibb s plot and durovpolt na ca2 cl and hco3 are the most important ion in the water which will affect the geochemistry of ground water these ions are depositing in water after weathering of certain rocks like mg2 is depositing in water after the weathering of basic rock such as basalt which are ferromagnesium rich the plots in present study will provide the visual representation of water ion configuration and in which regime they are lying like under evaporates weathering or precipitation various mechanical and chemical operations cleaning fabrication diluting of materials chilling subsuming water to product or sanitation purpose in industry premises are major key units in industries where water is inevitable the water quality must be monitored to prevent pipe corrosion in utilities for indicating the extent to which water flowing through pipes will precipitate or dissolve calcium carbonate important factors such as saturation indices are used to test the quality of water the present study shows that water of wells can be utilize with some additional processing of water through which the key parameter like corrosion tds and temperature can be altered to make it compatible with certain equipment in industries graphical abstract image 1 keywords piper trilinear plot gibbs plot durov plot stiff s polygonal diagram water stability indices 1 introduction water is nector of life spatial and temporal structure of water availability are principally influenced by rainfall which is classified among the rudimentary climate variables de luis et al 2000 arun et al 2014 the amount of rain is governing factor in pre determining the availability of water for industrial agricultural domestic and other usage the heavy concentration of rainfall in june to september monsoon months results in scarcity of water during the non monsoon periods in country baba et al 2009 shah et al 2017 shah et al 2018a shah et al 2018b shah et al 2019e the availability of surface

in the district the main products of these industries are drugs textiles adhesives plastics rubber steel pharmaceuticals engineering fertilizers electronics chemicals and iron steel the thane belapur kalyan industrial belt is the center of highly sophisticated modern industries geologically the area is dominated by deccan volcanic province volcanic rocks formed by extrusive igneous basaltic lava flows approx 65 million years ago with near horizontal flood basalts which exists in compound and simple pahoehoe type flow deolankar 1980 deshmukh 1988 this kind of flow results in creation of horizontal banding of mountains and characteristic landscape of plateaus with flat top jared bueno et al 2016 the lithology of the area consists of alternating layers of compact dense basalt inter exits with beds of relatively porous or vesicular sections the depth of weathered mantle ranges from 1 to 8 m and potential fractures normally are limited to 20 60 m depth range ground water information 2013 naturally the water conductivity of vesicular fractured and jointed basalt is much more compared to the compacted basalts deolankar and kulkarni 1987 this results in forming of aquifer by weathered vesicular fractured and jointed basalt of deccan trap where as the compact basalt acts as impermeable limiting layer springs are formed when groundwater accumulated in this porous basalt gradually seeps through it and move in according to pizometric surface to make appearance on the surface naik et al 2002 the hydro chemical analysis of water is the pre eminent vital part before it is taken in the industrial applications the chemical contents of water are majorly altered while percolating through the soil alluvium and rocks kelly et al 1940 wilcox 1948 belkhiri and

samples were collected from the 11 different locations from the study area the standard sampling methods were used giggenbach and gougel 1989 there were three samples collected from each water source purging was done in order to prevent the water from changes like temperature escape or dissolution of different gases oxidation biological activity precipitation of metals reactions with well casing etc which may result into the alteration of composition koterba et al 1995 the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the laboratory where all the chemical tests were carried out in order to obtain concentration values shah et al 2015 sircar et al 2015 shah et al 2017 shah et al 2018a standard apha methods were used to

ca2 mg2 f k hco3 br so4 2 sio2 according to table 1 ph exceeds the permissible limit as per indian standard in some well like sativali akloli dasgaon and aravali it is one of the most important operational water quality parameter with the optimum ph required often being in the range of 7 04 8 78 fig 2a ph is highly dependent on the temperature as temperature increases the ph also increases high temperature decreases the solubility of co2 and increase the basicity sativali has highest ph might be due to gasification of co2 unhavre farare v and tural has high temperature because of hydrodynamic influence of ground water movement in area might be resulted from the deccan volcanism which carries heat from one place to other place and transfer the heat and rise in temperature can be observed fig 2b total dissolved solids tds is a parameter that is interconnected with electrical conductivity the significance of ec and tds lies in their impact on the corrosive potential of a groundwater samples fig 2 showthe spatial distribution for values of ph tds na cl temperature sio2 ec na and cl are the most influencing parameters in tds and ec tds and ec are ranging from the 95 34 2516 62 mg l and 160 4 3940 mg l respectively fig 2c 2 d na and cl are available 8 06 587 and 9 2 1410 mg l respectively fig 2e 2 f ec more than 3000 μs cm are the dangerous for the industrial uses that are visually represent in fig 2 d sativali akloli unhavre farare v and aravali tw have the highest ec na and cl may be because of seawater intrusion by the arabian sea cl is exceeding the permissible limit given by is which can create problem like precipitation of salt fig 3 show the spatial distribution for values of k co3 2 mg 2 f 1 ca 2 so4 2 br 1 sign suggests the charge of particular ion potassium ions are ranging from 0 to 18 mg l with an average of 6 16 mg l fig 3a bicarbonates shows variation from 9 to 1410 mg l with an average of 341 mg l fig 3b bicarbonates over 200 mg l may pose potential hazards as higher carbonates causes calcium to precipitate resulting in comparative increase in sodium ion concentration fig 3c shows distribution of magnesium ion concentration that varies from 0 to 10 mg l with average of 3 5 mg l the maximum permissible limit for mg 2 ions as per indian standards is 30 mg l for industry water with this concentration of magnesium is not likely to create any problem for industrial use fig 3d is showing distribution of fluoride ion that ranges from 0 15 to 3 4 mg l with most of the samples are not falling in the range of desired limit of fluoride concentration i e 1 0 mg l calcium ion concentration varies in between 11 1 and 420 mg l fig 3e from the point of view for industrial usage permissible limit of ca 2 in water for industry use is 500 mg l as per indian standards making no issues for water to be used in industrial purposes main concern with the calcium ion is scaling on the wall of machinery like scaling in boiler sulphate ion varies between 2 8 and 275 mg l which is exceeding the limit in indian standard for industry sulphate causes scaling and it is hard to remove fig 3f br varies between 1 27 and 4 59 mg l which seen normal for industrial operation fig 3g table 1 compares the limits for the parameters of water to be used in industries as per indian standards with the parameters of the water sample collected from our study area except cl f and so4 2 all parameter falls within the permissible limit 5 water quality characterization 5 1 hydrochemcialfacies to thoroughly evaluate

is studied in the present study the cations and anions are graphed by different ternary plots traditionally piper 1994 plots have been utilized to evaluate hydro chemical facies and thus allow us to understand the percolation history involved in it the percolation history includes the lithology solution kinematics and flow patterns of aquifer and other mundane systems which are chemically certain to the system chlorine is good candidate to use as indicator for detection the mingling of water bodies shah m et al 2018 the soil conditions precipitation from air subsurface strata topography are factors affecting water quality ravikumar et al 2015 the relative abundance of sodium calcium magnesium and potassium has been shown by ternary plot at left bottom of piper plot piper 1944 from the ternary plot it is observed that concentration of mg2 ca2 and so4 2 are less compare to other ions and cl has high concentration in the thermal water so there is high chance of corrosively in the ground water relative abundance of cl decreases and mg2 increases might be because of rainwater percolation and erosion of nearby rocks which are ferromagnesium rich deccan basalt so4 2 and cl

pigmentation changes and hyperkeratosis it also increases the risk of cancer in the skin lungs kidney and bladder one of the biggest sources of as poisoning is the consumption of contaminated drinking

efforts are being made in recent years to design portable reliable and sensitive techniques of detection scientists have been increasingly focussing on the use of nanomaterials for sensing purpose on account of their excellent optical electronic and magnetic properties zhang and chen 2019 pettinato et al 2015 chakraborty and raj 2007 2010 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 gold nanoparticles aunps

of selectively sensing traces of as by the calorimetric assay the proposed mechanism involves the formation of as o and as s bonds leading to aggregation of the modified aunps and subsequent change in the spectroscopy signals kalluri et al 2009 since the calorimetric detection technique does not work successfully for sensing of lower concentrations of as electrochemical methods of detection have

thiol 1 4 dithiothreitol dtt functionalized gold nano islands indium doped tin oxide ito glass electrode was modified with aptms for chemisorption of gold nano islands aunis a bilayer assembly of au

colloidal monolayers metal aunis are directly grafted on ito substrate and are easy to fabricate they possess advantages over the colloidal films such as tunable density of islands controlled deposition of islands with no agglomeration functionalized by dth high current density and high signal to noise ratio snr hence show improved sensing aunis were further functionalized with dtt dtt aptms au which captures as s bond and cage formation by intermolecular hydrogen bonding the captured as3 was reduced to as0 and detected by voltammetry to enhance the selectivity of the sensor pdca 2 4 pyridinedicarboxylic acid was used as a sequestering agent thus reducing the interference due to other bivalent heavy metal ligands the sensor was tested with contaminated water samples to confirm the practical utility 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents arsenic trioxide as2o3 aurochloric acid haucl4 sodium citrate 3 aminopropyl tri methoxy silane aptms 1 12 dodecanedithiol dth 1 4 dithiothreitol dtt 2 4 pyridinedicarboxylic acid pdca were purchased from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl and methanol were purchased from merck and co usa deionized water 18 mω cm was used for the preparation of solutions 2 2 stock solutions different concentrations of as3 standard solutions were prepared freshly using as2o3 in 1m hcl three contaminated water samples were obtained one from river water and the other two from the industrial wastewater they were filtered and then centrifuged to remove unwanted substances like mud and big particles 2 3 synthesis of gold nanoparticles aunp au seed solution was prepared using sodium citrate as a capping and reducing agent 50 ml of 10 mm haucl4 was heated to 80 c as the temperature reached 80 c 1 sodium citrate was added dropwise the color instinctively changes to light red and then to bright red stirring was continued for 10 mins and then gold nanoparticles were stored in cool and dry conditions 2 4 preparation of working electrode the dimension of ito glass slides was 0 8 cm 0 8 cm for cleaning purposes ito glass slides were washed with a mild detergent solution followed by acetone ethanol and distilled water the cleaned and dried substrate was then hydrolysed by soaking in 10 hcl solution for 10 min which was followed by annealing at 450 c for 6h the activated glass slides were then functionalized by treating with 30 mm aptms solution in methanol for 1 h followed by heating at 100 c for 2h to prepare aptms ito the aptms ito substrate was immersed in the au seed solution auseed for 20 min to construct auseed aptms ito further auseed aptms ito substrate was dipped in a 30 mm solution of dth prepared in methanol for 2h to obtain dth auseed aptms ito surface subsequently the dth auseed aptms ito substrate was then again immersed in the auseed solution for 20 min to obtain aunis dth auseed aptms ito aunis nano island surface finally the surface aunis dth auseed aptms ito was kept immersed in 4 mm solution of dtt for 24 h to prepare dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito sensor electrode the concentration of dth 30 mm and time for the growth of nano island 20 min were optimized by using varying concentration 10 40 mm and time for nano island 10 25 min as shown in supplementary fig s1 the active surface area of the electrode was calculated by the randles sevcik equation 1 ip 2 69 105ad1 2 n2 3 ν1 2 c where a is the active surface area of the dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode c is the concentration of the redox probe ν is the scan rate d is the diffusion coefficient and n is the number of electrons exchanged during the reaction to avoid interference from any physically adsorbed impurity the electrodes were washed with distilled water following each step 2 5 arsenic sensing electrochemical sensing of as3 was carried out by immersing the electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito hence prepared in 1m hcl solution containing varying concentrations of as3 ions a reducing potential of 0 35v was applied for 150s following which cyclic voltammetry studies 25 s each were made the cv studies were conducted while using the hence fabricated dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode as the working electrode platinum wire pt as the counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox species 2 6 interference with other bimetallic ions and contaminated water testing dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode was tested in presence of interfering ions like hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 while 10 mm of 2 4 pyridine dicarboxylic acid pdca was used as a blocking agent to obstruct the interference from the above mentioned metal ions a mixture of 1 1 w v ratio of as to other ions was used three contaminated water samples were collected from the yamuna river and two industrial effluents the water samples were filtered and further centrifuged twice at 5000 rpm for 5 min the cleaned samples were then used for testing 2 7 h bonding evaluation stock solutions of 4 mm dtt and auseed dtt as3 were prepared in di water the solutions were further serially diluted 5 times the stock solution and the dilutions were subjected to ftir to spot the change in oh stretching peak 2 8 stability studies to analyze the stability 30 sets of each aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes were fabricated and stored at 4 c the cyclic voltammetric response of the fabricated electrodes was recorded at an interval of 3 days in 25 ml pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 0 9 nacl containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 signal variation in current is calculated by the formula 2 i e i a i d i a 100 ie percentage variation in current ia actual current id detected current 2 9 instrumentation cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out with autolab potentiostat galvanostat model aut83945 pgstat302n using the conventional three electrode system modified ito was used as the working electrode platinum wire pt as the auxiliary electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 0 9 nacl containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox mediator the surface morphology was studied by scanning electron microscope fesem mira ii lmh and atomic force microscope afm ndmt uv visible spectra were measured using the hitachi u3300 spectrophotometer ftir spectra were obtained using thermo fisher scientific instrument and raman spectroscopy was carried out using raman microscope renishaw uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of materials the fabricated sensor electrode was based on the ito substrate due to high conductivity and robustness favoring subsequent modification bifunctional linker molecule aptms was used as a binder for the immobilization of gold seed monolayer onto ito the morphology of the gold nano island depends on the coverage of colloidal gold seed nanoparticles au nanostructures were grown as a seed layer and subsequent growth of nano island enhanced the ion transfer by increasing the active surface area of the electrode dth allows the fabrication of au bilayer as it is difficult to improve the coverage of the electrode using a single seed layer dtt was used for sensing due to the strong as s bond and its free hydroxyl group helps in capturing the as3 forming a network cage like structure the capability of dtt in capturing as3 is proven for colorimetric sensing 3 2 material characterisation 3 2 1 fesem and afm studies the surface of the modified electrode was imaged using fesem and afm during the stage of construction uneven distribution and scattered arrangement of auseed occurs over hydrolysed ito substrate as seen in fesem and afm fig 1 a and c the sem image for aunis dth auseed aptms ito shows a relatively larger size and high density of au seed bilayer fig 1b and d which is referred to as gold nano islands aunis it is quite difficult to improve the surface coverage of the monolayer assembly by altering the concentration and deposition time of au seeds oyama 2015 thus the preferred method is to design a bilayer assembly surface by insertion of a dithiol the height of the electrode after deposition of au seed and aunis for auseed aptms ito and aunis dth auseed aptms ito is 28 nm and 40 nm respectively 3 2 2 uv visible spectroscopy the results of uv visible spectroscopy studies are following the fesem and afm results as explained by fig 2 a the absorption spectra for auseed aptms ito substrate exhibits a maxima at 512 nm fig 2a i while it shifts to 533 nm along with a significant increase in the absorption intensity for aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 2a ii this change can be attributed to the increase in the number and size of nanostructured aunis on the dth auseed aptms ito substrate during the formation of aunis freshly prepared au seed can also attach onto bare ito surface or to the previously attached au seed through au s linkage via dithiol thus enhancing the density or dimension of nanostructured au and hence showing the red shift 3 2 3 ftir studies ftir of the electrode surface was performed at different stages of the functionalization fig 2b displays the ftir spectra of i dth auseed aptms ito surface ii dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito the presence of c s bond is evident in both dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dth auseed aptms ito at 652 cm 1 and 631 cm 1 respectively the spectrum of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito in fig 2b ii shows a sharp strong peak at 1020 cm 1 and a weak peak at 1110 cm 1 respectively which are attributable to c o stretching the 1430 cm 1 band in dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito spectrum can be due to ch2 bending finally the oh stretching is observed at 3320 cm 1 in both the spectra this confirms the presence of characteristics functional groups in the dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes for as3 detection 3 2 4 raman studies raman spectroscopy of the surface dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes has been performed at three different functionalization stages while designing the electrode i e dth auseed aptms ito dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito and aptms ito electrodes fig 2c and d in case of thiol terminated layers i e dth auseed aptms ito fig 2c i and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 2c ii appearance of ν c s bands in the region 600 800 cm 1 ν c c bands around 1000 1150 cm 1 region δ c h bands in region higher than 1200 cm 1 ν c o bands in the region around 1265 cm 1 and ν s h around 2400 cm 1 morel et al 2010 undoubtedly proves successful surface modification at various stages of fabrication of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes the raman spectra for aptms spectra 2d shows peaks at 1094 1119 cm 1 1215 cm 1 1286 cm 1 and 1428 cm 1 and these bands are identified for ν si c c ν c c δ c h ν c o and δ si ch2 respectively sun et al 2016 the peak at 1592 cm 1 is ascribed to the presence of δ nh2 kim et al 2015 thus raman study confirms the effective functionalization of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes at different stages 3 2 5 cyclic voltammetry studies cv was performed to understand the electrochemical properties of the chemicals used and their cumulative effect on the final design dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 3 the cv studies have been performed following each modification step in a three electrode cell while pt wire acts as the counter electrode saturated ag agcl works as the reference electrode and the electrode under study as the working electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox species the cv was carried out from 0 3 v to 0 8 v at a scan rate of 0 1 vs 1 clear redox signals are evident from all the samples irrespective of the modifications the bare ito being electrically conductive shows a peak current intensity of 1 57x 10 4 a the presence of aptms on the ito surface for the aptms ito electrode offers a negligible barrier to the flow of electrons between the substrate and the electrolyte rather the peak current shows a slight increase to 1 90 x 10 4 a due to the presence of nh2 functional group oyama et al 2009 the peak separation i e epc epa decreases from 102 54 mv to 85 45 mv in case of aptms ito as compared to bare ito confirming better reversibility in the latter case the peak current ratio ipa ipc is greater than 1 in both cases which indicates the same with the attachment of au seeds the current increases drastically to 3 09 10 4 a for auseed aptms ito and the peak separation decreased to 2 4 mv on account of the high conductivity offered by auseed cho et al 2012 interestingly the presence of organic groups such as dth dodecanedithiol hinders the electron transfer between the electrolyte and dth auseed aptms ito electrode thus negatively affecting the quasi reversible characteristics of the cell ballarin et al 2008 as a consequence the peak current intensity slips down to 3 03 x 10 4 a while the peak separation increases to 19 53 mv however with the formation of aunis there is a drastic increase in the number of nanostructured au attached to the electrode surface leading to a remarkable increase in peak current value 4 84 10 4 a the active surface area of the dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode is 0 59 cm2 as calculated using eq 1 but at the same time no significant change in the peak separation is observed due to the subsequent layering the final functionalization of aunis with dtt results for the final electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito in a relatively distorted pattern of redox peaks and a lower current intensity 4 46 x10 4 a since the ligand used and fe cn 6 3 4 are negatively charged it resulting to electron charge repulsion and a poor electron transfer as compared to aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode zhao et al 2005 3 2 6 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy apart from cv studies the charge transfer properties of electrode solution interfaces during the fabrication of electrodes were studied through eis the imaginary impedance vs real impedance was plotted in the nyquist plot of impedance spectra the observed semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to the electron transfer limited process the value of electron transfer resistance rct is dependent on the dielectric and insulating features of the medium fig 3b displays the charge transfer resistance during the fabrication process of the electrode the bare ito being electrically conductive shows a lower value of rct 3 5kω the presence of aptms on the ito surface for the aptms ito electrode due to the presence of conductive functional groups present in the structure shows a further decrease in rct 2 3 kω further as au seeds were attached over the surface the resistance of the electrode decreases drastically 1 4 kω for auseed aptms ito interestingly the presence of organic groups such as dth restricts the electron transfer of electron through the surface increasing the rct value 2 85kω however with the formation of aunis there is a drastic increase in the number of nanostructured au attached to the electrode surface leading to a remarkable decrease in resistance 1 1kω the functionalization of dtt to fabricate the sensor electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito leads to a sharp increase in rct 3 75 kω due to poor ion conduction of dtt monolayer self assembled on aunis the results of cv and eis complement each other confirming the successful electrode fabrication fig 3c shows the scheme illustrating the stages of electrode fabrication 3 3 sensing of as3 ions prior to as3 sensing the concentration of dtt 4 mm and reduction time 150 s of as3 to as0 were optimized as presented in supplementary figs s2 a b the developed dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode was tested against different concentrations of arsenic as3 on the application of 0 35 v on to proposed electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito after interacting with as3 in solution as3 trapped by dtt of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode is reduced to as0 and subjected to cv measurement in a three electrode cell using platinum wire pt as counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox probe fig 4a shows the cv graph of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito with varying concentrations of as3 it is found that the developed electrode can sense quantitatively as3 linearly from 0 1 ppb to 100 ppb an increase in peak current is observed with increasing concentration of as3 within the reported range derived from the increased concentration of metallic as0 fig 4b and c shows the calibration curve with detection ranges from 0 1 to1 ppb 1to100 ppb respectively with good linearity r2 0 97 with sensitivity 4 4 ma μg 1 l cm 2 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of the developed sensor electrode are 0 085 ppb and 0 156 ppb which are much lower than the permissible limit 10 ppb established internationally table 2 compares the developed sensor with few previously reported ones in the literature 3 4 sensing mechanism the sensing mechanism involved in the process depends upon the chelating interaction of as3 with the recognizing thiol monolayer dtt agent dtt has two sh groups to provide a strong interface between gold nano island and as3 ions among these two sh groups one can form au s bond with the surface of the sensing electrode and the other can form an as s bond with the as3 in the water previously confirmed by mass spectroscopy shen et al 2013 thevis et al 2003 and surface plasmon resonance kre et al 2001 on the application of constant potential 0 35 v for 150 s the as3 ions captured by dtt via as s bond were then reduced to elemental as0 which got deposited onto the layer of aunis to produce enhanced current response at the same time oh groups formed a network through intermolecular h bonding between neighbouring dtt molecules forming cage like structure as depicted by the scheme fig 5 c reinforcing capturing of as3 ions by dtt molecules the presence of intermolecular h bonding is confirmed by ftir spectroscopy as seen in fig 5a and b with serial dilution the oh stretching peak shifts from 3328 cm 1 3285 cm 1 in the case of dtt and 3597 cm 1 to 3436 cm 1 in the case of au dtt as3 the peak shift of oh stretching in both dtt and au dtt as 3 confirms the presence of h bonding this selective detection of as3 is attributed to the network structure formed by dtt due to h bonding a relatively amplified peak current was noted with increasing the concentration of as3 this behavior can be attributed to the fact that metallic deposition is responsible for greater electron transfer a similar detection mechanism was well documented for sam earlier kalluri et al 2009 dom 2015 since the proposed approach employs the use of nanoparticles having a larger surface area and a wider range of detection was obtained with a simpler electrode design 3 5 interference studies 3 5 1 interference due to other bivalent and trivalent cations the selectivity of the developed electrochemical sensor towards as3 was studied in presence of some commonly found bivalent as well as trivalent heavy metal ions like hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 for this purpose pdca has been used to sequester the interfering ions cv studies were performed with the chosen concentration of as3 in presence of the interfering ions before and after the addition of pdca in absence of sequestering agent hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 when present along with as3 recorded peak current intensity as 0 48 ma 0 28 m and 0 28 ma 0 295 ma respectively cr3 does not influence the selective sensing of as3 even in absence of pdca as it does not form complex with dtt as reported earlier our results indicate a stronger affinity of dtt towards hg2 as compared to other heavy metal ions lai et al 2016 while with the use of a sequestering agent the peak current for all these interfering ions showed a similar value as that of the only as3 in the presence of pdca i e 0 25 ma this implies that the sequestering agent can form strong complexes with the interfering ions thus suppressing their effect while allowing sensing of arsenic to occur successfully as3 is highly acidic having a pka value of 2 2 while hg2 is having a pka value of 20 2 due to this nature pdca pka 2 59 predicted forms a strong acid base complex with hg2 and other bimetallic ions improving the selectivity of the sensor for arsenic 3 5 2 testing of contaminated water samples the cv graph of arsenic detection in contaminated water samples is as shown in fig 6 b comparing the results with the calibration curves the estimated 50 8 ppb and 10 4 ppb of as3 are present in the samples reported in table 1 the actual results may vary due to the presence of other ions or organic molecules in the water in sample b due to the presence of a high amount of biowaste no current was observed to remove the interference pdca was used in contaminated water samples the developed electrode can indicate the presence of inorganic substances and bio waste the proposed electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito for as3 detection can be extended to detect as5 alone or mixture of as3 and as5 for the detection of as5 the sample can be reduced to as3 using a reducing agent na2so3 and can be detected further 3 6 stability studies fig 6c d shows the stability of fabricated aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes respectively the developed sensor dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito is stable for 28 days signal variation of 15 is obtained after 28 days assessment period aunis dth auseed aptms ito is stable for 30 days and a signal variation of 12 was observed after 25 days thus the developed electrode is stable for up to 28 days few unique features of the proposed electrodes are observed while comparing with the reported literature table 2 the comparative analysis describes the developed dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito sensor shows that none of the previously reported sensors has such a broad detection range 0 1ppb to100 ppb with lower lod 0 085 ppb the interference studies suggested the specificity of the sensor while other reported sensors were interfered by other cationic ions like cu2 the fabricated sensor electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito is highly selective in the presence pdca as sequestering agent the stability studies of other nanomaterial modified electrodes reported earlier were less than 15 days however the prepared dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito shows remarkable stability for 28 days the proposed sensor surely projects a promising potential as a smart handheld sensor for the rapid detection of arsenic 4 conclusion gold nano island aunis is chemically deposited on the ito surface without any template which is functionalized with dtt to prepare electrochemical sensor dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito for ultra low detection of as3 in contaminated water a wide sensing range of 0 1to100 ppb with lod of 0 085 ppb was noted the strong arrest of as3 onto the electrode surface is achieved via dtt which strongly binds with as3 via as s a unique study of the cage like network structure formed due to intermolecular h bonding between dtt molecules through oh groups was proven by ftir analysis the interface modification by aunis and caged network by dtt are accountable for wide linear range and specific detection of as3 though the presence of biowaste in the real sample might hamper its sensitivity in presence of pdca the sensors capture selectively as3 ion in a mixture of hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 ions a simple and unique strategy for developing a uniform coating of aunis on the ito surface with tuneable electrochemistry for universal application of electrochemical sensing bed shows a great promise for its commercial application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

guideline for as in drinking water 10 ppb ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2020 therefore sensitive and reliable detection of minute traces of arsenic is a crucial requirement aragay and merkoc

2014 have been previously reported to sense as since these techniques are time consuming and require sophisticated instruments these are less suitable for on field testing of real samples therefore efforts are being made in recent years to design portable reliable and sensitive techniques of detection scientists have been increasingly focussing on the use of nanomaterials for sensing purpose on account of their excellent optical electronic and magnetic properties zhang and chen 2019 pettinato et al 2015 chakraborty and raj 2007 2010 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 gold nanoparticles aunps are one such material that exhibits excellent optical and electronic properties and also offers a scope for functionalization via strong bonding with thiols amino acids etc jana et al 2002 sugunan et al have utilized the chelating properties of chitosan capped aunps to effectively sense the presence of heavy metal ions like zn2 and cu2 sugunan et al 2005 kalluri et al have proposed the possibility of selectively sensing traces of as by the calorimetric assay the proposed mechanism involves the formation of as o and as s bonds leading to aggregation of the modified aunps and subsequent change in the spectroscopy signals kalluri et al 2009 since the calorimetric detection technique does not work successfully for sensing of lower concentrations of as electrochemical methods of detection have also been studied extensively rahman et al 2018 2019 rahman et al have used a au like polycrystalline electrode to reach a lod of 0 28 ppb rahman et al 2010 a lod of 5 ppt has been reported by

lod of 0 5 ppb with the proposed mechanism links 2011 r domínguez gonzález et al have reported a highly sensitive and selective method for electrochemical detection of as based on as o and as s bonding dom 2015 the present work reports the fabrication of a portable cost effective and user friendly approach for highly selective and sensitive detection of as3 while using dth 1 12 dodecane thiol 1 4 dithiothreitol dtt functionalized gold nano islands indium doped tin oxide ito glass electrode was modified with aptms for chemisorption of gold nano islands aunis a bilayer assembly of au seed auseed was obtained by insertion of a di thiol 1 12 dodecanedithiol dth in between two nano gold seed layers resulting in the formation of nano islands aunis on the surface as compared to colloidal monolayers metal aunis are directly grafted on ito substrate and are easy to fabricate they possess advantages over the colloidal films such as tunable density of islands controlled deposition of islands with no agglomeration functionalized by dth high current density and high signal to noise ratio snr hence show improved sensing aunis were further functionalized with dtt dtt aptms au which captures as s bond and cage formation by intermolecular hydrogen bonding the captured as3 was reduced to as0 and detected by voltammetry to enhance the selectivity of the sensor pdca 2 4 pyridinedicarboxylic acid was used as a sequestering agent thus reducing the interference due to other bivalent heavy metal ligands the sensor was tested with contaminated water samples to confirm the practical utility 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents arsenic trioxide as2o3 aurochloric acid haucl4 sodium citrate 3 aminopropyl tri methoxy silane aptms 1 12 dodecanedithiol dth 1 4 dithiothreitol dtt 2 4 pyridinedicarboxylic acid pdca were purchased from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl and methanol were purchased from merck and co usa deionized water 18 mω cm was used for the preparation of solutions 2 2 stock solutions different concentrations of as3 standard solutions were prepared freshly using as2o3 in 1m hcl three contaminated water samples were obtained one from river water and the other two from the industrial wastewater they were filtered and then centrifuged to remove unwanted substances like mud and big particles 2 3 synthesis of gold nanoparticles aunp au seed solution was prepared using sodium citrate as a capping and reducing agent 50 ml of 10 mm haucl4 was heated to 80 c as the temperature reached 80 c 1 sodium citrate was added dropwise the color instinctively changes to light red and then to bright red stirring was continued for 10 mins and then gold nanoparticles were stored in cool and dry conditions 2 4 preparation of working electrode the dimension of ito glass slides was 0 8 cm 0 8 cm for cleaning purposes ito glass slides were washed with a mild detergent solution followed by acetone ethanol and distilled water the cleaned and dried substrate was then hydrolysed by soaking in 10 hcl solution for 10 min which was followed by annealing at 450 c for 6h the activated glass slides were then functionalized by treating with 30 mm aptms solution in methanol for 1 h followed by heating at 100 c for 2h to prepare aptms ito the aptms ito substrate was immersed in the au seed solution auseed for 20 min to construct auseed aptms ito further auseed aptms ito substrate was dipped in a 30 mm solution of dth prepared in methanol for 2h to obtain dth auseed aptms ito surface subsequently the dth auseed aptms ito substrate was then again immersed in the auseed solution for 20 min to obtain aunis dth auseed aptms ito aunis nano island surface finally the surface aunis dth auseed aptms ito was kept immersed in 4 mm solution of dtt for 24 h to prepare dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito sensor electrode the concentration of dth 30 mm and time for the growth of nano island 20 min were optimized by using varying concentration 10 40 mm and time for nano island 10 25 min as shown in supplementary fig s1 the active surface area of the electrode was calculated by the randles sevcik equation 1 ip 2 69 105ad1 2 n2 3 ν1 2 c where a is the active surface area of the dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode c is the concentration of the redox probe ν is the scan rate d is the diffusion coefficient and n is the number of electrons exchanged during the reaction to avoid interference from any physically adsorbed impurity the electrodes were washed with distilled water following each step 2 5 arsenic sensing electrochemical sensing of as3 was carried out by immersing the electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito hence prepared in 1m hcl solution containing varying concentrations of as3 ions a reducing potential of 0 35v was applied for 150s following which cyclic voltammetry studies 25 s each were made the cv studies were conducted while using the hence fabricated dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode as the working electrode platinum wire pt as the counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox species 2 6 interference with other bimetallic ions and contaminated water testing dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode was tested in presence of interfering ions like hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 while 10 mm of 2 4 pyridine dicarboxylic acid pdca was used as a blocking agent to obstruct the interference from the above mentioned metal ions a mixture of 1 1 w v ratio of as to other ions was used three contaminated water samples were collected from the yamuna river and two industrial effluents the water samples were filtered and further centrifuged twice at 5000 rpm for 5 min the cleaned samples were then used for testing 2 7 h bonding evaluation stock solutions of 4 mm dtt and auseed dtt as3 were prepared in di water the solutions were further serially diluted 5 times the stock solution and the dilutions were subjected to ftir to spot the change in oh stretching peak 2 8 stability studies to analyze the stability 30 sets of each aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes were fabricated and stored at 4 c the cyclic voltammetric response of the fabricated electrodes was recorded at an interval of 3 days in 25 ml pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 0 9 nacl containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 signal variation in current is calculated by the formula 2 i e i a i d i a 100 ie percentage variation in current ia actual current id detected current 2 9 instrumentation cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out with autolab potentiostat galvanostat model aut83945 pgstat302n using the conventional three electrode system modified ito was used as the working electrode platinum wire pt as the auxiliary electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 0 9 nacl containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox mediator the surface morphology was studied by scanning electron microscope fesem mira ii lmh and atomic force microscope afm ndmt uv visible spectra were measured using the hitachi u3300 spectrophotometer ftir spectra were obtained using thermo fisher scientific instrument and raman spectroscopy was carried out using raman microscope renishaw uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of materials the fabricated sensor electrode was based on the ito substrate due to high conductivity and robustness favoring subsequent modification bifunctional linker molecule aptms was used as a binder for the immobilization of gold seed monolayer onto ito the morphology of the gold nano island depends on the coverage of colloidal gold seed nanoparticles au nanostructures were grown as a seed layer and subsequent growth of nano island enhanced the ion transfer by increasing the active surface area of the electrode dth allows the fabrication of au bilayer as it is difficult to improve the coverage of the electrode using a single seed layer dtt was used for sensing due to the strong as s bond and its free hydroxyl group helps in capturing the as3 forming a network cage like structure the capability of dtt in capturing as3 is proven for colorimetric sensing 3 2 material characterisation 3 2 1 fesem and afm studies the surface of the modified electrode was imaged using fesem and afm during the stage of construction uneven distribution and scattered arrangement of auseed occurs over hydrolysed ito substrate as seen in fesem and afm fig 1 a and c the sem image for aunis dth auseed aptms ito shows a relatively larger size and high density of au seed bilayer fig 1b and d which is referred to as gold nano islands aunis it is quite difficult to improve the surface coverage of the monolayer assembly by altering the concentration and deposition time of au seeds oyama 2015 thus the preferred method is to design a bilayer assembly surface by insertion of a dithiol the height of the electrode after deposition of au seed and aunis for auseed aptms ito and aunis dth auseed aptms ito is 28 nm and 40 nm respectively 3 2 2 uv visible spectroscopy the results of uv visible spectroscopy studies are following the fesem and afm results as explained by fig 2 a the absorption spectra for auseed aptms ito substrate exhibits a maxima at 512 nm fig 2a i while it shifts to 533 nm along with a significant increase in the absorption intensity for aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 2a ii this change can be attributed to the increase in the number and size of nanostructured aunis on the dth auseed aptms ito substrate during the formation of aunis freshly prepared au seed can also attach onto bare ito surface or to the previously attached au seed through au s linkage via dithiol thus enhancing the density or dimension of nanostructured au and hence showing the red shift 3 2 3 ftir studies ftir of the electrode surface was performed at different stages of the functionalization fig 2b displays the ftir spectra of i dth auseed aptms ito surface ii dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito the presence of c s bond is evident in both dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dth auseed aptms ito at 652 cm 1 and 631 cm 1 respectively the spectrum of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito in fig 2b ii shows a sharp strong peak at 1020 cm 1 and a weak peak at 1110 cm 1 respectively which are attributable to c o stretching the 1430 cm 1 band in dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito spectrum can be due to ch2 bending finally the oh stretching is observed at 3320 cm 1 in both the spectra this confirms the presence of characteristics functional groups in the dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes for as3 detection 3 2 4 raman studies raman spectroscopy of the surface dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes has been performed at three different functionalization stages while designing the electrode i e dth auseed aptms ito dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito and aptms ito electrodes fig 2c and d in case of thiol terminated layers i e dth auseed aptms ito fig 2c i and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 2c ii appearance of ν c s bands in the region 600 800 cm 1 ν c c bands around 1000 1150 cm 1 region δ c h bands in region higher than 1200 cm 1 ν c o bands in the region around 1265 cm 1 and ν s h around 2400 cm 1 morel et al 2010 undoubtedly proves successful surface modification at various stages of fabrication of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes the raman spectra for aptms spectra 2d shows peaks at 1094 1119 cm 1 1215 cm 1 1286 cm 1 and 1428 cm 1 and these bands are identified for ν si c c ν c c δ c h ν c o and δ si ch2 respectively sun et al 2016 the peak at 1592 cm 1 is ascribed to the presence of δ nh2 kim et al 2015 thus raman study confirms the effective functionalization of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes at different stages 3 2 5 cyclic voltammetry studies cv was performed to understand the electrochemical properties of the chemicals used and their cumulative effect on the final design dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito fig 3 the cv studies have been performed following each modification step in a three electrode cell while pt wire acts as the counter electrode saturated ag agcl works as the reference electrode and the electrode under study as the working electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox species the cv was carried out from 0 3 v to 0 8 v at a scan rate of 0 1 vs 1 clear redox signals are evident from all the samples irrespective of the modifications the bare ito being electrically conductive shows a peak current intensity of 1 57x 10 4 a the presence of aptms on the ito surface for the aptms ito electrode offers a negligible barrier to the flow of electrons between the substrate and the electrolyte rather the peak current shows a slight increase to 1 90 x 10 4 a due to the presence of nh2 functional group oyama et al 2009 the peak separation i e epc epa decreases from 102 54 mv to 85 45 mv in case of aptms ito as compared to bare ito confirming better reversibility in the latter case the peak current ratio ipa ipc is greater than 1 in both cases which indicates the same with the attachment of au seeds the current increases drastically to 3 09 10 4 a for auseed aptms ito and the peak separation decreased to 2 4 mv on account of the high conductivity offered by auseed cho et al 2012 interestingly the presence of organic groups such as dth dodecanedithiol hinders the electron transfer between the electrolyte and dth auseed aptms ito electrode thus negatively affecting the quasi reversible characteristics of the cell ballarin et al 2008 as a consequence the peak current intensity slips down to 3 03 x 10 4 a while the peak separation increases to 19 53 mv however with the formation of aunis there is a drastic increase in the number of nanostructured au attached to the electrode surface leading to a remarkable increase in peak current value 4 84 10 4 a the active surface area of the dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode is 0 59 cm2 as calculated using eq 1 but at the same time no significant change in the peak separation is observed due to the subsequent layering the final functionalization of aunis with dtt results for the final electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito in a relatively distorted pattern of redox peaks and a lower current intensity 4 46 x10 4 a since the ligand used and fe cn 6 3 4 are negatively charged it resulting to electron charge repulsion and a poor electron transfer as compared to aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode zhao et al 2005 3 2 6 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy apart from cv studies the charge transfer properties of electrode solution interfaces during the fabrication of electrodes were studied through eis the imaginary impedance vs real impedance was plotted in the nyquist plot of impedance spectra the observed semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to the electron transfer limited process the value of electron transfer resistance rct is dependent on the dielectric and insulating features of the medium fig 3b displays the charge transfer resistance during the fabrication process of the electrode the bare ito being electrically conductive shows a lower value of rct 3 5kω the presence of aptms on the ito surface for the aptms ito electrode due to the presence of conductive functional groups present in the structure shows a further decrease in rct 2 3 kω further as au seeds were attached over the surface the resistance of the electrode decreases drastically 1 4 kω for auseed aptms ito interestingly the presence of organic groups such as dth restricts the electron transfer of electron through the surface increasing the rct value 2 85kω however with the formation of aunis there is a drastic increase in the number of nanostructured au attached to the electrode surface leading to a remarkable decrease in resistance 1 1kω the functionalization of dtt to fabricate the sensor electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito leads to a sharp increase in rct 3 75 kω due to poor ion conduction of dtt monolayer self assembled on aunis the results of cv and eis complement each other confirming the successful electrode fabrication fig 3c shows the scheme illustrating the stages of electrode fabrication 3 3 sensing of as3 ions prior to as3 sensing the concentration of dtt 4 mm and reduction time 150 s of as3 to as0 were optimized as presented in supplementary figs s2 a b the developed dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode was tested against different concentrations of arsenic as3 on the application of 0 35 v on to proposed electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito after interacting with as3 in solution as3 trapped by dtt of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrode is reduced to as0 and subjected to cv measurement in a three electrode cell using platinum wire pt as counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as the reference electrode in pbs 50 mm 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 containing 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 as a redox probe fig 4a shows the cv graph of dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito with varying concentrations of as3 it is found that the developed electrode can sense quantitatively as3 linearly from 0 1 ppb to 100 ppb an increase in peak current is observed with increasing concentration of as3 within the reported range derived from the increased concentration of metallic as0 fig 4b and c shows the calibration curve with detection ranges from 0 1 to1 ppb 1to100 ppb respectively with good linearity r2 0 97 with sensitivity 4 4 ma μg 1 l cm 2 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of the developed sensor electrode are 0 085 ppb and 0 156 ppb which are much lower than the permissible limit 10 ppb established internationally table 2 compares the developed sensor with few previously reported ones in the literature 3 4 sensing mechanism the sensing mechanism involved in the process depends upon the chelating interaction of as3 with the recognizing thiol monolayer dtt agent dtt has two sh groups to provide a strong interface between gold nano island and as3 ions among these two sh groups one can form au s bond with the surface of the sensing electrode and the other can form an as s bond with the as3 in the water previously confirmed by mass spectroscopy shen et al 2013 thevis et al 2003 and surface plasmon resonance kre et al 2001 on the application of constant potential 0 35 v for 150 s the as3 ions captured by dtt via as s bond were then reduced to elemental as0 which got deposited onto the layer of aunis to produce enhanced current response at the same time oh groups formed a network through intermolecular h bonding between neighbouring dtt molecules forming cage like structure as depicted by the scheme fig 5 c reinforcing capturing of as3 ions by dtt molecules the presence of intermolecular h bonding is confirmed by ftir spectroscopy as seen in fig 5a and b with serial dilution the oh stretching peak shifts from 3328 cm 1 3285 cm 1 in the case of dtt and 3597 cm 1 to 3436 cm 1 in the case of au dtt as3 the peak shift of oh stretching in both dtt and au dtt as 3 confirms the presence of h bonding this selective detection of as3 is attributed to the network structure formed by dtt due to h bonding a relatively amplified peak current was noted with increasing the concentration of as3 this behavior can be attributed to the fact that metallic deposition is responsible for greater electron transfer a similar detection mechanism was well documented for sam earlier kalluri et al 2009 dom 2015 since the proposed approach employs the use of nanoparticles having a larger surface area and a wider range of detection was obtained with a simpler electrode design 3 5 interference studies 3 5 1 interference due to other bivalent and trivalent cations the selectivity of the developed electrochemical sensor towards as3 was studied in presence of some commonly found bivalent as well as trivalent heavy metal ions like hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 for this purpose pdca has been used to sequester the interfering ions cv studies were performed with the chosen concentration of as3 in presence of the interfering ions before and after the addition of pdca in absence of sequestering agent hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 when present along with as3 recorded peak current intensity as 0 48 ma 0 28 m and 0 28 ma 0 295 ma respectively cr3 does not influence the selective sensing of as3 even in absence of pdca as it does not form complex with dtt as reported earlier our results indicate a stronger affinity of dtt towards hg2 as compared to other heavy metal ions lai et al 2016 while with the use of a sequestering agent the peak current for all these interfering ions showed a similar value as that of the only as3 in the presence of pdca i e 0 25 ma this implies that the sequestering agent can form strong complexes with the interfering ions thus suppressing their effect while allowing sensing of arsenic to occur successfully as3 is highly acidic having a pka value of 2 2 while hg2 is having a pka value of 20 2 due to this nature pdca pka 2 59 predicted forms a strong acid base complex with hg2 and other bimetallic ions improving the selectivity of the sensor for arsenic 3 5 2 testing of contaminated water samples the cv graph of arsenic detection in contaminated water samples is as shown in fig 6 b comparing the results with the calibration curves the estimated 50 8 ppb and 10 4 ppb of as3 are present in the samples reported in table 1 the actual results may vary due to the presence of other ions or organic molecules in the water in sample b due to the presence of a high amount of biowaste no current was observed to remove the interference pdca was used in contaminated water samples the developed electrode can indicate the presence of inorganic substances and bio waste the proposed electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito for as3 detection can be extended to detect as5 alone or mixture of as3 and as5 for the detection of as5 the sample can be reduced to as3 using a reducing agent na2so3 and can be detected further 3 6 stability studies fig 6c d shows the stability of fabricated aunis dth auseed aptms ito and dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito electrodes respectively the developed sensor dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito is stable for 28 days signal variation of 15 is obtained after 28 days assessment period aunis dth auseed aptms ito is stable for 30 days and a signal variation of 12 was observed after 25 days thus the developed electrode is stable for up to 28 days few unique features of the proposed electrodes are observed while comparing with the reported literature table 2 the comparative analysis describes the developed dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito sensor shows that none of the previously reported sensors has such a broad detection range 0 1ppb to100 ppb with lower lod 0 085 ppb the interference studies suggested the specificity of the sensor while other reported sensors were interfered by other cationic ions like cu2 the fabricated sensor electrode dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito is highly selective in the presence pdca as sequestering agent the stability studies of other nanomaterial modified electrodes reported earlier were less than 15 days however the prepared dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito shows remarkable stability for 28 days the proposed sensor surely projects a promising potential as a smart handheld sensor for the rapid detection of arsenic 4 conclusion gold nano island aunis is chemically deposited on the ito surface without any template which is functionalized with dtt to prepare electrochemical sensor dtt aunis dth auseed aptms ito for ultra low detection of as3 in contaminated water a wide sensing range of 0 1to100 ppb with lod of 0 085 ppb was noted the strong arrest of as3 onto the electrode surface is achieved via dtt which strongly binds with as3 via as s a unique study of the cage like network structure formed due to intermolecular h bonding between dtt molecules through oh groups was proven by ftir analysis the interface modification by aunis and caged network by dtt are accountable for wide linear range and specific detection of as3 though the presence of biowaste in the real sample might hamper its sensitivity in presence of pdca the sensors capture selectively as3 ion in a mixture of hg2 pb2 ni2 and cr3 ions a simple and unique strategy for developing a uniform coating of aunis on the ito surface with tuneable electrochemistry for universal application of electrochemical sensing bed shows a great promise for its commercial application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

11988,a lithostratigraphy analysis commonly adopted for subsurface structures exploration in oil prospecting is deployed for groundwater prognosis due to the need to address the prevailing water shortage in this study the lithology characterization was based on a clustered approach of geomagnetic analysis geomorphometric analysis and sequence stratigraphy correlation across the buffalo catchment eastern cape south africa the result showed the existence of a spatial correlation between the tectonic stress field and the surficial lineaments similarly a significant azimuthal correlation wnw ese was found between surficial lineaments 203 m 6249 m subsurface lineaments and the neotectonic structures the depth slicing analysis enables the estimation of the depth of the tectonic stress field at 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km in the subsurface the sequence stratigraphy correlation based on borehole lithology data enables the identification of the fault system at the contact zones heterolithic bedding and the characterization of the hydrostratigraphic domain of the catchment the study shows that buffalo hydrostratigraphic structures are dominated by fracture networks whereby the shallow groundwater resources are possibly hosted by the dolerite host rock contact zones in the north of the buffalo catchment specific recommendations concerning groundwater management are made to water and environment stakeholders considering the vulnerability of the shallow groundwater system to pollution in the permeable contact zones of dolerite host rock the study also recommends the adaptation of surficial lineaments as a morpho tectonic aid and a hydrostratigraphic analysis tool the clustered approach demonstrated in this study has important prospects for groundwater exploration in environments with similar geology graphical abstract image 1 keywords lithostratigraphic analysis hydrostratigraphic model macrostructures aeromagnetic analysis tectonic lines karoo supergroup 1 introduction the understanding of geologic complexity has provided remarkable information on the variability of hydraulic properties and the zones of effective permeability that are significant to the flow of fluid in the subsurface at a regional scale fluid flow is channelled through large scale structures of hydrostratigraphic units with significant permeability for example ingebritsen and manning 2003 demonstrated that the transmission of the metamorphic fluid system and the continental crust degasification were controlled by large scale crustal permeability at the continental margin bense and van balen 2003 illustrated the effects of large scale fault zones on the regional groundwater flux in the roer valley rift system marker et al 2015 presented a hydrostratigraphic cluster model based on sequential hydro geophysical inversion for incorporating airborne electromagnetic data into the hydrological modeling process christensen et al 2017 demonstrated a three dimensional groundwater model using airborne electromagnetic data and lithology data the geometry of geological structures was processed with the aid of the bayesian geostatistical approach likewise this study presents a clustered approach of geomagnetic analysis and lineament detection methods for the assessment of geologic structures in a complex geologic environment as a contribution to groundwater prospecting the major target zones in regional groundwater exploration are often areas of secondary porosity such as shear zones trenches elongated joints major faults and fractures generally referred to as natural lineaments singhal and gupta 2010 lineaments are tectonics structures developed by stress concentration or strains due to the initiation and evolution of rift and orogeny masoud and koike 2011 o leary et al 1976 opined that they are extractible features of the earth with linear or curvilinear orientations on weak points of the earth s surface they are often concentrated in areas with complex landforms galloway 2010 they stretch over a few hundred meters to several kilometers on the surface and in the subsurface lineament mapping has a long history wilson 1936 moody and hill 1956 o leary et al 1976 lineaments can be processed and extracted manually or automatically from remotely sensed images aeromagnetic data and seismic lines madi and zhao 2013 adiri et al 2017 baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 their application has gained wide recognition for groundwater prospecting nag 2005 for the study of tectonic evolution boutirame et al 2019 and mapping shear zones of ore mineralization eldosouky et al 2020 the precision of lineament detection depends on image enhancement tools such as the transformation computations the enhancement filters the algorithm efficiency and the image quality or the extent of distortion randomness in nature and electromagnetic radiation interfere with image quality by raising the inherent noise level and producing outlying frequencies morphological and tonal variation which accounts for the distortion in the quality of the image however enhancement filters such as convolution laplacian and sobel filters and principal component analysis serve as the tools for correcting the distortions sukumar et al 2014 for further improvement of the aeromagnetic and gravity signal transformation computation is applied to redefine the geophysical signal as a function with a finite length segment along a defined axis and for the alteration of the domain of the function for example fast fourier transform works by redefining the square and periodic domain of a magnetic and gravity body to the wavenumber domain baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 in south africa large scale geologic structures within the karoo supergroup have been explored for their groundwater resources and shale gas potential chevallier and woodford 1999 andreoli et al 2006 madi and zhao 2013 baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 the present study intends to present a holistic lithostratigraphy characterization that enables the delineation of groundwater capture zones in a complex environment the novelty of the study lies in the three dimensional characterization of lithology for visualization of hydrostratigraphic domains based on the clustered approach of geomagnetism geoinformatics and sequence stratigraphy correlation the following research questions were addressed 1 can the relationship between the swarms of lineaments and the tectonic stress field be deduced 2 do the geomorphic based surficial lineaments have a significant relationship with magnetic and neotectonic structures 3 how can a holistic three dimensional configuration of the basement be evaluated 4 what amount of groundwater information can be drawn from the inferred hydrostratigraphic units the clustered geophysics and geoinformatics methods present a catchment based geologic assessment that is scoped into the following objectives 1 to assess the geology of the environment through comparative analysis of geomagnetic imprint and sequence stratigraphy correlation 2 to explore the interrelationship between the surficial lineaments neotectonic structures the subsurface lineaments and the tectonic stress field and 3 to infer hydrostratigraphic controls on groundwater prospects of the study area 2 study area description the study was carried out in the buffalo headwaters catchment it is located within latitude 32 39 to 33 05 s and longitude 27 05 to 27 33 e covering approximately 1237 km2 fig 1 it is drained by dendritic foothill drainage comprising of six tributaries and the main stem of the buffalo river which is 46 km long it runs northwest southeast from an altitude of approximately 1338 m in the isidenge forest to the catchment mouth at laing dam at an altitude of 267 m above sea level owolabi et al 2020b the foot slope is covered by colluvium and alluvial fan of about 2 m to 8 m thick in the valley bottom the catchment soil maturity is quite low due to the shallowness of the underlying bedrock of clastic sedimentary materials and the crystalline basement owolabi et al 2020a 3 geological setting and stratigraphy the geology of buffalo catchment comprises tatarian red and grey mudstone of the balfour formation covering three quarters of the catchment the lower quarter of the catchment grades into the older kazarian silty sandstone dominated arenaceous strata of the middleton formation the two formations fall within the beaufort group adelaide subgroup of the karoo supergroup baiyegunhi et al 2017 the balfour formation has been noted to comprise five members namely oudeberg daggaboersnek barberskrans elandsberg and palingkloof members katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 these were grouped into arenaceous and argillaceous units the sedimentary facies of the catchment represent fluvio deltaic alluvial deposits with lateral and downstream accretion in their flood paleochannel wilson et al 2014 the catchment hydrostratigraphy is laterally bounded at the north and south by a jurassic dolerite outcrop and interspersed in various sections by jurassic dolerite dykes and sills lithostratigraphy of the beaufort group is presented in table 1 4 materials and methods an integrated geo structural framework of digital processing of aeromagnetic data and landsat 8 operational land imager oli was employed to characterize the hydrostratigraphy domain and to define the macroscale geologic structures of the geologic environment 4 1 geomagnetic analysis the aeromagnetic data of buffalo catchment was extracted from the regional aeromagnetic survey of eastern cape mapped by fugro airborne surveys for the council for geoscience the aeromagnetic data mapping was achieved with the aid of a proton procession magnetometer of 0 01 nt resolution the aeromagnetic scanner was flown at a constant height of 60 m in north south flight direction within a sampling line of 250 m using line spacing of 200 m 4 1 1 the reduced to pole mapping the aeromagnetic data was processed through linear and non linear filtering algorithms of the montaj magmap filtering system the space domain grid was prepared first this enables the reduction of long wavelength and high amplitude behavior it ensures an adequate gap for periodicity and maintains the power and frequency content in the data at the same level li and oldenburg 1998 the total magnetic field intensity tmi has a range of 44 1 to 52 6 nt the average magnetic inclination of 63 4667 and declination of 28 6667 were applied after removing the international geomagnetic reference field to plot a reduced to pole map peddie 1982 the reduced to pole mapping enables the correction of total magnetization intensity for spatial distortion and removal of anomaly skewness while the data format and polarity are preserved guo et al 2013 by so doing the computation process enables the repositioning of the high magnetic amplitude vertically on the magnetic source baranov 1957 this enables the delineation of the tectonic stress field induced by jurassic dolerite sills and dykes at great depth this was done by computing twice the differentiation of the source function in the vertical direction according to equation 1 mckenzie et al 2012 the first differentiation enables the deduction of magnetization potential corresponding to the vertical component of the magnetic source while the second differentiation enables the alignment of the magnetic anomaly in the vertical direction of the magnetic potential 1 δ t y r δ 2 δ y 2 δ t r δ ρ δ b where ty r connotes the reduced to pole magnetic anomaly based on the vertical magnetization y r is the radius of the magnetization field from the source to the observation ρ is the direction of the uniform anomalous magnetization and b is the direction of the earth s main field 4 1 2 analytical signal mapping a two dimensional forward and inverse fast fourier transform algorithm was applied to convolve and filter the data in the wavenumber domain the analytical signal as and the total horizontal derivatives of tilt derivatives thdtds were computed for structural delineation of basement configuration principally as transform convolves the magnetic amplitude from a magnetic inclination to a non skewed magnetic signature thus enabling the resultant and symmetrical positioning of a magnetic anomaly on its causative bodies nabighian 1972 pilkington and keating 2004 in this work the need for a conceptualization of the hydrostratigraphy domain and contact zones of dolerite host rock necessitates the mapping of as this was computed based on equation 2 shown below 2 a s x y z δ t y r δx 2 δ t y r δy 2 δ t y r δz 2 where ty r is the reduced to pole magnetic anomaly is the measured field and x y and z are the edges of the magnetic structures 4 1 3 magnetic lineament detection a thdtd was computed to delineate the effective position of the subsurface linear features such as fractures and faults magnetic lineaments which may influence the preferential flow path of groundwater the thdtd computation of the total magnetic intensity t is based on equations 3 and 4 shown below 3 t d r a r c t a n δt δz δt δx 2 δt δy 2 4 t h d t d δtdr δx 2 δtdr δy 2 where t is the total magnetic intensity and tdr is the tilt derivative 4 1 4 assessment of depth of the magnetic source the magnetic depth slicing was carried out using getech getgrid the depth slicing linear filter computes the apparent depth to magnetic source as a plot of magnetic field gradients across the subsidence of magnetic anomaly the computation procedure is based on wiener filtering principle whereby the magnetic signal is assumed to be due to two or more invariant arbitrary processes baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 the components of the magnetic gradient were extracted from the gradient plots by disaggregating the shallow sources from the deeper sources this was done by fitting trend lines to join the vertices of major tilts on the plot the depth estimation is based on the slope of the fitted trendline as defined in equation 5 5 h b 4 π where h is the average depth to the anomalous structure in meters and b is the slope of the nyquist wavenumber components the information on the derivation manipulation and general discussions of magnetic filtering techniques and equations projected above are documented in detail in whitehead and musselman 2008 4 2 auto lineament detection secondly surficial lineaments were processed using the panchromatic band of landsat 8 oli the image selection for the landsat 8 oli imagery was based on less than 10 low cloud scene and critical visual inspection of the satellite image further atmospheric correction for noise removal improvement of radiometric value and pan sharpening was carried out on the selected band in pci geomatica software the selection of the pan chromatic band band 8 was because of its high spatial resolution 15 m it is the only band whereby visible colors are integrated into a single channel amer et al 2009 the surficial lineaments were digitized through a multi stage line detection algorithm of canny edge and contour detection enhancement using pci geomatica 2017 version curve detection was filtered using the contour detection enhancement a four stage line algorithm specifies the minimum length of a curve the maximum error based on a line fitting threshold the maximum angle between the polyline segments based on the angular difference threshold and the minimum distance between two polylines based on the linking distance threshold hashim et al 2013 the statistical summary of the extracted lineaments was computed in arcgis 10 5 1 the information on the lineament angular direction was extracted by splitting the linear features at the vertices the linear feature classes were plotted on a rose diagram in rockworks 17 the linear features of the thdtd map were also extracted and computed for their azimuthal information the lineament density for the surficial and magnetic lineaments was computed using arcmap 10 5 1 the deductions from the assessments were corroborated by a sequence stratigraphy correlation using borehole lithology data mapped in strater 5 the borehole lithology data were acquired from the national groundwater archive of the department of water and sanitation south africa the field geologic survey involving sampling of sedimentary facies based on their detrital sizes structural and textural attributes enabled the delineation of members of the balfour formation within the catchment the extracted geologic information was compared with scanned soil composition and geomorphological map to produce the sedimentary facies map 5 results 5 1 tectonic stress field of the jurassic dolerite the reduction to pole rtp map fig 2 a presents the spatial distribution of the tectonic stress whereby the areas of anomalous magnetic intensity typify the source of the remnant magnetization of the causative body the rtp transformation removes dipolar attributes of magnetic anomalies by reorienting the magnetic anomaly into a normalized and symmetrical pattern abedi et al 2013 hence the anomalous sources of the remnant magnetization indicate the field of tectonic stress as shown at the northwest and other spots in the north center extreme west southwest and south this assessment provides information on the source of crustal deformation and fracture system in the contact zones of dolerite intrusion and the country rock ingebritsen and manning 2003 montanari et al 2017 the lineaments produced by magnetic lows of the rtp transformation correlate visually with the areas of emplacement of the dolerite rocks 5 2 geomagnetic mapping of shallow dolerite the as transformation computes the magnetic signal by registering the crest of a magnetic anomaly within the borders of the magnetic bodies at shallow depth hence the resulting map delineates the areas of emplacements of magnetic bodies in a manner that is independent of induced or remnant magnetization and magnetic inclination or declination fig 2b the high as amplitude within the range of 6000 10 000 nt shows a significant spatial correlation with dolerite features especially the two dolerite dykes lying west east at the north and the south of the study area moreover the deductions helped in identifying the minor dolerite sills and dykes which were concealed by low resolution mapping at a regional scale as well as the dolerite outcrop and near surface features in inaccessible locations the dolerite outcrops were estimated to cover 281 km2 22 72 while the shallow dolerite intrusion within the range of 4500 nt 6000 nt was estimated at 228 km2 18 46 the possible hydrostratigraphic relevance of the intermediate as amplitude 500 1500 nt and the extremely low as amplitude 0 250 nt was further inspected the amplitudes are due to the residual geomagnetic properties of the clay rich argillaceous strata and of non magnetic arenaceous strata vaniman et al 2014 vogel et al 2015 the relationship between the position of the major dolerite outcrops and the rtp lineaments suggests that the magnetic lows of rtp are likely to constitute the synclinal area of the emplacement of geologic intrusion fig 2a 5 3 lineaments distribution the thdtd analysis enables the spatial configuration of magnetic relief and textures corresponding to the variation in magnetic susceptibility of host rock and subsurface fractures fig 2c the linear and curvilinear features of low amplitude magnetic responses are truncated residual magnetization anomalies that are possibly linked with neotectonic movements middleton et al 2015 the surficial lineaments extracted from the rectified panchromatic band of landsat 8 oli fig 3 b show a high degree of correlation with the tectonic stress field presented by the rtp map most of the delineated magnetic lineaments trend wnw ese the same direction as the surficial lineaments the surficial and subsurface lineaments vary in length from 12 m to 2563 m and 1 15 m 6307 m respectively fig 4 the two sets of lineaments align with the neotectonic structural lineaments which also trends wnw ese in the extreme south of the catchment fig 3 the radial trend pattern of the surficial lineaments rose diagram depicts a combination of geomorphic alterations crustal weak zones shear zones thrust and reverse faults these are considered excellent pathways for groundwater flow similarly the surficial lineaments exhibited a geospatial relationship with buffalo drainage in a manner that indicates the structural influence on the buffalo river 5 4 depth assessment of tectonic stress field the result of the magnetic source position based on a radially averaged power spectrum is presented in fig 5 the five major trend lines extracted and lying at depths of 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km connote the trenches of a deep seated tectonic stress field identified as the sills and feeder dykes slice 1 suggests that most of the shallow dolerite intrusions are emplaced at 382 m depth while the pattern is replicated in slice 2 thus suggesting that the shallow geologic intrusions have a thickness of at least 195 m slice 3 913 m which is also replicated by slice 4 1 49 km presents much broader sills believed to be the source for the shallow feeder dykes the discernment of the dyke trenches based on the connection of the slices suggest that most of the geologic intrusion occurs in the w e wsw ene and wnw ese directions the deepest tectonic stress field lies at the depth of 10 7 km shown at the northwest this is presumably the tectonic source of the main w e dyke at the north of the catchment and possibly accounts for the high density of subsurface and surface lineaments in the north as shown in fig 3a and c 5 5 validation of the geologic model the south section of the catchment mapped as daggaboersnek member by katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 is characterized by non lenticular argillaceous rock deposited by lateral and downstream accretion figs 6 and 7 a the section grades into arenaceous rock with a flat topped laminated sheet of sandstone and lateral accretionary mudstone deposit at the ngwokweni headwaters the barberskrans member is dominated by massive coarse yellow sandstone fig 7b subordinate siltstone and red mudstone by the mgqakwebe and tshoxa river cut in the west the sandstone appears as a multi story section with a flat topped tabular platform in the east to the southeast along the yellowwoods river fig 7b the barberskrans member grades into the elandsberg member characterized by intercalated arenaceous rocks enriched in shale and interspersed with silty sandstone along some sections of the quencwe river at the northwest pirie fish farm the elandsberg member is associated with crevasse channel ribbon complexes whose accretionary pattern is fluvio deltaic towards the rooikrans dam the lamina deposit tapers into the quaternary sediments the palingkloof member is dominated by reddish brown bedded mudstone formed as floodplain deposits the catchment geologic cover is characterized by weathered and densely fractured dolerite outcrops as well as detached dolerite boulders in the north towards the west and center of the catchment the dolerite surface is characterized by joints or solution holes due to weathering action in the northwest the dolerite spreads appear as pyroclastic round top dykes amidst hilly landforms the dolerite outcrops in the south are quite fresh with limited fractures joints or solution holes compared to those of the north the argillaceous sections of the catchment show a moderate spatial correlation with the intermediate signals 500 1500 nt obtained from the as map also the extremely low signals 0 250 nt correlate with the arenaceous rocks of the barberskrans member and this as a result presents the analytical signal model as an important imprint for hydrostratigraphic modeling the ramification suggested by as amplitude disbandment was further examined through sequence stratigraphy correlation ssc of lithologic logs from 34 shallow boreholes presented in table 2 and figs 8 and 9 the ssc shows that the overburden of the northern half of the buffalo basin is mostly characterized by mudstone and sandstone ql ml1 and yl1 while the southern half is mostly characterized by sandstone and shale tl ml2 nl1 nl2 and yl2 as indicated by the field survey report the ssc also reveals the possible existence of a fault system in the northern profiles ql ml1 tl and yl1 where the dolerite section pinches out unconformably against another in a similar manner to the survey the ssc corroborates the extremely low signal to be the sandstone dominated units f44 f88 f17 a2 and f26 meanwhile the intermediate signal is corroborated to be dominated by argillaceous sedimentary clast f31 f20 f89 a6 c31 and c14 as shown in fig 8 the three dimensional projection of the total residual magnetization confirms that the northern half is associated with spikes of dolerite intrusion which possibly influence the development of the complex topographic system fig 10 the tectonic stress induced by the geologic intrusion as indicated by slices 4 and 5 fig 6 may have accounted for the uplift in the northwest and influenced the fracture systems within the area 6 discussion 6 1 buffalo lithostratigraphic settings the lithology of the buffalo catchment has been characterized for its basement configuration and macrostructures using geomagnetic analysis the study enables the visualization of the landscape evolution from the uplift initiated by the dolerite intrusion in the northwest of the catchment fig 10 the landform produced in the northwest coincides with the continental hinterland associated with the amatole swaziland range the range was reported to be initiated by intercontinental rifting during uplift wildman et al 2016 the tectonic stress field in the buffalo catchment is localized at depths of 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km the dolerite lineaments are oriented in the e w wnw ese and wsw ene directions the tectonic activity impacted the north of the study area and influenced the development of swarms of subsurface and surface lineaments trending wnw ese the azimuthal correlation between the surficial lineaments the subsurface lineaments and the neotectonic structures further corroborates the relevance of surficial lineaments to geologic studies the finding here agrees with senger et al 2015 on the localization of fractures and faults at the contact between southern karoo dolerite dykes and the country rocks the findings on the orientation of the lineaments align with the reports of andreoli et al 2006 and madi and zhao 2013 on the existence of structural lineaments trending nw se in the region with the aid of seismic exploration also chevallier and woodford 1999 noted that the orientation of dolerite sills and dykes in the karoo is important for inferring neotectonic fractures since the dolerites are emplaced within the neotectonic structures this finding was confirmed in this study by the positive correlation between the low amplitude tectonic stress field of rtp fig 2a and the magnetic anomaly of as map fig 2b additionally the multiple strata in the lithology of some boreholes in the east a24 c25 and f07 and the southwest f20 and f44 indicates the existence of heterolithic deposition in some part of the buffalo basin fig 9a and b the bedding suggests a successive deposition typical of a straight and faster moving flow this implies that the paleohydrology of the buffalo basin is characterized by high energy flow and turbulent fluvial style which develops accretionary structures the bedding indicates that the geology of the buffalo basin is complex this finding aligns with catuneanu and elango 2001 and katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 who posited the fluvial style of the buffalo paleoenvironment the heterolithic bedding of the buffalo catchment suggests the possibility for highly variable groundwater flow on account of the varying hydraulic conductivity across the multiple lithologies an important finding in this study is the hydrostratigraphic characterization potential of as disbandment the correspondence between the intermediate amplitudes of the as transform 500 1500 nt and the argillaceous sedimentary rocks may be due to the residual magnetization of ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite in the mudstone and shale islam et al 2002 vaniman et al 2014 vogel et al 2015 overall the finding on the as mapping conforms to the report of baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 on the basement configuration of the study area within the southeastern karoo 6 2 delineation of buffalo hydrostratigraphy for groundwater prospect the buffalo basin is characterized by a fissured aquifer as the main hydrostratigraphic domain with a minor intergranular aquifer the fissured aquifer of the buffalo basin is localized in the north and influenced by the tectonic stress field where dolerite intrusion had contact with the host rocks as indicated by the lineament density maps fig 3a and c owolabi et al 2020c the exposed dolerite and sandstone outcrops in the north are characterized by intense weathering and extensive joints and fractures in a way that aligns with the subsurface stress field the fractured system in the basin is further confirmed by the existence of quartzite lenses a78 and f80 fig 9a and b the clustered geomagnetic lineament approach adopted here suggests that the creation of permeable contact zones between the karoo dolerite dykes and the country rock depends on the complexity of the sedimentary layers f26 f07 c25 figs 8 9a and 9b hence the fractured system produced by dolerite intrusions in the buffalo basin is likely to vary in permeability as indicated by the lineament density map the main aquifer is expected to vary from low to moderate permeability and yield at the contact zone of dolerite and the host rocks in the daggasboersnek and barberskrans members in agreement with owolabi et al 2020c fig 6 madi et al 2016 also noted that the permeable contact zones of dolerite and country rock serve as an excellent conduit for groundwater flow the variation in the contact zones is associated with the complexity of the sedimentary layers f26 f07 c25 figs 8 9a and 9b dwa 2010 also posited that the catchment groundwater system is hosted by fractured and intergranular aquifers the subordinate intergranular aquifer system in the buffalo basin is possibly hosted in the sandstone within the barberskrans member fig 6 ramoeli 2009 further geophysical exploration may be required to ascertain the aquifer geometry groundwater flow in the study area may be influenced by the wnw ese trends of the subsurface lineaments the radial pattern of the surficial lineament cluster is significant for groundwater recharge where there is a high hydraulic head and discharge where the hydraulic head is lower this discovery is instrumental for the protection of groundwater resources against pollution hence the department of environment and the department of water and sanitation are advised to work together to develop a policy to protect this area given the potential for land use change agricultural activities such as fertilizer applications and industrial activities that generate chemical wastes are significant sources of groundwater pollutants in south africa stevens and van koppen 2015 the vulnerability of water resources of the buffalo catchment area to the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and to chemical fertilizers have been reported by chigor et al 2013 and okoh et al 2015 7 conclusions in this study the regional groundwater prospect of the complex geologic environment was assessed using a clustered approach of aeromagnetic assessment geoinformatics assessment sequence stratigraphy correlation and field survey the following deductions were made a conjunctive approach for lithostratigraphic analysis and its geologic structures provides holistic information on the hydrostratigraphic domain the rtp map not only enables the identification of deep seated geologic intrusion but also enables the modeling of tectonic impact on geologic terrain the analytical signal proved to be a powerful reconnaissance tool based on variable sections of low magnetic amplitude that showed spatial correlation with argillaceous and arenaceous clasts the authenticity of surficial lineaments as morphotectonic structures was demonstrated by their zonal and azimuthal correlation with subsurface lineaments and neotectonic structures the study depicted that buffalo basin geology is complex and heterogeneous any attempt to cross correlate the lithologic data beyond 20 km will be pointless the analysis enabled the characterization of buffalo catchment as a fissured hydrostratigraphic domain with the shallow groundwater system hosted in the permeable contact zones of the dolerite and host rocks the potential zones for the groundwater capture are the west northwest north and northeast however further point exploration for groundwater depth is recommended the geoinformatics geophysical approach for lithostratigraphic analysis is therefore recommended for adoption in areas with complex geology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

11988,a lithostratigraphy analysis commonly adopted for subsurface structures exploration in oil prospecting is deployed for groundwater prognosis due to the need to address the prevailing water shortage in this study the lithology characterization was based on a clustered approach of geomagnetic analysis geomorphometric analysis and sequence stratigraphy correlation across the buffalo catchment eastern cape south africa the result showed the existence of a spatial correlation between the tectonic stress field and the surficial lineaments similarly a significant azimuthal correlation wnw ese was found between surficial lineaments 203 m 6249 m subsurface lineaments and the neotectonic structures the depth slicing analysis enables the estimation of the depth of the tectonic stress field at 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km in the subsurface the sequence stratigraphy correlation based on borehole lithology data enables the identification of the fault system at the contact zones heterolithic bedding and the characterization of the hydrostratigraphic domain of the catchment the study shows that buffalo hydrostratigraphic structures are dominated by fracture networks whereby the shallow groundwater resources are possibly hosted by the dolerite host rock contact zones in the north of the buffalo catchment specific recommendations concerning groundwater management are made to water and environment stakeholders considering the vulnerability of the shallow groundwater system to pollution in the permeable contact zones of dolerite host rock the study also recommends the adaptation of surficial lineaments as a morpho tectonic aid and a hydrostratigraphic analysis tool the clustered approach demonstrated in this study has important prospects for groundwater exploration in environments with similar geology graphical abstract image 1 keywords lithostratigraphic analysis hydrostratigraphic model macrostructures aeromagnetic analysis tectonic lines karoo supergroup 1 introduction the understanding of geologic complexity has provided remarkable information on the variability of hydraulic properties and the zones of effective permeability that are significant to the flow of fluid in the subsurface at a regional scale fluid flow is channelled through large scale structures of hydrostratigraphic units with significant permeability for example ingebritsen and manning 2003 demonstrated that the transmission of the metamorphic fluid system and the continental crust degasification were controlled by large scale crustal permeability at the continental margin bense and van balen 2003 illustrated the effects of large scale fault zones on the regional groundwater flux in the roer valley rift system marker et al 2015 presented a hydrostratigraphic cluster model based on sequential hydro geophysical inversion for incorporating airborne electromagnetic data into the hydrological modeling process christensen et al 2017 demonstrated a three dimensional groundwater model using airborne electromagnetic data and lithology data the geometry of geological structures was processed with the aid of the bayesian geostatistical approach likewise this study presents a clustered approach of geomagnetic analysis and lineament detection methods for the assessment of geologic structures in a complex geologic environment as a contribution to groundwater prospecting the major target zones in regional groundwater exploration are often areas of secondary porosity such as shear zones trenches elongated joints major faults and fractures generally referred to as natural lineaments singhal and gupta 2010 lineaments are tectonics structures developed by stress concentration or strains due to the initiation and evolution of rift and orogeny masoud and koike 2011 o leary et al 1976 opined that they are extractible features of the earth with linear or curvilinear orientations on weak points of the earth s surface they are often concentrated in areas with complex landforms galloway 2010 they stretch over a few hundred meters to several kilometers on the surface and in the subsurface lineament mapping has a long history wilson 1936 moody and hill 1956 o leary et al 1976 lineaments can be processed and extracted manually or automatically from remotely sensed images aeromagnetic data and seismic lines madi and zhao 2013 adiri et al 2017 baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 their application has gained wide recognition for groundwater prospecting nag 2005 for the study of tectonic evolution boutirame et al 2019 and mapping shear zones of ore mineralization eldosouky et al 2020 the precision of lineament detection depends on image enhancement tools such as the transformation computations the enhancement filters the algorithm efficiency and the image quality or the extent of distortion randomness in nature and electromagnetic radiation interfere with image quality by raising the inherent noise level and producing outlying frequencies morphological and tonal variation which accounts for the distortion in the quality of the image however enhancement filters such as convolution laplacian and sobel filters and principal component analysis serve as the tools for correcting the distortions sukumar et al 2014 for further improvement of the aeromagnetic and gravity signal transformation computation is applied to redefine the geophysical signal as a function with a finite length segment along a defined axis and for the alteration of the domain of the function for example fast fourier transform works by redefining the square and periodic domain of a magnetic and gravity body to the wavenumber domain baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 in south africa large scale geologic structures within the karoo supergroup have been explored for their groundwater resources and shale gas potential chevallier and woodford 1999 andreoli et al 2006 madi and zhao 2013 baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 the present study intends to present a holistic lithostratigraphy characterization that enables the delineation of groundwater capture zones in a complex environment the novelty of the study lies in the three dimensional characterization of lithology for visualization of hydrostratigraphic domains based on the clustered approach of geomagnetism geoinformatics and sequence stratigraphy correlation the following research questions were addressed 1 can the relationship between the swarms of lineaments and the tectonic stress field be deduced 2 do the geomorphic based surficial lineaments have a significant relationship with magnetic and neotectonic structures 3 how can a holistic three dimensional configuration of the basement be evaluated 4 what amount of groundwater information can be drawn from the inferred hydrostratigraphic units the clustered geophysics and geoinformatics methods present a catchment based geologic assessment that is scoped into the following objectives 1 to assess the geology of the environment through comparative analysis of geomagnetic imprint and sequence stratigraphy correlation 2 to explore the interrelationship between the surficial lineaments neotectonic structures the subsurface lineaments and the tectonic stress field and 3 to infer hydrostratigraphic controls on groundwater prospects of the study area 2 study area description the study was carried out in the buffalo headwaters catchment it is located within latitude 32 39 to 33 05 s and longitude 27 05 to 27 33 e covering approximately 1237 km2 fig 1 it is drained by dendritic foothill drainage comprising of six tributaries and the main stem of the buffalo river which is 46 km long it runs northwest southeast from an altitude of approximately 1338 m in the isidenge forest to the catchment mouth at laing dam at an altitude of 267 m above sea level owolabi et al 2020b the foot slope is covered by colluvium and alluvial fan of about 2 m to 8 m thick in the valley bottom the catchment soil maturity is quite low due to the shallowness of the underlying bedrock of clastic sedimentary materials and the crystalline basement owolabi et al 2020a 3 geological setting and stratigraphy the geology of buffalo catchment comprises tatarian red and grey mudstone of the balfour formation covering three quarters of the catchment the lower quarter of the catchment grades into the older kazarian silty sandstone dominated arenaceous strata of the middleton formation the two formations fall within the beaufort group adelaide subgroup of the karoo supergroup baiyegunhi et al 2017 the balfour formation has been noted to comprise five members namely oudeberg daggaboersnek barberskrans elandsberg and palingkloof members katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 these were grouped into arenaceous and argillaceous units the sedimentary facies of the catchment represent fluvio deltaic alluvial deposits with lateral and downstream accretion in their flood paleochannel wilson et al 2014 the catchment hydrostratigraphy is laterally bounded at the north and south by a jurassic dolerite outcrop and interspersed in various sections by jurassic dolerite dykes and sills lithostratigraphy of the beaufort group is presented in table 1 4 materials and methods an integrated geo structural framework of digital processing of aeromagnetic data and landsat 8 operational land imager oli was employed to characterize the hydrostratigraphy domain and to define the macroscale geologic structures of the geologic environment 4 1 geomagnetic analysis the aeromagnetic data of buffalo catchment was extracted from the regional aeromagnetic survey of eastern cape mapped by fugro airborne surveys for the council for geoscience the aeromagnetic data mapping was achieved with the aid of a proton procession magnetometer of 0 01 nt resolution the aeromagnetic scanner was flown at a constant height of 60 m in north south flight direction within a sampling line of 250 m using line spacing of 200 m 4 1 1 the reduced to pole mapping the aeromagnetic data was processed through linear and non linear filtering algorithms of the montaj magmap filtering system the space domain grid was prepared first this enables the reduction of long wavelength and high amplitude behavior it ensures an adequate gap for periodicity and maintains the power and frequency content in the data at the same level li and oldenburg 1998 the total magnetic field intensity tmi has a range of 44 1 to 52 6 nt the average magnetic inclination of 63 4667 and declination of 28 6667 were applied after removing the international geomagnetic reference field to plot a reduced to pole map peddie 1982 the reduced to pole mapping enables the correction of total magnetization intensity for spatial distortion and removal of anomaly skewness while the data format and polarity are preserved guo et al 2013 by so doing the computation process enables the repositioning of the high magnetic amplitude vertically on the magnetic source baranov 1957 this enables the delineation of the tectonic stress field induced by jurassic dolerite sills and dykes at great depth this was done by computing twice the differentiation of the source function in the vertical direction according to equation 1 mckenzie et al 2012 the first differentiation enables the deduction of magnetization potential corresponding to the vertical component of the magnetic source while the second differentiation enables the alignment of the magnetic anomaly in the vertical direction of the magnetic potential 1 δ t y r δ 2 δ y 2 δ t r δ ρ δ b where ty r connotes the reduced to pole magnetic anomaly based on the vertical magnetization y r is the radius of the magnetization field from the source to the observation ρ is the direction of the uniform anomalous magnetization and b is the direction of the earth s main field 4 1 2 analytical signal mapping a two dimensional forward and inverse fast fourier transform algorithm was applied to convolve and filter the data in the wavenumber domain the analytical signal as and the total horizontal derivatives of tilt derivatives thdtds were computed for structural delineation of basement configuration principally as transform convolves the magnetic amplitude from a magnetic inclination to a non skewed magnetic signature thus enabling the resultant and symmetrical positioning of a magnetic anomaly on its causative bodies nabighian 1972 pilkington and keating 2004 in this work the need for a conceptualization of the hydrostratigraphy domain and contact zones of dolerite host rock necessitates the mapping of as this was computed based on equation 2 shown below 2 a s x y z δ t y r δx 2 δ t y r δy 2 δ t y r δz 2 where ty r is the reduced to pole magnetic anomaly is the measured field and x y and z are the edges of the magnetic structures 4 1 3 magnetic lineament detection a thdtd was computed to delineate the effective position of the subsurface linear features such as fractures and faults magnetic lineaments which may influence the preferential flow path of groundwater the thdtd computation of the total magnetic intensity t is based on equations 3 and 4 shown below 3 t d r a r c t a n δt δz δt δx 2 δt δy 2 4 t h d t d δtdr δx 2 δtdr δy 2 where t is the total magnetic intensity and tdr is the tilt derivative 4 1 4 assessment of depth of the magnetic source the magnetic depth slicing was carried out using getech getgrid the depth slicing linear filter computes the apparent depth to magnetic source as a plot of magnetic field gradients across the subsidence of magnetic anomaly the computation procedure is based on wiener filtering principle whereby the magnetic signal is assumed to be due to two or more invariant arbitrary processes baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 the components of the magnetic gradient were extracted from the gradient plots by disaggregating the shallow sources from the deeper sources this was done by fitting trend lines to join the vertices of major tilts on the plot the depth estimation is based on the slope of the fitted trendline as defined in equation 5 5 h b 4 π where h is the average depth to the anomalous structure in meters and b is the slope of the nyquist wavenumber components the information on the derivation manipulation and general discussions of magnetic filtering techniques and equations projected above are documented in detail in whitehead and musselman 2008 4 2 auto lineament detection secondly surficial lineaments were processed using the panchromatic band of landsat 8 oli the image selection for the landsat 8 oli imagery was based on less than 10 low cloud scene and critical visual inspection of the satellite image further atmospheric correction for noise removal improvement of radiometric value and pan sharpening was carried out on the selected band in pci geomatica software the selection of the pan chromatic band band 8 was because of its high spatial resolution 15 m it is the only band whereby visible colors are integrated into a single channel amer et al 2009 the surficial lineaments were digitized through a multi stage line detection algorithm of canny edge and contour detection enhancement using pci geomatica 2017 version curve detection was filtered using the contour detection enhancement a four stage line algorithm specifies the minimum length of a curve the maximum error based on a line fitting threshold the maximum angle between the polyline segments based on the angular difference threshold and the minimum distance between two polylines based on the linking distance threshold hashim et al 2013 the statistical summary of the extracted lineaments was computed in arcgis 10 5 1 the information on the lineament angular direction was extracted by splitting the linear features at the vertices the linear feature classes were plotted on a rose diagram in rockworks 17 the linear features of the thdtd map were also extracted and computed for their azimuthal information the lineament density for the surficial and magnetic lineaments was computed using arcmap 10 5 1 the deductions from the assessments were corroborated by a sequence stratigraphy correlation using borehole lithology data mapped in strater 5 the borehole lithology data were acquired from the national groundwater archive of the department of water and sanitation south africa the field geologic survey involving sampling of sedimentary facies based on their detrital sizes structural and textural attributes enabled the delineation of members of the balfour formation within the catchment the extracted geologic information was compared with scanned soil composition and geomorphological map to produce the sedimentary facies map 5 results 5 1 tectonic stress field of the jurassic dolerite the reduction to pole rtp map fig 2 a presents the spatial distribution of the tectonic stress whereby the areas of anomalous magnetic intensity typify the source of the remnant magnetization of the causative body the rtp transformation removes dipolar attributes of magnetic anomalies by reorienting the magnetic anomaly into a normalized and symmetrical pattern abedi et al 2013 hence the anomalous sources of the remnant magnetization indicate the field of tectonic stress as shown at the northwest and other spots in the north center extreme west southwest and south this assessment provides information on the source of crustal deformation and fracture system in the contact zones of dolerite intrusion and the country rock ingebritsen and manning 2003 montanari et al 2017 the lineaments produced by magnetic lows of the rtp transformation correlate visually with the areas of emplacement of the dolerite rocks 5 2 geomagnetic mapping of shallow dolerite the as transformation computes the magnetic signal by registering the crest of a magnetic anomaly within the borders of the magnetic bodies at shallow depth hence the resulting map delineates the areas of emplacements of magnetic bodies in a manner that is independent of induced or remnant magnetization and magnetic inclination or declination fig 2b the high as amplitude within the range of 6000 10 000 nt shows a significant spatial correlation with dolerite features especially the two dolerite dykes lying west east at the north and the south of the study area moreover the deductions helped in identifying the minor dolerite sills and dykes which were concealed by low resolution mapping at a regional scale as well as the dolerite outcrop and near surface features in inaccessible locations the dolerite outcrops were estimated to cover 281 km2 22 72 while the shallow dolerite intrusion within the range of 4500 nt 6000 nt was estimated at 228 km2 18 46 the possible hydrostratigraphic relevance of the intermediate as amplitude 500 1500 nt and the extremely low as amplitude 0 250 nt was further inspected the amplitudes are due to the residual geomagnetic properties of the clay rich argillaceous strata and of non magnetic arenaceous strata vaniman et al 2014 vogel et al 2015 the relationship between the position of the major dolerite outcrops and the rtp lineaments suggests that the magnetic lows of rtp are likely to constitute the synclinal area of the emplacement of geologic intrusion fig 2a 5 3 lineaments distribution the thdtd analysis enables the spatial configuration of magnetic relief and textures corresponding to the variation in magnetic susceptibility of host rock and subsurface fractures fig 2c the linear and curvilinear features of low amplitude magnetic responses are truncated residual magnetization anomalies that are possibly linked with neotectonic movements middleton et al 2015 the surficial lineaments extracted from the rectified panchromatic band of landsat 8 oli fig 3 b show a high degree of correlation with the tectonic stress field presented by the rtp map most of the delineated magnetic lineaments trend wnw ese the same direction as the surficial lineaments the surficial and subsurface lineaments vary in length from 12 m to 2563 m and 1 15 m 6307 m respectively fig 4 the two sets of lineaments align with the neotectonic structural lineaments which also trends wnw ese in the extreme south of the catchment fig 3 the radial trend pattern of the surficial lineaments rose diagram depicts a combination of geomorphic alterations crustal weak zones shear zones thrust and reverse faults these are considered excellent pathways for groundwater flow similarly the surficial lineaments exhibited a geospatial relationship with buffalo drainage in a manner that indicates the structural influence on the buffalo river 5 4 depth assessment of tectonic stress field the result of the magnetic source position based on a radially averaged power spectrum is presented in fig 5 the five major trend lines extracted and lying at depths of 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km connote the trenches of a deep seated tectonic stress field identified as the sills and feeder dykes slice 1 suggests that most of the shallow dolerite intrusions are emplaced at 382 m depth while the pattern is replicated in slice 2 thus suggesting that the shallow geologic intrusions have a thickness of at least 195 m slice 3 913 m which is also replicated by slice 4 1 49 km presents much broader sills believed to be the source for the shallow feeder dykes the discernment of the dyke trenches based on the connection of the slices suggest that most of the geologic intrusion occurs in the w e wsw ene and wnw ese directions the deepest tectonic stress field lies at the depth of 10 7 km shown at the northwest this is presumably the tectonic source of the main w e dyke at the north of the catchment and possibly accounts for the high density of subsurface and surface lineaments in the north as shown in fig 3a and c 5 5 validation of the geologic model the south section of the catchment mapped as daggaboersnek member by katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 is characterized by non lenticular argillaceous rock deposited by lateral and downstream accretion figs 6 and 7 a the section grades into arenaceous rock with a flat topped laminated sheet of sandstone and lateral accretionary mudstone deposit at the ngwokweni headwaters the barberskrans member is dominated by massive coarse yellow sandstone fig 7b subordinate siltstone and red mudstone by the mgqakwebe and tshoxa river cut in the west the sandstone appears as a multi story section with a flat topped tabular platform in the east to the southeast along the yellowwoods river fig 7b the barberskrans member grades into the elandsberg member characterized by intercalated arenaceous rocks enriched in shale and interspersed with silty sandstone along some sections of the quencwe river at the northwest pirie fish farm the elandsberg member is associated with crevasse channel ribbon complexes whose accretionary pattern is fluvio deltaic towards the rooikrans dam the lamina deposit tapers into the quaternary sediments the palingkloof member is dominated by reddish brown bedded mudstone formed as floodplain deposits the catchment geologic cover is characterized by weathered and densely fractured dolerite outcrops as well as detached dolerite boulders in the north towards the west and center of the catchment the dolerite surface is characterized by joints or solution holes due to weathering action in the northwest the dolerite spreads appear as pyroclastic round top dykes amidst hilly landforms the dolerite outcrops in the south are quite fresh with limited fractures joints or solution holes compared to those of the north the argillaceous sections of the catchment show a moderate spatial correlation with the intermediate signals 500 1500 nt obtained from the as map also the extremely low signals 0 250 nt correlate with the arenaceous rocks of the barberskrans member and this as a result presents the analytical signal model as an important imprint for hydrostratigraphic modeling the ramification suggested by as amplitude disbandment was further examined through sequence stratigraphy correlation ssc of lithologic logs from 34 shallow boreholes presented in table 2 and figs 8 and 9 the ssc shows that the overburden of the northern half of the buffalo basin is mostly characterized by mudstone and sandstone ql ml1 and yl1 while the southern half is mostly characterized by sandstone and shale tl ml2 nl1 nl2 and yl2 as indicated by the field survey report the ssc also reveals the possible existence of a fault system in the northern profiles ql ml1 tl and yl1 where the dolerite section pinches out unconformably against another in a similar manner to the survey the ssc corroborates the extremely low signal to be the sandstone dominated units f44 f88 f17 a2 and f26 meanwhile the intermediate signal is corroborated to be dominated by argillaceous sedimentary clast f31 f20 f89 a6 c31 and c14 as shown in fig 8 the three dimensional projection of the total residual magnetization confirms that the northern half is associated with spikes of dolerite intrusion which possibly influence the development of the complex topographic system fig 10 the tectonic stress induced by the geologic intrusion as indicated by slices 4 and 5 fig 6 may have accounted for the uplift in the northwest and influenced the fracture systems within the area 6 discussion 6 1 buffalo lithostratigraphic settings the lithology of the buffalo catchment has been characterized for its basement configuration and macrostructures using geomagnetic analysis the study enables the visualization of the landscape evolution from the uplift initiated by the dolerite intrusion in the northwest of the catchment fig 10 the landform produced in the northwest coincides with the continental hinterland associated with the amatole swaziland range the range was reported to be initiated by intercontinental rifting during uplift wildman et al 2016 the tectonic stress field in the buffalo catchment is localized at depths of 382 m 577 m 913 m 1 49 km and 10 7 km the dolerite lineaments are oriented in the e w wnw ese and wsw ene directions the tectonic activity impacted the north of the study area and influenced the development of swarms of subsurface and surface lineaments trending wnw ese the azimuthal correlation between the surficial lineaments the subsurface lineaments and the neotectonic structures further corroborates the relevance of surficial lineaments to geologic studies the finding here agrees with senger et al 2015 on the localization of fractures and faults at the contact between southern karoo dolerite dykes and the country rocks the findings on the orientation of the lineaments align with the reports of andreoli et al 2006 and madi and zhao 2013 on the existence of structural lineaments trending nw se in the region with the aid of seismic exploration also chevallier and woodford 1999 noted that the orientation of dolerite sills and dykes in the karoo is important for inferring neotectonic fractures since the dolerites are emplaced within the neotectonic structures this finding was confirmed in this study by the positive correlation between the low amplitude tectonic stress field of rtp fig 2a and the magnetic anomaly of as map fig 2b additionally the multiple strata in the lithology of some boreholes in the east a24 c25 and f07 and the southwest f20 and f44 indicates the existence of heterolithic deposition in some part of the buffalo basin fig 9a and b the bedding suggests a successive deposition typical of a straight and faster moving flow this implies that the paleohydrology of the buffalo basin is characterized by high energy flow and turbulent fluvial style which develops accretionary structures the bedding indicates that the geology of the buffalo basin is complex this finding aligns with catuneanu and elango 2001 and katemaunzanga and gunter 2009 who posited the fluvial style of the buffalo paleoenvironment the heterolithic bedding of the buffalo catchment suggests the possibility for highly variable groundwater flow on account of the varying hydraulic conductivity across the multiple lithologies an important finding in this study is the hydrostratigraphic characterization potential of as disbandment the correspondence between the intermediate amplitudes of the as transform 500 1500 nt and the argillaceous sedimentary rocks may be due to the residual magnetization of ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite in the mudstone and shale islam et al 2002 vaniman et al 2014 vogel et al 2015 overall the finding on the as mapping conforms to the report of baiyegunhi and gwavava 2017 on the basement configuration of the study area within the southeastern karoo 6 2 delineation of buffalo hydrostratigraphy for groundwater prospect the buffalo basin is characterized by a fissured aquifer as the main hydrostratigraphic domain with a minor intergranular aquifer the fissured aquifer of the buffalo basin is localized in the north and influenced by the tectonic stress field where dolerite intrusion had contact with the host rocks as indicated by the lineament density maps fig 3a and c owolabi et al 2020c the exposed dolerite and sandstone outcrops in the north are characterized by intense weathering and extensive joints and fractures in a way that aligns with the subsurface stress field the fractured system in the basin is further confirmed by the existence of quartzite lenses a78 and f80 fig 9a and b the clustered geomagnetic lineament approach adopted here suggests that the creation of permeable contact zones between the karoo dolerite dykes and the country rock depends on the complexity of the sedimentary layers f26 f07 c25 figs 8 9a and 9b hence the fractured system produced by dolerite intrusions in the buffalo basin is likely to vary in permeability as indicated by the lineament density map the main aquifer is expected to vary from low to moderate permeability and yield at the contact zone of dolerite and the host rocks in the daggasboersnek and barberskrans members in agreement with owolabi et al 2020c fig 6 madi et al 2016 also noted that the permeable contact zones of dolerite and country rock serve as an excellent conduit for groundwater flow the variation in the contact zones is associated with the complexity of the sedimentary layers f26 f07 c25 figs 8 9a and 9b dwa 2010 also posited that the catchment groundwater system is hosted by fractured and intergranular aquifers the subordinate intergranular aquifer system in the buffalo basin is possibly hosted in the sandstone within the barberskrans member fig 6 ramoeli 2009 further geophysical exploration may be required to ascertain the aquifer geometry groundwater flow in the study area may be influenced by the wnw ese trends of the subsurface lineaments the radial pattern of the surficial lineament cluster is significant for groundwater recharge where there is a high hydraulic head and discharge where the hydraulic head is lower this discovery is instrumental for the protection of groundwater resources against pollution hence the department of environment and the department of water and sanitation are advised to work together to develop a policy to protect this area given the potential for land use change agricultural activities such as fertilizer applications and industrial activities that generate chemical wastes are significant sources of groundwater pollutants in south africa stevens and van koppen 2015 the vulnerability of water resources of the buffalo catchment area to the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and to chemical fertilizers have been reported by chigor et al 2013 and okoh et al 2015 7 conclusions in this study the regional groundwater prospect of the complex geologic environment was assessed using a clustered approach of aeromagnetic assessment geoinformatics assessment sequence stratigraphy correlation and field survey the following deductions were made a conjunctive approach for lithostratigraphic analysis and its geologic structures provides holistic information on the hydrostratigraphic domain the rtp map not only enables the identification of deep seated geologic intrusion but also enables the modeling of tectonic impact on geologic terrain the analytical signal proved to be a powerful reconnaissance tool based on variable sections of low magnetic amplitude that showed spatial correlation with argillaceous and arenaceous clasts the authenticity of surficial lineaments as morphotectonic structures was demonstrated by their zonal and azimuthal correlation with subsurface lineaments and neotectonic structures the study depicted that buffalo basin geology is complex and heterogeneous any attempt to cross correlate the lithologic data beyond 20 km will be pointless the analysis enabled the characterization of buffalo catchment as a fissured hydrostratigraphic domain with the shallow groundwater system hosted in the permeable contact zones of the dolerite and host rocks the potential zones for the groundwater capture are the west northwest north and northeast however further point exploration for groundwater depth is recommended the geoinformatics geophysical approach for lithostratigraphic analysis is therefore recommended for adoption in areas with complex geology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

11989,the aim of the present study is to investigate the removal of escherichia coli e coli strain from contaminated groundwater using an adsorbent material prepared from moroccan oil shales extracted in the timahdit region layer x several factors were studied and optimized using the experimental design method based on the plackett burman experimental plan pbe namely the bacterial suspension concentration 105 108 cfu ml the adsorbent mass 1 30 mg the ph 3 9 the temperature 20 37 c the contact time 5 360 min and the stirring speed 45 150 rpm data analysis by the pbe model showed that the bacterial suspension concentration the adsorbent mass and the stirring speed are the most significant factors that influence the removal of e coli the optimum process conditions were found with a suspension concentration below 5 107 cfu ml about 15 5 mg of the adsorbent material and a stirring speed over 97 5 rpm at 28 5 c and ph 6 during 182 min under these conditions the adsorption efficiency of e coli reached 70 57 graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil shales adsorption escherichia coli experimental design plackett and burman 1 introduction water purification is one of the most serious challenges facing our world these days chakraborty et al 2014 legrouri et al 2005 especially with the rise of the world population and the increased demand on water abarca et al 2020 kalhor et al 2019 thousands of organic inorganic and biological contaminants have found their way into the environment anjum et al 2017 arsalan et al 2019 naciri et al 2020b 2020c biological pollutants such as animal and human excrements that comprise high levels of bacteria like escherichia coli e coli which is an indicator of faecal contamination present a high risk to human health and groundwater igbinosa et al 2013 kalhor et al 2019 owamah 2020 saha et al 2018 several treatment processes were used for the reduction of the level of this pollutant in groundwater and wastewater discharge dasgupta et al 2015 naciri et al 2020a among these adsorption is widely used because of its efficiency and easy implementation to remove organic and biological pollutants from water arsalan et al 2019 hsini et al 2020a sarkar et al 2015 activated carbon is the most used adsorbent because of its high adsorption capacity aarab et al 2020a hsini et al 2020b khouya et al 2010 however it is relatively expensive and its regeneration is delicate especially when it is applied to large contamination giwa et al 2018 gupta and balomajumder 2015 kacha et al 2003 legrouri et al 2005 marchal et al 2013 accordingly the search for alternative low cost and effective adsorbent materials has been the subject of several recent studies litter et al 2019 maity et al 2018 tripathi and ranjan 2015 in this context we explored the use of an adsorbent material originating from moroccan oil shales extracted from the timahdit region northern morocco oil shale based materials seem to be interesting as efficient adsorbents due to their chemical composition and active functions arsalan et al 2019 chen et al 2010 ichcho et al 2005 their functional sites are related to the arrangement of their mineral and organic components within their structure chen et al 2010 previous research groups have investigated the adsorption process of e coli on activated carbon under different experimental conditions in order to elucidate the parameters that affect the efficiency of this process gupta and balomajumder 2015 mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 rivera utrilla et al 2001 2003 in fact the adsorption of e coli is affected by several factors including temperature ph contact time adsorbent mass bacterial suspension concentration and stirring speed herrera et al 2000 kharchenko et al 2014 owamah 2020 rivera utrilla et al 2001 therefore an optimization process of these factors is needed in order to maximize the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent chakraborty et al 2014 priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 one of the most used methods to optimize the process is the plackett burman experimental plan pbe also called plackett burman design which investigates the reliance of experimental data on a number of independent factors das et al 2015 patil and jena 2015 plackett and burman 1946 ungureanu et al 2015 the method is extremely economical in terms of number of experiments required for the process optimization olivieri and magallanes 2012 priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 in fact it allows with 12 experiments to account for the effect of up to 11 factors unlike the two level factorial design which requires 32 tests for 5 factors 64 for 6 factors etc mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 olivieri and magallanes 2012 the pbe is a well established and widely used statistical method for selecting the most efficient components with high significance levels for further optimization without taking into account interactions between variables priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 saha et al 2017 the present study aims to examine the performance of an adsorbent material prepared from the moroccan oil shales of the timahdit region layer x to remove the e coli bacteria from contaminated groundwater and to determine the optimum conditions for the maximum adsorption different parameters were studied namely temperature ph contact time adsorbent mass bacterial suspension concentration and stirring speed following some preliminary tests to determine the factors affecting the bacteria adsorption the pbe experimental plan was used to carry out the experiments in order to optimize the adsorption conditions chakraborty et al 2014 mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and equipment the oil shale specimen was collected from layer x in timahdit region northern morocco hydrochloric acid hcl phosphoric acid h3po4 and all other chemicals were from aldrich distilled water was used for the preparation of all test solutions the bacterial strain e coli atcc 35218 was obtained from the laboratory of medical analyses of hassan ii hospital in agadir morocco besides its extensive pathogenicity this strain was selected because it is biologically referenced and standardized by the american type culture collection atcc mariani kurkdjian and bonacorsi 2016 the mass of the samples was measured by the nimbus analytical balances nbl 214i the ph temperature and conductivity were determined by a ph meter equipped with a multi parameter electrode type wtw 522 the stirring speed was evaluated by the heated magnetic stirrer rt2 basic thermo scientific absorbance of the turbidity of the solution was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific multiskan fc 2 2 preparation of adsorbent materials 2 2 1 preparation of the xh precursor the choice of the sedimentary oil shale rocks of timahdit layer x was based on two factors namely the abundance of this material and the composition of the native rock khouya et al 2005 oumam et al 2020 previous studies showed that this material comprises organic matter 20 strongly bound to the mineral portion 80 that consists mainly of carbonates 15 6 calcite 13 8 dolomite clays 26 9 and silicates 23 7 mansouri et al 2018 the mechanical preparation of the collected rocks x was carried out by crushing and grinding the obtained product was sieved to extract the 80 μm fraction of the particles the solid material was then completely decarbonated by mixing 40 g of the sample x with 160 ml of 6 n hcl under continuous stirring 4 h after filtration the residue was washed with distilled water in a soxhlet extractor to remove the acid the obtained product labelled xh was dried in the oven at 110 c after this treatment the precursor xh is essentially composed of organic matter and clay abourriche et al 2013 mahaninia et al 2015 oumam et al 2020 2 2 2 preparation of the xha precursor by activation of xh chemical activation of the obtained matter consists of impregnating the xh precursor in a phosphoric acid 30 70 h3po4 solution diluted in distilled water this novel activation process of oil shales by phosphoric acid was developed by our laboratory during the preparation of the adsorbent from the oil shales of timahdit layer y m elhammoudi et al 2017 khouya et al 2010 the h3po4 xh weight ratio was equal to 1 and the mixture was subjected to a heat treatment from 200 to 450 c and an activation time up to 4 h in air molina sabio and rodrıguez reinoso 2004 nayak et al 2017 nowrouzi et al 2017 the excess acid and other soluble matters were removed with distilled water using a soxhlet extractor mahaninia et al 2015 oumam et al 2020 the obtained product labelled xha was dried at 110 c then sieved chham et al 2018 khouya et al 2010 mansouri et al 2018 2 3 characterization of adsorbent materials 2 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the characteristic bands of the adsorbents were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with bruker tensor 27 in the 400 4000 cm 1 wavenumber range fig 1 presents the ftir spectra of xh and xha comparison of the spectra of the two samples leads to the following remarks the disappearance of the bands at 400 and 550 cm 1 that are typical for branched alkanes in xha elhammoudi et al 2017 the disappearance of the fine bands at 1100 and 1200 cm 1 which are characteristic of the c c elongations aliphatic and aromatic alkanes and the c o elongations in the xha sample respectively the appearance of the bands at 1375 and 1500 cm 1 that correspond to the presence of organic matter in xha moine et al 2018 the intensity decrease of the band around 1700 cm 1 for xha which is specific to the co bonds due to the oxidation of the organic matter elhammoudi et al 2017 moine et al 2018 the intensity reduction of the peaks around 2950 cm 1 that characterize the c h bonds of methyl and methylene groups ch3 ch2 and ch this decrease is due to the oxidation of the organic material during the heat treatment chang et al 2018 moine et al 2018 the lower intensity of the band around 3800 cm 1 massive vibrations of oh is caused by the desiccant effects related to the acid treatment aboulkas et al 2012 chang et al 2018 2 3 2 thermal analyses thermogravimetry tg and differential thermal analysis dta were recorded simultaneously in air using a tga verstherme thermoscientific thermoanalyzer in the 20 900 c range the tg and dta thermograms of xh and xha are given in figs 2 and 3 respectively the thermal evolution of each of xh and xha takes place in two consecutive stages for the xh the first weight loss of ca 15 which occurs between 25 and 200 c is attributed to the evaporation of adsorbed water on the solid surface the second weight loss of up to 75 observed between 200 and 600 c overlaps with two exothermic peaks at 250 and 350 c that can be ascribed to the gradual oxidation of different types of organic matter in the case of xha we note in addition to the water loss the loss of organic matter in a single process which is accompanied by an exothermic peak between 200 and 600 c with its maximum at 470 c this phenomenon is mainly due to the catalytic role of h3po4 in the crosslinking of organic matter and hence its protection against oxidation at low temperatures naciri et al 2019 oumam et al 2020 2 3 3 scanning electron microscopy the morphology of xh and xha was visualized by scanning electron microscopy sem on a hirox sh 4000 m with a magnification of 20 000 the obtained images are represented in fig 4 the examination of the decarbonated precursor xh compared to xha reveals wider grain size resulting from the attack of xh by hcl with lack of porosity in contrast the image of xha exposes the effect of thermal and chemical activation by h3po4 leading to the development of a microstructure with very high homogeneous and well distributed porosity khouya et al 2010 this result reveals the substantial effect of using h3po4 during the activation process of xh on the microstructure of oil shale based materials 2 4 preparation of the bacterial suspension the e coli strain was isolated from a culture that was stored and maintained at 20 c in liquid media trypticase soy broth bts 20 glycerol the strain was subsequently plated in the muller hinton agar medium to obtain young and isolated colonies petri plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the obtained strain was thereafter supplemented with physiological saline then mixed with a vortex zx3 velp scientifica in order to have a microbial suspension with a turbidity close to that of 0 5 mc farland 108 cfu ml aftab et al 2020 aziz et al 2015 suba et al 2019 obtaining this concentration required the modification of the method described by karunakaran and vinayagamoorthy 2016 2 5 adsorption of the bacterium on the material the adsorption tests of the e coli atcc 35218 strain by xha were carried out in batch bottles aarab et al 2020b das et al 2015 each bottle contained a quantity of the adsorbent material added to 100 ml of a bacterial suspension of about 108 cfu ml the experiments effected under aseptic and controlled conditions at a temperature between 20 and 37 c a ph of 3 9 and a stirring speed of 45 150 rpm subsequently 200 μl aliquot samples of the supernatant were taken at pre set times 5 360 min and deposited in a microplate of 96 wells the adsorption tests

shales in the timahdit region layer x the solid material was prepared by chemical activation with h3po4 of decarbonated oil shales xh followed by a heat treatment in air between 200 and 450 c the results of the ftir show an oxidation of the organic matter of xha justified by the disappearance of the characteristic bands of the c h c o and o h bonds in the ir spectrum the sem observation presents a microstructure with very high porosity for xha consequent to the chemical attack by h3po4 and the thermal treatment in air experiments were conducted following the pbe screening concept on six factors involved in the adsorption process namely temperature c contact time min ph stirring speed rpm adsorbent mass mg and bacterial suspension concentration cfu ml the impact of these factors on the adsorption rates y indicates that the optimal conditions for maximum adsorption of the e coli bacterial strain were found to be a bacterial concentration less than 5 10 7 cfu ml an xha mass

11989,the aim of the present study is to investigate the removal of escherichia coli e coli strain from contaminated groundwater using an adsorbent material prepared from moroccan oil shales extracted in the timahdit region layer x several factors were studied and optimized using the experimental design method based on the plackett burman experimental plan pbe namely the bacterial suspension

bacterial suspension concentration the adsorbent mass and the stirring speed are the most significant factors that influence the removal of e coli the optimum process conditions were found with a suspension concentration below 5 107 cfu ml about 15 5 mg of the adsorbent material and a stirring speed over 97 5 rpm at 28 5 c and ph 6 during 182 min under these conditions the adsorption efficiency of e coli reached 70 57 graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil shales adsorption escherichia coli experimental design plackett and burman 1 introduction water purification is one of the most serious challenges facing our world these days chakraborty et al 2014 legrouri et al 2005 especially with the rise of the world population and the increased demand on water abarca et al 2020 kalhor et al 2019 thousands of organic inorganic and biological contaminants have found their way into the environment anjum et al 2017 arsalan et al 2019 naciri et al 2020b 2020c biological pollutants such as animal and human excrements that comprise high levels of bacteria like escherichia coli e coli which is an indicator of faecal contamination present a high risk to human health and groundwater igbinosa et al 2013 kalhor et al 2019 owamah 2020 saha et al 2018 several treatment processes were used for the reduction of the level of this pollutant in groundwater and wastewater discharge dasgupta et al 2015 naciri et al 2020a among these adsorption is widely used because of its efficiency and easy implementation to remove organic and biological pollutants from water arsalan et al 2019 hsini et al 2020a sarkar et al 2015 activated carbon is the most used adsorbent because of its high adsorption capacity aarab et al 2020a hsini et al 2020b khouya et al 2010 however it is relatively expensive and its regeneration is delicate especially when it is applied to large contamination giwa et al 2018 gupta and balomajumder 2015 kacha et al 2003 legrouri et al 2005 marchal et al 2013 accordingly the search for alternative low cost and effective adsorbent materials has been the subject of several recent studies litter et al 2019 maity et al 2018 tripathi and ranjan 2015 in this context we explored the use of an adsorbent material originating from moroccan oil shales extracted from the timahdit region northern morocco oil shale based materials seem to be interesting as efficient adsorbents due to their chemical composition and active functions arsalan et al 2019 chen et al 2010 ichcho et al 2005 their functional sites are related to the arrangement of their mineral and organic components within their structure chen et al 2010 previous research groups have investigated the adsorption process of e coli on activated carbon under different experimental conditions in order to elucidate the parameters that affect the efficiency of this process gupta and balomajumder 2015 mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 rivera utrilla et al 2001 2003 in fact the adsorption of e coli is affected by several factors including temperature ph contact time adsorbent mass bacterial suspension concentration and stirring speed herrera et al 2000 kharchenko et al 2014 owamah 2020 rivera utrilla et al 2001 therefore an optimization process of these factors is needed in order to maximize the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent chakraborty et al 2014 priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 one of the most used methods to optimize the process is the plackett burman experimental plan pbe also called plackett burman design which investigates the reliance of experimental data on a number of independent factors das et al 2015 patil and jena 2015 plackett and burman 1946 ungureanu et al 2015 the method is extremely economical in terms of number of experiments required for the process optimization olivieri and magallanes 2012 priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 in fact it allows with 12 experiments to account for the effect of up to 11 factors unlike the two level factorial design which requires 32 tests for 5 factors 64 for 6 factors etc mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 olivieri and magallanes 2012 the pbe is a well established and widely used statistical method for selecting the most efficient components with high significance levels for further optimization without taking into account interactions between variables priyadharshini and bakthavatsalam 2016 saha et al 2017 the present study aims to examine the performance of an adsorbent material prepared from the moroccan oil shales of the timahdit region layer x to remove the e coli bacteria from contaminated groundwater and to determine the optimum conditions for the maximum adsorption different parameters were studied namely temperature ph contact time adsorbent mass bacterial suspension concentration and stirring speed following some preliminary tests to determine the factors affecting the bacteria adsorption the pbe experimental plan was used to carry out the experiments in order to optimize the adsorption conditions chakraborty et al 2014 mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and equipment the oil shale specimen was collected from layer x in timahdit region northern morocco hydrochloric acid hcl phosphoric acid h3po4 and all other chemicals were from aldrich distilled water was used for the preparation of all test solutions the bacterial strain e coli atcc 35218 was obtained from the laboratory of medical analyses of hassan ii hospital in agadir morocco besides its extensive pathogenicity this strain was selected because it is biologically referenced and standardized by the american type culture collection atcc mariani kurkdjian and bonacorsi 2016 the mass of the samples was measured by the nimbus analytical balances nbl 214i the ph temperature and conductivity were determined by a ph meter equipped with a multi parameter electrode type wtw 522 the stirring speed was evaluated by the heated magnetic stirrer rt2 basic thermo scientific absorbance of the turbidity of the solution was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific multiskan fc 2 2 preparation of adsorbent materials 2 2 1 preparation of the xh precursor the choice of the sedimentary oil shale rocks of timahdit layer x was based on two factors namely the abundance of this material and the composition of the native rock khouya et al 2005 oumam et al 2020 previous studies showed that this material comprises organic matter 20 strongly bound to the mineral portion 80 that consists mainly of carbonates 15 6 calcite 13 8 dolomite clays 26 9 and silicates 23 7 mansouri et al 2018 the mechanical preparation of the collected rocks x was carried out by crushing and grinding the obtained product was sieved to extract the 80 μm fraction of the particles the solid material was then completely decarbonated by mixing 40 g of the sample x with 160 ml of 6 n hcl under continuous stirring 4 h after filtration the residue was washed with distilled water in a soxhlet extractor to remove the acid the obtained product labelled xh was dried in the oven at 110 c after this treatment the precursor xh is essentially composed of organic matter and clay abourriche et al 2013 mahaninia et al 2015 oumam et al 2020 2 2 2 preparation of the xha precursor by activation of xh chemical activation of the obtained matter consists of impregnating the xh precursor in a phosphoric acid 30 70 h3po4 solution diluted in distilled water this novel activation process of oil shales by phosphoric acid was developed by our laboratory during the preparation of the adsorbent from the oil shales of timahdit layer y m elhammoudi et al 2017 khouya et al 2010 the h3po4 xh weight ratio was equal to 1 and the mixture was subjected to a heat treatment from 200 to 450 c and an activation time up to 4 h in air molina sabio and rodrıguez reinoso 2004 nayak et al 2017 nowrouzi et al 2017 the excess acid and other soluble matters were removed with distilled water using a soxhlet extractor mahaninia et al 2015 oumam et al 2020 the obtained product labelled xha was dried at 110 c then sieved chham et al 2018 khouya et al 2010 mansouri et al 2018 2 3 characterization of adsorbent materials 2 3 1 ftir spectroscopy the characteristic bands of the adsorbents were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with bruker tensor 27 in the 400 4000 cm 1 wavenumber range fig 1 presents the ftir spectra of xh and xha comparison of the spectra of the two samples leads to the following remarks the disappearance of the bands at 400 and 550 cm 1 that are typical for branched alkanes in xha elhammoudi et al 2017 the disappearance of the fine bands at 1100 and 1200 cm 1 which are characteristic of the c c elongations aliphatic and aromatic alkanes and the c o elongations in the xha sample respectively the appearance of the bands at 1375 and 1500 cm 1 that correspond to the presence of organic matter in xha moine et al 2018 the intensity decrease of the band around 1700 cm 1 for xha which is specific to the co bonds due to the oxidation of the organic matter elhammoudi et al 2017 moine et al 2018 the intensity reduction of the peaks around 2950 cm 1 that characterize the c h bonds of methyl and methylene groups ch3 ch2 and ch this decrease is due to the oxidation of the organic material during the heat treatment chang et al 2018 moine et al 2018 the lower intensity of the band around 3800 cm 1 massive vibrations of oh is caused by the desiccant effects related to the acid treatment aboulkas et al 2012 chang et al 2018 2 3 2 thermal analyses thermogravimetry tg and differential thermal analysis dta were recorded simultaneously in air using a tga verstherme thermoscientific thermoanalyzer in the 20 900 c range the tg and dta thermograms of xh and xha are given in figs 2 and 3 respectively the thermal evolution of each of xh and xha takes place in two consecutive stages for the xh the first weight loss of ca 15 which occurs between 25 and 200 c is attributed to the evaporation of adsorbed water on the solid surface the second weight loss of up to 75 observed between 200 and 600 c overlaps with two exothermic peaks at 250 and 350 c that can be ascribed to the gradual oxidation of different types of organic matter in the case of xha we note in addition to the water loss the loss of organic matter in a single process which is accompanied by an exothermic peak between 200 and 600 c with its maximum at 470 c this phenomenon is mainly due to the catalytic role of h3po4 in the crosslinking of organic matter and hence its protection against oxidation at low temperatures naciri et al 2019 oumam et al 2020 2 3 3 scanning electron microscopy the morphology of xh and xha was visualized by scanning electron microscopy sem on a hirox sh 4000 m with a magnification of 20 000 the obtained images are represented in fig 4 the examination of the decarbonated precursor xh compared to xha reveals wider grain size resulting from the attack of xh by hcl with lack of porosity in contrast the image of xha exposes the effect of thermal and chemical activation by h3po4 leading to the development of a microstructure with very high homogeneous and well distributed porosity khouya et al 2010 this result reveals the substantial effect of using h3po4 during the activation process of xh on the microstructure of oil shale based materials 2 4 preparation of the bacterial suspension the e coli strain was isolated from a culture that was stored and maintained at 20 c in liquid media trypticase soy broth bts 20 glycerol the strain was subsequently plated in the muller hinton agar medium to obtain young and isolated colonies petri plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the obtained strain was thereafter supplemented with physiological saline then mixed with a vortex zx3 velp scientifica in order to have a microbial suspension with a turbidity close to that of 0 5 mc farland 108 cfu ml aftab et al 2020 aziz et al 2015 suba et al 2019 obtaining this concentration required the modification of the method described by karunakaran and vinayagamoorthy 2016 2 5 adsorption of the bacterium on the material the adsorption tests of the e coli atcc 35218 strain by xha were carried out in batch bottles aarab et al 2020b das et al 2015 each bottle contained a quantity of the adsorbent material added to 100 ml of a bacterial suspension of about 108 cfu ml the experiments effected under aseptic and controlled conditions at a temperature between 20 and 37 c a ph of 3 9 and a stirring speed of 45 150 rpm subsequently 200 μl aliquot samples of the supernatant were taken at pre set times 5 360 min and deposited in a microplate of 96 wells the adsorption tests were repeated three times to control their reproducibility the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a thermo scientific multiskan fc spectrophotometer the quantity of adsorbed bacteria is obtained by calculating the difference between the initial concentration of the bacterial suspension c i and the concentration in the extracted suspension c f at time ti time of the contact between bacteria and xha the percentage removal of the bacteria by the adsorbent material r was calculated using the following equation legrouri et al 2017 zemnukhova et al 2014 1 r c i c f c i 100 2 6 plackett burman

the values of r2 0 955 and adjusted r2 0 901 are close which means that the observed variation is directly related to the effects of the tested factors furthermore these coefficients are close to 1
