experimental data and simulating results in the literature the related phenomena induced by the large amplitude free surface oscillation in narrow gaps are examined numerical comparisons between the single and two box systems suggest that the fluid resonance in the narrow gap can significantly affect the behavior of box system including wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and vertical wave forces of the box system analogous phenomena can also be observed in three box system at the fundamental natural frequency which is generated by the in phase free surface oscillations in narrow gaps at the second natural frequency only a little discrepancy in the results of wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and total wave forces can be observed between two and three box systems the wave forces on each box in three box system are significantly affected by the wave resonance in two gaps including the fundamental and second resonant frequencies keywords fluid resonance narrow gap multi box system wave response hydrodynamic coefficient wave force openfoam 1 introduction fluid resonance in narrow gaps is one of the considerable phenomenon of crucial importance in offshore and ocean engineering when the fluid resonance happens the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can lead to significant variation of hydrodynamic behavior it is a potential threat for the safety of marine operation and maritime structure such as a liquefied natural gas lng carrier alongside a floating liquefied natural gas flng the floating production storage and offloading fpso with a moonpool and the very large floating structure vlfs involving several separated modules many efforts have been focused on this topic including theoretical analysis molin 2001 faltinsen et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 experimental measurement saitoh et al 2006 iwata et al 2007 and numerical simulations sun et al 2010 2015 feng and bai 2015 among others as suggested by a large amount of literature the potential flow model over predicts the free surface oscillation in narrow gaps around the resonant frequency in order to suppress the non physical large amplitude free surface oscillation in narrow gaps various damping terms are introduced into the potential flow model newman 2004 applied the flexible lid condition on the free surface in the narrow gap chen 2004 introduced a dissipative force term into the free surface boundary condition the above modified potential flow models have been adopted in the commercial software wamit and hydrostar a linear semi analytical solution for the gap resonance problem was established by liu and li 2014 in which the dissipative boundary condition was imposed on the free surface in the narrow gap ning et al 2018 developed a time domain potential flow solver according to introducing an artificial viscous coefficient on the fully nonlinear free surface condition feng et al 2018 introduced some dissipative surfaces inside the fluid domain for representing the physical viscous dissipation in which the normal velocity through theses surfaces remains continuous but a pressure drop occurs across them liu and falzarano 2019 proposed a wall damping method to damp out the exaggerated wave elevation in the narrow gap where the energy loss is imposed on the ship hull surface tan et al 2019 however the damping coefficient has to be calibrated by the laboratory observations leading to the problem that the modified potential flow model above can only work well after the experimental measurement in recent years the computational fluid dynamic cfd simulation was paid more attention for the gap resonance problem which is powerful for predicting accurate results and revealing the mechanical essence behind the phenomenon lu et al 2010 modelled the fluid resonance of side by side boxes by using a finite element method based on navier stokes equations numerical simulations indicated that the free surface amplitudes in narrow gaps are closely relevant to the vertical velocity along the gap bottom fredriksen et al 2014 investigated a two dimensional heave twin box section with a moonpool in a wave flume at low forward speed the forward speed can affect the vortex structure in the vicinity of moonpool bottom leading to the decreased piston mode resonance feng et al 2020 conducted an experimental measurement for a three dimensional rectangular box with a moonpool under wave actions in stationary and transit conditions where the forward speed has significant effects on both the piston and sloshing mode resonances the influence of moonpool bottom on fluid resonance was also considered in fredriksen et al 2014 according to the comparison between sharp and convex edge profiles it was reported that there is an increase in damping from sharp edge profile to convex edge profile resulting in the decrease of relative resonant amplitude in moonpool furthermore jiang et al 2019a examined the fluid resonance induced velocity field by various convex appendages including the single and multiple types the flow pattern indicated the vortical motion and vortex shedding in moonpool can be significantly changed by different convex appendages types which is one of the reason for the variation of resonant amplitude moradi et al 2015 studied the two dimensional free surface oscillation in the narrow gap with the sharp and curved corners of gap configurations in which the stronger fluid resonance can be observed in curved corner feng et al 2017 investigated a three dimensional gap resonance for two adjacent rectangular barges with sharp and rounded corners a close examination showed that the large amount of vortices generated by sharp corners disappear in the results of rounded corner which is the essential reason for the discrepancy of resonant responses between two corners the above work demonstrates that the vortical motion and flow separation in the vicinity of gap bottom are two important factors on the free surface resonance in the narrow gap it is straightforward to speculate that the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can extremely affect the hydrodynamic behavior of box system the related phenomena involved in gap resonance have been also attracted more attention recently feng and bai 2017 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of two freely floating or interconnected barges by using a nonlinear decomposition method in the framework of potential flow model the nonlinear effect is highlighted by decomposing the higher harmonic components of nonlinear responses zhao et al 2018a b studied the transient and steady state resonant response of the fluid in narrow gaps under transient wave groups and regular waves the nonlinearity and uncertainties in obtaining the response amplitude operators of resonant fluid motions in narrow gaps were addressed huang et al 2018 investigated the dynamic response of passive telescopic gangway between monohull flotel and fpso in close non parallel proximity in which the physics of various gangway responses such as the extension and rotation was revealed zhao et al 2018c considered the hydrodynamic interaction between the connected side by side vessels with liquid sloshing it is found that the response of vessels are significantly affected by the hydrodynamic interactions between vessels gao et al 2019 examined the variation of the first and higher harmonic components of free surface elevation inside the gap and the wave loads on boxes when resonance happens numerical simulations for non identical side by side boxes and box wall system were investigated jiang et al 2018 and jiang et al 2019b respectively where the energy dissipation induced by the fluid flow rotation and energy transformation associated with free surface motion is addressed gao et al 2019b 2020 further examined the topographic effect on the wave resonance in the box wall system according to the previous work it can be observed that the influence of narrow gap on the behavior of multiple box system are very complicated while the detailed analysis for the related phenomena is still lack of comprehensive understanding the modified potential flow model indicated that hydrodynamic difference between a single body and a multiple body system ning et al 2015a b however the accurate results in their work can be achieved only with great attention to the value of artificial damping in this study the variations of wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces of different box systems are investigated based on the openfoam package in which the naiver stokes equations and the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 are employed for the governing equations and capturing the free surface motion respectively the incident and transmission waves are generated and absorbed by the relaxation zones jacobsen et al 2012 equipped at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively where the internal wave reflections can also be avoided in this method about the basic numerical implementations of cfd simulations in openfoam the readers may refer to jasak 1996 and rusche 2003 more detailed information of the formulations and numerical schemes described above have been given in the previous paper jiang et al 2018 for the purpose of comparison the classical linear potential flow model with higher order boundary element method teng and eatock taylor 1995 is also adopted in this study which can demonstrate the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation on the fluid resonant behavior the main motivation of this study is to investigate the influence of narrow gaps on the behavior of multiple box system especially when gap resonance happens it is carried out according to the comparison between the hydrodynamic phenomena between single and multi box systems by which the mechanism behind the fluid resonance in narrow gasp can be disclosed this paper is structured as follows the definition of geometries in numerical simulations is setup in section 2 after the numerical validation in section 3 the free surface oscillation in narrow gaps is studied in section 4 which is helpful for understanding the discrepancy between different box systems in sections 5 6 and 7 the behavior of wave responses around the box system the hydrodynamic coefficient of box system and wave forces on box system and each box are investigated respectively numerical simulations are focused on the discrepancy between different types of box systems and therefore the influence of large amplitude free surface oscillation in narrow gaps can be obtained finally the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 8 2 numerical setup a sketch of the definition of numerical simulations is illustrated in fig 1 where the wave interactions with the boxes with or without narrow gaps are considered three types of box systems that is the single box system the two box system and the three box system with identical drafts d 0 252 m are placed in the middle of the wave flume with a constant water depth h 0 50 m the breadth of three types of box systems is kept on b 1 60 m which is also the breadth of the box in single box system in two box system non identical breadths b l and b r are adopted for the upstream left and downstream right boxes respectively a narrow gap gap with breadth b g is formed by two boxes where the total length of the system is b l b g b r b as for the three box system identical breadths b s and two gaps gap 1 and gap 2 with the same breadth b g are utilized in which the relationship of 3 b s 2 b g b needs to be satisfied noted that only one of the box systems is situated in waves in each simulation numerical investigations in this work focus on the influence of narrow gaps on the behavior of box systems including the wave responses in narrow gaps and in the vicinity of the structures reflection and transmission coefficients of the box systems and the total wave forces on the box systems and the wave forces on each box three wave gauges g 1 g 3 are located away from the box systems in which g 1 and g 2 with the distance of 0 25 l wave length are used for separating the incident and reflected waves while g 3 is used to record the transmission in the upstream and downstream of the box systems two wave gauges g u and g d are adopted to record the wave responses respectively which are situated 0 005 m away from the vertical wall of the box specially wave gauges also need to be adopted in the middle of narrow gaps for the two box system the wave gauge in the narrow gap is denoted as g p while g p 1 and g p 2 are placed in the gap 1 and gap 2 for the three box system respectively the situations of wave gauges are also depicted in fig 1 in numerical simulations the height of the numerical wave flume is fixed at 1 0 m and the length is closely relevant to the incident wave length l for different geometries two relaxation zones are arranged on the left and right sides of the wave flume which are employed for generating the incident and absorbing the transmission waves respectively generally speaking the length of relaxation zones is kept at 1 5 l 2 0 l and the total length of wave flume is 8 0 l 10 0 l finally the incident wave amplitude is a i 0 012 m in all the simulations in this study 3 numerical validation in order to validate the accuracy of the present viscous numerical wave flume two and three box systems are utilized to simulations the available experimental data in saitoh et al 2006 and iwata et al 2007 and the viscous numerical results by lu et al 2010 2011a 2011b are adopted in which b l b r 0 50 m with b g 0 050 m for the two box system and b s 0 50 m with b g 0 050 m for the three box system are considered in such a scenario the large amplitude piston mode free surface oscillation can be excited when the incident wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of the confined fluid bulk numerical validations are focused on this phenomenon as for the sloshing mode resonance it is not considered in this work because the corresponding natural frequency is out of the adopted incident wave frequency range the mesh resolution tests are carried out by six different meshes for two and three box systems details on the mesh generation have been illustrated in table 1 for the purpose of saving the computing cost non uniform meshes are equipped in the computational domain the square fine meshes with high resolution are adopted around the boxes especially in the vicinity of the gap which is able to account for the boundary layer effect and capture the large amplitude free surface oscillation accurately the coarse rectangular meshes with large aspect ratio up to 1 5 height length are utilized in the relaxation zone of eliminating the transmission wave in the relaxation zone of generating the incident waves and the other parts of the computational domain the square fine meshes with intermediate resolution are employed fig 2 shows typical meshes in the vicinity of the multi box systems which corresponds to mesh 1 in table 1 the potential flow model can generate the variation of wave amplitudes in narrow gaps with the incident wave frequency the exaggerated peak values can be observed in the results by which the corresponding frequencies can be taken as the natural frequencies according to the above analysis the piston modal natural frequencies of the confined fluid bulk in gaps can be evaluated as follows i the two box system has one piston modal natural frequency which is ω 0 5 30 rad s ii the three box system has two piston model natural frequencies which are ω 1 4 90 rad s and ω 2 5 50 rad s respectively fig 3 a shows the normalized free surface amplitude a g a i in the narrow gap between two boxes at wave gauge g p by different mesh resolutions where the incident wave frequencies ω ω 0 and ω ω 0 0 30 rad s are considered the wave amplitude a g in the narrow gap is computed by the averaged value of wave amplitudes in the steady state evolutions numerical simulations indicate that the variation of mesh density has little effect on wave amplitudes if the number of cells exceeds 3 10 5 indicating mesh 4 is able to produce convergent solutions furthermore the mesh convergent tests are extended to three box system in fig 3b and c in which the wave amplitudes in two narrow gaps at g p 1 and g p 2 under three incident frequencies ω 4 90 5 20 and 5 50 rad s are presented again mesh 4 can work well in generating the convergent results and hence it is adopted for all the following numerical computations numerical validations for the two box system with b g 0 050 m b l b r 0 50 m and d 0 252 m under the incident wave amplitude a i 0 012 m are conducted in fig 4 where the present results are compared to the potential flow results experimental results in saitoh et al 2006 and the cfd results in lu et al 2011a b it can be observed that two viscous fluid flow results agree well with the experimental results including wave amplitudes in the narrow gap and the reflection and transmission coefficients of two box system the wave forces in present viscous fluid flow results are also agreement to the finite element method fem results in lu et al 2011b as shown in fig 5 however the potential flow model over predicts the wave amplitude around the resonant frequency in fig 4a fig 4b and c shows the significant minimal and maximal peak values of k r and k t in the potential flow results around the resonant frequency respectively fig 5 indicates that the potential flow model cannot give the accurate results on the wave forces on these boxes the exaggerated resonant free surface oscillation in the narrow gap is the main reason for the inaccurate numerical results in the potential flow model it is believed that the over prediction in the potential flow results are mainly because of the ignorance of fluid viscosity demonstrating the importance of fluid viscosity and the necessity of using the viscous fluid flow model the validations are also carried out for wave responses in two gaps formed by three box system where the box breadth box draft gap breadth and incident wave amplitude are b s 0 50 m d 0 252 m b g 0 050 m a i 0 012 m respectively as shown in fig 6 a and b the comparisons of wave amplitudes in g p 1 and g p 2 are performed between the present numerical results the potential flow solutions the measured data in iwata et al 2007 and numerical results in lu et al 2010 it can be seen from these figures that the potential flow model predicts two peak values at frequencies ω 4 90 and 5 50 rad s which are defined as the fundamental and second resonant frequencies respectively the fundamental resonant frequency can also be called the first resonant frequency analogous with two box system the potential flow model over predicts the free surface amplitudes around resonant frequencies moreover laboratory observations suggested that the typical two peak behavior can only be observed in gap 1 the second resonant amplitude in gap 2 predicted by the potential flow model even disappears in fig 6b the non physical ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation is the reason of above inaccuracy again the viscous fluid flow model is able to agree well with the experimental and numerical results in iwata et al 2007 and lu et al 2010 indicating the present numerical model can predict the accurate wave responses in narrow gaps for the three box system furthermore the wave forces on three box system between the present viscous fluid flow model the available finite element method fem numerical results in lu et al 2010 and the linear potential flow solutions are compared in fig 7 reasonable agreement between the present model and fem model can be obtained confirming that the present numerical wave flume can work well in predicting wave forces on three box system the over prediction in potential flow results can be observed again demonstrating the indispensable of the viscous fluid model according to all the comparisons in figs 4 7 it can be confirmed that the present viscous numerical model is able to work well in producing the accurate results for hydrodynamic analysis of multi box systems 4 wave responses in narrow gaps the above viscous numerical wave flume is adopted to investigate wave interactions with box systems with and without narrow gaps which are denoted as single box and multi box systems respectively in numerical simulations the breadths b of multi box systems are the same with that of the single box system the breadths of narrow gaps are kept on b g 0 050 m the breadths of boxes in multi box systems are changing in accordance with simulation requirements as tabulated in table 2 one single box system case a three two box systems cases b c d and one three box system case e are considered in this work it should be noted that gap positions in cases b and d are the positions of gap 1 and gap 2 in case e for three box system respectively in case c the position of the gap is in the middle of two box system in which the relationship b l b r is satisfied more detailed parameters are illustrated in table 2 the resonant frequencies of fluid bulk in narrow gaps are also illustrated in the table which is computed by the potential flow model in this section numerical simulations are carried out for free surface amplitudes in narrow gaps of multi box systems the objective of the simulations is to examine the resonant behavior of fluid bulk in narrow gaps which is helpful for understanding the discrepancy between the single box and multi box systems and between the two box and three box systems fig 8 shows the variation of wave amplitudes in the narrow gap with the incident wave frequency for the three two box systems i e cases b d it can be seen from fig 8a c that the potential flow model can work well in predicting the resonant frequency of wave response in the narrow gap however the significant over predicted free surface amplitude in the narrow gap can also be observed in the potential flow results around the resonant frequency the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation by the potential flow model is the main reason if the incident wave frequency is deviated from the resonant frequency the potential flow model is able to produce the accurate wave amplitude in the narrow gap the relatively small free surface oscillation in the narrow gap and the slow rotational flow in the neighborhood of the gap region can be obtained indicating that the influence of vortical flow and energy dissipation is negligible at these lower or higher frequencies the comparison of wave amplitudes in the narrow gap between the three two box systems is depicted in fig 8 d numerical simulations suggest that the resonant frequencies of the three two box systems are nearly the same while the resonant amplitudes decrease when the narrow gap moves from the front to the back of the box system that is from case b to case d moreover the influence of gap position can also be observed when the incident wave frequency is outside a certain band at either side of the resonant frequency the decreased wave amplitudes in the narrow gap at non resonant frequencies can be obtained following the sequence form case b to case d according to the comparison the gap position is important for the behavior of two box system not only around the resonant frequency but also at some non resonant frequencies numerical simulations are further carried out for wave responses in two gaps of the three box system which is case e in table 2 as shown in fig 9 a and b the potential flow model can firstly manifest a general impression for the variation of wave amplitudes in g p 1 and g p 2 with the incident wave frequency in difference to the behavior of two box with one gap system the variation of wave amplitudes in the narrow gaps has two peak values implying that the significant large amplitude free surface oscillation occurs at two distinct frequencies the double peak variation can be attributed to the existence of two gaps in the three box system which can be explained according to the motion equation of multi mass spring system for the free surface oscillation theoretically from this figure the two peaks are at frequencies of ω 4 90 and 5 50 rad s in the potential flow results which are defined as fundamental and second resonant frequencies respectively again the potential flow model over predicts the wave amplitudes around resonant frequencies moreover the viscous numerical model shows that the typical two peak behavior can only be observed in gap 1 in fig 9a the second resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 2 in gap 2 almost disappears in fig 9b all these phenomena are due to the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation by the potential flow model around the frequencies between the fundamental and second resonant frequencies the wave amplitudes are under estimated by the potential flow model it can also be observed in the experimental and numerical results in iwata et al 2007 and lu et al 2010 which might be from the local near field wave wave and wave body interactions fig 9c shows the comparison of wave amplitudes between two narrow gaps the wave amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 is always larger than those at wave gauge g p 2 at the scopes of low and high frequency ranges around the fundamental resonant frequency the peak value of resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 is a g a i 4 946 slightly larger than that of a g a i 4 572 at wave gauge g p 2 the wave amplitude in gap 1 shows the peak value a g a i 3 043 at the second natural frequency ω 5 60 rad s although the peak value in gap 2 disappears the values of wave amplitude at wave gauge g p 2 around the frequency almost has the same magnitude with the resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 for example the normalized wave amplitudes a g a i are 3 412 and 3 015 at frequencies ω 5 30 and 5 40 rad s respectively in the region between the fundamental and second natural frequencies the wave amplitude at gap 2 is larger than that at gap 1 all these phenomena indicate the difference of resonant behavior between two gaps in three box system in order to further understand the wave responses in narrow gaps of three box system time signals recorded by wave gauges g p 1 and g p 2 around the fundamental and second resonant frequencies are depicted in fig 10 the in phase relationship between the free surface evolutions in two gaps around the fundamental resonant frequency can be observed in fig 10a while the out of phase relationship between them around the second resonant frequency can be obtained in fig 10b it is also analogues with the motion equation of multi mass spring system in which the fundamental and second piston modes of the free surface oscillations correspond to the first and second order vibration modes of the multi mass spring system respectively the first and second order principal modes are in phase and out of phase respectively further comparison in fig 10b indicates the phase difference between the time signals are not out of phase precisely it is agreement with the damped mass spring system where the second order higher order vibration mode is easier affected by the damping action according to the analysis in this section it can be summarized that the two box system with one gap has one piston model natural frequency while the three box system with two gaps has two piston modal resonant frequencies when the incident wave frequencies are close to the resonant frequencies the extremely large amplitude fluid resonance can be excited in narrow gaps whereas the essential discrepancy of the resonant behavior between the two box and three box systems and between the fundamental and second resonant frequencies of three box system can be observed it can be speculated that the large amplitude piston modal resonance in narrow gaps can significantly affect the behavior of the multi box systems which will be investigated in the following sections 5 wave responses around the box systems the influence of narrow gaps on wave responses around the box system is investigated in this section where wave amplitudes can be measured by wave gauges g u and g d fig 11 shows the variation of free surface amplitudes with the incident wave frequency in the upstream and downstream of box systems including the comparison between the single and multi box systems general comparison suggests that the existence of narrow gaps can significantly affect the wave responses around the box system in single box system the variations of wave amplitudes at g u and g d are increase and decrease monotonously with the incident wave frequency respectively the potential flow model can also work well indicating the fluid viscosity and flow rotation are insignificant for the single box system however the peak values appear in the results of multi box systems where the potential flow model over predicts and under estimates the free surface amplitudes in the upstream and downstream of the systems around the resonant frequency respectively the exaggerated resonant amplitudes in narrow gaps are the main reason for the inaccurate results at g u and g d by the potential flow model which are essentially due to the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation in the potential flow theory analogous with the wave amplitude at g p 2 in fig 9b the second peak values of the maximal and minimal wave amplitudes at wave gauges g u and g d predicted by the potential flow model around ω 5 50 rad s also disappear in viscous fluid flow results the above comparisons indicate that the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation is indispensable for wave responses around the multi box systems with narrow gaps the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauge g u between three two box systems are depicted in fig 12 a the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap needs to be supported by the wave energy from the incident wave that is more wave energy is absorbed to support the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap leading to the decrease of wave response in the upstream of the two box system as illustrated in fig 8d the resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p increases when the narrow gap moves from the back to front of box system correspondingly the decrease of minimal peak value of wave amplitude at wave gauge g u can be observed following the sequence of cases d c b in fig 12a as for the wave amplitude at wave gauge g d in fig 12b the influence of gap position is not remarkable for three two box systems fig 12c and d show the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauges g u and g d between the cases a b and e respectively noted that the discrepancy of geometries between the single and two box systems is the additional gap 1 in case b while between the two and three box systems is the additional gap 2 in case e from these figures the discrepancy between the single and multi box systems can be observed not only around the resonant frequency but also at some ranges of non resonant frequency in the regions of low frequency range wave amplitudes at g u and g d of multi box system are smaller and larger than that of single box system respectively at the range of high frequency wave amplitudes give rise to zero for multi box system when ω 5 80 rad s while single box system results approach to zero until ω 8 00 rad s the comparisons between the two and three box systems suggest that the differences are mainly around the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental frequency of three box system as illustrated in fig 12c the minimal peak value of wave amplitude at wave gauge g u of case b is a g a i 1 693 at the resonant frequency which is slightly larger than that of a g a i 1 529 for case e at the fundamental natural frequency in the downstream of the box systems the maximal wave amplitude of case d is nearly double than that of case b in fig 12d however around the second resonant frequency ω 5 50 rad s of three box system the viscous fluid flow model suggests wave amplitudes at g u and g d between the cases b and e are nearly the same it indicates the insignificant effect of the second resonant wave frequency on wave responses around the three box system roughly speaking the behavior of wave responses at g u and g d between two and three box systems is similar because the single peak variation of wave amplitudes can be observed in both of them 6 reflection and transmission coefficients of the box systems further examinations are extended to the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t of various single and multi box systems fig 13 shows the variation of k r and k t of multi box systems with the incident wave frequency including the comparison with the results of single box system the discrepancy between the single box and multi box systems is major in the region of resonant frequency where the significant peak values of k r and k t can be observed in multi box systems similar to wave responses around the box systems the potential flow model can work well in single box system while the accurate reflection and transmission coefficients cannot be obtained around the resonant frequency numerical simulations in fig 13a c suggest that the peak value in transmission coefficient by the viscous fluid flow model is always smaller than that by the potential flow model around the resonant frequency in two box systems the transmission coefficient is closely relevant to the free surface amplitude in the narrow gap in which the large amplitude piston like fluid oscillation can be taken as a radiation source for the downstream wave it can lead to the transmission wave and result in the peak value of transmission coefficient therefore the exaggerated resonant amplitude in the narrow gap in fig 8 is the reason of generating the over prediction of transmission coefficient in fig 13a c by the potential flow model as for the three box system in fig 13d the significant increase of transmission wave is mainly induced by the resonant fluid motion in gap 2 therefore the peak value of transmission coefficient can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency while it disappears around the second natural frequency as for the reflection coefficient k r in fig 13a c the discrepancy between the potential flow and the viscous fluid flow results is different for various gap positions of two box systems in the potential flow model the exaggerated wave resonance in the narrow gap needs to be supported by the energy from incident wave in the viscous fluid flow model the incident wave energy is adopted to support the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap and the significant energy dissipation in the gap region as shown in fig 13a the reflection coefficient in the viscous fluid flow result is always smaller than that in potential flow result around the resonant frequency indicating the free surface oscillation and energy dissipation in the viscous fluid flow model need more wave energy oppositely fig 13c shows the larger reflection coefficient around the resonant frequency by the viscous fluid flow model than that by the potential flow model this implies that the exaggerated fluid motion in the narrow gap in the potential flow results should be supported by more wave energy as for case c in fig 13b where the gap position is in the middle of the two box system the reflection coefficient has both characteristics of cases b and d that is the potential flow model under estimates the reflection coefficient at the resonant frequency while the over prediction in potential flow results can be observed when the frequency is a bit away from the resonant frequency the position of narrow gap is the major reason for all these phenomena above the reflection coefficient in the three box system is depicted in fig 13d where the two peak variation with the incident wave frequency can be observed in the potential flow results at the fundamental resonant frequency the viscous fluid flow model predicts the larger minimal reflection coefficient than that by the potential flow model indicating less wave energy is absorbed into the box system due to the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation the two peak variation of reflection coefficient with the incident wave frequency can be observed in the viscous fluid flow results this is the reason that the reflection coefficient of three box system is closely relevant to the fluid resonance in gap 1 where the large amplitude piston type free surface oscillation happen at the fundamental and second natural frequencies in difference to the results at the fundamental resonant frequency the reflection coefficient by the viscous fluid flow model is smaller than that by the potential flow model around the second natural frequency it implies the effect of fluid viscosity and flow rotation can lead to more wave energy is absorbed from the incident wave to support the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation and significant energy dissipation at the second resonant frequency the comparison of reflection and transmission coefficients between three two box systems are depicted in fig 14 a and b based on the linear potential flow theory the values of k r and k t of cases b and d should be the same with each other at all the frequencies which can be observed by the present potential flow model in viscous fluid flow results the insignificant effect of gap position on the transmission coefficient can be observed in fig 14b as for the reflection coefficient k r in fig 14a numerical simulation suggests that the value of k r decreases dramatically when the narrow gap moves from the back to the front of the two box system that is from cases d to b correspondingly the decreased energy coefficient e k r 2 k t 2 can be observed in fig 14c following the above sequence by summarizing the results illustrated in figs 8d and 14a 14c the case b that is the position of gap is in the front of the two box system can generate the largest resonant amplitude in the narrow gap and more significant energy dissipation the wave resonance and energy dissipation are supported by the incident wave leading to the smallest reflection coefficient around the resonant frequency the reflection transmission and energy coefficients of the single two and three box systems are compared in fig 14d f according to compare the reflection coefficients in fig 14d the minimal peak value can be obtained in the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system this can be understood that more wave energy is required to support the significant fluid resonant motion in two gaps fig 14e shows the maximal transmission coefficient also appears at the first resonant frequency of three box system indicating the in phase oscillations of fluid bulk in two gaps can result in the stronger radiation action than that of two box system with one narrow gap furthermore fig 14f depicts that the minimal energy coefficient of case e at the fundamental natural frequency is larger than that of case b at the resonant frequency implying the relative energy dissipation of case e is smaller than that of case b around the second resonant frequency of three box system although the small peak values can be observed in the reflection and dissipation coefficients in fig 14d and f the magnitudes of them are nearly the same with those of case b in addition the value of transmission coefficient at the second resonant frequency of three box system is also very close to that of two box system in fig 14f in summary the discrepancy of the hydrodynamic coefficient is mainly around the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system which is mainly from the fluid resonance in narrow gaps 7 wave forces on the box systems with and without gaps in this section numerical investigations are carried out for investigating the behavior of wave forces including the wave force on each box in multi box systems and total wave force on box system the comparison of horizontal wave forces on each box in two box system is illustrated in fig 15 while the comparison of horizontal total wave forces between single and two box systems is shown in fig 16 as illustrated in fig 15 the significant variation of wave force on each box in two box system can be observed around the resonant frequency which is mainly induced by the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap the comparison in fig 16b can suggest that the horizontal total wave forces on cases a and c are nearly the same including the potential flow and viscous fluid flow results this is the reason that the piston modal resonance induced horizontal wave forces on each box are canceled out with each other analogous phenomena can also be observed in the horizontal wave forces results of cases b and d although a little discrepancy of total wave forces between the single and two box systems can be observed in fig 16a and c generally speaking the influence of narrow gap on horizontal total wave force on two box system is not remarkable in preset study fig 17 illustrates the variation of vertical wave force on each box with the incident wave frequency including the total wave force on two box system the potential flow model over predicts the wave forces around the resonant frequency which is also essentially due to the exaggerated free surface oscillation in narrow gaps under the inviscid fluid and irrotational flow more detailed comparisons in these figures indicate the relationship of f v t f v l f v r especially around the resonant condition the above relationship implies the in phase relationship between vertical wave forces f v l and f v r on boxes l and r which can be confirmed by the comparison of vertical force evolutions the resonant frequencies in fig 18 based on bernoulli equation the vertical wave force on the box is major from the fluid velocity around the box bottom the large amplitude piston like fluid oscillation in the narrow gap is able to significantly affect the flow field around the bottom of the box which is the reason for above phenomena furthermore fig 19 shows the remarkable discrepancy of vertical total wave forces between the single and two box systems which can be observed in the regions of both the resonant and non resonant frequencies all these numerical simulations suggest that the addition of narrow gap can significantly affect the behavior of vertical wave forces variations of horizontal wave forces on three box system are examined in fig 20 including the wave forces on each box and the total wave force on the system numerical simulations in fig 20a suggest the two peak variation in the results of wave forces on box a around the fundamental and second resonant frequencies which is induced by the large amplitude wave resonance in gap 1 at the corresponding natural frequencies however there is no peak value at the fundamental natural frequency for the wave forces on box b that is only one peak value can be observed at the second resonant frequency the in phase and out of phase relationships of free surface oscillations in gap 1 and gap 2 are the main reason for the occurrence and disappearance of peak values as for box c the significant increase of wave forces around two resonant frequencies can be observed in the potential flow model while it disappears at the second natural frequency in the viscous fluid flow results it can be understood that the horizontal wave force on box c is closely dependent on the free surface oscillation in gap 2 which is accordance to the numerical results in figs 9b and 20a above analysis can also be adopted to explain the discrepancy between the horizontal wave forces between the total horizontal wave forces on single and three box systems in fig 20b numerical simulations suggest that the discrepancy mainly occurs around the second natural frequency while little difference can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency generally the influence of narrow gaps on the horizontal wave forces is small fig 21 depicts the variation of vertical wave forces on three box system with the incident wave frequency in the potential flow results the significant peak values of vertical wave forces on each box can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency as shown in fig 21a correspondingly the maximal vertical wave force also appears at the total wave forces around the second natural frequency the potential flow model only predicts the maximal peak values on f v a and f v c however there is no peak value in the total vertical wave force on three box system implying that the vertical wave forces on boxes a and c are canceled out with each other the viscous fluid flow model can further indicates the real physical phenomena of wave forces on boxes generally speaking the significant increase of vertical wave forces on each box can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency the relationship of f v t f v a f v b f v c can be observed which can be explained by the in phase relationship of vertical force evolution between different boxes in fig 22 a however around the second natural frequency the peak values predicted by the potential flow model disappear including f v a and f v c fig 21b shows the comparison of vertical total wave force on the single two and three box systems that is cases a b and e the variation of vertical total wave force on the single and multiple box systems shows the monotone decrease and dramatic change with the incident wave frequency respectively it implies that the existence of narrow gap is able to significant affect the behavior of total vertical wave force on the box system however vertical wave forces between two and three box systems have the similar characteristic in the figure the single peak variation in vertical forces can be observed at the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system respectively around the second resonant frequency of three box system the vertical force is quite small which is also similar with that of two box system the time history results in fig 22b shows the boxes a and c have the 180 phase difference while box b is also different with others the above relationship is mainly due to the out phase fluids motion in the two gaps leading to an extremely low value of total vertical wave force amplitude therefore the total vertical force on three box system is hardly affected by the second piston modal resonance only the discrepancy between them is the peak value of vertical force on three box system is larger than that on two box system the additional gap 2 is able to increase the total vertical force on the box system 8 conclusion in this work the hydrodynamic behavior of box systems with and without narrow gaps is investigated by employing a numerical wave flume based on openfoam package the naiver stokes equations and the vof interface capture technique are employed which is able to account for the influence of vortical flow and large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap for the purpose of comparison the conventional potential flow model is also included in the simulation validations is carried out by comparing with available experimental data and simulating results in the literature demonstrating that the present numerical model can work well in predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of box systems the fluid resonance can be observed when the incident wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of fluid bulk in the narrow gap formed by the two box system the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can lead to the decrease and increase of wave responses in the upstream and downstream of the two box system analogous behavior can also be observed in the reflection and transmission coefficients numerical simulation indicates that the wave resonance in the narrow gap is able to increase the horizontal and vertical wave forces on each box around resonant frequency the fluid resonance in the narrow gap can also significantly affect the total vertical wave forces on two box systems while the influence on total horizontal wave forces is not remarkable numerical simulations for three box system indicate in phase and out of phase large amplitude free surface oscillations in two gaps at the fundamental and second natural frequencies the comparisons suggest that the in phase free surface oscillations of three box system at the fundamental resonant frequency is able to generate the similar behavior of wave resonance of two box system that is the significant decrease and increase of reflection and transmission coefficients of three box systems respectively and the similar phenomena of wave responses in the upstream and downstream of box system the fundamental wave resonance can also lead to the dramatical increase of total wave force on the three box system whereas the influence on the total horizontal vertical wave force is quite small around the second natural frequency only a little discrepancy between two and three box systems can be observed including the wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and total wave forces however the wave forces on each box in three box system are closely relevant to the wave resonance in two gaps including the fundamental and second resonant

box system wave response hydrodynamic coefficient wave force openfoam 1 introduction fluid resonance in narrow gaps is one of the considerable phenomenon of crucial importance in offshore and ocean engineering when the fluid resonance happens the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can lead to significant variation of hydrodynamic behavior it is a potential threat for the safety of marine operation and maritime structure such as a liquefied natural gas lng carrier alongside a floating liquefied natural gas flng the floating production storage and offloading fpso with a moonpool and the very large floating structure vlfs involving several separated modules many efforts have been focused on this topic including theoretical analysis molin 2001 faltinsen et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 experimental measurement saitoh et al 2006 iwata et al 2007 and numerical simulations sun et al 2010 2015 feng and bai 2015 among others as suggested by a large amount of literature the potential flow model over predicts the free surface oscillation in narrow gaps around the resonant frequency in order to suppress the non physical large amplitude free surface oscillation in narrow gaps various damping terms are introduced into the potential flow model newman 2004 applied the flexible lid condition on the free surface in the narrow gap chen 2004 introduced a dissipative force term into the free surface boundary condition the above modified potential flow models have been adopted in the commercial software wamit and hydrostar a linear semi analytical solution for the gap resonance problem was established by liu and li 2014 in which the dissipative boundary condition was imposed on the free surface in the narrow gap ning et al 2018 developed a time domain potential flow solver according to introducing an artificial viscous coefficient on the fully nonlinear free surface condition feng et al 2018 introduced some dissipative surfaces inside the fluid domain for representing the physical viscous dissipation in which the normal velocity through theses surfaces remains continuous but a pressure drop occurs across them liu and falzarano 2019 proposed a wall damping method to damp out the exaggerated wave elevation in the narrow gap where the energy loss is imposed on the ship hull surface tan et al 2019 however the damping coefficient has to be calibrated by the laboratory observations leading to the problem that the modified potential flow model above can only work well after the experimental measurement in recent years the computational fluid dynamic cfd simulation was paid more attention for the gap resonance problem which is powerful for predicting accurate results and revealing the mechanical essence behind the phenomenon lu et al 2010 modelled the fluid resonance of side by side boxes by using a finite element method based on navier stokes equations numerical simulations indicated that the free surface amplitudes in narrow gaps are closely relevant to the vertical velocity along the gap bottom fredriksen et al 2014 investigated a two dimensional heave twin box section with a moonpool in a wave flume at low forward speed the forward speed can affect the vortex structure in the vicinity of moonpool bottom leading to the decreased piston mode resonance feng et al 2020 conducted an experimental measurement for a three dimensional rectangular box with a moonpool under wave actions in stationary and transit conditions where the forward speed has significant effects on both the piston and sloshing mode resonances the influence of moonpool bottom on fluid resonance was also considered in fredriksen et al 2014 according to the comparison between sharp and convex edge profiles it was reported that there is an increase in damping from sharp edge profile to convex edge profile resulting in the decrease of relative resonant amplitude in moonpool furthermore jiang et al 2019a examined the fluid resonance induced velocity field by various convex appendages including the single and multiple types the flow pattern indicated the vortical motion and vortex shedding in moonpool can be significantly changed by different convex appendages types which is one of the reason for the variation of resonant amplitude moradi et al 2015 studied the two dimensional free surface oscillation in the narrow gap with the sharp and curved corners of gap configurations in which the stronger fluid resonance can be observed in curved corner feng et al 2017 investigated a three dimensional gap resonance for two adjacent rectangular barges with sharp and rounded corners a close examination showed that the large amount of vortices generated by sharp corners disappear in the results of rounded corner which is the essential reason for the discrepancy of resonant responses between two corners the above work demonstrates that the vortical motion and flow separation in the vicinity of gap bottom are two important factors on the free surface resonance in the narrow gap it is straightforward to speculate that the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can extremely affect the hydrodynamic behavior of box system the related phenomena involved in gap resonance have been also attracted more attention recently feng and bai 2017 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of two freely floating or interconnected barges by using a nonlinear decomposition method in the framework of potential flow model the nonlinear effect is highlighted by decomposing the higher harmonic components of nonlinear responses zhao et al 2018a b studied the transient and steady state resonant response of the fluid in narrow gaps under transient wave groups and regular waves the nonlinearity and uncertainties in obtaining the response amplitude operators of resonant fluid motions in narrow gaps were addressed huang et al 2018 investigated the dynamic response of passive telescopic gangway between monohull flotel and fpso in close non parallel proximity in which the physics of various gangway responses such as the extension and rotation was revealed zhao et al 2018c considered the hydrodynamic interaction between the connected side by side vessels with liquid sloshing it is found that the response of vessels are significantly affected by the hydrodynamic interactions between vessels gao et al 2019 examined the variation of the first and higher harmonic components of free surface elevation inside the gap and the wave loads on boxes when resonance happens numerical simulations for non identical side by side boxes and box wall system were investigated jiang et al 2018 and jiang et al 2019b respectively where the energy dissipation induced by the fluid flow rotation and energy transformation associated with free surface motion is addressed gao et al 2019b 2020 further examined the topographic effect on the wave resonance in the box wall system according to the previous work it can be observed that the influence of narrow gap on the behavior of multiple box system are very complicated while the detailed analysis for the related phenomena is still lack of comprehensive understanding the modified potential flow model indicated that hydrodynamic difference between a single body and a multiple body system ning et al 2015a b however the accurate results in their work can be achieved only with great attention to the value of artificial damping in this study the variations of wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces of different box systems are investigated based on the openfoam package in which the naiver stokes equations and the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 are employed for the governing equations and capturing the free surface motion respectively the incident and transmission waves are generated and absorbed by the relaxation zones jacobsen et al 2012 equipped at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively where the internal wave reflections can also be avoided in this method about the basic numerical implementations of cfd simulations in openfoam the readers may refer to jasak 1996 and rusche 2003 more detailed information of the formulations and numerical schemes described above have been given in the previous paper jiang et al 2018 for the purpose of comparison the classical linear potential flow model with higher order boundary element method teng and eatock taylor 1995 is also adopted in this study which can demonstrate the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation on the fluid resonant behavior the main motivation of this study is to investigate the influence of narrow gaps on the behavior of multiple box system especially when gap resonance happens it is carried out according to the comparison between the hydrodynamic phenomena between single and multi box systems by which the mechanism behind the fluid resonance in narrow gasp can be disclosed this paper is structured as follows the definition of geometries in numerical simulations is setup in section 2 after the numerical validation in section 3 the free surface oscillation in narrow gaps is studied in section 4 which is helpful for understanding the discrepancy between different box systems in sections 5 6 and 7 the behavior of wave responses around the box system the hydrodynamic coefficient of box system and wave forces on box system and each box are investigated respectively numerical simulations are focused on the discrepancy between different types of box systems and therefore the influence of large amplitude free surface oscillation in narrow gaps can be obtained finally the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 8 2 numerical setup a sketch of the definition of numerical simulations is illustrated in fig 1 where the wave interactions with the boxes with or without narrow gaps are considered three types of box systems that is the single box system the two box system and the three box system with identical drafts d 0 252 m are placed in the middle of the wave flume with a constant water depth h 0 50 m the breadth of three types of box systems is kept on b 1 60 m which is also the breadth of the box in single box system in two box system non identical breadths b l and b r are adopted for the upstream left and downstream right boxes respectively a narrow gap gap with breadth b g is formed by two boxes where the total length of the system is b l b g b r b as for the three box system identical breadths b s and two gaps gap 1 and gap 2 with the same breadth b g are utilized in which the relationship of 3 b s 2 b g b needs to be satisfied noted that only one of the box systems is situated in waves in each simulation numerical investigations in this work focus on the influence of narrow gaps on the behavior of box systems including the wave responses in narrow gaps and in the vicinity of the structures reflection and transmission coefficients of the box systems and the total wave forces on the box systems and the wave forces on each box three wave gauges g 1 g 3 are located away from the box systems in which g 1 and g 2 with the distance of 0 25 l wave length are used for separating the incident and reflected waves while g 3 is used to record the transmission in the upstream and downstream of the box systems two wave gauges g u and g d are adopted to record the wave responses respectively which are situated 0 005 m away from the vertical wall of the box specially wave gauges also need to be adopted in the middle of narrow gaps for the two box system the wave gauge in the narrow gap is denoted as g p while g p 1 and g p 2 are placed in the gap 1 and gap 2 for the three box system respectively the situations of wave gauges are also depicted in fig 1 in numerical simulations the height of the numerical wave flume is fixed at 1 0 m and the length is closely relevant to the incident wave length l for different geometries two relaxation zones are arranged on the left and right sides of the wave flume which are employed for generating the incident and absorbing the transmission waves respectively generally speaking the length of relaxation zones is kept at 1 5 l 2 0 l and the total length of wave flume is 8 0 l 10 0 l finally the incident wave amplitude is a i 0 012 m in all the simulations in this study 3 numerical validation in order to validate the accuracy of the present viscous numerical wave flume two and three box systems are utilized to simulations the available experimental data in saitoh et al 2006 and iwata et al 2007 and the viscous numerical results by lu et al 2010 2011a 2011b are adopted in which b l b r 0 50 m with b g 0 050 m for the two box system and b s 0 50 m with b g 0 050 m for the three box system are considered in such a scenario the large amplitude piston mode free surface oscillation can be excited when the incident wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of the confined fluid bulk numerical validations are focused on this phenomenon as for the sloshing mode resonance it is not considered in this work because the corresponding natural frequency is out of the adopted incident wave frequency range the mesh resolution tests are carried out by six different meshes for two and three box systems details on the mesh generation have been illustrated in table 1 for the purpose of saving the computing cost non uniform meshes are equipped in the computational domain the square fine meshes with high resolution are adopted around the boxes especially in the vicinity of the gap which is able to account for the boundary layer effect and capture the large amplitude free surface oscillation accurately the coarse rectangular meshes with large aspect ratio up to 1 5 height length are utilized in the relaxation zone of eliminating the transmission wave in the relaxation zone of generating the incident waves and the other parts of the computational domain the square fine meshes with intermediate resolution are employed fig 2 shows typical meshes in the vicinity of the multi box systems which corresponds to mesh 1 in table 1 the potential flow model can generate the variation of wave amplitudes in narrow gaps with the incident wave frequency the exaggerated peak values can be observed in the results by which the corresponding frequencies can be taken as the natural frequencies according to the above analysis the piston modal natural frequencies of the confined fluid bulk in gaps can be evaluated as follows i the two box system has one piston modal natural frequency which is ω 0 5 30 rad s ii the three box system has two piston model natural frequencies which are ω 1 4 90 rad s and ω 2 5 50 rad s respectively fig 3 a shows the normalized free surface amplitude a g a i in the narrow gap between two boxes at wave gauge g p by different mesh resolutions where the incident wave frequencies ω ω 0 and ω ω 0 0 30 rad s are considered the wave amplitude a g in the narrow gap is computed by the averaged value of wave amplitudes in the steady state evolutions numerical simulations indicate that the variation of mesh density has little effect on wave amplitudes if the number of cells exceeds 3 10 5 indicating mesh 4 is able to produce convergent solutions furthermore the mesh convergent tests are extended to three box system in fig 3b and c in which the wave amplitudes in two narrow gaps at g p 1 and g p 2 under three incident frequencies ω 4 90 5 20 and 5 50 rad s are presented again mesh 4 can work well in generating the convergent results and hence it is adopted for all the following numerical computations numerical validations for the two box system with b g 0 050 m b l b r 0 50 m and d 0 252 m under the incident wave amplitude a i 0 012 m are conducted in fig 4 where the present results are compared to the potential flow results experimental results in saitoh et al 2006 and the cfd results in lu et al 2011a b it can be observed that two viscous fluid flow results agree well with the experimental results including wave amplitudes in the narrow gap and the reflection and transmission coefficients of two box system the wave forces in present viscous fluid flow results are also agreement to the finite element method fem results in lu et al 2011b as shown in fig 5 however the potential flow model over predicts the wave amplitude around the resonant frequency in fig 4a fig 4b and c shows the significant minimal and maximal peak values of k r and k t in the potential flow results around the resonant frequency respectively fig 5 indicates that the potential flow model cannot give the accurate results on the wave forces on these boxes the exaggerated resonant free surface oscillation in the narrow gap is the main reason for the inaccurate numerical results in the potential flow model it is believed that the over prediction in the potential flow results are mainly because of the ignorance of fluid viscosity demonstrating the importance of fluid viscosity and the necessity of using the viscous fluid flow model the validations are also carried out for wave responses in two gaps formed by three box system where the box breadth box draft gap breadth and incident wave amplitude are b s 0 50 m d 0 252 m b g 0 050 m a i 0 012 m respectively as shown in fig 6 a and b the comparisons of wave amplitudes in g p 1 and g p 2 are performed between the present numerical results the potential flow solutions the measured data in iwata et al 2007 and numerical results in lu et al 2010 it can be seen from these figures that the potential flow model predicts two peak values at frequencies ω 4 90 and 5 50 rad s which are defined as the fundamental and second resonant frequencies respectively the fundamental resonant frequency can also be called the first resonant frequency analogous with two box system the potential flow model over predicts the free surface amplitudes around resonant frequencies moreover laboratory observations suggested that the typical two peak behavior can only be observed in gap 1 the second resonant amplitude in gap 2 predicted by the potential flow model even disappears in fig 6b the non physical ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation is the reason of above inaccuracy again the viscous fluid flow model is able to agree well with the experimental and numerical results in iwata et al 2007 and lu et al 2010 indicating the present numerical model can predict the accurate wave responses in narrow gaps for the three box system furthermore the wave forces on three box system between the present viscous fluid flow model the available finite element method fem numerical results in lu et al 2010 and the linear potential flow solutions are compared in fig 7 reasonable agreement between the present model and fem model can be obtained confirming that the present numerical wave flume can work well in predicting wave forces on three box system the over prediction in potential flow results can be observed again demonstrating the indispensable of the viscous fluid model according to all the comparisons in figs 4 7 it can be confirmed that the present viscous numerical model is able to work well in producing the accurate results for hydrodynamic analysis of multi box systems 4 wave responses in narrow gaps the above viscous numerical wave flume is adopted to investigate wave interactions with box systems with and without narrow gaps which are denoted as single box and multi box systems respectively in numerical simulations the breadths b of multi box systems are the same with that of the single box system the breadths of narrow gaps are kept on b g 0 050 m the breadths of boxes in multi box systems are changing in accordance with simulation requirements as tabulated in table 2 one single box system case a three two box systems cases b c d and one three box system case e are considered in this work it should be noted that gap positions in cases b and d are the positions of gap 1 and gap 2 in case e for three box system respectively in case c the position of the gap is in the middle of two box system in which the relationship b l b r is satisfied more detailed parameters are illustrated in table 2 the resonant frequencies of fluid bulk in narrow gaps are also illustrated in the table which is computed by the potential flow model in this section numerical simulations are carried out for free surface amplitudes in narrow gaps of multi box systems the objective of the simulations is to examine the resonant behavior of fluid bulk in narrow gaps which is helpful for understanding the discrepancy between the single box and multi box systems and between the two box and three box systems fig 8 shows the variation of wave amplitudes in the narrow gap with the incident wave frequency for the three two box systems i e cases b d it can be seen from fig 8a c that the potential flow model can work well in predicting the resonant frequency of wave response in the narrow gap however the significant over predicted free surface amplitude in the narrow gap can also be observed in the potential flow results around the resonant frequency the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation by the potential flow model is the main reason if the incident wave frequency is deviated from the resonant frequency the potential flow model is able to produce the accurate wave amplitude in the narrow gap the relatively small free surface oscillation in the narrow gap and the slow rotational flow in the neighborhood of the gap region can be obtained indicating that the influence of vortical flow and energy dissipation is negligible at these lower or higher frequencies the comparison of wave amplitudes in the narrow gap between the three two box systems is depicted in fig 8 d numerical simulations suggest that the resonant frequencies of the three two box systems are nearly the same while the resonant amplitudes decrease when the narrow gap moves from the front to the back of the box system that is from case b to case d moreover the influence of gap position can also be observed when the incident wave frequency is outside a certain band at either side of the resonant frequency the decreased wave amplitudes in the narrow gap at non resonant frequencies can be obtained following the sequence form case b to case d according to the comparison the gap position is important for the behavior of two box system not only around the resonant frequency but also at some non resonant frequencies numerical simulations are further carried out for wave responses in two gaps of the three box system which is case e in table 2 as shown in fig 9 a and b the potential flow model can firstly manifest a general impression for the variation of wave amplitudes in g p 1 and g p 2 with the incident wave frequency in difference to the behavior of two box with one gap system the variation of wave amplitudes in the narrow gaps has two peak values implying that the significant large amplitude free surface oscillation occurs at two distinct frequencies the double peak variation can be attributed to the existence of two gaps in the three box system which can be explained according to the motion equation of multi mass spring system for the free surface oscillation theoretically from this figure the two peaks are at frequencies of ω 4 90 and 5 50 rad s in the potential flow results which are defined as fundamental and second resonant frequencies respectively again the potential flow model over predicts the wave amplitudes around resonant frequencies moreover the viscous numerical model shows that the typical two peak behavior can only be observed in gap 1 in fig 9a the second resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 2 in gap 2 almost disappears in fig 9b all these phenomena are due to the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation by the potential flow model around the frequencies between the fundamental and second resonant frequencies the wave amplitudes are under estimated by the potential flow model it can also be observed in the experimental and numerical results in iwata et al 2007 and lu et al 2010 which might be from the local near field wave wave and wave body interactions fig 9c shows the comparison of wave amplitudes between two narrow gaps the wave amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 is always larger than those at wave gauge g p 2 at the scopes of low and high frequency ranges around the fundamental resonant frequency the peak value of resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 is a g a i 4 946 slightly larger than that of a g a i 4 572 at wave gauge g p 2 the wave amplitude in gap 1 shows the peak value a g a i 3 043 at the second natural frequency ω 5 60 rad s although the peak value in gap 2 disappears the values of wave amplitude at wave gauge g p 2 around the frequency almost has the same magnitude with the resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p 1 for example the normalized wave amplitudes a g a i are 3 412 and 3 015 at frequencies ω 5 30 and 5 40 rad s respectively in the region between the fundamental and second natural frequencies the wave amplitude at gap 2 is larger than that at gap 1 all these phenomena indicate the difference of resonant behavior between two gaps in three box system in order to further understand the wave responses in narrow gaps of three box system time signals recorded by wave gauges g p 1 and g p 2 around the fundamental and second resonant frequencies are depicted in fig 10 the in phase relationship between the free surface evolutions in two gaps around the fundamental resonant frequency can be observed in fig 10a while the out of phase relationship between them around the second resonant frequency can be obtained in fig 10b it is also analogues with the motion equation of multi mass spring system in which the fundamental and second piston modes of the free surface oscillations correspond to the first and second order vibration modes of the multi mass spring system respectively the first and second order principal modes are in phase and out of phase respectively further comparison in fig 10b indicates the phase difference between the time signals are not out of phase precisely it is agreement with the damped mass spring system where the second order higher order vibration mode is easier affected by the damping action according to the analysis in this section it can be summarized that the two box system with one gap has one piston model natural frequency while the three box system with two gaps has two piston modal resonant frequencies when the incident wave frequencies are close to the resonant frequencies the extremely large amplitude fluid resonance can be excited in narrow gaps whereas the essential discrepancy of the resonant behavior between the two box and three box systems and between the fundamental and second resonant frequencies of three box system can be observed it can be speculated that the large amplitude piston modal resonance in narrow gaps can significantly affect the behavior of the multi box systems which will be investigated in the following sections 5 wave responses around the box systems the influence of narrow gaps on wave responses around the box system is investigated in this section where wave amplitudes can be measured by wave gauges g u and g d fig 11 shows the variation of free surface amplitudes with the incident wave frequency in the upstream and downstream of box systems including the comparison between the single and multi box systems general comparison suggests that the existence of narrow gaps can significantly affect the wave responses around the box system in single box system the variations of wave amplitudes at g u and g d are increase and decrease monotonously with the incident wave frequency respectively the potential flow model can also work well indicating the fluid viscosity and flow rotation are insignificant for the single box system however the peak values appear in the results of multi box systems where the potential flow model over predicts and under estimates the free surface amplitudes in the upstream and downstream of the systems around the resonant frequency respectively the exaggerated resonant amplitudes in narrow gaps are the main reason for the inaccurate results at g u and g d by the potential flow model which are essentially due to the ignorance of fluid viscosity and flow rotation in the potential flow theory analogous with the wave amplitude at g p 2 in fig 9b the second peak values of the maximal and minimal wave amplitudes at wave gauges g u and g d predicted by the potential flow model around ω 5 50 rad s also disappear in viscous fluid flow results the above comparisons indicate that the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation is indispensable for wave responses around the multi box systems with narrow gaps the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauge g u between three two box systems are depicted in fig 12 a the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap needs to be supported by the wave energy from the incident wave that is more wave energy is absorbed to support the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap leading to the decrease of wave response in the upstream of the two box system as illustrated in fig 8d the resonant amplitude at wave gauge g p increases when the narrow gap moves from the back to front of box system correspondingly the decrease of minimal peak value of wave amplitude at wave gauge g u can be observed following the sequence of cases d c b in fig 12a as for the wave amplitude at wave gauge g d in fig 12b the influence of gap position is not remarkable for three two box systems fig 12c and d show the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauges g u and g d between the cases a b and e respectively noted that the discrepancy of geometries between the single and two box systems is the additional gap 1 in case b while between the two and three box systems is the additional gap 2 in case e from these figures the discrepancy between the single and multi box systems can be observed not only around the resonant frequency but also at some ranges of non resonant frequency in the regions of low frequency range wave amplitudes at g u and g d of multi box system are smaller and larger than that of single box system respectively at the range of high frequency wave amplitudes give rise to zero for multi box system when ω 5 80 rad s while single box system results approach to zero until ω 8 00 rad s the comparisons between the two and three box systems suggest that the differences are mainly around the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental frequency of three box system as illustrated in fig 12c the minimal peak value of wave amplitude at wave gauge g u of case b is a g a i 1 693 at the resonant frequency which is slightly larger than that of a g a i 1 529 for case e at the fundamental natural frequency in the downstream of the box systems the maximal wave amplitude of case d is nearly double than that of case b in fig 12d however around the second resonant frequency ω 5 50 rad s of three box system the viscous fluid flow model suggests wave amplitudes at g u and g d between the cases b and e are nearly the same it indicates the insignificant effect of the second resonant wave frequency on wave responses around the three box system roughly speaking the behavior of wave responses at g u and g d between two and three box systems is similar because the single peak variation of wave amplitudes can be observed in both of them 6 reflection and transmission coefficients of the box systems further examinations are extended to the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t of various single and multi box systems fig 13 shows the variation of k r and k t of multi box systems with the incident wave frequency including the comparison with the results of single box system the discrepancy between the single box and multi box systems is major in the region of resonant frequency where the significant peak values of k r and k t can be observed in multi box systems similar to wave responses around the box systems the potential flow model can work well in single box system while the accurate reflection and transmission coefficients cannot be obtained around the resonant frequency numerical simulations in fig 13a c suggest that the peak value in transmission coefficient by the viscous fluid flow model is always smaller than that by the potential flow model around the resonant frequency in two box systems the transmission coefficient is closely relevant to the free surface amplitude in the narrow gap in which the large amplitude piston like fluid oscillation can be taken as a radiation source for the downstream wave it can lead to the transmission wave and result in the peak value of transmission coefficient therefore the exaggerated resonant amplitude in the narrow gap in fig 8 is the reason of generating the over prediction of transmission coefficient in fig 13a c by the potential flow model as for the three box system in fig 13d the significant increase of transmission wave is mainly induced by the resonant fluid motion in gap 2 therefore the peak value of transmission coefficient can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency while it disappears around the second natural frequency as for the reflection coefficient k r in fig 13a c the discrepancy between the potential flow and the viscous fluid flow results is different for various gap positions of two box systems in the potential flow model the exaggerated wave resonance in the narrow gap needs to be supported by the energy from incident wave in the viscous fluid flow model the incident wave energy is adopted to support the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap and the significant energy dissipation in the gap region as shown in fig 13a the reflection coefficient in the viscous fluid flow result is always smaller than that in potential flow result around the resonant frequency indicating the free surface oscillation and energy dissipation in the viscous fluid flow model need more wave energy oppositely fig 13c shows the larger reflection coefficient around the resonant frequency by the viscous fluid flow model than that by the potential flow model this implies that the exaggerated fluid motion in the narrow gap in the potential flow results should be supported by more wave energy as for case c in fig 13b where the gap position is in the middle of the two box system the reflection coefficient has both characteristics of cases b and d that is the potential flow model under estimates the reflection coefficient at the resonant frequency while the over prediction in potential flow results can be observed when the frequency is a bit away from the resonant frequency the position of narrow gap is the major reason for all these phenomena above the reflection coefficient in the three box system is depicted in fig 13d where the two peak variation with the incident wave frequency can be observed in the potential flow results at the fundamental resonant frequency the viscous fluid flow model predicts the larger minimal reflection coefficient than that by the potential flow model indicating less wave energy is absorbed into the box system due to the influence of fluid viscosity and flow rotation the two peak variation of reflection coefficient with the incident wave frequency can be observed in the viscous fluid flow results this is the reason that the reflection coefficient of three box system is closely relevant to the fluid resonance in gap 1 where the large amplitude piston type free surface oscillation happen at the fundamental and second natural frequencies in difference to the results at the fundamental resonant frequency the reflection coefficient by the viscous fluid flow model is smaller than that by the potential flow model around the second natural frequency it implies the effect of fluid viscosity and flow rotation can lead to more wave energy is absorbed from the incident wave to support the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation and significant energy dissipation at the second resonant frequency the comparison of reflection and transmission coefficients between three two box systems are depicted in fig 14 a and b based on the linear potential flow theory the values of k r and k t of cases b and d should be the same with each other at all the frequencies which can be observed by the present potential flow model in viscous fluid flow results the insignificant effect of gap position on the transmission coefficient can be observed in fig 14b as for the reflection coefficient k r in fig 14a numerical simulation suggests that the value of k r decreases dramatically when the narrow gap moves from the back to the front of the two box system that is from cases d to b correspondingly the decreased energy coefficient e k r 2 k t 2 can be observed in fig 14c following the above sequence by summarizing the results illustrated in figs 8d and 14a 14c the case b that is the position of gap is in the front of the two box system can generate the largest resonant amplitude in the narrow gap and more significant energy dissipation the wave resonance and energy dissipation are supported by the incident wave leading to the smallest reflection coefficient around the resonant frequency the reflection transmission and energy coefficients of the single two and three box systems are compared in fig 14d f according to compare the reflection coefficients in fig 14d the minimal peak value can be obtained in the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system this can be understood that more wave energy is required to support the significant fluid resonant motion in two gaps fig 14e shows the maximal transmission coefficient also appears at the first resonant frequency of three box system indicating the in phase oscillations of fluid bulk in two gaps can result in the stronger radiation action than that of two box system with one narrow gap furthermore fig 14f depicts that the minimal energy coefficient of case e at the fundamental natural frequency is larger than that of case b at the resonant frequency implying the relative energy dissipation of case e is smaller than that of case b around the second resonant frequency of three box system although the small peak values can be observed in the reflection and dissipation coefficients in fig 14d and f the magnitudes of them are nearly the same with those of case b in addition the value of transmission coefficient at the second resonant frequency of three box system is also very close to that of two box system in fig 14f in summary the discrepancy of the hydrodynamic coefficient is mainly around the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system which is mainly from the fluid resonance in narrow gaps 7 wave forces on the box systems with and without gaps in this section numerical investigations are carried out for investigating the behavior of wave forces including the wave force on each box in multi box systems and total wave force on box system the comparison of horizontal wave forces on each box in two box system is illustrated in fig 15 while the comparison of horizontal total wave forces between single and two box systems is shown in fig 16 as illustrated in fig 15 the significant variation of wave force on each box in two box system can be observed around the resonant frequency which is mainly induced by the large amplitude piston like free surface oscillation in the narrow gap the comparison in fig 16b can suggest that the horizontal total wave forces on cases a and c are nearly the same including the potential flow and viscous fluid flow results this is the reason that the piston modal resonance induced horizontal wave forces on each box are canceled out with each other analogous phenomena can also be observed in the horizontal wave forces results of cases b and d although a little discrepancy of total wave forces between the single and two box systems can be observed in fig 16a and c generally speaking the influence of narrow gap on horizontal total wave force on two box system is not remarkable in preset study fig 17 illustrates the variation of vertical wave force on each box with the incident wave frequency including the total wave force on two box system the potential flow model over predicts the wave forces around the resonant frequency which is also essentially due to the exaggerated free surface oscillation in narrow gaps under the inviscid fluid and irrotational flow more detailed comparisons in these figures indicate the relationship of f v t f v l f v r especially around the resonant condition the above relationship implies the in phase relationship between vertical wave forces f v l and f v r on boxes l and r which can be confirmed by the comparison of vertical force evolutions the resonant frequencies in fig 18 based on bernoulli equation the vertical wave force on the box is major from the fluid velocity around the box bottom the large amplitude piston like fluid oscillation in the narrow gap is able to significantly affect the flow field around the bottom of the box which is the reason for above phenomena furthermore fig 19 shows the remarkable discrepancy of vertical total wave forces between the single and two box systems which can be observed in the regions of both the resonant and non resonant frequencies all these numerical simulations suggest that the addition of narrow gap can significantly affect the behavior of vertical wave forces variations of horizontal wave forces on three box system are examined in fig 20 including the wave forces on each box and the total wave force on the system numerical simulations in fig 20a suggest the two peak variation in the results of wave forces on box a around the fundamental and second resonant frequencies which is induced by the large amplitude wave resonance in gap 1 at the corresponding natural frequencies however there is no peak value at the fundamental natural frequency for the wave forces on box b that is only one peak value can be observed at the second resonant frequency the in phase and out of phase relationships of free surface oscillations in gap 1 and gap 2 are the main reason for the occurrence and disappearance of peak values as for box c the significant increase of wave forces around two resonant frequencies can be observed in the potential flow model while it disappears at the second natural frequency in the viscous fluid flow results it can be understood that the horizontal wave force on box c is closely dependent on the free surface oscillation in gap 2 which is accordance to the numerical results in figs 9b and 20a above analysis can also be adopted to explain the discrepancy between the horizontal wave forces between the total horizontal wave forces on single and three box systems in fig 20b numerical simulations suggest that the discrepancy mainly occurs around the second natural frequency while little difference can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency generally the influence of narrow gaps on the horizontal wave forces is small fig 21 depicts the variation of vertical wave forces on three box system with the incident wave frequency in the potential flow results the significant peak values of vertical wave forces on each box can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency as shown in fig 21a correspondingly the maximal vertical wave force also appears at the total wave forces around the second natural frequency the potential flow model only predicts the maximal peak values on f v a and f v c however there is no peak value in the total vertical wave force on three box system implying that the vertical wave forces on boxes a and c are canceled out with each other the viscous fluid flow model can further indicates the real physical phenomena of wave forces on boxes generally speaking the significant increase of vertical wave forces on each box can be observed around the fundamental natural frequency the relationship of f v t f v a f v b f v c can be observed which can be explained by the in phase relationship of vertical force evolution between different boxes in fig 22 a however around the second natural frequency the peak values predicted by the potential flow model disappear including f v a and f v c fig 21b shows the comparison of vertical total wave force on the single two and three box systems that is cases a b and e the variation of vertical total wave force on the single and multiple box systems shows the monotone decrease and dramatic change with the incident wave frequency respectively it implies that the existence of narrow gap is able to significant affect the behavior of total vertical wave force on the box system however vertical wave forces between two and three box systems have the similar characteristic in the figure the single peak variation in vertical forces can be observed at the resonant frequency of two box system and the fundamental resonant frequency of three box system respectively around the second resonant frequency of three box system the vertical force is quite small which is also similar with that of two box system the time history results in fig 22b shows the boxes a and c have the 180 phase difference while box b is also different with others the above relationship is mainly due to the out phase fluids motion in the two gaps leading to an extremely low value of total vertical wave force amplitude therefore the total vertical force on three box system is hardly affected by the second piston modal resonance only the discrepancy between them is the peak value of vertical force on three box system is larger than that on two box system the additional gap 2 is able to increase the total vertical force on the box system 8 conclusion in this work the hydrodynamic behavior of box systems with and without narrow gaps is investigated by employing a numerical wave flume based on openfoam package the naiver stokes equations and the vof interface capture technique are employed which is able to account for the influence of vortical flow and large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap for the purpose of comparison the conventional potential flow model is also included in the simulation validations is carried out by comparing with available experimental data and simulating results in the literature demonstrating that the present numerical model can work well in predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of box systems the fluid resonance can be observed when the incident wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of fluid bulk in the narrow gap formed by the two box system the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the narrow gap can lead to the decrease and increase of wave responses in the upstream and downstream of the two box system analogous behavior can also be observed in the reflection and transmission coefficients numerical simulation indicates that the wave resonance in the narrow gap is able to increase the horizontal and vertical wave forces on each box around resonant frequency the fluid resonance in the narrow gap can also significantly affect the total vertical wave forces on two box systems while the influence on total horizontal wave forces is not remarkable numerical simulations for three box system indicate in phase and out of phase large amplitude free surface oscillations in two gaps at the fundamental and second natural frequencies the comparisons suggest that the in phase free surface oscillations of three box system at the fundamental resonant frequency is able to generate the similar behavior of wave resonance of two box system that is the significant decrease and increase of reflection and transmission coefficients of three box systems respectively and the similar phenomena of wave responses in the upstream and downstream of box system the fundamental wave resonance can also lead to the dramatical increase of total wave force on the three box system whereas the influence on the total horizontal vertical wave force is quite small around the second natural frequency only a little discrepancy between two and three box systems can be observed including the wave responses hydrodynamic coefficients and total wave forces however the wave forces on each box in three box system are closely relevant to the wave resonance in two gaps including the fundamental and second resonant

21606,a novel conceptual design of hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider aug is proposed to help the aug increase gliding speed the twin hydrofoils of aug will undergoes flapping motion just like the fish fins or bird wings when the aug encounter severe sea conditions while remain stationary at other times the motion parameters of flapping foil needs to be adjusted to satisfy the force balance condition thus the aug may achieve cruise status under constant moving velocity the numerical simulation has been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of current aug by using of the immersed boundary method under different incoming velocities the numerical result shows that there exists optimum dimensionless st number as a combination of heaving amplitude flapping frequency and incoming velocity resulting in highest propulsive efficiency and there exists mutual linear relationship between three motion parameters the vortex ring structures at the rear part of the aug under three typical st numbers are also presented and discussed proving qualitative explanation for the numerical results the conclusion acquired in this study may provide technical guidance for the development of hybrid driven unmanned underwater vehicle uuv keywords autonomous underwater glider aug hybrid driven flapping foil immersed boundary method 1 introduction autonomous underwater glider aug is a type of unmanned underwater vehicles that can autonomously propel underwater for long periods of time or glide without utilizing external forces through autonomous control and they can be recovered and used repeatedly eriksen et al 2001 the augs rely on two adjustment systems to achieve forward motion the buoyancy adjustment system and the gravity center adjustment respectively taking the diving condition as example when the aug is going to dive the water bag starts to drain water off with the help of buoyancy adjustment system and the mass block moves forward by utilizing the gravity center adjustment at the same time osse and eriksen 2007 at present aug has been widely used in a large number of marine applications including marine environmental monitoring military monitoring marine scientific surveys marine surveying mine detection marine resource exploration and performing missions in far reaching or dangerous sea areas that are difficult for humans to reach graver 2005 zhang et al 2013 hussain et al 2011 with the rapid development of underwater technologies and corresponding demands the modern unmanned underwater vehicle uuv design is calling for long range endurance low energy consumption and good maneuverability actually the gliding speed of aug is designed to be relatively small and the reasons come from two aspects for the one the low gliding speed can minimize the friction resistance of hull to the furthest extent and for another a low gliding speed can help the aug improve the signal acquisition density as a result of this the aug can be easily deviated from its initial gliding route once experienced strong ocean current therefore failing to complete designed task webb et al 2001 hobson et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 in order to solve this tricky problem plenty of works have been conducted by scholars from home and abroad in jeong s work jeong et al 2016 a controllable buoyancy device to regulate the aug s net buoyancy adjustment system is adopted to search for the optimum pitching angle of aug so as to improve aug s gliding speed and the maximum horizontal gliding speed can reach 2 5 knots which is larger than the average speed of ocean current in zhang s work zhang et al 2017 a super cavitation configuration is utilized to reduce the drag resistance of aug so as to improve its gliding speed and the similar work has also been conducted by the bai bai and han 2014 by using of cavitation fins to reduce the hull resistance in kim s work kim and hong 2011 new type of x stern configuration with relative small control surface is added to the aug s rear part and the simulation result demonstrates that the drag resistance is largely reduced and the gliding speed can reach 2 8 knots in gao s work gao et al 2012 an original motion control strategy is proposed to increase the gliding time of aug on the surface of water and large amount of resistance can be reduced so as to increase its cruise speed in carneiro s work carneiro and almedia 2018 temperature difference energy is utilized for the quick propulsion of aug by using of energy harvester device to extract energy from the sea water and the sea trial result shows that the with the help of temperature difference energy the aug s moving speed can reach 3 0 knots similar works have also been conducted by yang et al 2016 and ma et al 2016 apart from these works mentioned above the conceptual design of hybrid driven aug is proposed to improve its gliding speed the so called hybrid driven aug means that apart from its original buoyancy adjustment system another propulsion system will be added to help the aug achieve higher cruise speed and plenty of works have been conducted by scholars from home and abroad in fang s work fang 2017 a hybrid aug is proposed by utilizing the external propeller placed at the rear part of aug to improve the gliding speed the propeller starts to work when the aug experiences strong ocean current and once if the gliding environment is stable the aug switch to original gliding mode by using of the net buoyancy system similar design was also adopted by chen et al 2016 and the difference among them lies in that the foldable propelled was utilized by chen and the propeller can be retracted into the hull when the aug undergoes usual gliding so as to cut down the resistance induced by the propeller the above mentioned work to increase the aug s gliding speed mainly utilize the propeller and although this traditional propulsion method employed by current unmanned underwater vehicle to achieve propulsion and maneuvering has been proved to be reliable to some extent several drawbacks is inevitable for the one the issue of unfriendly environment caused by high noise during the working of propeller destroys the concealment performance of uuv for another poor maneuverability may be caused when the uuv is under low cruise speed or hovering condition as the result of the application of rudder and wing operating system in view of this alternative solutions to improve aug s gliding speed are strongly urgent in nature high developed natural creatures have acquired extraordinary locomotion and survival abilities and it has become the source of developing new conceptual design of uuv fish et al 2003 georgiades et al 2009 birds flying in the sky and fishes swimming in the water are typical creatures among them having those merits mentioned above and both of these two creatures employ flapping motion for example birds usually flap their wings to acquire quick locomotion and fishes can obtain high advancing speed and small turning radius by using of their tail s flapping motion triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 roper et al 2011 raj and thakur 2016 therefore a new conceptual design of hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider with active twin flapping foils is proposed under that conceptual design the aug can utilize original net buoyancy system and gravity center adjustment to move forward when the flow speed of ocean current is lower than aug s normal gliding speed appropriately 0 5 knot and that will consume fewer energy once experienced bad sea conditions meaning that the flow speed of ocean current is larger than its gliding speed the two foils will undergoes flapping motion similar with the bird s wing oscillating motion to help the aug to overcome the ocean current the advantages of our hybrid driven aug lie in two aspects for the one no more additional attached structures is introduced thus the drag resistance experienced by the aug will not grow for another no deformation appears on aug which is favorable for the electrical components or motion system carrying in this article a hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider is introduced with a twin foils undergoing flapping motion hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug is analyzed by numerically solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations of surrounding flow by using of modified immersed boundary method the rest of the paper is organized as follows the physical model adopted in current study is shown in sec 2 followed by the numerical method utilized in numerical computation and the hydrodynamic performance of hybrid driven aug is shown in sec 4 the conclusion gotten in this study is presented in final part 2 physical model as can be seen in fig 1 the physical model chosen in current study consists of two parts the bullet like fuselage and the twin foils symmetrically arranged at two sides of the fuselage taking the chord length of single foil as characteristic length c the total length of the physical model is 4 0 c where the middle part is a standard cylinder with diameter of 0 83c and length of 2 08 c the head part is a semi ellipsoid with semi major axis of 0 58 c and the rear part is also a semi spheroid with semi major axis of 1 34 c the aspect ratio of single foil is set as 2 0 for the consideration of producing much thrust according to our previous study li et al 2018 in our preliminary design the bullet like fuselage serves as mission carrying unit where the pipe system gravity center adjustment system and buoyancy system is placed within it as for the twin foils which can be functioned as the propulsive unit through its flapping motion which consists of two parts the heaving motion along the vertical direction y axis and the pitching motion around the z axis both the two motions are harmonic motions but there exists a phase lag the motion equation is expressed in formula 1 where h 0 denotes the heaving amplitude θ 0 is the pitching amplitude f is the flapping frequency ϕ 0 is the phase lag between these two motions and according to kinsey s suggestion kinesy and dumas 2012 ϕ 0 is often set as 90 to achieve optimum propulsive performance 1 h t h 0 cos 2 π f t θ t θ 0 cos 2 π f t φ 0 in order to give intuitive description of foil s flapping motion the motion process of foil in single motion period is presented in fig 2 where p is the motion period and it can be calculated as p 1 f for simplicity the aug is fixed stationary with the constant incoming velocity and there is no real forward movement of aug in our preliminary research considering that no extra degrees of freedom are allowed therefore the surge acceleration is not given the due consideration in current study the direct forward motion coupled with the other degrees of freedom such as heave surge heave sway pitch or roll motion might be much time consuming and the grid spacing must be fully refined and that can be considered in our future work 3 numerical method the mathematical problem described in this article can be summed up as moving boundary problem and if the traditional computational method is used there might exist obvious disadvantages in calculation efficiency on the one hand since the actual fluid area always changes with time as a result of moving solid boundary the grid needs to be re divided at each time step which may lead to obvious decrease in computation efficiency on the other hand once if the boundary of the fluid region is quietly complicated or the shape of the surrounded solid part is irregular the generation of the initial grid will also be time consuming meanwhile if an unstructured grid is used the accuracy of the flow field solution will be affected therefore the numerical computation of the moving boundary has always been a tricky problem in computational fluid mechanics shao et al 2010 shao and pan 2011 pan et al 2014 2016 the emergence of the immersed boundary ib method has provided the possibility of efficiently solving the moving boundary problem specifically the immersed boundary method adds an additional force term to the fluid s governing equation so that the fluid s non slip boundary conditions on the solid surface will be satisfied and in that process the regeneration of the computation mesh will be omitted at the same time for complex shaped boundaries a close fitting calculation grid is no longer needed and the numerical calculation of the governing equations only needs to be performed on a regular structured grid or cartesian grid the specific description of immersed boundary method can refer to the yuan et al 2015 yusof et al 1997 fadlun et al 2000 de palma et al 2006 ghias et al 2007 in our current study the surrounding fluid around the hybrid driven aug can be considered as incompressible and viscous thus the dimensionless governing equation can be written as 2 u t u u p 1 re 2 u f 3 u 0 here u and p represent the velocity field and pressure field respectively re the non dimensional reynolds number which can be calculated as re vc ν with v and c the moving velocity and chord length of single foil the reynolds number in current study varies from 100 to 300 when the moving velocity alters from 0 5 m s 1 5 m s considering that the reynolds number is very small and the flow field around the aug is laminar flow hence no turbulent model is applied in current study the reason why such a low re number is chosen may refer to our previous work li et al 2018 f is the added force term as mentioned above which equals to zero everywhere in the flow field except for the boundary of solid body and it can be calculated as in formula 4 where v n 1 is immersed body s moving velocity at the time level t δt while v n represents the corresponding velocity at t time level besides that rhs n denotes the convective term viscous term and pressure gradient term corresponding to n s equation respectively at present t time level 4 f n 1 r h s n v n 1 v n δ t in actual computation the added force on the boundary of the solid boundary in the flow field should be firstly solved called as f x and it can be calculated as 5 f x f a x f i x f ν x f p x where the f a x represents the acceleration force term f i x the inertial term f ν x the viscous force term f p x the pressure difference term and their specific expression can be expressed as 6 f a x v t x f i x v v x f ν x 1 re 2 v x f p x p x the effect of added force f x on the boundary of solid boundary calculated form formula 5 and 6 needs to be applied into the surrounding fluid grids by using of an interpolation process as shown in fig 3 a series of discrete points called lagrange point are used to describe the boundary of aug s geometry seen in fig 3 a while the flow field is discretized as another series of points called euler point seen in fig 3 b the force obtained by formula 7 is called the lagrange force the process of interpolating lagrange force into surrounding fluid mesh can be expressed as 7 f i j k 1 d s h f x k where x k is the certain lagrange point of aug ds is the spatial distance between the lagrange point and euler point h is the grid space i j k is the coordinate of the corresponding euler point and f i j k denotes the virtual force of the euler point with the coordinate i j k before the above interpolation process there exists a process of filtering the fluid grid points euler point around the solid boundary that is determining which fluid grid points the added force is interpolated to as for the fluid point around the boundary of solid body if the distance between the closest lagrange point and itself is less than the single grid space then it can be regarded as the fluid point to be interpolated the detailed procedure of the interpolation process in single time step can be expressed as 1 the velocity and pressure field of certain lagrange point in current time step t0 can be calculated directly from the previous time step t0 δt by solving the n s equation 2 once if the velocity ad pressure value is acquired the added force f xk at the point of xk can be easily calculated from formula 5 3 after that the obtained added force f xk will be interpolated back to the closest euler point through formula 7 and the new value of velocity and pressure field in nest time step t0 δt will be acquired by solving the n s equation in current simulation velocity boundary condition is imposed at inlet and no back flow condition is applied at outlet the other surrounding boundaries are all set as the uniform velocity condition based on our convergence tests for the present problem the computational domain for fluid flow is chosen as 5 10 4 4 4 4 in x y and z directions and the grid size in each direction is uniform with grid spacing 0 03 in the near region of the aug and gradually increases in a geometric progression to a coarser spacing of 0 1 in the far field the time step is chosen as 0 001 the numerical computation in our current study was not considered converged until periodic history patterns of the monitored variables were available as well as the difference between their period averaged values from one period to the next should be less than 0 1 a time duration of about six motion periods was found to be acceptable particularly for the integrated statistics of forces moment and propulsive efficiency as for the discretization of the navier stokes equations the second order projection method is applied here to solve eq 2 and eq 3 and the crank nicolson method is utilized for the dissipation term while other terms are discretized by the adams bashforth method the specific introduction of discretization and the validation of current method can refer to our previous work li et al 2018 pan and li 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug in this section the hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug under different motion parameters heaving amplitude flapping frequency pitching amplitude will be analyzed unlike previous study we focus on the aug s normal cruise status meaning that the mean drag experienced by the fuselage d f u s e l a g e should equal to the thrusts generated by the flapping foils t f l a p p i n g f o i l so that the aug may achieve cruise state under constant gliding speed in order to satisfy the balance condition the motion parameters need to be adjusted several times taking v 1 0 m s θ 0 30 and f 0 8 hz as example seen in table 1 four different h 0 magnitudes have been chosen to try to satisfy the force balance condition and when the h 0 is set as 0 163 the difference between the mean thrust force t f l a p p i n g f o i l and mean drag d f u s e l a g e nearly equals to zero o 10 4 we may say the balance condition is satisfied under that combination of parameters the newly defined propulsive efficiency of current bionic aug is expressed as formula 8 where pout and pin represent the output power and input power of the system respectively the pin consists of two parts the pin foil and pin fuselage representing the energy required by the foil and fuselage to overcome the resistance t t denotes the thrust force generated by the flapping foil l t and m t are the lift force and moment force experienced by the flapping foil respectively compared with the single flapping foil s propulsive efficiency that there is a non zero fluid force acting on the wing foil in current study we only focus on the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity therefore the net fluid force acting on the whole aug is nearly zero by adjusting the motion parameters and the resistance or energy consumption of the fuselage may vary from individual to individual under different moving velocities and combination of motion parameters in view of this in order to accurately characterize the propulsive efficiency of hybrid driven aug system which consists of two flapping foils and one fuselage the effect of the fuselage has been taken into the consideration here 8 η p o u t p i n p o u t p i n f o i l p i n f u s e l a g e 1 t 0 t

hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is firstly investigated and the heaving amplitude h 0 is set variable to satisfy the force balance condition the pitching amplitude is set as a constant value θ 0 30 the dimensionless frequency st combining the effects of incoming velocity flapping frequency and heaving amplitude is defined as st 2 h 0 f v the variation curves of propulsive efficiency with flapping frequencies under various incoming velocities and the corresponding values of heaving amplitudes h 0 are shown in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4 a the changing tendency of aug s propulsive efficiency with the flapping frequency under different incoming velocities are very similar with each other the propulsive efficiency increases first and then decrease with the growth of flapping frequency and there exists optimum frequency corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency under each incoming velocity it can be also noted that the value of highest propulsive efficiency shows little gradual decrease with the increase of cruise speeds meaning that the high gliding speed and longer gliding range cannot be satisfied at the same time and if we want to achieve higher gliding speed we must pay the price for cutting down longer range besides that it can be also found the lower the gliding speed is the shorter the range of corresponding flapping frequency f will be for example when the gliding speed is set as 0 5 m s the available flapping frequency ranges from 0 2 0 5 and there will exist no suitable heaving amplitude h 0 to satisfy the balance condition when the flapping frequency exceeds that range with the further increase of gliding speed the range of cooperated flapping frequency shows corresponding increase so is the magnitude of flapping frequency as for the relationship of the heaving amplitude and flapping frequency seen in fig 4 b apparently there exists linear correlation between the heaving amplitude and flapping frequency linear fittings are also made in fig 4 b the slope ratios of fitting lines are 2 48 1 83 1 46 and 1 33 corresponding to the moving velocity v 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 5 m s respectively that conclusion is of great significance for the adjustment of motion parameters in the following prototype production as mentioned above the effects the incoming velocity flapping frequency and heaving amplitude can be combined as the effect of the dimensionless number st and the corresponding result of fig 4 can be summarized in fig 5 similar with fig 4 a the propulsive efficiency of aug shows first increase and then decrease with the growth of st number and there exist optimum st number leading to highest propulsive efficiency under each moving velocity more importantly the optimum st number under different incoming velocities are similar with each other around 0 52 meaning that the st number still plays vital role in evaluating the propulsive performance of bionic aug 4 1 2 effect of heaving amplitude on propulsive performance of current aug in this subsection effect of heaving amplitude on hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is investigated and the pitching amplitude θ 0 is set variable to satisfy the balance condition the flapping frequency is set as constant f 0 6 hz seen in fig 6 a propulsive efficiency of aug under different incoming velocities except for the v 0 5 m s has the same changing tendency that is firstly increase and then decrease and there exist optimum h 0 leading to highest propulsive efficiency as for the case of v 0 5 m s the propulsive efficiency shows sharp decrease with the increase of h 0 that strange phenomenon can be explained as follows the magnitude of h 0 chosen in current study ranges from 0 2 to 0 5 for the consideration of satisfying the balance condition once if more larger range of h 0 is selected the maximum propulsive efficiency for the case of v 0 5 m s will be found and the mutual relationship of h 0 and ƞ may have the similar changing tendency as for the relationship of pitching amplitude θ 0 and heaving amplitude h 0 seen in fig 6 b similar with fig 5 b there exist linear relationship between θ 0 and h 0 and the slope ratios of fitting lines are 32 5 62 0 66 5 and 68 corresponding to the moving velocity v 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 5 m s respectively that conclusion is also helpful for the future adjustment of motion parameter similar with fig 5 propulsive efficiency under different st numers are plot in fig 7 as can be vividly seen from fig 7 the highest propulsive efficiency can be acquired around st 0 5 which is approximately the same with the magnitude in fig 5 4 1 3 effect of pitching amplitude on propulsive performance of current aug in this subsection effect of pitching amplitude on hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is investigated and the flapping frequency f is set variable to satisfy the balance condition the heaving amplitude h 0 is set as constant h 0 0 5 seen in fig 8 a the propulsive efficiency of aug shows gradual growth with the increase of θ 0 and then presents tendency of decrease with the further increase of θ 0 the optimum θ 0 corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency under various incoming velocities are within the range of 30 40 similar with the optimum magnitude of single flapping foil the magnitudes of flapping frequency f to the pitching amplitude θ 0 are expressed in fig 8 b apparently there also exists linear relationship between the flapping frequency and pitching amplitude and the slope ratios of fitting line under various incoming velocities show little variation around 0 01 combined with the above conclusions we can find that there exists mutual linear correlation between three motion parameters and that conclusion is of significant reference value for the motion parameter adjust in the subsequent prototype experiment similarly propulsive efficiency of aug under different st numbers and incoming velocities are also presented in fig 9 as vividly seen from fig 9 optimum st number leading to highest propulsive efficiency under different incoming velocities is around 0 5 4 2 flow structure of current aug considering that the flow structures of hybrid driven aug have a close connection with its hydrodynamic performance therefore the vortex structures at the rear part of the hybrid driven aug will be presented and discussed and all the vortex structures presented here are all defined by the λ 2 criterion which is proposed by the jeong and hussain three typical st numbers are chosen here to shown the difference of vortex structures among them with same pitching amplitude and moving velocity θ 0 30 and v 1 0 m s and different heaving amplitude and flapping frequency the corresponding st numbers are 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 respectively and the resultant propulsive efficiency are 31 5 44 2 and 26 6 respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the typical vortex ring structures all emerge at the wake of the flow field of aug with three different st numbers as a result of the twin hydrofoils flapping motion it can be understood as that when the hydrofoil moves up to the maximum height and then move back to initial position in the first half motion period the vortex on the surface of hydrofoil starts to fall off at the trailing edge and the shedding vortex connected with the wingtip vortex will be stretched at the rear part of aug leading to a half of vortex ring under the impact of incoming flow when the hydrofoil moves down to the minimum height and then move back to initial position in the second half motion period another half of vortex ring emerges and growing number of vortex rings will show up at the wake of aug with the hydrofoils continuous motion the difference of vortex structures among these three aug under different st numbers lies in vortex obliquity an angle between the center line of vortex ring and the horizontal line it can be vividly seen from fig 10 that the vortex obliquity of case st 0 3 fig 10 a is a little larger than the case of st 0 5 fig 10 b despite of the fact that the corresponding heaving amplitude h 0 in the case of st 0 3 is larger than that of the case st 0 5 when it comes to the case of st 1 0 fig 10 c the vortex obliquity reaches maximum value as a result of the largest flapping frequency according to the vortex dynamics theory large amounts of energy will be released during the process of the vortex ring s release as a result of the strong momentum exchange the released energy can be divided into two parts the horizontal and the vertical component and it can be easily gotten that the smaller the vortex obliquity is the more the horizontal energy component will be since the main focus of our proposed hybrid driven aug is to utilize the twin foils flapping motion to increase its gliding speed thus the horizontal energy component is favorable for this aug therefore it can be conjectured that the smaller the vortex obliquity is the more horizontal energy component is produced and the better the propulsive performance of aug will be 5 conclusions in this article a novel conceptual design of hybrid driven aug with active twin hydrofoil undergoing flapping motion is proposed and the twin hydrofoil merely work in the case of aug encountering severe sea conditions and remains stationary at other times a force balance condition need to be satisfied by adjusting the motion parameters the aug may glide at a constant speed the numerical simulation has also been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of current aug under different incoming velocities by using of immersed boundary method and the reynolds number in current study varies from 100 to 300 when the moving velocity alters from 0 5 m s 1 5 m s the conclusions acquired in this study can be summarized as 1 the propulsive efficiency of current aug increases first and then decreases with the growth of all motion parameters i e the heaving amplitude the pitching amplitude and flapping frequency under different incoming velocities and there exists optimum motion parameters leading to highest propulsive efficiency the highest propulsive efficiency under different incoming velocities shows obvious decrease with the increase of moving velocity meaning that the high moving velocity and the gliding endurance could not be achieved at the same time 2 there exists mutual linear relationship among flapping foil s motion parameters when the force balance condition is satisfied and that conclusion is of great significance for the future prototype development and motion parameters adjustment 3 the vortex obliquity has strong connection with the propulsive performance of current aug the little the vortex obliquity is the more horizontal energy input will be produced and the better the propulsive performance will be funding supports from national natural scientific foundation of china with the grant no 51279184 are acknowledged credit

21606,a novel conceptual design of hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider aug is proposed to help the aug increase gliding speed the twin hydrofoils of aug will undergoes flapping motion just like the fish fins or bird wings when the aug encounter severe sea conditions while remain stationary at other times the motion parameters of flapping foil needs to be adjusted to satisfy the force balance condition thus the aug may achieve cruise status under constant moving velocity the numerical simulation has been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of current aug by using of the immersed boundary method under different incoming velocities the numerical result shows that there exists optimum dimensionless st number as a combination of heaving amplitude flapping frequency and incoming velocity resulting in highest propulsive efficiency and there exists mutual linear relationship between three motion parameters the vortex ring structures at the rear part of the aug under three typical st numbers are also presented and discussed proving qualitative explanation for the numerical results the conclusion acquired in this study may provide technical guidance for the development of hybrid driven unmanned underwater vehicle uuv keywords autonomous underwater glider aug hybrid driven flapping foil immersed boundary method 1 introduction autonomous underwater glider aug is a type of unmanned underwater vehicles that can autonomously propel underwater for long periods of time or glide without utilizing external forces through autonomous control and they can be recovered and used repeatedly eriksen et al 2001 the augs rely on two adjustment systems to achieve forward motion the buoyancy adjustment system and the gravity center adjustment respectively taking the diving condition as example when the aug is going to dive the water bag starts to drain water off with the help of buoyancy adjustment system and the mass block moves forward by utilizing the gravity center adjustment at the same time osse and eriksen 2007 at present aug has been widely used in a large number of marine applications including marine environmental monitoring military monitoring marine scientific surveys marine surveying mine detection marine resource exploration and performing missions in far reaching or dangerous sea areas that are difficult for humans to reach graver 2005 zhang et al 2013 hussain et al 2011 with the rapid development of underwater technologies and corresponding demands the modern unmanned underwater vehicle uuv design is calling for long range endurance low energy consumption and good maneuverability actually the gliding speed of aug is designed to be relatively small and the reasons come from two aspects for the one the low gliding speed can minimize the friction resistance of hull to the furthest extent and for another a low gliding speed can help the aug improve the signal acquisition density as a result of this the aug can be easily deviated from its initial gliding route once experienced strong ocean current therefore failing to complete designed task webb et al 2001 hobson et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 in order to solve this tricky problem plenty of works have been conducted by scholars from home and abroad in jeong s work jeong et al 2016 a controllable buoyancy device to regulate the aug s net buoyancy adjustment system is adopted to search for the optimum pitching angle of aug so as to improve aug s gliding speed and the maximum horizontal gliding speed can reach 2 5 knots which is larger than the average speed of ocean current in zhang s work zhang et al 2017 a super cavitation configuration is utilized to reduce the drag resistance of aug so as to improve its gliding speed and the similar work has also been conducted by the bai bai and han 2014 by using of cavitation fins to reduce the hull resistance in kim s work kim and hong 2011 new type of x stern configuration with relative small control surface is added to the aug s rear part and the simulation result demonstrates that the drag resistance is largely reduced and the gliding speed can reach 2 8 knots in gao s work gao et al 2012 an original motion control strategy is proposed to increase the gliding time of aug on the surface of water and large amount of resistance can be reduced so as to increase its cruise speed in carneiro s work carneiro and almedia 2018 temperature difference energy is utilized for the quick propulsion of aug by using of energy harvester device to extract energy from the sea water and the sea trial result shows that the with the help of temperature difference energy the aug s moving speed can reach 3 0 knots similar works have also been conducted by yang et al 2016 and ma et al 2016 apart from these works mentioned above the conceptual design of hybrid driven aug is proposed to improve its gliding speed the so called hybrid driven aug means that apart from its original buoyancy adjustment system another propulsion system will be added to help the aug achieve higher cruise speed and plenty of works have been conducted by scholars from home and abroad in fang s work fang 2017 a hybrid aug is proposed by utilizing the external propeller placed at the rear part of aug to improve the gliding speed the propeller starts to work when the aug experiences strong ocean current and once if the gliding environment is stable the aug switch to original gliding mode by using of the net buoyancy system similar design was also adopted by chen et al 2016 and the difference among them lies in that the foldable propelled was utilized by chen and the propeller can be retracted into the hull when the aug undergoes usual gliding so as to cut down the resistance induced by the propeller the above mentioned work to increase the aug s gliding speed mainly utilize the propeller and although this traditional propulsion method employed by current unmanned underwater vehicle to achieve propulsion and maneuvering has been proved to be reliable to some extent several drawbacks is inevitable for the one the issue of unfriendly environment caused by high noise during the working of propeller destroys the concealment performance of uuv for another poor maneuverability may be caused when the uuv is under low cruise speed or hovering condition as the result of the application of rudder and wing operating system in view of this alternative solutions to improve aug s gliding speed are strongly urgent in nature high developed natural creatures have acquired extraordinary locomotion and survival abilities and it has become the source of developing new conceptual design of uuv fish et al 2003 georgiades et al 2009 birds flying in the sky and fishes swimming in the water are typical creatures among them having those merits mentioned above and both of these two creatures employ flapping motion for example birds usually flap their wings to acquire quick locomotion and fishes can obtain high advancing speed and small turning radius by using of their tail s flapping motion triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 roper et al 2011 raj and thakur 2016 therefore a new conceptual design of hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider with active twin flapping foils is proposed under that conceptual design the aug can utilize original net buoyancy system and gravity center adjustment to move forward when the flow speed of ocean current is lower than aug s normal gliding speed appropriately 0 5 knot and that will consume fewer energy once experienced bad sea conditions meaning that the flow speed of ocean current is larger than its gliding speed the two foils will undergoes flapping motion similar with the bird s wing oscillating motion to help the aug to overcome the ocean current the advantages of our hybrid driven aug lie in two aspects for the one no more additional attached structures is introduced thus the drag resistance experienced by the aug will not grow for another no deformation appears on aug which is favorable for the electrical components or motion system carrying in this article a hybrid driven autonomous underwater glider is introduced with a twin foils undergoing flapping motion hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug is analyzed by numerically solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations of surrounding flow by using of modified immersed boundary method the rest of the paper is organized as follows the physical model adopted in current study is shown in sec 2 followed by the numerical method utilized in numerical computation and the hydrodynamic performance of hybrid driven aug is shown in sec 4 the conclusion gotten in this study is presented in final part 2 physical model as can be seen in fig 1 the physical model chosen in current study consists of two parts the bullet like fuselage and the twin foils symmetrically arranged at two sides of the fuselage taking the chord length of single foil as characteristic length c the total length of the physical model is 4 0 c where the middle part is a standard cylinder with diameter of 0 83c and length of 2 08 c the head part is a semi ellipsoid with semi major axis of 0 58 c and the rear part is also a semi spheroid with semi major axis of 1 34 c the aspect ratio of single foil is set as 2 0 for the consideration of producing much thrust according to our previous study li et al 2018 in our preliminary design the bullet like fuselage serves as mission carrying unit where the pipe system gravity center adjustment system and buoyancy system is placed within it as for the twin foils which can be functioned as the propulsive unit through its flapping motion which consists of two parts the heaving motion along the vertical direction y axis and the pitching motion around the z axis both the two motions are harmonic motions but there exists a phase lag the motion equation is expressed in formula 1 where h 0 denotes the heaving amplitude θ 0 is the pitching amplitude f is the flapping frequency ϕ 0 is the phase lag between these two motions and according to kinsey s suggestion kinesy and dumas 2012 ϕ 0 is often set as 90 to achieve optimum propulsive performance 1 h t h 0 cos 2 π f t θ t θ 0 cos 2 π f t φ 0 in order to give intuitive description of foil s flapping motion the motion process of foil in single motion period is presented in fig 2 where p is the motion period and it can be calculated as p 1 f for simplicity the aug is fixed stationary with the constant incoming velocity and there is no real forward movement of aug in our preliminary research considering that no extra degrees of freedom are allowed therefore the surge acceleration is not given the due consideration in current study the direct forward motion coupled with the other degrees of freedom such as heave surge heave sway pitch or roll motion might be much time consuming and the grid spacing must be fully refined and that can be considered in our future work 3 numerical method the mathematical problem described in this article can be summed up as moving boundary problem and if the traditional computational method is used there might exist obvious disadvantages in calculation efficiency on the one hand since the actual fluid area always changes with time as a result of moving solid boundary the grid needs to be re divided at each time step which may lead to obvious decrease in computation efficiency on the other hand once if the boundary of the fluid region is quietly complicated or the shape of the surrounded solid part is irregular the generation of the initial grid will also be time consuming meanwhile if an unstructured grid is used the accuracy of the flow field solution will be affected therefore the numerical computation of the moving boundary has always been a tricky problem in computational fluid mechanics shao et al 2010 shao and pan 2011 pan et al 2014 2016 the emergence of the immersed boundary ib method has provided the possibility of efficiently solving the moving boundary problem specifically the immersed boundary method adds an additional force term to the fluid s governing equation so that the fluid s non slip boundary conditions on the solid surface will be satisfied and in that process the regeneration of the computation mesh will be omitted at the same time for complex shaped boundaries a close fitting calculation grid is no longer needed and the numerical calculation of the governing equations only needs to be performed on a regular structured grid or cartesian grid the specific description of immersed boundary method can refer to the yuan et al 2015 yusof et al 1997 fadlun et al 2000 de palma et al 2006 ghias et al 2007 in our current study the surrounding fluid around the hybrid driven aug can be considered as incompressible and viscous thus the dimensionless governing equation can be written as 2 u t u u p 1 re 2 u f 3 u 0 here u and p represent the velocity field and pressure field respectively re the non dimensional reynolds number which can be calculated as re vc ν with v and c the moving velocity and chord length of single foil the reynolds number in current study varies from 100 to 300 when the moving velocity alters from 0 5 m s 1 5 m s considering that the reynolds number is very small and the flow field around the aug is laminar flow hence no turbulent model is applied in current study the reason why such a low re number is chosen may refer to our previous work li et al 2018 f is the added force term as mentioned above which equals to zero everywhere in the flow field except for the boundary of solid body and it can be calculated as in formula 4 where v n 1 is immersed body s moving velocity at the time level t δt while v n represents the corresponding velocity at t time level besides that rhs n denotes the convective term viscous term and pressure gradient term corresponding to n s equation respectively at present t time level 4 f n 1 r h s n v n 1 v n δ t in actual computation the added force on the boundary of the solid boundary in the flow field should be firstly solved called as f x and it can be calculated as 5 f x f a x f i x f ν x f p x where the f a x represents the acceleration force term f i x the inertial term f ν x the viscous force term f p x the pressure difference term and their specific expression can be expressed as 6 f a x v t x f i x v v x f ν x 1 re 2 v x f p x p x the effect of added force f x on the boundary of solid boundary calculated form formula 5 and 6 needs to be applied into the surrounding fluid grids by using of an interpolation process as shown in fig 3 a series of discrete points called lagrange point are used to describe the boundary of aug s geometry seen in fig 3 a while the flow field is discretized as another series of points called euler point seen in fig 3 b the force obtained by formula 7 is called the lagrange force the process of interpolating lagrange force into surrounding fluid mesh can be expressed as 7 f i j k 1 d s h f x k where x k is the certain lagrange point of aug ds is the spatial distance between the lagrange point and euler point h is the grid space i j k is the coordinate of the corresponding euler point and f i j k denotes the virtual force of the euler point with the coordinate i j k before the above interpolation process there exists a process of filtering the fluid grid points euler point around the solid boundary that is determining which fluid grid points the added force is interpolated to as for the fluid point around the boundary of solid body if the distance between the closest lagrange point and itself is less than the single grid space then it can be regarded as the fluid point to be interpolated the detailed procedure of the interpolation process in single time step can be expressed as 1 the velocity and pressure field of certain lagrange point in current time step t0 can be calculated directly from the previous time step t0 δt by solving the n s equation 2 once if the velocity ad pressure value is acquired the added force f xk at the point of xk can be easily calculated from formula 5 3 after that the obtained added force f xk will be interpolated back to the closest euler point through formula 7 and the new value of velocity and pressure field in nest time step t0 δt will be acquired by solving the n s equation in current simulation velocity boundary condition is imposed at inlet and no back flow condition is applied at outlet the other surrounding boundaries are all set as the uniform velocity condition based on our convergence tests for the present problem the computational domain for fluid flow is chosen as 5 10 4 4 4 4 in x y and z directions and the grid size in each direction is uniform with grid spacing 0 03 in the near region of the aug and gradually increases in a geometric progression to a coarser spacing of 0 1 in the far field the time step is chosen as 0 001 the numerical computation in our current study was not considered converged until periodic history patterns of the monitored variables were available as well as the difference between their period averaged values from one period to the next should be less than 0 1 a time duration of about six motion periods was found to be acceptable particularly for the integrated statistics of forces moment and propulsive efficiency as for the discretization of the navier stokes equations the second order projection method is applied here to solve eq 2 and eq 3 and the crank nicolson method is utilized for the dissipation term while other terms are discretized by the adams bashforth method the specific introduction of discretization and the validation of current method can refer to our previous work li et al 2018 pan and li 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug in this section the hydrodynamic performance of current hybrid driven aug under different motion parameters heaving amplitude flapping frequency pitching amplitude will be analyzed unlike previous study we focus on the aug s normal cruise status meaning that the mean drag experienced by the fuselage d f u s e l a g e should equal to the thrusts generated by the flapping foils t f l a p p i n g f o i l so that the aug may achieve cruise state under constant gliding speed in order to satisfy the balance condition the motion parameters need to be adjusted several times taking v 1 0 m s θ 0 30 and f 0 8 hz as example seen in table 1 four different h 0 magnitudes have been chosen to try to satisfy the force balance condition and when the h 0 is set as 0 163 the difference between the mean thrust force t f l a p p i n g f o i l and mean drag d f u s e l a g e nearly equals to zero o 10 4 we may say the balance condition is satisfied under that combination of parameters the newly defined propulsive efficiency of current bionic aug is expressed as formula 8 where pout and pin represent the output power and input power of the system respectively the pin consists of two parts the pin foil and pin fuselage representing the energy required by the foil and fuselage to overcome the resistance t t denotes the thrust force generated by the flapping foil l t and m t are the lift force and moment force experienced by the flapping foil respectively compared with the single flapping foil s propulsive efficiency that there is a non zero fluid force acting on the wing foil in current study we only focus on the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity therefore the net fluid force acting on the whole aug is nearly zero by adjusting the motion parameters and the resistance or energy consumption of the fuselage may vary from individual to individual under different moving velocities and combination of motion parameters in view of this in order to accurately characterize the propulsive efficiency of hybrid driven aug system which consists of two flapping foils and one fuselage the effect of the fuselage has been taken into the consideration here 8 η p o u t p i n p o u t p i n f o i l p i n f u s e l a g e 1 t 0 t

hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is firstly investigated and the heaving amplitude h 0 is set variable to satisfy the force balance condition the pitching amplitude is set as a constant value θ 0 30 the dimensionless frequency st combining the effects of incoming velocity flapping frequency and heaving amplitude is defined as st 2 h 0 f v the variation curves of propulsive efficiency with flapping frequencies under various incoming velocities and the corresponding values of heaving amplitudes h 0 are shown in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4 a the changing tendency of aug s propulsive efficiency with the flapping frequency under different incoming velocities are very similar with each other the propulsive efficiency increases first and then decrease with the growth of flapping frequency and there exists optimum frequency corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency under each incoming velocity it can be also noted that the value of highest propulsive efficiency shows little gradual decrease with the increase of cruise speeds meaning that the high gliding speed and longer gliding range cannot be satisfied at the same time and if we want to achieve higher gliding speed we must pay the price for cutting down longer range besides that it can be also found the lower the gliding speed is the shorter the range of corresponding flapping frequency f will be for example when the gliding speed is set as 0 5 m s the available flapping frequency ranges from 0 2 0 5 and there will exist no suitable heaving amplitude h 0 to satisfy the balance condition when the flapping frequency exceeds that range with the further increase of gliding speed the range of cooperated flapping frequency shows corresponding increase so is the magnitude of flapping frequency as for the relationship of the heaving amplitude and flapping frequency seen in fig 4 b apparently there exists linear correlation between the heaving amplitude and flapping frequency linear fittings are also made in fig 4 b the slope ratios of fitting lines are 2 48 1 83 1 46 and 1 33 corresponding to the moving velocity v 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 5 m s respectively that conclusion is of great significance for the adjustment of motion parameters in the following prototype production as mentioned above the effects the incoming velocity flapping frequency and heaving amplitude can be combined as the effect of the dimensionless number st and the corresponding result of fig 4 can be summarized in fig 5 similar with fig 4 a the propulsive efficiency of aug shows first increase and then decrease with the growth of st number and there exist optimum st number leading to highest propulsive efficiency under each moving velocity more importantly the optimum st number under different incoming velocities are similar with each other around 0 52 meaning that the st number still plays vital role in evaluating the propulsive performance of bionic aug 4 1 2 effect of heaving amplitude on propulsive performance of current aug in this subsection effect of heaving amplitude on hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is investigated and the pitching amplitude θ 0 is set variable to satisfy the balance condition the flapping frequency is set as constant f 0 6 hz seen in fig 6 a propulsive efficiency of aug under different incoming velocities except for the v 0 5 m s has the same changing tendency that is firstly increase and then decrease and there exist optimum h 0 leading to highest propulsive efficiency as for the case of v 0 5 m s the propulsive efficiency shows sharp decrease with the increase of h 0 that strange phenomenon can be explained as follows the magnitude of h 0 chosen in current study ranges from 0 2 to 0 5 for the consideration of satisfying the balance condition once if more larger range of h 0 is selected the maximum propulsive efficiency for the case of v 0 5 m s will be found and the mutual relationship of h 0 and ƞ may have the similar changing tendency as for the relationship of pitching amplitude θ 0 and heaving amplitude h 0 seen in fig 6 b similar with fig 5 b there exist linear relationship between θ 0 and h 0 and the slope ratios of fitting lines are 32 5 62 0 66 5 and 68 corresponding to the moving velocity v 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 5 m s respectively that conclusion is also helpful for the future adjustment of motion parameter similar with fig 5 propulsive efficiency under different st numers are plot in fig 7 as can be vividly seen from fig 7 the highest propulsive efficiency can be acquired around st 0 5 which is approximately the same with the magnitude in fig 5 4 1 3 effect of pitching amplitude on propulsive performance of current aug in this subsection effect of pitching amplitude on hybrid driven aug s propulsive performance is investigated and the flapping frequency f is set variable to satisfy the balance condition the heaving amplitude h 0 is set as constant h 0 0 5 seen in fig 8 a the propulsive efficiency of aug shows gradual growth with the increase of θ 0 and then presents tendency of decrease with the further increase of θ 0 the optimum θ 0 corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency under various incoming velocities are within the range of 30 40 similar with the optimum magnitude of single flapping foil the magnitudes of flapping frequency f to the pitching amplitude θ 0 are expressed in fig 8 b apparently there also exists linear relationship between the flapping frequency and pitching amplitude and the slope ratios of fitting line under various incoming velocities show little variation around 0 01 combined with the above conclusions we can find that there exists mutual linear correlation between three motion parameters and that conclusion is of significant reference value for the motion parameter adjust in the subsequent prototype experiment similarly propulsive efficiency of aug under different st numbers and incoming velocities are also presented in fig 9 as vividly seen from fig 9 optimum st number leading to highest propulsive efficiency under different incoming velocities is around 0 5 4 2 flow structure of current aug considering that the flow structures of hybrid driven aug have a close connection with its hydrodynamic performance therefore the vortex structures at the rear part of the hybrid driven aug will be presented and discussed and all the vortex structures presented here are all defined by the λ 2 criterion which is proposed by the jeong and hussain three typical st numbers are chosen here to shown the difference of vortex structures among them with same pitching amplitude and moving velocity θ 0 30 and v 1 0 m s and different heaving amplitude and flapping frequency the corresponding st numbers are 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 respectively and the resultant propulsive efficiency are 31 5 44 2 and 26 6 respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the typical vortex ring structures all emerge at the wake of the flow field of aug with three different st numbers as a result of the twin hydrofoils flapping motion it can be understood as that when the hydrofoil moves up to the maximum height and then move back to initial position in the first half motion period the vortex on the surface of hydrofoil starts to fall off at the trailing edge and the shedding vortex connected with the wingtip vortex will be stretched at the rear part of aug leading to a half of vortex ring under the impact of incoming flow when the hydrofoil moves down to the minimum height and then move back to initial position in the second half motion period another half of vortex ring emerges and growing number of vortex rings will show up at the wake of aug with the hydrofoils continuous motion the difference of vortex structures among these three aug under different st numbers lies in vortex obliquity an angle between the center line of vortex ring and the horizontal line it can be vividly seen from fig 10 that the vortex obliquity of case st 0 3 fig 10 a is a little larger than the case of st 0 5 fig 10 b despite of the fact that the corresponding heaving amplitude h 0 in the case of st 0 3 is larger than that of the case st 0 5 when it comes to the case of st 1 0 fig 10 c the vortex obliquity reaches maximum value as a result of the largest flapping frequency according to the vortex dynamics theory large amounts of energy will be released during the process of the vortex ring s release as a result of the strong momentum exchange the released energy can be divided into two parts the horizontal and the vertical component and it can be easily gotten that the smaller the vortex obliquity is the more the horizontal energy component will be since the main focus of our proposed hybrid driven aug is to utilize the twin foils flapping motion to increase its gliding speed thus the horizontal energy component is favorable for this aug therefore it can be conjectured that the smaller the vortex obliquity is the more horizontal energy component is produced and the better the propulsive performance of aug will be 5 conclusions in this article a novel conceptual design of hybrid driven aug with active twin hydrofoil undergoing flapping motion is proposed and the twin hydrofoil merely work in the case of aug encountering severe sea conditions and remains stationary at other times a force balance condition need to be satisfied by adjusting the motion parameters the aug may glide at a constant speed the numerical simulation has also been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of current aug under different incoming velocities by using of immersed boundary method and the reynolds number in current study varies from 100 to 300 when the moving velocity alters from 0 5 m s 1 5 m s the conclusions acquired in this study can be summarized as 1 the propulsive efficiency of current aug increases first and then decreases with the growth of all motion parameters i e the heaving amplitude the pitching amplitude and flapping frequency under different incoming velocities and there exists optimum motion parameters leading to highest propulsive efficiency the highest propulsive efficiency under different incoming velocities shows obvious decrease with the increase of moving velocity meaning that the high moving velocity and the gliding endurance could not be achieved at the same time 2 there exists mutual linear relationship among flapping foil s motion parameters when the force balance condition is satisfied and that conclusion is of great significance for the future prototype development and motion parameters adjustment 3 the vortex obliquity has strong connection with the propulsive performance of current aug the little the vortex obliquity is the more horizontal energy input will be produced and the better the propulsive performance will be funding supports from national natural scientific foundation of china with the grant no 51279184 are acknowledged credit

21607,cooperative localization is one of the recent techniques that are being utilized for localization navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs received signal strength rss based cooperative localization is relatively unexplored field and only a little literature is available about it proper positioning of the sensors to maximize the observability of the auvs is very critical for cooperative localization in this paper a method for estimating optimal geometric configuration of sensors is presented for 3d localization of targets using rrs measurements an evaluation function based on fisher information matrix fim theory has been derived keeping in view the underwater acoustic channel characteristics most of the real world constraints such as acoustic waves characteristics in water multiple auvs system and computation complexity have been considered the proposed evaluation function has been solved using successive optimization algorithm to obtain optimal positions of the sensors the algorithm ensured that the computation complexity should remain limited even when number of sensor auvs is increased various simulation examples are then presented to calculate optimal formation for different systems situations finally efficacy of proposed method has been proved using extended kalman filter ekf based simulations to compare the localization error between optimal formations and random formations of the sensors keywords cooperative localization autonomous underwater vehicle received signal strength sensors placement optimization underwater navigation 1 introduction with the advancements in computing and sensor technology autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are now being used for many tasks which were previously being carried out using manned or towed vehicles oceanographic surveys pollution monitoring underwater search and rescue disaster prevention structure monitoring military surveillance and mine counter operations are few of the examples of the modern day applications of auvs stutters et al huang et al 2017 although the research progress in the capabilities of the auvs has been steady over the past decade there still remain some key research challenges unlike ground or aerial vehicles self localization is one of the most difficult tasks for an auv operation this is because of the fact that electromagnetic waves are severely attenuated in water and therefore global positioning system gps cannot be used for localization of auvs burdic 2002 the various localization methods that are currently being used for auv operations can be categorized as inertial navigation geophysical navigation acoustic navigation or combinations of these methods kinsey et al due to accelerometer drift inertial navigation system ins may accumulate error with the passage of time leading to unbound degradation of localization accuracy of auvs geophysical navigation system uses observable physical features of the surrounding environment of the auvs to estimate their position however this method is only suitable for limited applications acoustic navigation in combination with ins is presently the most common and reliable navigation method that is suitable for vide range of the auvs operations xiao et al 2017 tan et al 2014 huang et al 2017 cooperative localization is the most advanced method based on acoustic navigation and ins cooperative localization offers the advantages of accurate localization for longer duration and wide area operation of auvs webster et al 2013 gao and chitre 2010 qi et al 2017 in cooperative localization the auvs which are actually performing underwater operation are called targets or slave auvs the targets are equipped with ins and acoustic modems some of the auvs called pilot vessels or sensors are deployed at or new water surface the accurate position of the sensors is known at all time using gps or other reliable methods the target auvs measure their position relative to accurate position of sensors and apply correction to ins to bound its error the key methods to estimate target s relative positions with respect to sensors are angle of arrival aoa range measurement time difference of arrival tdoa and received signal strength rss toa and tdoa based cooperative localization requires precise clock synchronization which may not be suitable or cost effective to some of the underwater applications bo et al 2019a moreover aoa based cooperative localization may not be the most suitable choice because time varying path loss multiple path affect and bending of sound waves in water etter 2003 therefore rss based cooperative localization is a preferable choice for many underwater applications due to ease of its implementation and cost effectiveness rss based cooperative localization depends upon estimating the sensor s range by using path loss propagation model and measuring power of the received signal after measuring the range of a target auv from all the sensors its position is estimated utilizing multilateration each sensor is considered to be located at the centre of a circle whose radius is the estimated range of the target from the sensor the target lies on the circumference of the circle the intersection of the circumferences is the location of the target node at least three or more sensors are needed to estimate the target s positioning in 2d while four or more sensors are required in the case of 3d position estimation beside other implementation challenges associated with cooperative localization accurate rss measurements and subsequently range estimation is a difficult task due to multiple path effect varying speed of sound in water and dependence of sound propagation on bathy condition although the above mentioned factors are mostly uncontrollable due to harsh underwater environment the accuracy of rss based position estimation can still be optimized using suitable estimation algorithm and by maximizing the observability of the sensor auvs by stationing them at maximum observable location called optimal formation of sensor auvs in ensuring paragraphs we will discuss the existing research in the field of cooperative localization particularly for auvs first of all we will discuss the literature review about estimation algorithms cooperative localization estimation algorithm development for cooperative localization is mature research area now as many researchers have worked in this field for instance in baccou et al 2001 the authors presented a method for position estimation of an auv by measuring its range from a fixed beacon from different locations around the beacon auv was navigated in a way to optimize the observability of beacon by maximizing the fisher information matrix fim similarly extended kalman filter ekf morgado et al 2013 cubature kalman filter ckf dong et al 2019 and unscented kalman filter ukf ming yong et al 2011 are various modifications of kalman filter that have been used as estimation algorithms for cooperative localization of auvs moreover huber based estimation algorithms bo et al 2019b have also been presented in literature for cooperative localization of auvs under non gaussian noise condition in this paragraph literature review about optimal placement of sensors for cooperative localization of auvs will be discussed in lohrasbipeydeh et al 2014 minimax optimization and semi definite programming is applied to estimate the source location which is efficient for large signal to noise ratio scenario in xinpeng and wei sheng 2012 the authors proposed an evaluation function based on cramer rao lower bound crlb and fim to estimate the optimal formation of two leaders for localization of auvs it was suggested that for two leaders cooperative localization the optimal formation is 90 separation between leader and the follower auvs further by utilizing the same method they presented the optimal formation for three leaders and one follower system in xinpeng et al 2014 it was suggested that leaders should stay around the follower at 120 with each other for achieving maximum observability moreover sensitivity of the localization performance with respect to the smaller change of distance and angle between leaders and follower was analyzed in wang and inkol 2011 efficient least squares solution was presented for rssd based localization of transmitter deep theoretical analysis about the effect of sensor target geometry on rss based localization performance was presented in bishop and jensfelt 2009 in liu et al 2006 a novel and efficient method for localization of receiver was presented based on hyperbolic curves and circumferences which are defined by rssd measurements from various transmitters the authors also validated the simulated results with various field experiments in wang et al 2012 solutions to rss based localization of transmitter were presented for unknown transmit power and unknown path loss exponent using weighted least squares estimation and alternating estimation procedures respectively finally in cheung et al 2003 an algorithm for localization of mobile phones was presented using rss measurements from base stations using constrained weighted least squares method it can be seen from the past literature of cooperative localization that there are only few papers that have studied the effect sensors or receivers positions on its localization performance particularly for cooperative localization of auvs few researchers have presented the optimal sensors formation for cooperative localization of auvs but they have mostly considered solutions aoa toa or tdoa based cooperative localization techniques although rss based cooperative localization is an attractive and low cost method sensors formation for the same has rarely been studied in the past it is also pertinent to highlight that cooperative localization for underwater vehicles has unique challenges associated with it due to dynamic underwater environment few factors that make underwater localization difficult and distinctive from above water localization are as follows 1 the target auvs are operating underwater and are to localized in 3d on the other hand the sensors auvs can only be placed at water surface in 2d this is contrary to most of the previous literature where 2d localization of the target was considered in the few cases where 3d localization was considered it was assumed that both sensors and targets can be located anywhere in 3d 2 another important aspect that is to be considered for underwater localization is that the measurement noise is distance dependent due to acoustic signal spreading 3 range estimation based on rss measurements depends upon the distance that the wave has traveled from the target to the sensor for above water measurements this is the shortest distance between target and the sensor however the acoustic wave does not travel in a straight path as is the case for above water waves so distance traveled by the sound wave is greater than the actual target sensor range in the literature of cooperative localization and sensor placement sound wave was mostly considered to be traveling in a straight line in this paper a novel method is presented to estimate optimal geometric configuration of sensor auvs for the cooperative localization of targets using rss measurements all the above mentioned challenges related to cooperative localization of auvs have been considered to obtain a solution that is suitable for practical applications first of all an evaluation function based on crlb and fim has been derived then the evaluation function has been used to find the optimal formation of the sensor auvs using a recursive optimization strategy the efficacy of the method has been verified using various simulation examples for different scenarios the remaining paper is organized as follows problem formulation is affirmed in the next section the proposed evaluation function based on fim and crlb is derived in section 3 the optimal solution of the evaluation function based on recursive strategy has been explained in section 4 in section 5 various simulation examples are presented for different scenarios and the paper is concluded in section 6 the framework of the whole research process and simulation examples is shown in fig 1 2 problem statement consider a target auv is operating underwater at t x y z t where depth of the target is known using depth sensor in order to localize the target auv using the rss measurements n sensor auvs are deployed on the surface at s i x i y i z i t i 1 2 3 n as shown in fig 2 the actual range between ith sensor and the target is given as 1 d i s i t the target auv transmits acoustic waves with power p t the average noise free received power at ith sensor is given as 2 ρ i k o p t d i where α is path loss exponent and its value is between 1 and 6 and k o is path loss for reference distance typically at 1 m the actual received power at the ith sensor is given as 3 ρ i ρ i ω i where ω i is measurement noise keeping in view the underwater acoustic channel characteristics we assume that the rss measurements will be corrupted by the noise which is dependent on the range of target from the sensor such measurement noise may be defined as follows bo et al 2018 4 ω i σ 1 η d i γ the covariance matrix will be defined as follows 5 e ω i ω i t ω i σ 2 1 η d i γ 2 i where i is an n by n identity matrix and η and γ are distance related noise parameters expressing 2 and 3 in db and assuming ρ i d b ρ i d b p t d b k o d b 6 ρ i d b 10 log 10 d i ω i let s define the vectors ρ ρ and d as follows ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ n ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ n and d d 1 d 2 d n it is important to highlight that in most of the previous work on optimal formation the underwater sound speed was taken as a constant although it varies with temperature pressure and salinity due to varying speed the sound wave propagates does not travel in a straight line in order to consider this important aspect we have assumed that the underwater sound speed profile ssp is a function of the depth and the sound wave travels along a curved path as shown in fig 3 berger et al 2008 following was assumed for underwater sound wave propagation and measurement a direct propagation path exists between the sensors and the target in the presence of a typical underwater multipath environment it is possible to receive and measure signal strength of the first received wave the ssp is known to be depth dependent isogradient only i e the field of interest is vertically stratified with the above assumptions the speed of sound is given as 7 v z a z b where z indicates the depth of the target auv a is the steepness of ssp and b represents the sound speed at the water surface as the speed of sound will change with the depth the sound wave will follow a curved path to reach the sensors so the distance that the sound wave will travel will not be the same as the shortest distance between sensors and the target the received signal strength given by eq 6 actually depends upon the distance curved path that the sound wave has traveled which is governed by snell s law 8 cos θ c z cos θ i c z i cos θ t c z k o θ π 2 π 2 where θ i and θ t are the sound wave angles at i t h sensor and target respectively and are given as berger et al 2008 θ i β o α o θ t β o α o where α o and β o are defined in fig 3 and are calculated as tan β o z z i r r i 1 tan β o tan α o 1 tan β o tan α o b a z b a z i where z and z i are the operating depths of the target and the i t h sensor respectively moreover r r i indicate the horizontal distance between the target and the i t h sensor and is defined as r r i x x i 2 y y i 2 from fig 2 9 l z sin θ from 7 and 8 10 z 1 a k o sin θ θ substituting 10 into 9 and taking derivative w r t θ 11 l i a z b θ t θ i a cos θ t where l i is the actual distance that sound wave has traveled form target to the ith sensor so the actual received power at ith sensor is now given as 12 ρ i d b 10 log 10 l i ω i 3 derivation of evaluation function in this section we have used the theory of crlb and fim to derive the proposed evaluation function for estimating the optimal formation in first step we will derive the evaluation function for a single target cooperative localization system then based on its outcome we will derive the evaluation function for a multiple target system 3 1 evaluation function for single target system the maximum likelihood function for ρ given the target position t and noise covariance matrix σ is defined as bo et al 2018 13 p ρ 1 2 π n 2 σ j 1 2 exp 1 2 ρ 10 log 10 l t ω 1 ρ 10 log 10 l taking logarithm of eq 13 14 ln p ρ constant 1 2 ρ 10 log 10 l t

determinant of fim we will get our required evaluation function for single target system 24 f f i m 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 i 1 n f i x 2 ω i i 1 n f i y 2 ω i i 1 n f i x f i y ω i 2 alternatively the evaluation function can also be defined as 25 f fim 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 m n t where m i 1 n a i x 2 σ i i 1 n a i x a i y σ i and n i 1 n a i y 2 σ i i 1 n a i x a i y σ i for the single target rss measurements based cooperative localization system equations 23 and 24 represent the evaluation function that will be used for estimating the optimal sensors positions in fact the evaluation function is the measure of observability of the target auv which is dependent upon the sensors positions the observability will be maximum when the evaluation function will reach its maximum value and hence that formation of the sensors will be the optimal formation 3 2 evaluation function for multi target system consider that there are m target auvs are operating underwater at positions t j x j y j z j t j 1 2 3 m in order to localize the target auvs using the rss measurements n sensor auvs are deployed on the surface at s i x i y i z i t i 1 2 3 n as shown in fig 4 to find evaluation function for such system the matrix g is to be calculated separately for each target as 26 g j t j l l x j l y j where 27 l i x j l i r j x j x i r j r i 28 l i y j l i r j y j y i r j r i fim for jth target auv can be derived using eqs 20 21 and 25 as follows f i m j 10 ln 10 2 1 m 1 n l m 2 i 1 n f i j x 2 ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i i 1 n f i j y 2 ω i where a i j x l i x j a i j y l i y j and ω i σ 2 1 η d i γ 2 the determinant of fim of jth target is as follows 29 f i m j 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 i 1 n f i j x 2 ω i i 1 n f i j y 2 ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i 2 the value of eq 28 indicates the amount of rss related information available from jth target which is dependent upon the sensors positions when its value is the maximum the corresponding sensors formation is optimal for that target however this sensors formation may not be the optimal for other target auvs the optimal formation of sensors with respect to all the targets is obtained by maximizing the evaluation function that is given by sum of natural log of eq 28 of all the targets f f i m 1 f i m 2 f i m m 30 f j 1 m ln f i m j 3 3 unknown target position for the derivation of the evaluation functions in sections 3 1 and 3 2 it was assumed that the accurate targets positions are known beforehand in real situations however only the depth of the target is accurately known using pressure sensors the position in xy plane can only be known with an uncertainty depending upon the type of application of the target auv in order to cater for this issue the eq 29 can be modified by considering that the jth target is known to lie in a well defined region of uncertainty r j which is described in terms of the probability density function f t j as shown in fig 5 the evaluation function for multi target cooperative localization system can now be defined as 31 f j 1 m ln r j f i m j f t j d t j 4 iterative optimization algorithm solving eq 29 for estimating the optimal sensors positions becomes computationally very complex as the number of targets and sensors increases in multi target cooperative localization system therefore the eq 29 was solved using an iterative optimization algorithm that ensured that the calculation was achievable even for higher number of targets the iterative optimization algorithm is implemented as follows see fig 6 for each target auv calculate f i m j based on the sensors present positions x i t y i t at time t calculate fim j using eq 28 and sum them using eq 29 to get the evaluation function value in current step as f t calculate the derivatives x i t f t and y i t f t with respect to x and y coordinates of sensors current positions update the position of each sensor using following equations 32 x i t 1 x i t ψ x i t f t 33 y i t 1 y i t ψ y i t f t where ψ is the step size and can be varied as per requirement a higher step size will leave to quicker computation with lesser accuracy and vice versa the value of ψ used for simulation examples was 100 again calculate f i m j based on the updated sensor positions x i t 1 y i t 1 and subsequently calculate the updated evaluation function f t 1 compare the present step evaluation function to the previous step evaluation function if f t 1 f t it means the updated sensors positions can improve the observability of the system so go back to step 3 to start the next calculation based on the updated sensors positions if f t 1 f t it means that current sensors positions are optimal for cooperation localization as the system observability is maximum the algorithm is to be terminated 5 simulation examples for all the simulations is this section the sound speed at water surface b and the steepness of ssp a in equation 7 are taken as 1500 and 0 1 respectively moreover the values of parameters σ η and γ in equation 4 are taken as 0 1 0 05 and 1 respectively 5 1 single target system in this section it is assumed that a single target auv is operating under water at 0 0 50 three sensors are supposed to be placed at water surface for cooperative localization of the target using rss measurements the sensors are initially placed randomly around the target area at 0 30 30 30 and 15 40 then using the proposed method the optimal positions of the sensors are estimated to be 47 58 30 68 50 02 25 66 and 2 56 56 1 respectively the value of evaluation function in xy plane is plotted on a contour plot and is shown in fig 7 the target auv s position in 2d is displayed by red dot and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed by blue crosses in order to evaluate the effect of depth of the target auv the optimal sensors positions are estimated by placing the target at 50 m 100 m and 150 m depth the estimated optimal formations are summarized in table 1 it can be analyzed that as the target depth is reduced the optimal positions of the sensors become closer to the target and vice versa 5 2 multiple targets system 5 2 1 two targets four sensors system in this simulation example it is assumed that there are two target auvs operating underwater at 10 10 50 and 10 10 50 respectively for cooperative localization of the targets using rss measurements four sensors are randomly placed at 40 0 20 15 10 45 and 10 30 respectively the 2d plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 8 and the optimal sensors positions are summarized in table 2 the targets positions in 2d are displayed by red dots and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed using blue crosses 5 2 2 three targets five sensors system in this simulation example it is assumed that five sensors are randomly placed at 40 0 20 15 10 45 10 40 and 40 50 respectively the 2d plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 9 and the optimal sensors positions are summarized in table 3 the targets positions in 2d are displayed by red dots and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed using blue crosses 5 3 uncertainty in target s location in this simulation example it is assumed that the target s precise position is not known a priori and the target is only known to be located in a specific area i e a square of 15 m 15 m in xy plane centered at z axis three sensors are placed at the surface randomly at 40 25 25 15 and 30 25 respectively using equation 30 the optimal sensors positions are estimated and are summarized in table 3 the 2d contour plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 10 the blue square represents the two dimensional projection of the target s position uncertainty area it can be analyzed from fig 8 and table 4 that the optimal formation of the sensors is spread out depending upon the area of uncertainty of the target auv 5 4 position estimation using extended kalman filter in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed optimal formations in reducing the localization error several simulations of rss based cooperative localization are performed based on extended kalman filter ekf the localization accuracy achieved from optimally placed sensors was compared with that of any random formation of the sensors considering the example of two targets and four sensors and setting the simulation time as 500 s for each target in different formations the average localization error was calculated the both average values were combined to calculate the overall localization error of the system the simulation was repeated 300 times and the achieved localization error from both the formations was plotted in fig 8 the blue asterisk plot shows the localization error when the sensors were placed randomly at 40 0 20 15 10 45 and 10 30 the red dots plot represents the localization error when the sensors were placed at optimal positions estimated in section 4 2 1 it can be analyzed from the fig 11 that the system accuracy has improved when the sensors are placed in optimal formation in 300 simulation cycles the average localization error of the random formation is 2 9758 m and that of optimal formation is 1 8038 m in conclusion the optimal formation is able to decrease the noise error and enhance the observability of the system 6 conclusion in this paper a new method for obtaining optimal formation of sensor auvs for cooperative localization of submerged auvs using rss measurements is presented fim based evaluation function was derived in term of sensors positions the optimal sensors formation was estimated by maximizing the evaluation function which was achieved by an iterative optimization algorithm the effect of target auv s depth on optimal sensors was analyzed ekf based auvs localization simulations confirmed that the proposed optimal formation were able to reduce localization error significantly the proposed method when utilized for cooperative localization of auvs will minimize the positioning error by maximizing the rss related information by enhancing the localization accuracy of auv it will be suitable for many applications other than cooperative localization as well such as cooperative sensor motion control target tracking adaptive control etc future work will be focused on experimental verification of the proposed method and studying its performance when used with selected algorithms for

pilot vessels or sensors are deployed at or new water surface the accurate position of the sensors is known at all time using gps or other reliable methods the target auvs measure their position relative to accurate position of sensors and apply correction to ins to bound its error the key methods to estimate target s relative positions with respect to sensors are angle of arrival aoa range measurement time difference of arrival tdoa and received signal strength rss toa and tdoa based cooperative localization requires precise clock synchronization which may not be suitable or cost effective to some of the underwater applications bo et al 2019a moreover aoa based cooperative localization may not be the most suitable choice because time varying path loss multiple path affect and bending of sound waves in water etter 2003 therefore rss based cooperative localization is a preferable choice for many underwater applications due to ease of its implementation and cost effectiveness rss based cooperative localization depends upon estimating the sensor s range by using path loss propagation model and measuring power of the received signal after measuring the range of a target auv from all the sensors its position is estimated utilizing multilateration each sensor is considered to be located at the centre of a circle whose radius is the estimated range of the target from the sensor the target lies on the circumference of the circle the intersection of the circumferences is the location of the target node at least three or more sensors are needed to estimate the target s positioning in 2d while four or more sensors are required in the case of 3d position estimation beside other implementation challenges associated with cooperative localization accurate rss measurements and subsequently range estimation is a difficult task due to multiple path effect varying speed of sound in water and dependence of sound propagation on bathy condition although the above mentioned factors are mostly uncontrollable due to harsh underwater environment the accuracy of rss based position estimation can still be optimized using suitable estimation algorithm and by maximizing the observability of the sensor auvs by stationing them at maximum observable location called optimal formation of sensor auvs in ensuring paragraphs we will discuss the existing research in the field of cooperative localization particularly for auvs first of all we will discuss the literature review about estimation algorithms cooperative localization estimation algorithm development for cooperative localization is mature research area now as many researchers have worked in this field for instance in baccou et al 2001 the authors presented a method for position estimation of an auv by measuring its range from a fixed beacon from different locations around the beacon auv was navigated in a way to optimize the observability of beacon by maximizing the fisher information matrix fim similarly extended kalman filter ekf morgado et al 2013 cubature kalman filter ckf dong et al 2019 and unscented kalman filter ukf ming yong et al 2011 are various modifications of kalman filter that have been used as estimation algorithms for cooperative localization of auvs moreover huber based estimation algorithms bo et al 2019b have also been presented in literature for cooperative localization of auvs under non gaussian noise condition in this paragraph literature review about optimal placement of sensors for cooperative localization of auvs will be discussed in lohrasbipeydeh et al 2014 minimax optimization and semi definite programming is applied to estimate the source location which is efficient for large signal to noise ratio scenario in xinpeng and wei sheng 2012 the authors proposed an evaluation function based on cramer rao lower bound crlb and fim to estimate the optimal formation of two leaders for localization of auvs it was suggested that for two leaders cooperative localization the optimal formation is 90 separation between leader and the follower auvs further by utilizing the same method they presented the optimal formation for three leaders and one follower system in xinpeng et al 2014 it was suggested that leaders should stay around the follower at 120 with each other for achieving maximum observability moreover sensitivity of the localization performance with respect to the smaller change of distance and angle between leaders and follower was analyzed in wang and inkol 2011 efficient least squares solution was presented for rssd based localization of transmitter deep theoretical analysis about the effect of sensor target geometry on rss based localization performance was presented in bishop and jensfelt 2009 in liu et al 2006 a novel and efficient method for localization of receiver was presented based on hyperbolic curves and circumferences which are defined by rssd measurements from various transmitters the authors also validated the simulated results with various field experiments in wang et al 2012 solutions to rss based localization of transmitter were presented for unknown transmit power and unknown path loss exponent using weighted least squares estimation and alternating estimation procedures respectively finally in cheung et al 2003 an algorithm for localization of mobile phones was presented using rss measurements from base stations using constrained weighted least squares method it can be seen from the past literature of cooperative localization that there are only few papers that have studied the effect sensors or receivers positions on its localization performance particularly for cooperative localization of auvs few researchers have presented the optimal sensors formation for cooperative localization of auvs but they have mostly considered solutions aoa toa or tdoa based cooperative localization techniques although rss based cooperative localization is an attractive and low cost method sensors formation for the same has rarely been studied in the past it is also pertinent to highlight that cooperative localization for underwater vehicles has unique challenges associated with it due to dynamic underwater environment few factors that make underwater localization difficult and distinctive from above water localization are as follows 1 the target auvs are operating underwater and are to localized in 3d on the other hand the sensors auvs can only be placed at water surface in 2d this is contrary to most of the previous literature where 2d localization of the target was considered in the few cases where 3d localization was considered it was assumed that both sensors and targets can be located anywhere in 3d 2 another important aspect that is to be considered for underwater localization is that the measurement noise is distance dependent due to acoustic signal spreading 3 range estimation based on rss measurements depends upon the distance that the wave has traveled from the target to the sensor for above water measurements this is the shortest distance between target and the sensor however the acoustic wave does not travel in a straight path as is the case for above water waves so distance traveled by the sound wave is greater than the actual target sensor range in the literature of cooperative localization and sensor placement sound wave was mostly considered to be traveling in a straight line in this paper a novel method is presented to estimate optimal geometric configuration of sensor auvs for the cooperative localization of targets using rss measurements all the above mentioned challenges related to cooperative localization of auvs have been considered to obtain a solution that is suitable for practical applications first of all an evaluation function based on crlb and fim has been derived then the evaluation function has been used to find the optimal formation of the sensor auvs using a recursive optimization strategy the efficacy of the method has been verified using various simulation examples for different scenarios the remaining paper is organized as follows problem formulation is affirmed in the next section the proposed evaluation function based on fim and crlb is derived in section 3 the optimal solution of the evaluation function based on recursive strategy has been explained in section 4 in section 5 various simulation examples are presented for different scenarios and the paper is concluded in section 6 the framework of the whole research process and simulation examples is shown in fig 1 2 problem statement consider a target auv is operating underwater at t x y z t where depth of the target is known using depth sensor in order to localize the target auv using the rss measurements n sensor auvs are deployed on the surface at s i x i y i z i t i 1 2 3 n as shown in fig 2 the actual range between ith sensor and the target is given as 1 d i s i t the target auv transmits acoustic waves with power p t the average noise free received power at ith sensor is given as 2 ρ i k o p t d i where α is path loss exponent and its value is between 1 and 6 and k o is path loss for reference distance typically at 1 m the actual received power at the ith sensor is given as 3 ρ i ρ i ω i where ω i is measurement noise keeping in view the underwater acoustic channel characteristics we assume that the rss measurements will be corrupted by the noise which is dependent on the range of target from the sensor such measurement noise may be defined as follows bo et al 2018 4 ω i σ 1 η d i γ the covariance matrix will be defined as follows 5 e ω i ω i t ω i σ 2 1 η d i γ 2 i where i is an n by n identity matrix and η and γ are distance related noise parameters expressing 2 and 3 in db and assuming ρ i d b ρ i d b p t d b k o d b 6 ρ i d b 10 log 10 d i ω i let s define the vectors ρ ρ and d as follows ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ n ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ n and d d 1 d 2 d n it is important to highlight that in most of the previous work on optimal formation the underwater sound speed was taken as a constant although it varies with temperature pressure and salinity due to varying speed the sound wave propagates does not travel in a straight line in order to consider this important aspect we have assumed that the underwater sound speed profile ssp is a function of the depth and the sound wave travels along a curved path as shown in fig 3 berger et al 2008 following was assumed for underwater sound wave propagation and measurement a direct propagation path exists between the sensors and the target in the presence of a typical underwater multipath environment it is possible to receive and measure signal strength of the first received wave the ssp is known to be depth dependent isogradient only i e the field of interest is vertically stratified with the above assumptions the speed of sound is given as 7 v z a z b where z indicates the depth of the target auv a is the steepness of ssp and b represents the sound speed at the water surface as the speed of sound will change with the depth the sound wave will follow a curved path to reach the sensors so the distance that the sound wave will travel will not be the same as the shortest distance between sensors and the target the received signal strength given by eq 6 actually depends upon the distance curved path that the sound wave has traveled which is governed by snell s law 8 cos θ c z cos θ i c z i cos θ t c z k o θ π 2 π 2 where θ i and θ t are the sound wave angles at i t h sensor and target respectively and are given as berger et al 2008 θ i β o α o θ t β o α o where α o and β o are defined in fig 3 and are calculated as tan β o z z i r r i 1 tan β o tan α o 1 tan β o tan α o b a z b a z i where z and z i are the operating depths of the target and the i t h sensor respectively moreover r r i indicate the horizontal distance between the target and the i t h sensor and is defined as r r i x x i 2 y y i 2 from fig 2 9 l z sin θ from 7 and 8 10 z 1 a k o sin θ θ substituting 10 into 9 and taking derivative w r t θ 11 l i a z b θ t θ i a cos θ t where l i is the actual distance that sound wave has traveled form target to the ith sensor so the actual received power at ith sensor is now given as 12 ρ i d b 10 log 10 l i ω i 3 derivation of evaluation function in this section we have used the theory of crlb and fim to derive the proposed evaluation function for estimating the optimal formation in first step we will derive the evaluation function for a single target cooperative localization system then based on its outcome we will derive the evaluation function for a multiple target system 3 1 evaluation function for single target system the maximum likelihood function for ρ given the target position t and noise covariance matrix σ is defined as bo et al 2018 13 p ρ 1 2 π n 2 σ j 1 2 exp 1 2 ρ 10 log 10 l t ω 1 ρ 10 log 10 l taking logarithm of eq 13 14 ln p ρ constant 1 2 ρ 10 log 10 l t

determinant of fim we will get our required evaluation function for single target system 24 f f i m 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 i 1 n f i x 2 ω i i 1 n f i y 2 ω i i 1 n f i x f i y ω i 2 alternatively the evaluation function can also be defined as 25 f fim 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 m n t where m i 1 n a i x 2 σ i i 1 n a i x a i y σ i and n i 1 n a i y 2 σ i i 1 n a i x a i y σ i for the single target rss measurements based cooperative localization system equations 23 and 24 represent the evaluation function that will be used for estimating the optimal sensors positions in fact the evaluation function is the measure of observability of the target auv which is dependent upon the sensors positions the observability will be maximum when the evaluation function will reach its maximum value and hence that formation of the sensors will be the optimal formation 3 2 evaluation function for multi target system consider that there are m target auvs are operating underwater at positions t j x j y j z j t j 1 2 3 m in order to localize the target auvs using the rss measurements n sensor auvs are deployed on the surface at s i x i y i z i t i 1 2 3 n as shown in fig 4 to find evaluation function for such system the matrix g is to be calculated separately for each target as 26 g j t j l l x j l y j where 27 l i x j l i r j x j x i r j r i 28 l i y j l i r j y j y i r j r i fim for jth target auv can be derived using eqs 20 21 and 25 as follows f i m j 10 ln 10 2 1 m 1 n l m 2 i 1 n f i j x 2 ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i i 1 n f i j y 2 ω i where a i j x l i x j a i j y l i y j and ω i σ 2 1 η d i γ 2 the determinant of fim of jth target is as follows 29 f i m j 10 ln 10 4 1 m 1 n l m 4 i 1 n f i j x 2 ω i i 1 n f i j y 2 ω i i 1 n f i j x f i j y ω i 2 the value of eq 28 indicates the amount of rss related information available from jth target which is dependent upon the sensors positions when its value is the maximum the corresponding sensors formation is optimal for that target however this sensors formation may not be the optimal for other target auvs the optimal formation of sensors with respect to all the targets is obtained by maximizing the evaluation function that is given by sum of natural log of eq 28 of all the targets f f i m 1 f i m 2 f i m m 30 f j 1 m ln f i m j 3 3 unknown target position for the derivation of the evaluation functions in sections 3 1 and 3 2 it was assumed that the accurate targets positions are known beforehand in real situations however only the depth of the target is accurately known using pressure sensors the position in xy plane can only be known with an uncertainty depending upon the type of application of the target auv in order to cater for this issue the eq 29 can be modified by considering that the jth target is known to lie in a well defined region of uncertainty r j which is described in terms of the probability density function f t j as shown in fig 5 the evaluation function for multi target cooperative localization system can now be defined as 31 f j 1 m ln r j f i m j f t j d t j 4 iterative optimization algorithm solving eq 29 for estimating the optimal sensors positions becomes computationally very complex as the number of targets and sensors increases in multi target cooperative localization system therefore the eq 29 was solved using an iterative optimization algorithm that ensured that the calculation was achievable even for higher number of targets the iterative optimization algorithm is implemented as follows see fig 6 for each target auv calculate f i m j based on the sensors present positions x i t y i t at time t calculate fim j using eq 28 and sum them using eq 29 to get the evaluation function value in current step as f t calculate the derivatives x i t f t and y i t f t with respect to x and y coordinates of sensors current positions update the position of each sensor using following equations 32 x i t 1 x i t ψ x i t f t 33 y i t 1 y i t ψ y i t f t where ψ is the step size and can be varied as per requirement a higher step size will leave to quicker computation with lesser accuracy and vice versa the value of ψ used for simulation examples was 100 again calculate f i m j based on the updated sensor positions x i t 1 y i t 1 and subsequently calculate the updated evaluation function f t 1 compare the present step evaluation function to the previous step evaluation function if f t 1 f t it means the updated sensors positions can improve the observability of the system so go back to step 3 to start the next calculation based on the updated sensors positions if f t 1 f t it means that current sensors positions are optimal for cooperation localization as the system observability is maximum the algorithm is to be terminated 5 simulation examples for all the simulations is this section the sound speed at water surface b and the steepness of ssp a in equation 7 are taken as 1500 and 0 1 respectively moreover the values of parameters σ η and γ in equation 4 are taken as 0 1 0 05 and 1 respectively 5 1 single target system in this section it is assumed that a single target auv is operating under water at 0 0 50 three sensors are supposed to be placed at water surface for cooperative localization of the target using rss measurements the sensors are initially placed randomly around the target area at 0 30 30 30 and 15 40 then using the proposed method the optimal positions of the sensors are estimated to be 47 58 30 68 50 02 25 66 and 2 56 56 1 respectively the value of evaluation function in xy plane is plotted on a contour plot and is shown in fig 7 the target auv s position in 2d is displayed by red dot and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed by blue crosses in order to evaluate the effect of depth of the target auv the optimal sensors positions are estimated by placing the target at 50 m 100 m and 150 m depth the estimated optimal formations are summarized in table 1 it can be analyzed that as the target depth is reduced the optimal positions of the sensors become closer to the target and vice versa 5 2 multiple targets system 5 2 1 two targets four sensors system in this simulation example it is assumed that there are two target auvs operating underwater at 10 10 50 and 10 10 50 respectively for cooperative localization of the targets using rss measurements four sensors are randomly placed at 40 0 20 15 10 45 and 10 30 respectively the 2d plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 8 and the optimal sensors positions are summarized in table 2 the targets positions in 2d are displayed by red dots and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed using blue crosses 5 2 2 three targets five sensors system in this simulation example it is assumed that five sensors are randomly placed at 40 0 20 15 10 45 10 40 and 40 50 respectively the 2d plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 9 and the optimal sensors positions are summarized in table 3 the targets positions in 2d are displayed by red dots and the sensors initial positions are shown by blue dots the final optimal sensors positions are displayed using blue crosses 5 3 uncertainty in target s location in this simulation example it is assumed that the target s precise position is not known a priori and the target is only known to be located in a specific area i e a square of 15 m 15 m in xy plane centered at z axis three sensors are placed at the surface randomly at 40 25 25 15 and 30 25 respectively using equation 30 the optimal sensors positions are estimated and are summarized in table 3 the 2d contour plot of the evaluation function is shown in fig 10 the blue square represents the two dimensional projection of the target s position uncertainty area it can be analyzed from fig 8 and table 4 that the optimal formation of the sensors is spread out depending upon the area of uncertainty of the target auv 5 4 position estimation using extended kalman filter in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed optimal formations in reducing the localization error several simulations of rss based cooperative localization are performed based on extended kalman filter ekf the localization accuracy achieved from optimally placed sensors was compared with that of any random formation of the sensors considering the example of two targets and four sensors and setting the simulation time as 500 s for each target in different formations the average localization error was calculated the both average values were combined to calculate the overall localization error of the system the simulation was repeated 300 times and the achieved localization error from both the formations was plotted in fig 8 the blue asterisk plot shows the localization error when the sensors were placed randomly at 40 0 20 15 10 45 and 10 30 the red dots plot represents the localization error when the sensors were placed at optimal positions estimated in section 4 2 1 it can be analyzed from the fig 11 that the system accuracy has improved when the sensors are placed in optimal formation in 300 simulation cycles the average localization error of the random formation is 2 9758 m and that of optimal formation is 1 8038 m in conclusion the optimal formation is able to decrease the noise error and enhance the observability of the system 6 conclusion in this paper a new method for obtaining optimal formation of sensor auvs for cooperative localization of submerged auvs using rss measurements is presented fim based evaluation function was derived in term of sensors positions the optimal sensors formation was estimated by maximizing the evaluation function which was achieved by an iterative optimization algorithm the effect of target auv s depth on optimal sensors was analyzed ekf based auvs localization simulations confirmed that the proposed optimal formation were able to reduce localization error significantly the proposed method when utilized for cooperative localization of auvs will minimize the positioning error by maximizing the rss related information by enhancing the localization accuracy of auv it will be suitable for many applications other than cooperative localization as well such as cooperative sensor motion control target tracking adaptive control etc future work will be focused on experimental verification of the proposed method and studying its performance when used with selected algorithms for

21608,although the practical use of bubbly drag reduction for marine vessels has begun to spread it is unclear how bubbles migrate along spatially developing turbulent boundary layers we measured the spatiotemporal distribution of the local void fraction beneath a 4 m long fully transparent flat bottom model ship towed in a 100 m long water tank with a ship speed of up to 3 00 m s bubbles were injected with both constant and periodically fluctuated air flow rates into the turbulent boundary layers with constant flow rates 2 5 mm bubbles caused spontaneous void waves i e quasiperiodic fluctuation of the local void fraction standing at 4 8 hz when repetitive bubble injection which formed artificial void waves downstream was applied void waves propagated at 47 53 of the ship speed during the propagation we found the apparent diffusion coefficient of the void wave taking values down to 10 4 m2 s and even negative values when the repetition frequency was set lower than the spontaneous frequency of void waves this indicates that the void waves persist for several tens of meter in application to ship hulls keywords bubbly drag reduction void waves turbulent boundary layer multiphase flow model ship 1 introduction air lubrication to reduce frictional drag on a ship hull has been studied for decades methods of air lubrication are classified into three types as explained by ceccio 2010 air layer drag reduction aldr partial cavity drag reduction pcdr and bubbly drag reduction bdr for aldr and pcdr the surface of the hull is totally or partially covered with gas film and insulated from the liquid turbulent flow to stabilize the air layer and cavity a number of investigations have been reported mäkiharju et al 2012 mäkiharju and ceccio 2018 for aldr and gokcay et al 2004 matveev 2007 mäkiharju et al 2013 for pcdr in contrast bdr modifies the internal structure of the turbulent boundary layer using dispersed bubbles murai et al 2006 reported the importance of bubble slip to local events of turbulence in the enhancement of drag reduction they also found that bdr performance is dependent on the bubble size relative to the boundary layer thickness murai et al 2007 expectations of energy saving by bdr have motivated studies of practical application to ships kodama et al 2008 reported 10 15 drag reduction on a 120 m long cement carrier by blowing gas into a turbulent boundary layer from compressors the net power saving was approximately 5 with canceling of the extra energy consumption for the compressors kumagai et al 2015 used hydrofoil type bubble generators to reduce the energy consumed for gas injection an approximately 10 net power saving was obtained by installing the devices on an 80 m long ferry and an 85 m long coaster other recent applications of bdr to 21 commercial vessels were reported by the american bureau of shipping 2019 since the first demonstration of bdr by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 for a submerged hull the fluid dynamics mechanism of bdr has been widely investigated the research until 2014 was summarized in a review by murai 2014 in which more than 190 reports were compared after the review a noticeable feature was discovered the bdr effect is enhanced as void waves quasiperiodic fluctuations of local void fraction stand in the two phase turbulent boundary layer park et al 2016 the void waves stand spontaneously for multiple reasons it begins with the clustering and coalescence of dispersed bubbles during their migration the phenomenon is analogous to the initiation of bubble to slug flow transition observed in vertical pipe flows lammers and biesheuvel 1996 the difference in the horizontal two phase flow from the vertical system is the contribution of the bubble buoyancy that always attracts bubbles to the wall surface hence the growth of void waves is an intrinsic process because of the bubble buoyancy murai et al 2007 sliding bubble behaviors oishi et al 2019 and the wettability of the wall surface kitagawa et al 2019 evolving from the drag reduction by spontaneously standing void waves the use of artificially synthesized void waves was examined by park et al 2014 and park et al 2015 for horizontal turbulent channel flows the artificial void waves were generated by injecting bubbles with periodically fluctuated gas flow rates this method provided higher time averaged drag reduction ratios compared with the bubble injection at constant gas flow rates the enhancement of bdr was confirmed in these channel flows especially at low time averaged bulk void fractions park et al 2016 derived a void wave equation from a two fluid model to explain mathematically the experimental results they found that local wall shear stress and the local void fraction are dynamically coupled to produce significant persistency of the void waves in a long downstream distance this indicates the usefulness of artificial void waves for ship drag reduction however artificial void waves in an external flow are supposed to disperse easily with the weak confinement of the flow the feasibility depends on how the artificial void waves are sustainable over a long downstream distance in the present work the persistence of artificially generated void waves in turbulent boundary layers beneath a 4 m long flat bottom model ship was investigated experimentally the bottom plate of the model ship is fully transparent and bubbles migrating beneath its bottom surface can be optically visualized park et al 2018 conducted an experiment using the same model ship and confirmed that spontaneous void waves emerged when a constant gas flow rate was supplied they attributed the spontaneity to tollemien schlichting kelvin helmholtz and richardson waves in the two phase turbulent boundary layer in the present work the downstream persistency of artificial void waves is reported giving new physical insights in the study of bdr as well as a new degree of freedom in the design of bdr for practical applications 2 experimental setup and conditions 2 1 towing test facility and model ship a model ship shown in fig 1 a made of transparent acrylic resin was installed in the towing test facility at hiroshima university japan the facility has been certified as a standard institute for ship performance examination iso 9001 the water tank shown in fig 1 b in the facility is 100 m long 8 0 m wide and 3 5 m deep the towing train of the facility runs at a speed up to 3 00 m s when hanging the model ship as shown in fig 1 c the train achieves a period with a constant speed between the acceleration and deceleration processes the period changes depending on the train speed and it becomes approximately 7 s for the maximum speed of the train corresponding to 21 m of displacement in the water tank the model ship with a 50 mm draft is 4 0 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high as shown in fig 2 beneath the bottom plate of the model ship 20 mm high side walls are equipped to prevent the entrance of hydraulic waves to the flat bottom plate as in fig 2 b the side walls preserve the two dimensional spatial development of the turbulent boundary layer on the bottom plate a tripping wire is fixed on the bow of the model ship to perturb the inflow onto the plate as shown in fig 2 c the wire is necessary to guarantee the reproducible spatial development of the turbulent boundary layer because of a smooth flat plate employed as the bdr target plane the model ship includes a gas buffer chamber located 0 7 m from the bow a part of the bottom plate in the chamber is replaced with a porous plastic plate to inject bubbles gas stored in the chamber is regulated at a constant pressure and then injected into the flow through the porous plate as shown in fig 2 d size of bubbles during their advection downstream beneath the flat plate is not significantly influenced by the hole size of the porous bubble injector it is naturally determined by the balance between fragmentation and coalescence in turbulent boundary layers e g sanders et al 2006 this was also confirmed by park et al 2018 using the same model ship as the present one 2 2 flow condition as shown in fig 3 two compressors supplied air to the buffer chamber through individual gas tanks an isothermal chamber and a gas flow control system the gas control system was designed to generate an arbitrary waveform of the gas volume flow rate learned from a device developed by tokyo gas corporation takeuchi and kagawa 2013 the control system consists of an electromagnetic valve a gas flow meter and two gas pressure meters in the case of a constant gas flow rate the control system can regulate the temporal fluctuations of the gas flow rate so that they are negligible and no specific peak in the frequency spectra emerges park et al 2016 therefore clear fluctuations of the void fraction observed downstream must be attributed to the spontaneous generation of void waves during propagation in the turbulent boundary layer the control system can also make a periodically fluctuated gas flow rate of more than 20 hz in repetition frequency in this experiment the variation of the gas flow rate was controlled to be a sinusoidal wave with the fluctuating gas flow rate artificial void waves were generated at the gas injection point as the upstream condition of the bdr the measurement instruments on the towing test facility a speedometer for the towing train and a water thermometer in the water tank were synchronized with the gas flow control system to record all data in a multichannel data logger the temperature was kept at approximately 33 c during the experiment at which the corresponding density ρ and kinematic viscosity ν of the water were approximately 995 kg m3 and 0 758 10 6 m2 s respectively in the series of experiments the time averaged gas flow rate q g was varied from 0 25 10 3 to 1 00 10 3 m3 s past researchers used as an intuitive parameter the following thickness scale of bubbles t g defined as 1 t g q g u w where u is the towing speed of the model ship and w is the width of model ship the parameter means a gas layer equivalent thickness in the time average in the case of bubble injection with a sinusoidally fluctuated gas flow rate the instantaneous minimum gas flow rate could not be set to zero perfectly but a little emission was allowed at 0 08 10 3 m3 s this is because the control system cannot close the valve completely the frequency of the periodic fluctuation of bubble injection f inj was varied from 2 to 16 hz as listed in table 1 here bubble injection with a constant gas flow rate is expressed as a condition of f inj 0 the towing speed of the model ship was set at 1 50 2 25 and 3 00 m s here the reynolds number is defined as 2 re x x u v where x denotes the streamwise distance from the bow of the model ship for estimating the void fraction in two phase turbulent boundary layers α δ the authors group has conventionally used a fraction

vertical profile of the streamwise velocity and thickness of the boundary layer respectively the 1 7 power law for u y and 99 thickness of the boundary layer for δ are adopted yielding 4 u y u y δ 1 7 5 δ 0 37 x 4 5 ν u 1 5 in a trial experiment using the same model ship details of the setup are the same as park et al 2018 we tested artificial void wave generation with u 3 00 m s and t g 4 63 10 4 m and shear stress acting on the bottom plate was measured by a shear stress sensor installed at x 2 3 m drag reduction ratio increased up to 15 with f inj 1 4 hz from f inj 0 as shown in fig 4 this result shows that void waves have potential to improve the drag reduction in the present experiment we focused on behavior of void waves and observed it at two measurement regions placed at x 1 4 and 2 6 m on the bottom plate of the model ship here these measurement regions are called upstream and downstream measurement regions respectively the observations at the two regions were conducted independently in every run of the ship 2 3 visualization of bubble and void wave a high speed video camera fastcam mini ax50 photoron ltd installed in the model ship took a top view of bubbles advecting beneath the bottom plate two light emitting diode led panels inclined at 45 were mounted on both sides of the camera to light up the measurement region as shown in fig 2 a as listed in table 2 the spatial resolution and the frame rate of the camera were set at 0 17 mm pixel and 2000 fps respectively these camera settings ensured sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolutions to analyze the frequency characteristics of the void waves fig 5 shows snapshots of bubbles at each towing speed keeping the gas layer equivalent thickness constant t g 5 56 10 4 m the gas liquid interfaces of bubbles reflected the light from the led panels so that the fringe of bubbles was recognized in the snapshots in the cases of f inj 0 the equivalent diameters of the 50 sample bubbles in the images were calculated from the projection areas of the bubbles the probability density functions of the diameters shown in fig 6 indicate that the diameters were distributed around 10 0 mm u 1 50 m s 5 0 mm u 2 25 m s and 2 5 mm u 3 00 m s it was confirmed that the bubble size becomes larger from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one the coalescence of bubbles during the advection is considered a cause of the increase in mean bubble diameter bubbles with these diameters are supposed to migrate in the wall proximity due to dominance of buoyancy relatively to the turbulent diffusion at the flow speed tested installment of the side walls on the bottom plate keep bubbles stay inside the boundary layer thus all the bubbles advect from the injector to the stern of model ship original images taken by the camera were processed to detect the gas phase by the following procedure the fringes of the bubbles were extracted by thresholding then the areas enclosed by the fringes including the fringes themselves were regarded as gas phase the ratio of the gas phase in one z directional line of pixels was acquired as a local projection void fraction α 0 α 1 temporal variations of α were treated as void waves the observed area was 85 mm from the z directional center of the model ship this is narrower than half the width of the model ship the time integral of α generally decreases from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one the decrease of projection area can be attributed to the bubble coalescence during their advection 3 frequency characteristics of void waves 3 1 spontaneously standing void wave fig 7 shows visualized bubbles in a timeline where spontaneously standing void waves were observed at f inj 0 to obtain the frequency characteristics of the void waves a wavelet transform was applied using the morlet mother wavelet torrence and compo 1998 the spectra obtained by the wavelet transform for the upstream region are shown in fig 8 strong components distribute around 10 hz at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s for all conditions of t g in comparison at u 1 50 m s strong components are found around 6 hz at t g 5 56 10 4 m and not found at t g 2 78 10 4 m the same set of results measured at the downstream measurement region is shown in fig 9 the frequencies of standing void waves are 4 8 hz at every towing speed the frequencies slightly decrease from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s the observed frequency matches the frequency band of past data park et al 2016 2018 bubble velocity was also measured beneath the same flat bottom model ship and the velocity had a tendency of decreasing along the streamwise direction for the cases of u 2 00 m s the decrease in frequencies observed in the present experiment is attributed to the decrease in the bubble velocity this implies that the wavelength of void waves is almost constant during their propagation 3 2 artificially generated void wave fig 10 a c depict the periodic passage of bubble swarms for f inj 2 8 hz a further increase in the frequency to more than 12 hz makes the periodic patterns of bubbles unclear as shown in fig 10 d and e this is because bubble swarms of short intervals easily combine with each other linear spectra obtained by fourier transform of fluctuations of the projection void fraction at the x directional center of the sequential images are shown in fig 11 all the spectra are normalized by the same value the intensity of a frequency component in the spectra corresponds to the component s amplitude in waveforms of α 0 α 1 for f inj 8 hz as in fig 11 a f the largest peaks stand out at the exact same frequencies of f inj in the cases of f inj 12 and 16 hz as shown in fig 11 g i the peak frequencies are found at 11 8 and 15 8 hz respectively the slight change of the frequency is attributed to some delays in the gas flow control system no clear peak is found in fig 11 j which means that bubble swarms are almost dispersed in that condition here the frequency of the main component of void waves f main is read from the linear spectra f main f inj at f inj 8 hz f main 11 8 hz at f inj 12 hz and f main 15 8 hz at f inj 16 hz the intensity of the components at f main in the linear spectra is plotted in fig 12 multiple trials were performed under each experimental condition to evaluate the reproducibility of the result in fig 12 the reproducibility is expressed as error bars that denote standard deviations at the same towing speed and injection frequency an increase of the gas layer thickness i e increase of the gas flow rate leads to a high intensity with a high gas flow rate bubble swarms occupy a large area of the bottom plate thus the intensity evaluated from the projection void fraction depends on the gas flow rate a comparison between fig 12 a and b confirmed that the intensity decreases along the streamwise direction this is interpreted as meaning there are 1 attenuation of the void fraction fluctuations resulting from the dispersion of the void waves and 2 growth of other frequency components resulting from deformation of the void waves in the upstream measurement region the intensity has a decreasing trend with the increase in the injection frequency as shown in fig 12 a in two cases 1 u 2 25 m s t g 3 70 10 4 m and 2 u 3 00 m s t g 5 56 10 4 m the intensity is nearly constant for f inj 8 hz whereas it clearly decreases for f inj 12 hz as shown in fig 8 the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves is approximately 10 hz at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s in the upstream measurement region it is deduced that artificially generated void waves easily decay at the injection frequencies higher than the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves in the downstream measurement region the intensity does not monotonically decrease in several cases of u and t g maximum values are found at f inj 4 hz as shown in fig 12 b comparison of fig 12 a and b indicates that the intensity had a different tendency in the upstream measurement region from that in the downstream one as the injection frequency increased fig 13 a is a summary of the attenuation rates which are evaluated as 6 ξ 1 i down i up where i up and i down are the intensities of f main components in the upstream and downstream measurement regions respectively a small attenuation rate means long void wave persistence at the same towing speed and gas layer thickness the attenuation rate takes the minimum value at f inj 2 hz u 1 50 m s f inj 4 hz u 2 25 m s and f inj 4 or 8 hz u 3 00 m s as shown in fig 13 b thus the injection frequency that realizes the minimum attenuation of intensity varies depending on the towing speed 4 propagation characteristics of the void waves as discussed in the previous section the attenuation rate of void waves depends on the injection frequency the attenuation rate data can be applied for estimating the persistency of void waves over long distances in contrast there is a wave causing physics that must be considered in a bubbly two phase flow system biesheuvel and van wijngaarden 1984 derived a wave equation in liquid with dilute bubble dispersion in the experiment reported here bubbles are arranged closely and cause coalescence inside the bubble swarm a good reference is the mathematical work by lammers and biesheuvel 1996 who utilized a modified burgers equation to describe the periodicity of bubbly two phase flows in a vertical pipe flow toward establishment of a theoretical model of the void wave propagation in horizontal turbulent boundary layers the waveform of the void wave is evaluated in this section 4 1 phase averaged waveform several samples of the phase averaged waveform of the void waves are shown in fig 14 the samples are chosen from the conditions of u 3 00 m s and t g 5 56 10 4 m the phase is defined by fourier transform on the original waveforms at least 12 cycles of void waves are averaged as a general trend the amplitude of the waves becomes small as the wave migrates downstream this decay is remarkable for the higher injection frequencies the amplitudes at f inj 4 and 8 hz are kept larger than those at other injection frequencies in these two cases a sharp and asymmetric waveform can be identified in the phase averaged waveform this suggests a physics that resists the decay at these particular frequencies the propagation velocity u and apparent diffusion coefficient d of the void wave are evaluated based on the following one dimensional advection diffusion equation using the data of phase averaged waveforms 7 α t x t u α t x x d 2 α t x x 2 4 2 propagation velocity as reported by park et al 2016 the advection velocity of individual bubbles beneath a flat plate is approximately half the towing speed however the propagation velocity of a void wave cannot be given by averaging of individual bubble velocities we obtained the propagation velocity using a complex fourier transform of the fluctuations of the projection void fraction the transform produces the phase of the wave for a given f main components fig 15 plots the phases measured at each streamwise position inside the sequential images taken by a high speed camera see fig 5 the phase changed linearly in the x direction and a slope k was determined from the data as the wavenumber consequently the propagation velocity was obtained 8 u 2 π f main k the obtained velocity for all the cases examined is summarized in fig 16 it ranged from 0 47 to 0 53 in normalized scale with the towing speed with roughly half the towing speed as a general understanding this indicates bubble swarms being remained inside the boundary layer because the propagation velocity should be close to the towing speed if they were ejected to the outer flow region other than this it was found that the velocity decreases because of bubble migration along the downstream direction for the same flow conditions this trend is understandable with the feature of a spatially developing boundary layer where the liquid velocity in a near region to the wall gradually decreases along a streamwise direction 4 3 apparent diffusion coefficient 4 3 1 estimation method using eq 7 the apparent diffusion coefficient of projection void fraction d is estimated in this section the propagation velocity in the equation is given by 9 u u up u down 2 where u up and u down are the propagation velocities measured at the upstream and downstream regions substituting x x ut into eq 7 a one dimensional diffusion equation 10 α t x t d 2 α t x x 2 is derived discretization of eq 10 in second order accuracy with the crank nicolson scheme yields 11 α j i 1 α j i δ t d 2 α j 1 i 1 2 α j i 1 α j 1 i 1 δ x 2 α j 1 i 2 α j i α j 1 i δ x 2 where δt and δx are given by the temporal and the spatial resolutions of the present measurement the subscripts i and j indicate the integer time step and the spatial grid coordinate respectively as the initial condition the phase averaged waveform at the upstream region is used equation 11 is numerically solved to predict the waveform in the downstream region with an arbitrary value of d changing d for a possible range iteratively the most matched value of d is searched so that the downstream waveform takes the minimum difference between the measured result and the predicted result fig 17 shows a sample comparison between the measured waveform and the numerically predicted waveform that was judged as the best matching condition of course a small difference remains in the matching condition because of a certain irregularity of the wave motion departing from the one dimensional diffusion process however the amplitude and the width of the void wave can be well reproduced supporting the validity of approximation by the apparent diffusion coefficient as a primary parameter in representing the void wave characteristics 4 3 2 estimated results the apparent diffusion coefficients d estimated from all the examined cases are plotted in fig 18 for conditions performed multiple times diffusion coefficients were estimated for every combination of the waveforms in the upstream measurement region and in the downstream one positive and negative values were obtained as indicated by the circle and square symbols respectively the scattering of the positive coefficients was widely dependent on f inj they ranged approximately from 10 4 to 10 1 m2 s except for a condition u t g f inj 1 50 m s 2 78 10 4 m 8 hz at which void waves almost decayed before reaching the upstream measurement region the variance of coefficients is independent from the initial bubble sizes just after the bubble injector mean bubble size in the measurement regions is similar among each f inj at the same u and t g the minimum value of the coefficients appeared at f inj 2 or 4 hz u 1 50 m s f inj 4 hz u 2 25 m s and f inj 8 hz u 3 00 m s under these conditions the local attenuation rate of the void wave also had low values as shown in fig 13 b to understand the estimated values of the apparent diffusion coefficient we compare them with turbulent boundary layer theories to seek an analogy to void waves first the friction coefficient c f of a turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate is given by schoenherr 1932 12 1 c f exp 0 558 c f re x and that of a laminar boundary layer is schlichting 1979 13 1 c f 1 328 re x within the range of re x in the present experiment see table 1 the friction coefficient of turbulent flow is at most 10 times larger than that of laminar flow this ratio corresponds to the ratio of turbulent kinematic viscosity or eddy viscosity divided by fluid density ν t to the laminar kinematic viscosity in this theory ν t is on the order of 10 5 m2 s in the present range of re x because the apparent diffusion coefficient of void waves d was obtained several tens of times larger than this value void waves are regarded to have an intrinsic propagation process independent from the liquid velocity fluctuation inside the boundary layer the velocity gradient in turbulent boundary layers can induce the stretch of void waves in the streamwise direction this is not a diffusion but should be regarded as the effect of differential advection however if this stretching effect were treated as the diffusion coefficient in eq 7 the order of d would be estimated as 14 d γ δ 2 t γ δ 2 l u u δ δ 2 l u u 2 u l 2 u l where γ and t are the mean shear rate of the boundary layer and the time spent for bubbles migrating from the upstream to the downstream measurement regions respectively here l is the distance between the two regions for a typical condition of u 3 00 m s and l 1 2 m eq 15 estimates d 7 2 m2 s this is one to four digits larger than the measured diffusion coefficient hence void waves are unaffected by the shear and they rather have a self organizing mechanism in the boundary layer 4 3 3 downstream persistency of void waves using the apparent diffusion coefficient estimated from the present series of towing experiments it is possible to predict the downstream persistency of the void waves a sinusoidal void wave defined by 15 α 0 x c 1 c 2 sin 2 π λ x 16 λ u f main is considered as an initial condition of eq 10 where c 1 and c 2 are constants and λ is the wavelength of the void wave adoption of a periodic boundary condition yields an analytical solution 17 α t x c 1 c 2 sin 2 π λ x exp 4 π 2 d λ 2 t this solution indicates that the amplitude of void waves attenuates exponentially during advection for instance in the case of u t g f inj 3 00 m s 5 56 10 4 m 8 hz the corresponding diffusion coefficient measured as d 1 0 10 4 m2 s gives the persistency of the void wave as 93 at 1 m 69 at 5 m 47 at 10 m and 22 at 20 m downstream positions thus void waves have the potential to persist for 10 m or longer when the optimal frequency of bubble injection is applied in real hull configurations the persistency of void waves may be reduced due to the secondary spanwise flow interacts with the boundary layer this is another item to study in future considering 3d streamlines on each hull surface on a flat bottom plane of large carriers the streamline is kept almost parallel to the main flow direction fureby et al 2016 use of void waves is expected to promote drag reduction for such a hull form finally it is necessary to address to the measured fact that a negative diffusion coefficient was obtained in several conditions as indicated by the square symbols in fig 18 the conditions are the combinations of u t g f inj 1 50 m s 2 78 10 4 m 2 hz 2 25 m s 5 56 10 4 m 2 hz and 3 00 m s 5 56 10 4 m 4 hz in the first two conditions phase averaged waves showed almost no change during streamwise migration for the third condition the amplitude was rather intensified as shown in fig 14 in these particular conditions the downstream persistency of the void waves might be dramatically improved from a mathematical perspective a negative diffusion coefficient implied the existence of other terms in the diffusion equation inducing the concentration of void fraction this phenomenon potentially occurs for multiple reasons in different length scales even in continuous bubble injection park et al 2018 attributed to macroscopic two phase flow instability coupled with tollemien schlichiting wave kelvin helmholtz wave and richardson wave since their characteristic frequencies covered the measured void wave frequencies oishi et al 2019 found contribution of poly dispersed bubbles in spontaneous generation of the void waves i e velocity difference among different sized bubbles always accumulate bubbles in shear flow environment in case of repetitive bubble injection a unique flow pattern is possibly induced by the spatially periodic interaction between bubble swarms and surrounding liquid flow we need further studies to comprehensively explain this phenomenon in this work the possible range of the void wave behavior was demonstrated in a wide parametric study which is expected to help the design of void wave laden air lubrication ships 5 conclusion the development of void waves was examined in bubbly two phase turbulent boundary layers beneath the flat bottom of a 4 m long model ship advecting bubbles were optically visualized at two regions of the model ship during towing tests in a 100 m long water tank first the spontaneous standing of void waves was confirmed downstream from the bubble injector when a constant gas volume flow rate was supplied the frequencies of the spontaneous void waves were detected by wavelet transform and were 4 10 hz this range corresponded to the results of previous works using the same model ship park et al 2016 2018 in the present study we firstly applied artificial generation of void waves for the model ship it was performed by injecting bubbles with periodically fluctuating gas flow rates using an original gas pulsar device from the fourier analysis for the projection void fraction it was confirmed that the artificially generated void waves were gradually attenuated along the streamwise direction the attenuation was minimized at an injection frequency set smaller than the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves thus the use of a longer wavelength makes the void wave persist downstream to summarize the results quantitatively an apparent diffusion coefficient was measured based on a one dimensional advection diffusion equation model it took the range of 10 4 10 1 m2 s in most cases being at least one order larger than the turbulent eddy viscosity of liquid inside the turbulent boundary layer based on the measured diffusion coefficient the downstream persistency of the void waves was estimated it was longer than 10 m before decaying 40 in initial wave intensity a very low diffusion coefficient or even negative values were also found in several particular combinations of towing speed and bubble injection frequency although this demonstrated the necessity of further study application to large ships would be promoted by utilizing such facts of two phase flow dynamics credit authorship

21608,although the practical use of bubbly drag reduction for marine vessels has begun to spread it is unclear how bubbles migrate along spatially developing turbulent boundary layers we measured the spatiotemporal distribution of the local void fraction beneath a 4 m long fully transparent flat bottom model ship towed in a 100 m long water tank with a ship speed of up to 3 00 m s bubbles were injected with both constant and periodically fluctuated air flow rates into the turbulent boundary layers with constant flow rates 2 5 mm bubbles caused spontaneous void waves i e quasiperiodic fluctuation of the local void fraction standing at 4 8 hz when repetitive bubble injection which formed artificial void waves downstream was applied void waves propagated at 47 53 of the ship speed during the propagation we found the apparent diffusion coefficient of the void wave taking values down to 10 4 m2 s and even negative values when the repetition frequency was set lower than the spontaneous frequency of void waves this indicates that the void waves persist for several tens of meter in application to ship hulls keywords bubbly drag reduction void waves turbulent boundary layer multiphase flow model ship 1 introduction air lubrication to reduce frictional drag on a ship hull has been studied for decades methods of air lubrication are classified into three types as explained by ceccio 2010 air layer drag reduction aldr partial cavity drag reduction pcdr and bubbly drag reduction bdr for aldr and pcdr the surface of the hull is totally or partially covered with gas film and insulated from the liquid turbulent flow to stabilize the air layer and cavity a number of investigations have been reported mäkiharju et al 2012 mäkiharju and ceccio 2018 for aldr and gokcay et al 2004 matveev 2007 mäkiharju et al 2013 for pcdr in contrast bdr modifies the internal structure of the turbulent boundary layer using dispersed bubbles murai et al 2006 reported the importance of bubble slip to local events of turbulence in the enhancement of drag reduction they also found that bdr performance is dependent on the bubble size relative to the boundary layer thickness murai et al 2007 expectations of energy saving by bdr have motivated studies of practical application to ships kodama et al 2008 reported 10 15 drag reduction on a 120 m long cement carrier by blowing gas into a turbulent boundary layer from compressors the net power saving was approximately 5 with canceling of the extra energy consumption for the compressors kumagai et al 2015 used hydrofoil type bubble generators to reduce the energy consumed for gas injection an approximately 10 net power saving was obtained by installing the devices on an 80 m long ferry and an 85 m long coaster other recent applications of bdr to 21 commercial vessels were reported by the american bureau of shipping 2019 since the first demonstration of bdr by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 for a submerged hull the fluid dynamics mechanism of bdr has been widely investigated the research until 2014 was summarized in a review by murai 2014 in which more than 190 reports were compared after the review a noticeable feature was discovered the bdr effect is enhanced as void waves quasiperiodic fluctuations of local void fraction stand in the two phase turbulent boundary layer park et al 2016 the void waves stand spontaneously for multiple reasons it begins with the clustering and coalescence of dispersed bubbles during their migration the phenomenon is analogous to the initiation of bubble to slug flow transition observed in vertical pipe flows lammers and biesheuvel 1996 the difference in the horizontal two phase flow from the vertical system is the contribution of the bubble buoyancy that always attracts bubbles to the wall surface hence the growth of void waves is an intrinsic process because of the bubble buoyancy murai et al 2007 sliding bubble behaviors oishi et al 2019 and the wettability of the wall surface kitagawa et al 2019 evolving from the drag reduction by spontaneously standing void waves the use of artificially synthesized void waves was examined by park et al 2014 and park et al 2015 for horizontal turbulent channel flows the artificial void waves were generated by injecting bubbles with periodically fluctuated gas flow rates this method provided higher time averaged drag reduction ratios compared with the bubble injection at constant gas flow rates the enhancement of bdr was confirmed in these channel flows especially at low time averaged bulk void fractions park et al 2016 derived a void wave equation from a two fluid model to explain mathematically the experimental results they found that local wall shear stress and the local void fraction are dynamically coupled to produce significant persistency of the void waves in a long downstream distance this indicates the usefulness of artificial void waves for ship drag reduction however artificial void waves in an external flow are supposed to disperse easily with the weak confinement of the flow the feasibility depends on how the artificial void waves are sustainable over a long downstream distance in the present work the persistence of artificially generated void waves in turbulent boundary layers beneath a 4 m long flat bottom model ship was investigated experimentally the bottom plate of the model ship is fully transparent and bubbles migrating beneath its bottom surface can be optically visualized park et al 2018 conducted an experiment using the same model ship and confirmed that spontaneous void waves emerged when a constant gas flow rate was supplied they attributed the spontaneity to tollemien schlichting kelvin helmholtz and richardson waves in the two phase turbulent boundary layer in the present work the downstream persistency of artificial void waves is reported giving new physical insights in the study of bdr as well as a new degree of freedom in the design of bdr for practical applications 2 experimental setup and conditions 2 1 towing test facility and model ship a model ship shown in fig 1 a made of transparent acrylic resin was installed in the towing test facility at hiroshima university japan the facility has been certified as a standard institute for ship performance examination iso 9001 the water tank shown in fig 1 b in the facility is 100 m long 8 0 m wide and 3 5 m deep the towing train of the facility runs at a speed up to 3 00 m s when hanging the model ship as shown in fig 1 c the train achieves a period with a constant speed between the acceleration and deceleration processes the period changes depending on the train speed and it becomes approximately 7 s for the maximum speed of the train corresponding to 21 m of displacement in the water tank the model ship with a 50 mm draft is 4 0 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high as shown in fig 2 beneath the bottom plate of the model ship 20 mm high side walls are equipped to prevent the entrance of hydraulic waves to the flat bottom plate as in fig 2 b the side walls preserve the two dimensional spatial development of the turbulent boundary layer on the bottom plate a tripping wire is fixed on the bow of the model ship to perturb the inflow onto the plate as shown in fig 2 c the wire is necessary to guarantee the reproducible spatial development of the turbulent boundary layer because of a smooth flat plate employed as the bdr target plane the model ship includes a gas buffer chamber located 0 7 m from the bow a part of the bottom plate in the chamber is replaced with a porous plastic plate to inject bubbles gas stored in the chamber is regulated at a constant pressure and then injected into the flow through the porous plate as shown in fig 2 d size of bubbles during their advection downstream beneath the flat plate is not significantly influenced by the hole size of the porous bubble injector it is naturally determined by the balance between fragmentation and coalescence in turbulent boundary layers e g sanders et al 2006 this was also confirmed by park et al 2018 using the same model ship as the present one 2 2 flow condition as shown in fig 3 two compressors supplied air to the buffer chamber through individual gas tanks an isothermal chamber and a gas flow control system the gas control system was designed to generate an arbitrary waveform of the gas volume flow rate learned from a device developed by tokyo gas corporation takeuchi and kagawa 2013 the control system consists of an electromagnetic valve a gas flow meter and two gas pressure meters in the case of a constant gas flow rate the control system can regulate the temporal fluctuations of the gas flow rate so that they are negligible and no specific peak in the frequency spectra emerges park et al 2016 therefore clear fluctuations of the void fraction observed downstream must be attributed to the spontaneous generation of void waves during propagation in the turbulent boundary layer the control system can also make a periodically fluctuated gas flow rate of more than 20 hz in repetition frequency in this experiment the variation of the gas flow rate was controlled to be a sinusoidal wave with the fluctuating gas flow rate artificial void waves were generated at the gas injection point as the upstream condition of the bdr the measurement instruments on the towing test facility a speedometer for the towing train and a water thermometer in the water tank were synchronized with the gas flow control system to record all data in a multichannel data logger the temperature was kept at approximately 33 c during the experiment at which the corresponding density ρ and kinematic viscosity ν of the water were approximately 995 kg m3 and 0 758 10 6 m2 s respectively in the series of experiments the time averaged gas flow rate q g was varied from 0 25 10 3 to 1 00 10 3 m3 s past researchers used as an intuitive parameter the following thickness scale of bubbles t g defined as 1 t g q g u w where u is the towing speed of the model ship and w is the width of model ship the parameter means a gas layer equivalent thickness in the time average in the case of bubble injection with a sinusoidally fluctuated gas flow rate the instantaneous minimum gas flow rate could not be set to zero perfectly but a little emission was allowed at 0 08 10 3 m3 s this is because the control system cannot close the valve completely the frequency of the periodic fluctuation of bubble injection f inj was varied from 2 to 16 hz as listed in table 1 here bubble injection with a constant gas flow rate is expressed as a condition of f inj 0 the towing speed of the model ship was set at 1 50 2 25 and 3 00 m s here the reynolds number is defined as 2 re x x u v where x denotes the streamwise distance from the bow of the model ship for estimating the void fraction in two phase turbulent boundary layers α δ the authors group has conventionally used a fraction of the gas flow rate to the total flow rate inside the turbulent boundary layer 3 α δ q g q g q l q g w 0 δ u y d y where q l u y and δ denote the liquid flow rate inside the turbulent boundary layer vertical profile of the streamwise velocity and thickness of the boundary layer respectively the 1 7 power law for u y and 99 thickness of the boundary layer for δ are adopted yielding 4 u y u y δ 1 7 5 δ 0 37 x 4 5 ν u 1 5 in a trial experiment using the same model ship details of the setup are the same as park et al 2018 we tested artificial void wave generation with u 3 00 m s and t g 4 63 10 4 m and shear stress acting on the bottom plate was measured by a shear stress sensor installed at x 2 3 m drag reduction ratio increased up to 15 with f inj 1 4 hz from f inj 0 as shown in fig 4 this result shows that void waves have potential to improve the drag reduction in the present experiment we focused on behavior of void waves and observed it at two measurement regions placed at x 1 4 and 2 6 m on the bottom plate of the model ship here these measurement regions are called upstream and downstream measurement regions respectively the observations at the two regions were conducted independently in every run of the ship 2 3 visualization of bubble and void wave a high speed video camera fastcam mini ax50 photoron ltd installed in the model ship took a top view of bubbles advecting beneath the bottom plate two light emitting diode led panels inclined at 45 were mounted on both sides of the camera to light up the measurement region as shown in fig 2 a as listed in table 2 the spatial resolution and the frame rate of the camera were set at 0 17 mm pixel and 2000 fps respectively these camera settings ensured sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolutions to analyze the frequency characteristics of the void waves fig 5 shows snapshots of bubbles at each towing speed keeping the gas layer equivalent thickness constant t g 5 56 10 4 m the gas liquid interfaces of bubbles reflected the light from the led panels so that the fringe of bubbles was recognized in the snapshots in the cases of f inj 0 the equivalent diameters of the 50 sample bubbles in the images were calculated from the projection areas of the bubbles the probability density functions of the diameters shown in fig 6 indicate that the diameters were distributed around 10 0 mm u 1 50 m s 5 0 mm u 2 25 m s and 2 5 mm u 3 00 m s it was confirmed that the bubble size becomes larger from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one the coalescence of bubbles during the advection is considered a cause of the increase in mean bubble diameter bubbles with these diameters are supposed to migrate in the wall proximity due to dominance of buoyancy relatively to the turbulent diffusion at the flow speed tested installment of the side walls on the bottom plate keep bubbles stay inside the boundary layer thus all the bubbles advect from the injector to the stern of model ship original images taken by the camera were processed to detect the gas phase by the following procedure the fringes of the bubbles were extracted by thresholding then the areas enclosed by the fringes including the fringes themselves were regarded as gas phase the ratio of the gas phase in one z directional line of pixels was acquired as a local projection void fraction α 0 α 1 temporal variations of α were treated as void waves the observed area was 85 mm from the z directional center of the model ship this is narrower than half the width of the model ship the time integral of α generally decreases from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one the decrease of projection area can be attributed to the bubble coalescence during their advection 3 frequency characteristics of void waves 3 1 spontaneously standing void wave fig 7 shows visualized bubbles in a timeline where spontaneously standing void waves were observed at f inj 0 to obtain the frequency characteristics of the void waves a wavelet transform was applied using the morlet mother wavelet torrence and compo 1998 the spectra obtained by the wavelet transform for the upstream region are shown in fig 8 strong components distribute around 10 hz at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s for all conditions of t g in comparison at u 1 50 m s strong components are found around 6 hz at t g 5 56 10 4 m and not found at t g 2 78 10 4 m the same set of results measured at the downstream measurement region is shown in fig 9 the frequencies of standing void waves are 4 8 hz at every towing speed the frequencies slightly decrease from the upstream measurement region to the downstream one at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s the observed frequency matches the frequency band of past data park et al 2016 2018 bubble velocity was also measured beneath the same flat bottom model ship and the velocity had a tendency of decreasing along the streamwise direction for the cases of u 2 00 m s the decrease in frequencies observed in the present experiment is attributed to the decrease in the bubble velocity this implies that the wavelength of void waves is almost constant during their propagation 3 2 artificially generated void wave fig 10 a c depict the periodic passage of bubble swarms for f inj 2 8 hz a further increase in the frequency to more than 12 hz makes the periodic patterns of bubbles unclear as shown in fig 10 d and e this is because bubble swarms of short intervals easily combine with each other linear spectra obtained by fourier transform of fluctuations of the projection void fraction at the x directional center of the sequential images are shown in fig 11 all the spectra are normalized by the same value the intensity of a frequency component in the spectra corresponds to the component s amplitude in waveforms of α 0 α 1 for f inj 8 hz as in fig 11 a f the largest peaks stand out at the exact same frequencies of f inj in the cases of f inj 12 and 16 hz as shown in fig 11 g i the peak frequencies are found at 11 8 and 15 8 hz respectively the slight change of the frequency is attributed to some delays in the gas flow control system no clear peak is found in fig 11 j which means that bubble swarms are almost dispersed in that condition here the frequency of the main component of void waves f main is read from the linear spectra f main f inj at f inj 8 hz f main 11 8 hz at f inj 12 hz and f main 15 8 hz at f inj 16 hz the intensity of the components at f main in the linear spectra is plotted in fig 12 multiple trials were performed under each experimental condition to evaluate the reproducibility of the result in fig 12 the reproducibility is expressed as error bars that denote standard deviations at the same towing speed and injection frequency an increase of the gas layer thickness i e increase of the gas flow rate leads to a high intensity with a high gas flow rate bubble swarms occupy a large area of the bottom plate thus the intensity evaluated from the projection void fraction depends on the gas flow rate a comparison between fig 12 a and b confirmed that the intensity decreases along the streamwise direction this is interpreted as meaning there are 1 attenuation of the void fraction fluctuations resulting from the dispersion of the void waves and 2 growth of other frequency components resulting from deformation of the void waves in the upstream measurement region the intensity has a decreasing trend with the increase in the injection frequency as shown in fig 12 a in two cases 1 u 2 25 m s t g 3 70 10 4 m and 2 u 3 00 m s t g 5 56 10 4 m the intensity is nearly constant for f inj 8 hz whereas it clearly decreases for f inj 12 hz as shown in fig 8 the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves is approximately 10 hz at u 2 25 and 3 00 m s in the upstream measurement region it is deduced that artificially generated void waves easily decay at the injection frequencies higher than the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves in the downstream measurement region the intensity does not monotonically decrease in several cases of u and t g maximum values are found at f inj 4 hz as shown in fig 12 b comparison of fig 12 a and b indicates that the intensity had a different tendency in the upstream measurement region from that in the downstream one as the injection frequency increased fig 13 a is a summary of the attenuation rates which are evaluated as 6 ξ 1 i down i up where i up and i down are the intensities of f main components in the upstream and downstream measurement regions respectively a small attenuation rate means long void wave persistence at the same towing speed and gas layer thickness the attenuation rate takes the minimum value at f inj 2 hz u 1 50 m s f inj 4 hz u 2 25 m s and f inj 4 or 8 hz u 3 00 m s as shown in fig 13 b thus the injection frequency that realizes the minimum attenuation of intensity varies depending on the towing speed 4 propagation characteristics of the void waves as discussed in the previous section the attenuation rate of void waves depends on the injection frequency the attenuation rate data can be applied for estimating the persistency of void waves over long distances in contrast there is a wave causing physics that must be considered in a bubbly two phase flow system biesheuvel and van wijngaarden 1984 derived a wave equation in liquid with dilute bubble dispersion in the experiment reported here bubbles are arranged closely and cause coalescence inside the bubble swarm a good reference is the mathematical work by lammers and biesheuvel 1996 who utilized a modified burgers equation to describe the periodicity of bubbly two phase flows in a vertical pipe flow toward establishment of a theoretical model of the void wave propagation in horizontal turbulent boundary layers the waveform of the void wave is evaluated in this section 4 1 phase averaged waveform several samples of the phase averaged waveform of the void waves are shown in fig 14 the samples are chosen from the conditions of u 3 00 m s and t g 5 56 10 4 m the phase is defined by fourier transform on the original waveforms at least 12 cycles of void waves are averaged as a general trend the amplitude of the waves becomes small as the wave migrates downstream this decay is remarkable for the higher injection frequencies the amplitudes at f inj 4 and 8 hz are kept larger than those at other injection frequencies in these two cases a sharp and asymmetric waveform can be identified in the phase averaged waveform this suggests a physics that resists the decay at these particular frequencies the propagation velocity u and apparent diffusion coefficient d of the void wave are evaluated based on the following one dimensional advection diffusion equation using the data of phase averaged waveforms 7 α t x t u α t x x d 2 α t x x 2 4 2 propagation velocity as reported by park et al 2016 the advection velocity of individual bubbles beneath a flat plate is approximately half the towing speed however the propagation velocity of a void wave cannot be given by averaging of individual bubble velocities we obtained the propagation velocity using a complex fourier transform of the fluctuations of the projection void fraction the transform produces the phase of the wave for a given f main components fig 15 plots the phases measured at each streamwise position inside the sequential images taken by a high speed camera see fig 5 the phase changed linearly in the x direction and a slope k was determined from the data as the wavenumber consequently the propagation velocity was obtained 8 u 2 π f main k the obtained velocity for all the cases examined is summarized in fig 16 it ranged from 0 47 to 0 53 in normalized scale with the towing speed with roughly half the towing speed as a general understanding this indicates bubble swarms being remained inside the boundary layer because the propagation velocity should be close to the towing speed if they were ejected to the outer flow region other than this it was found that the velocity decreases because of bubble migration along the downstream direction for the same flow conditions this trend is understandable with the feature of a spatially developing boundary layer where the liquid velocity in a near region to the wall gradually decreases along a streamwise direction 4 3 apparent diffusion coefficient 4 3 1 estimation method using eq 7 the apparent diffusion coefficient of projection void fraction d is estimated in this section the propagation velocity in the equation is given by 9 u u up u down 2 where u up and u down are the propagation velocities measured at the upstream and downstream regions substituting x x ut into eq 7 a one dimensional diffusion equation 10 α t x t d 2 α t x x 2 is derived discretization of eq 10 in second order accuracy with the crank nicolson scheme yields 11 α j i 1 α j i δ t d 2 α j 1 i 1 2 α j i 1 α j 1 i 1 δ x 2 α j 1 i 2 α j i α j 1 i δ x 2 where δt and δx are given by the temporal and the spatial resolutions of the present measurement the subscripts i and j indicate the integer time step and the spatial grid coordinate respectively as the initial condition the phase averaged waveform at the upstream region is used equation 11 is numerically solved to predict the waveform in the downstream region with an arbitrary value of d changing d for a possible range iteratively the most matched value of d is searched so that the downstream waveform takes the minimum difference between the measured result and the predicted result fig 17 shows a sample comparison between the measured waveform and the numerically predicted waveform that was judged as the best matching condition of course a small difference remains in the matching condition because of a certain irregularity of the wave motion departing from the one dimensional diffusion process however the amplitude and the width of the void wave can be well reproduced supporting the validity of approximation by the apparent diffusion coefficient as a primary parameter in representing the void wave characteristics 4 3 2 estimated results the apparent diffusion coefficients d estimated from all the examined cases are plotted in fig 18 for conditions performed multiple times diffusion coefficients were estimated for every combination of the waveforms in the upstream measurement region and in the downstream one positive and negative values were obtained as indicated by the circle and square symbols respectively the scattering of the positive coefficients was widely dependent on f inj they ranged approximately from 10 4 to 10 1 m2 s except for a condition u t g f inj 1 50 m s 2 78 10 4 m 8 hz at which void waves almost decayed before reaching the upstream measurement region the variance of coefficients is independent from the initial bubble sizes just after the bubble injector mean bubble size in the measurement regions is similar among each f inj at the same u and t g the minimum value of the coefficients appeared at f inj 2 or 4 hz u 1 50 m s f inj 4 hz u 2 25 m s and f inj 8 hz u 3 00 m s under these conditions the local attenuation rate of the void wave also had low values as shown in fig 13 b to understand the estimated values of the apparent diffusion coefficient we compare them with turbulent boundary layer theories to seek an analogy to void waves first the friction coefficient c f of a turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate is given by schoenherr 1932 12 1 c f exp 0 558 c f re x and that of a laminar boundary layer is schlichting 1979 13 1 c f 1 328 re x within the range of re x in the present experiment see table 1 the friction coefficient of turbulent flow is at most 10 times larger than that of laminar flow this ratio corresponds to the ratio of turbulent kinematic viscosity or eddy viscosity divided by fluid density ν t to the laminar kinematic viscosity in this theory ν t is on the order of 10 5 m2 s in the present range of re x because the apparent diffusion coefficient of void waves d was obtained several tens of times larger than this value void waves are regarded to have an intrinsic propagation process independent from the liquid velocity fluctuation inside the boundary layer the velocity gradient in turbulent boundary layers can induce the stretch of void waves in the streamwise direction this is not a diffusion but should be regarded as the effect of differential advection however if this stretching effect were treated as the diffusion coefficient in eq 7 the order of d would be estimated as 14 d γ δ 2 t γ δ 2 l u u δ δ 2 l u u 2 u l 2 u l where γ and t are the mean shear rate of the boundary layer and the time spent for bubbles migrating from the upstream to the downstream measurement regions respectively here l is the distance between the two regions for a typical condition of u 3 00 m s and l 1 2 m eq 15 estimates d 7 2 m2 s this is one to four digits larger than the measured diffusion coefficient hence void waves are unaffected by the shear and they rather have a self organizing mechanism in the boundary layer 4 3 3 downstream persistency of void waves using the apparent diffusion coefficient estimated from the present series of towing experiments it is possible to predict the downstream persistency of the void waves a sinusoidal void wave defined by 15 α 0 x c 1 c 2 sin 2 π λ x 16 λ u f main is considered as an initial condition of eq 10 where c 1 and c 2 are constants and λ is the wavelength of the void wave adoption of a periodic boundary condition yields an analytical solution 17 α t x c 1 c 2 sin 2 π λ x exp 4 π 2 d λ 2 t this solution indicates that the amplitude of void waves attenuates exponentially during advection for instance in the case of u t g f inj 3 00 m s 5 56 10 4 m 8 hz the corresponding diffusion coefficient measured as d 1 0 10 4 m2 s gives the persistency of the void wave as 93 at 1 m 69 at 5 m 47 at 10 m and 22 at 20 m downstream positions thus void waves have the potential to persist for 10 m or longer when the optimal frequency of bubble injection is applied in real hull configurations the persistency of void waves may be reduced due to the secondary spanwise flow interacts with the boundary layer this is another item to study in future considering 3d streamlines on each hull surface on a flat bottom plane of large carriers the streamline is kept almost parallel to the main flow direction fureby et al 2016 use of void waves is expected to promote drag reduction for such a hull form finally it is necessary to address to the measured fact that a negative diffusion coefficient was obtained in several conditions as indicated by the square symbols in fig 18 the conditions are the combinations of u t g f inj 1 50 m s 2 78 10 4 m 2 hz 2 25 m s 5 56 10 4 m 2 hz and 3 00 m s 5 56 10 4 m 4 hz in the first two conditions phase averaged waves showed almost no change during streamwise migration for the third condition the amplitude was rather intensified as shown in fig 14 in these particular conditions the downstream persistency of the void waves might be dramatically improved from a mathematical perspective a negative diffusion coefficient implied the existence of other terms in the diffusion equation inducing the concentration of void fraction this phenomenon potentially occurs for multiple reasons in different length scales even in continuous bubble injection park et al 2018 attributed to macroscopic two phase flow instability coupled with tollemien schlichiting wave kelvin helmholtz wave and richardson wave since their characteristic frequencies covered the measured void wave frequencies oishi et al 2019 found contribution of poly dispersed bubbles in spontaneous generation of the void waves i e velocity difference among different sized bubbles always accumulate bubbles in shear flow environment in case of repetitive bubble injection a unique flow pattern is possibly induced by the spatially periodic interaction between bubble swarms and surrounding liquid flow we need further studies to comprehensively explain this phenomenon in this work the possible range of the void wave behavior was demonstrated in a wide parametric study which is expected to help the design of void wave laden air lubrication ships 5 conclusion the development of void waves was examined in bubbly two phase turbulent boundary layers beneath the flat bottom of a 4 m long model ship advecting bubbles were optically visualized at two regions of the model ship during towing tests in a 100 m long water tank first the spontaneous standing of void waves was confirmed downstream from the bubble injector when a constant gas volume flow rate was supplied the frequencies of the spontaneous void waves were detected by wavelet transform and were 4 10 hz this range corresponded to the results of previous works using the same model ship park et al 2016 2018 in the present study we firstly applied artificial generation of void waves for the model ship it was performed by injecting bubbles with periodically fluctuating gas flow rates using an original gas pulsar device from the fourier analysis for the projection void fraction it was confirmed that the artificially generated void waves were gradually attenuated along the streamwise direction the attenuation was minimized at an injection frequency set smaller than the frequency of spontaneously standing void waves thus the use of a longer wavelength makes the void wave persist downstream to summarize the results quantitatively an apparent diffusion coefficient was measured based on a one dimensional advection diffusion equation model it took the range of 10 4 10 1 m2 s in most cases being at least one order larger than the turbulent eddy viscosity of liquid inside the turbulent boundary layer based on the measured diffusion coefficient the downstream persistency of the void waves was estimated it was longer than 10 m before decaying 40 in initial wave intensity a very low diffusion coefficient or even negative values were also found in several particular combinations of towing speed and bubble injection frequency although this demonstrated the necessity of further study application to large ships would be promoted by utilizing such facts of two phase flow dynamics credit authorship

21609,the anti sloshing effects of a vertical porous baffle placed at the center of a rolling rectangular tank have been investigated rigorously the potential based analytical solutions were developed using the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem with an equivalent linearized quadratic loss model for this the empirical formula of the drag coefficient was obtained through the curve fitting with the cfd results for the channel flow with a circular void hole in parallel with the analytical model a 3d implicit turbulent model based on incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was used with the volume of fluid vof multiphase model to validate the analytical and numerical model experiments were conducted in a rolling rectangular tank with a fully partially submerged porous baffle of different porosities the acceptability and limitation of the present analytical model was quantified and qualified using experimental and numerical approach the presented analytical and 3d turbulent numerical model will provide a mutually complementary tool for the understanding of the energy dissipation mechanism and efficient design of the porous baffle as an anti sloshing device keywords rolling sloshing tank porous baffle anti sloshing eigenfunction expansion method turbulent flow model experiment 1 introduction the liquid in a container may easily exhibits severe free surface oscillation when the container is subjected to external excitations this phenomenon called sloshing has been a crucial engineering issue previous research has shown that sloshing loads depend on the wave excitation frequency and these loads reach their maximum value when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank impact sloshing loads may damage a tank thus liquid sloshing should be restricted to avoid structural failure of tank and instability of tank carrier a variety of anti sloshing devices have been developed to attenuate sloshing energy and limit liquid movement using various physical elements such as partitions mitra et al 2010 baffles wang et al 2016 flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 and floating roofs hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 among these elements vertical and horizontal baffles have been recognized as effective internal devices for increasing the intrinsic damping of tank and consequently decreasing sloshing energy in most practical engineering problems in recent years many experimental and analytical studies have been conducted on the use of baffles as a sloshing reduction device in tanks as a result several baffles have been suggested for suppressing sloshing behavior they include solid flexible ring and porous baffles however the damping mechanism of baffles has still not fully understood due to the complexity and highly nonlinear nature of the sloshing phenomenon yan et al 2009 warnitchai and pinkaew 1998 studied various slosh dampening devices with emphasis on wire mesh baffles they found that these devices introduce additional damping to the sloshing modes and slightly shift the resonance frequencies through the added mass effect akyildiz and ünal 2005 performed experimental studies to assess 3d sloshing effects and pressure variations at different locations on tank walls by installing solid baffles inside the tank subjected to roll excitation they found that side stringers horizontal baffles experience high slamming loads at low filling depths panigrahy et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments to estimate the free surface elevation and pressure on tank walls with horizontal and vertical baffles to reduce sloshing energy in a sway excited tank they observed that the baffle s edges induce turbulent vorticities in liquid flows leading to sloshing damping the experimental results of goudarzi et al 2010 showed that horizontal baffles are effective in a slender tank and vertical baffles are preferred for a broad tank with low filling depths these authors estimated the hydrodynamic damping ratio of liquid sloshing for wall bounded baffles using an analytical model based on linear potential theory faltinsen and timokha 2011 developed an analytical model based on the domain decomposition method to study the dependency of natural sloshing frequencies on solidity ratio number of submerged screen gaps liquid filling depth and position of perforated openings faltinsen et al 2011 revised the adaptive nonlinear multimodal method to examine the secondary resonance phenomenon due to a central slotted baffle with a high solidity ratio crowley and porter 2012 investigated liquid sloshing with a vertical porous baffle located at the center of a rectangular tank in a horizontal excitation motion using an equivalent linear baffle averaged condition instead of a nonlinear quadratic loss model wherein inertial and quadratic drag effects were included molin and remy 2013 also studied sloshing motion in a rectangular tank with a centered fully submerged vertical perforated screen experimentally numerically xue et al 2013 experimentally and numerically investigated damping characteristics of a perforated baffle in a sway excited sloshing tank jin et al 2014 conducted experiments to study the performance of a perforated horizontal baffle in a lateral excited tank and concluded that the influence of baffles on sloshing frequency is limited cho and kim 2016 performed an experiment to examine damping characteristics of dual vertical porous baffles in a swaying tank by changing their porosity submerged depth and position experimental results were used to validate analytical solutions based on potential theory this study was extended in cho et al 2017 to investigate the effectiveness of horizontal porous baffles in a sway excited rectangular tank and the optimal porosity of a porous baffle was found near p 0 1 xue et al 2017 conducted an experiment on a horizontal excited sloshing tank with various vertical baffle arrangements and compared the shift in the lowest mode natural frequency with no baffle tank ünal et al 2019 studied the sloshing suppression of a t shaped baffle numerically in a rolling tank and the effects of the t shaped baffle height as well as the filling depth and rotation angle on the liquid sloshing motion were systematically investigated most studies that have been conducted were limited to the sway excited tanks but published studies on rolling tanks are a few the effect of baffles on reducing liquid sloshing motion has been explored extensively in rectangular tank geometries through numerical investigations kim et al 2001 simulated sloshing flows in 2d and 3d liquid containers on the basis of a finite difference method fdm the free surface profile was assumed to be a single valued function the global fluid motion was regarded as relevant and some local nonlinear phenomena were not considered liu and lin 2009 numerically simulated 3d liquid sloshing in tanks equipped with baffles by solving spatially averaged navier stokes equations a comprehensive review of appropriate computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for liquid sloshing with a slotted baffle was conducted by maravani and hamed 2011 they developed a numerical algorithm based on a laminar navier stokes solver using the fdm moreover partial cell treatment was used to model the baffle wu et al 2012 used a time independent finite difference scheme with a fictitious cell technique to study viscous liquid sloshing in 2d tanks with baffles their method was applied to a number of problems including impulsive flow past a flat plate liquid sloshing in 2d tanks with surface piercing and bottom mounted baffles jung et al 2012 investigated the effect of vertical baffle height on liquid sloshing in a laterally moving 3d rectangular tank the volume of fluid vof method based on the finite volume method fvm was utilized to simulate 3d incompressible viscous two phase liquid and air flow in a tank akyildiz et al 2012 studied nonlinear sloshing behavior in a rolling tank with a vertical baffle a 2d numerical model based on the fdm was used for numerical simulation energy dissipation due to vortices at the edge of baffle was observed to be inversely proportional to baffle height frosina et al 2018 studied sloshing phenomena inside a real fuel tank for three different filling depths using the cfd method and validated with experiment data poguluri and cho 2019 2020 conducted numerical simulations on the basis of an incompressible turbulent model using a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation to verify complex phenomena associated with a sway excited rectangular tank with a vertical slotted baffle the adopted numerical technique captured nonlinear free surface wave profile air entrapment and vortices formation near the baffle in the present study the analytical numerical and experimental approaches were used to study the anti sloshing effect of a vertical porous baffle with different porosities and submerged depths in a rolling rectangular tank the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem was adopted to obtain analytical solutions which were supplemented with a porosity dependent drag coefficient representing energy dissipation due to vortices formation near the porous baffle the empirical formula for a drag coefficient was obtained through the curve fitting with cfd results for the channel flow with a circular hole the 3d numerical simulations of the sloshing problem were conducted using the cfd software starccm the rans equations were solved in the fluid domain and two phase water and air flow was simulated using the vof method the series of experiments were conducted in a roll excited rectangular tank with the half and fully submerged porous baffle of different porosities the developed analytical solutions were compared with the 3d numerical and experimental results and used to understand complex nonlinear phenomena and energy dissipation associated with the porous baffle for suppressing sloshing effects the general flow topology free surface deformations and eddy vortices generated by the porous baffle were also examined through visualization of the cfd simulation 2 analytic solution we investigated a 2d liquid sloshing in a rolling rectangular tank of length 2 a equipped with a vertical porous baffle at the center of the tank cartesian axes were chosen with the x axis along the mean free surface and z axis pointing vertically upward as shown in fig 1 the liquid filling depth is denoted by h and the submergence depth of the porous baffle by d the tank is excited by a sinusoidal function θ t θ a sin ω t with the roll motion amplitude θ a and frequency ω it was assumed that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the wave motions are small so linear potential theory can be used the fluid particle velocity can then be described by the gradient of a velocity potential φ x z t which satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 with the following free surface bottom and tank wall boundary conditions 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 on z 0 3 φ z x θ t on z h 4 φ x z z r θ t on x a where g is the gravitational acceleration and 0 z r the center of the rotational axis the additional boundary conditions are required to relate the flows on both sides of the porous baffle the boundary conditions at porous baffle were derived by crowley and porter 2012 cho and kim 2016 and poguluri and cho 2019 5 φ x z t x 0 0 0 on x 0 h z 0 6 φ x z t t 0 0 1 2 c d u r z t u r z t 2 c u r z t t on d z 0 0 on h z

coefficient representing energy dissipation across the porous baffle c is an inertial or blockage coefficient accounting for the added inertia felt by the fluid as it accelerates the tank is forced to oscillate rotationally with frequency ω the velocity potential wave elevation and horizontal relative velocity at porous baffle can be written as 7 φ x z t θ t φ j x z re ω θ a φ x z e i ω t ζ x t re η x e i ω t u r z t θ t u r z re ω θ a u r z e i ω t it is clear that the sloshing motions in a symmetric rectangular tank will be anti symmetric due to the asymmetric rolling motion of the tank such that φ x z φ x z therefore we only needed to consider the fluid motion in the half tank in x 0 the boundary value problem was solved only on the left half plane x 0 and the solution in x 0 could be easily extended by the anti symmetric relation φ x z φ x z the quadratic velocity dependence in the boundary condition 6 implies that excitation of a tank with a single frequency ω introduces multi frequency responses of fluid flow thus if expanding φ in a fourier time series in multiples of ω and retaining just the fundamental frequency response the fourier coefficient of the first term is 8 3π whilst the next term at frequency 3ω is much smaller than ω and justifies this assumption we can obtain an equivalent linearized porous boundary condition c can be neglected when the baffle is thin and the size of holes is not too large if substituting eq 7 into eqs 1 6 the velocity potential φ x z satisfied the following boundary value problem bvp 8 2 φ 0 9 φ z k φ 0 k ω 2 g on z 0 10 φ z x on

drag coefficient in this section we introduce the empirical formula for a drag coefficient c d through the curve fitting with star ccm s numerical results given a porous baffle with a staggered arrangement of circular holes of radius r and center to center spacing c fig 1 to investigate energy dissipation through holes of the baffle we consider a 3d square channel flow model of side c with a circular hole the geometrical porosity p 2 π r 2 3 c 2 is determined by a fixed hole s radius r 1 5 mm and five different spacings c 5 6 8 10 and 12 mm the size of the fluid domain extends upstream 10 c and downstream 20 c upstream velocities are set at the inlet boundary on the basis of the reynolds numbers re 5000 15 000 and 40 000 the outlet boundary is set as the pressure outlet other boundaries are defined as rigid wall boundaries the trimmed mesh model of star ccm is used to discretize the fluid domain using a fine mesh 0 2 mm near a circular void hole to capture flow separation and vortices the discretized computational domain for the channel flow model with a circular hole is depicted in fig 2 the steady form of rans equations is solved using a segregated solver based on the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme the realizable k ε turbulence model with all y wall treatment is used in the simulation additional details regarding the turbulence model are provided in section 3 2 after the cfd numerical calculation is completed fluid pressure is measured upstream and downstream and the pressure drop δ p between them is used to obtain the drag

calculation the strong water jet through a opening circular hole is seen due to sudden contraction it is obvious that due to sudden expansion of cross section the flow pattern is diverged and turbulent vortices are created in the downstream we obtained the numerical results for c d for five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 and three different reynolds numbers re 5000 15 000 and 40 000 the empirical formula of c d is determined through curve fitting with starccm s numerical results 29 c d 0 6 1 p c c 1 2 where the discharge coefficient c c for a sharp edged orifice is c c 0 6 0 4 p 3 fig 4 shows that there is a close agreement between the empirical formula 29 and numerical results and the effect of the reynolds numbers on c d is insignificant 3 2 3d turbulent model a 3d numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in a rolling rectangular tank with a vertical porous baffle was performed using a cfd software star ccm an incompressible turbulent flow model was adopted for numerical simulation and a vof method was used to trace the free surface behavior in a tank we introduce the tank fixed coordinate system where the x axis is aligned along the undisturbed free surface and the z axis points vertically upward the flow variation in the y direction is assumed to be small and thus the width of the tank model is set as 2 cm instead of actual tank width of 10 cm to reduce computational cost porous baffles with five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 are used for numerical calculation the fluid domain is discretized using a trimmed mesh model of star ccm it produces a predominantly hexahedral mesh and allows mesh refinement via different user defined controls a base mesh size of 10 mm is used and mesh refinement is achieved through volumetric and surface controls to represent the baffle geometry as well as to resolve local vorticity flow across the porous baffle the appropriate discretization of the baffle is achieved without increasing the total number of cells by using surface control an anisotropic cell with a height of 1 25 mm and a length of 2 5 mm is used near the free surface on the surface of the porous baffle the mesh size of the hole is set to 1 0 mm and that of the plate is set to 2 5 mm with the exception of the top of the tank which is set as the pressure outlet boundary all the boundaries of the fluid domain including the baffle plate are set as the wall boundary the number of holes in the baffle increase with porosity fig 5 thus the total number of cells increases correspondingly table 1 fig 6 a shows the overall mesh distribution on the x z cut plane fig 6b shows a mesh refinement near the free surface and on the porous baffle liquid sloshing motion in a rectangular tank is considered an incompressible multiphase fluid flow problem numerical simulation is performed by solving the continuity and navier stokes equations these equations are averaged with time to obtain the unsteady rans equations 30 v i x i 0 31 v i t v i v j x j 1 ρ p x i μ ρ 2 v i x i x j v i v j x j where i j 1 2 3 in eqs 30 and 31 v i is the time averaged velocity and v i is the fluctuating velocity a segregated flow solver is used to solve the unsteady rans equations along with the simple algorithm the convective term in eq 31 is discretized via the so called second order upwind scheme and the unsteady term is solved using the second order implicit time marching procedure an adaptive time step control based on the convective courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is applied to improve the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution the maximum cfl number is specified as 0 5 the reynolds stresses in eq 31 are represented by the mean flow quantities using the realizable k ε turbulent model as follows 32 k 1 2 v i v i ε ν t v i x j v i x j i j 1 2 3 where k is turbulent kinetic energy and ε is turbulent dissipation rate ν t is kinematic eddy viscosity defined as ν t c μ k 2 ε where model coefficient c μ is 0 09 the additional transport equations of turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are solved in the numerical simulation a two layer approach is used to incorporate the effect of the wall boundary on the turbulence in the viscous dominant region in addition all y wall treatment in star ccm is adopted this treatment uses a blended wall function that can describe the velocity and turbulence in the three boundary layers viscous sublayer buffer layer and log layer irrespective of the near wall cell size the free surface elevation in a rolling tank is traced using the vof method for two fluid phases air and water the volume fraction of the i fluid phase in a cell is given by α i v i v where v i is the volume of the i fluid phase in a cell and v is the volume of a cell in the vof method whole cells in a fluid domain are modeled as a single fluid with a newly defined density and viscosity with the phase indicator function α i such that ρ α i ρ i μ α i μ i these equivalent density and viscosity are also applied to the governing equations in addition the transport equation of the phase indicator function is used to update the evolution of free surface with space and time 33 α i t α i v i x i v r i α i 1 α i x i s α i the third term on the left side of eq 33 is known as the surface compression term and it only contributes to the free surface the term v r i denotes the relative velocity between the two phases the right side of eq 33 denotes the source term for the i fluid phase a high resolution interface capturing scheme is used as a discretization method for the convection term in the transport equation the forced roll excited motion of the tank is simulated by the rotation of the fluid domain the rotational velocity of the fluid domain in the tank is defined as ω θ a cos ω t the free surface elevation and dynamic pressure are monitored and plotted all the simulations are run until the monitoring parameters became steady 4 experiment to validate the analytical solutions developed in the preceding sections a series of experiments were conducted in a rolling rectangular tank with a submerged vertical porous baffle a rectangular tank length height width 50 50 10 cm of acrylic material is mounted on a movable platform allowing it to move only in a rolling motion the width of the tank is small compared with its length to avoid any 3d cross waves a forced roll excited motion is provided by using a cam mechanism comprised of a rotating disk and a connecting arm the amplitude of roll motion is controlled by positioning the end of the connecting arm at an appropriate place in a slot of the rotating disk with a diameter of 15 cm the rotating disk is connected to a servomotor the revolution per minute of the servomotor is changed accordingly to achieve different oscillation periods the porous baffles are made of a stainless steel plate with a uniform distribution of circular holes on it a staggered arrangement of pores with a radius of 1 5 mm is adopted for all the porosities and the center to center spacings are 5 6 8 10 and 12 mm for different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 the roll amplitudes of the tank are 0 5 and 1 0 and 16 periods ranging from 0 4 s to 1 4 s are considered the complete experimental set up and photo of the test scenes are shown in fig 7 an image processing technique is used to measure free surface elevation on the tank wall the accuracy of the measured data depends on the quality of the recorded video in the present study the resolution of the video is about 0 208 mm pixel and the sampling rate is 60 hz a matlab program is used for image processing the liquid is dyed red to improve optical detection the dynamic pressure acting on the tank wall is measured using a watertight disk type pressure transducer p310 02s at a sampling frequency of 100 hz the pressure transducer is installed on the left wall 2 cm above the tank bottom the oscillation time of the tank is 120 s for each motion period and the last 30 s is selected for image processing 5 results and discussion the anti sloshing performance of the vertical porous baffle in a rolling rectangular tank was investigated by utilizing the developed analytical model and cfd program the free surface elevation and dynamic pressure on the tank wall hydrodynamic moments added mass and damping coefficient and sloshing induced moments on the baffle were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the baffle calculations were performed for various important parameters such as porosities p submerged depths d h and tank oscillation periods meanwhile tank dimensions which is based on the experiment were fixed throughout the entire calculation besides the rotational center z r 16 cm was maintained first the convergence of the analytical solutions for the non dimensional added mass μ μ m l i q u i d h 2 m l i q u i d 2 a ρ h and damping coefficient ν ν m l i q u i d h 2 ω is shown in table 2 for the half submerged baffle n 80 is sufficient for engineering purposes and thus this value is used for rest of the present study the baffle averaged values for β z are overestimated a little bit compared with the six point gaussian quadrature integration but to reduce the computational time we used the baffle averaged values at the ensuing entire calculation the liquid sloshing of no baffle tank is demonstrated with the analytical experimental and numerical results the wall amplification factors and dynamic pressure in a rolling tank with no baffle are plotted in fig 8 with the roll period as an x axis the wall amplification factor is defined as the ratio of the surface elevation on the tank wall to the tank s rolling motion amplitude r a η a a θ θ and the dynamic pressure denotes the peak to trough pressure difference p m 2 ρ g θ a k φ a z a at z 0 8 h the solid lines in fig 8 are the meem solutions and the symbols and represent the experimental data and star ccm s numerical results respectively overall the analytical solutions agree well with the experimental and numerical results except resonance periods these discrepancies at resonance periods can be attributed to nonlinear and viscous effects which are not captured properly by the present potential based solutions two resonance peaks exist within the selected range of rolling periods for a 2d rectangular baffle free tank the natural periods t n for sloshing modes n 1 2 3 can be obtained analytically in terms of tank length 2a and filling depth h ibrahim 2005 34 t n 2 π ω n 2 π n π g 2 a tanh n π h 2 a n 1 2 3 three sloshing natural periods in a baffle free tank are expected to occur at 1 07 0 61 and 0 47 s the first and third mode natural periods coincide with the resonance periods shown in fig 8 however the even modes n 2 4 are insignificant because they generate nodes on the tank wall figs 9 and 10 show the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure on the wall in a rolling tank with the half submerged porous baffle the porous baffle has five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 as shown in fig 5 despite the installation of the baffle the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure exhibit a similar tendency to that of a baffle free tank due to the free liquid movement through the opening part under the baffle however the significant reduction of the numerical and experimental results at the first mode resonance period t 1 07 s accounts for the energy dissipation caused by the porous baffle the theoretically predicted solutions correlate well with the experimental and numerical results except for the quantitative differences at resonance the quantitative difference at resonance appears to be greater for the baffle of low porosity in the present model the added damping by the installation of a porous baffle is caused by the small scale vortices formation across the small circular holes of the porous baffle and the tip vortices at the edge of the baffle the analytical model can t involve tip vortices at the edge of the porous baffle but can consider small scale vortices generated across the small holes of a porous baffle for this reason the present analytical model can yield more reliable results when contribution of tip vortices in damping is less the tip vortices are particularly predominant in a baffle with low porosity consequently the quantitative difference between the analytical and experimental results appears to be more significant for low porosity baffles on the contrary a closer agreement is observed between them at relatively large porosity p 0 2267 and 0 3265 figs 11 and 12 show the effects of the baffle s submergence depth d h on the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure typical comparisons of theoretical numerical and experimental results are made at three different submergence depths d h 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 the general trend of the experimental and numerical results is reproduced well by the analytical solutions the smaller the submerged depth the higher the wall amplification factor due to the reduction of blocking effect and water contacting area of the porous baffle for the fully submerged low porosity baffles p 0 0567 0 0816 and 0 1275 the first mode resonance peak completely disappears the fully submerged baffle with low porosity separates the rectangular tank with a length of 2a into two tanks with the same length of a consequently the first mode natural period is changed from 1 07 s to 0 61 s from eq 34 as shown in fig 11 the first mode resonant peak occurs near 0 6 s moreover the vortices formation at the tip of the baffle doesn t occur in the fully submerged baffle accordingly the analytical solutions quantitatively follow the numerical results well as porosity increases the first mode resonant peak at t 1 07 s reappears and coincides with that of a baffle free tank to clarify energy dissipation according to the vortices formation described in figs 9 12 flow visualization from the cfd simulation is provided in fig 13 the figure shows the snapshots taken from the numerical simulation at the 3rd mode natural period t 0 437 s two different types of vortices are shown in the figure as mentioned before the strong tip vortices at the lower edge of the baffle are seen at the baffle of the lowest porosity p 0 0567 besides the small scale vortices across the small holes of the baffle is predominant at p 0 1275 these kinds of vortices formation near the porous baffle affect the energy dissipation by the porous baffle and plays an important role in the anti sloshing performance of porous baffles to get an insight into the nonlinearity of the problem the effect of the roll angle of the tank on the dynamic pressure is also investigated using the analytical and experimental results the comparison of the dynamic pressure is performed for the two roll angles 0 5 and 1 0 and five different porosities fig 14 the first mode natural period of the fully submerged baffle with low porosity is 0 61 s as an increase in porosity from p 0 0567 to p 0 3265 the resonance characteristics gradually approach to that of a baffle free tank the nonlinearity at θ a 1 0 is unobtrusive because the dynamic pressure at θ a 1 0 nearly doubles compared to θ a 0 5 in considering the variation of dynamic pressure by a porous baffle with different porosities the optimal porosity for anti sloshing exists near p 0 1275 next to gain additional insight into the effect of the enclosed fluid dynamics the non dimensional added mass μ μ m l i q u i d h 2 m l i q u i d 2 a ρ h and damping coefficient ν ν m l i q u i d h 2 ω are presented in fig 15 under the same conditions as figs 9 and 10 the fluctuations in added mass and damping coefficients appear evidently near the first mode resonance added mass sharply changes near the resonance and becomes negative while the damping coefficients reach maximum values a similar phenomenon occurs when resonant body oscillates in the enclosed fluid region such as floating torus floating bodies in proximity catamaran hull and moon pool a decrease in porosity results in an increase of the added mass and damping coefficient and a decrease in the width of the resonant peak fig 16 shows the non dimensional added mass and damping coefficient for the fully submerged baffle the fully submerged baffle with low porosity p 0 0567 causes the resonance period to occur at t 0 61 s after the first mode resonance the damping coefficient increases monotonously and the added mass continues to maintain negative values in case of moderate porosity p 0 1275 the added mass and damping coefficient do not exhibit clear resonance characteristics at resonance but maintain the lowest values for the entire period range at the largest porosity p 0 3265 the resonance characteristic becomes clearer and the added mass and damping coefficient larger fig 17 shows the non dimensional sloshing induced moments m b ρ g d 2 θ a on the vertical porous baffle at various porosities and submergence depths as porosity increases the water contacting areas and pressure differences across the porous baffle decrease it leads to a reduction of sloshing induced loads moreover energy dissipation across the porous baffle increases as the submerged depth increases consequently the sloshing induced moments decrease with increasing porosity and submergence depth the porous baffle helps reduce sloshing induced loads on the baffle as well as liquid sloshing motion in a tank 6 conclusions in this study the analytical model predicting the liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a vertical porous baffle was developed using the meem and an equivalent linearized quadratic loss model the empirical formula of a drag coefficient was determined through the curve fitting with star ccm s results for a simplified channel flow with a circular void hole the analytical model was verified through the comparison with the experimental and 3d cfd based numerical results comparisons were made for half and fully submerged baffles with five different porosities in addition the effect of submergence depths and roll angles on sloshing dynamics were also investigated the following conclusions could be drawn from the present study 1 in the half submerged baffle case the sloshing dynamics are analogous to that of a baffle free tank except reduction of resonance peaks however for the fully submerged baffle with low porosity the first mode natural period shifts from 1 1s to 0 6s due to the blocking effect of liquid movement by the porous baffle 2 the analytical solutions show a satisfactory agreement with 3d cfd based numerical and experimental results except the quantitative discrepancies near resonance periods the discrepancies are more noticeable for the half submerged case since the developed analytical tool can t consider energy dissipation by tip vortices at the lower edge of the baffle but with an increase in porosity the effect of tip vortices becomes smaller and the vortices formation through small openings of the baffle dominates as a results the analytical model shows good agreement with experiments 3 porous baffle with a porosity of 0 1275 provides maximum energy dissipation it is also observed through the flow visualization using cfd 4 near the first mode resonance the added mass sharply changes and becomes negative while the damping coefficient reaches the maximum values an increase in added mass and damping coefficient are observed with decreasing porosity the fully submerged baffle contributes to reduce the hydrodynamic moments added mass damping coefficient and exhibites peculiar hydrodynamic characteristics compared to the half submerged baffle 5 the sloshing induced moments on the baffle decrease with an increase in porosity the porous baffle is proved to help reduce sloshing induced loads on the baffle as well as liquid sloshing motion in a tank by capturing the essential dynamics of liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a porous baffle the present analytical model was proven to be a worthy initial design tool for anti sloshing porous baffles 3d cfd numerical simulations could be utilized for quantitative estimation at the final design stage and for gaining insights into

submerged porous baffle of different porosities the acceptability and limitation of the present analytical model was quantified and qualified using experimental and numerical approach the presented analytical and 3d turbulent numerical model will provide a mutually complementary tool for the understanding of the energy dissipation mechanism and efficient design of the porous baffle as an anti sloshing device keywords rolling sloshing tank porous baffle anti sloshing eigenfunction expansion method turbulent flow model experiment 1 introduction the liquid in a container may easily exhibits severe free surface oscillation when the container is subjected to external excitations this phenomenon called sloshing has been a crucial engineering issue previous research has shown that sloshing loads depend on the wave excitation frequency and these loads reach their maximum value when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank impact sloshing loads may damage a tank thus liquid sloshing should be restricted to avoid structural failure of tank and instability of tank carrier a variety of anti sloshing devices have been developed to attenuate sloshing energy and limit liquid movement using various physical elements such as partitions mitra et al 2010 baffles wang et al 2016 flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 and floating roofs hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 among these elements vertical and horizontal baffles have been recognized as effective internal devices for increasing the intrinsic damping of tank and consequently decreasing sloshing energy in most practical engineering problems in recent years many experimental and analytical studies have been conducted on the use of baffles as a sloshing reduction device in tanks as a result several baffles have been suggested for suppressing sloshing behavior they include solid flexible ring and porous baffles however the damping mechanism of baffles has still not fully understood due to the complexity and highly nonlinear nature of the sloshing phenomenon yan et al 2009 warnitchai and pinkaew 1998 studied various slosh dampening devices with emphasis on wire mesh baffles they found that these devices introduce additional damping to the sloshing modes and slightly shift the resonance frequencies through the added mass effect akyildiz and ünal 2005 performed experimental studies to assess 3d sloshing effects and pressure variations at different locations on tank walls by installing solid baffles inside the tank subjected to roll excitation they found that side stringers horizontal baffles experience high slamming loads at low filling depths panigrahy et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments to estimate the free surface elevation and pressure on tank walls with horizontal and vertical baffles to reduce sloshing energy in a sway excited tank they observed that the baffle s edges induce turbulent vorticities in liquid flows leading to sloshing damping the experimental results of goudarzi et al 2010 showed that horizontal baffles are effective in a slender tank and vertical baffles are preferred for a broad tank with low filling depths these

crowley and porter 2012 investigated liquid sloshing with a vertical porous baffle located at the center of a rectangular tank in a horizontal excitation motion using an equivalent linear baffle

frequency is limited cho and kim 2016 performed an experiment to examine damping characteristics of dual vertical porous baffles in a swaying tank by changing their porosity submerged depth and position experimental results were used to validate analytical solutions based on potential theory this study was extended in cho et al 2017 to investigate the effectiveness of horizontal porous baffles in a sway excited rectangular tank and the optimal porosity of a porous baffle was found near p 0 1 xue et al 2017 conducted an experiment on a horizontal excited sloshing tank with various vertical baffle arrangements and compared the shift in the lowest mode natural frequency with no baffle tank ünal et al 2019 studied the sloshing suppression of a t shaped baffle numerically in a rolling tank and the effects of the t shaped baffle height as well as the filling depth and rotation angle on the liquid sloshing motion were systematically investigated most studies that have been conducted were limited to the sway excited tanks but published studies on rolling tanks are a few the effect of baffles on reducing liquid sloshing motion has been explored extensively in rectangular tank geometries through numerical investigations kim et al 2001 simulated sloshing flows in 2d and 3d liquid containers on the basis of a finite difference method fdm the free surface profile was assumed to be a single valued function the global fluid motion was regarded as relevant and some local nonlinear phenomena were not considered liu and lin 2009 numerically simulated 3d liquid sloshing

baffle was conducted by maravani and hamed 2011 they developed a numerical algorithm based on a laminar navier stokes solver using the fdm moreover partial cell treatment was used to model the baffle wu et al 2012 used a time independent finite difference scheme with a fictitious cell technique to study viscous liquid sloshing in 2d tanks with baffles their method was applied to a number of problems including impulsive flow past a flat plate liquid sloshing in 2d tanks with surface piercing and bottom mounted baffles jung et al 2012 investigated the effect of vertical baffle height on liquid sloshing in a laterally moving 3d rectangular tank the volume of fluid vof method based on the finite volume method fvm was utilized to simulate 3d incompressible viscous two phase liquid and air flow in a tank akyildiz et al 2012 studied nonlinear sloshing behavior in a rolling tank with a vertical baffle a 2d numerical model based on the fdm was used for numerical simulation energy dissipation due to vortices at the edge of baffle was observed to be inversely proportional to baffle height frosina et al 2018 studied sloshing phenomena inside a real fuel tank for three different filling depths using the cfd method and validated with experiment data poguluri and cho 2019 2020 conducted numerical simulations on the basis of an incompressible turbulent model using a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation to verify complex phenomena associated with a sway excited rectangular tank with a vertical slotted baffle the adopted numerical technique captured nonlinear free surface wave profile air entrapment and vortices formation near the baffle in the present study the analytical numerical and experimental approaches were used to study the anti sloshing effect of a vertical porous baffle with different porosities and submerged depths in a rolling rectangular tank the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem was adopted to obtain analytical solutions which were supplemented with a porosity dependent drag coefficient representing energy dissipation due to vortices formation near the porous baffle the empirical formula for a drag coefficient was obtained through the curve fitting with cfd results for the channel flow with a circular hole the 3d numerical simulations of the sloshing problem were conducted using the cfd software starccm the rans equations were solved in the fluid domain and two phase water and air flow was simulated using the vof method the series of experiments were conducted in a roll excited rectangular tank with the half and fully submerged porous baffle of different porosities the developed analytical solutions were compared with the 3d numerical and experimental results and used to understand complex nonlinear phenomena and energy dissipation associated with the porous baffle for suppressing sloshing effects the general flow topology free surface deformations and eddy vortices generated by the porous baffle were also examined through visualization of the cfd simulation 2 analytic solution we investigated a 2d liquid sloshing in a rolling rectangular tank of length 2 a equipped with a vertical porous baffle at the center of the tank cartesian axes were chosen with the x axis along the mean free surface and z axis pointing vertically upward as shown in fig 1 the liquid filling depth is denoted by h and the submergence depth of the porous baffle by d the tank is excited by a sinusoidal function θ t θ a sin ω t with the roll motion amplitude θ a and frequency ω it was assumed that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the wave motions are small so linear potential theory can be used the fluid particle velocity can then be described by the gradient of a velocity potential φ x z t

that φ x z φ x z therefore we only needed to consider the fluid motion in the half tank in x 0 the boundary value problem was solved only on the left half plane x 0 and the solution in x 0 could be easily extended by the anti symmetric relation φ x z φ x z the quadratic velocity dependence in the boundary condition 6 implies that excitation of a tank with a single frequency ω introduces multi frequency responses of fluid flow thus if expanding φ in a fourier time series in multiples of ω and retaining just the fundamental frequency response the fourier coefficient of the first term is 8 3π whilst the next term at frequency 3ω is much smaller than ω and justifies this assumption we can obtain an equivalent linearized porous boundary condition c can be neglected when the baffle is thin

drag coefficient in this section we introduce the empirical formula for a drag coefficient c d through the curve fitting with star ccm s numerical results given a porous baffle with a staggered arrangement of circular holes of radius r and center to center spacing c fig 1 to investigate energy dissipation through holes of the baffle we consider a 3d square channel flow model of side c with a circular hole the geometrical porosity p 2 π r 2 3 c 2 is determined by a fixed hole s radius r 1 5 mm and five different spacings c 5 6 8 10 and 12 mm the size of the fluid domain extends upstream 10 c and downstream 20 c upstream velocities are set at the inlet boundary on the basis of the reynolds numbers re 5000 15 000 and 40 000 the outlet boundary is set as the pressure outlet other boundaries are defined as rigid wall boundaries the trimmed mesh model of star ccm is used to discretize the fluid domain using a fine mesh 0 2 mm near a circular void hole to capture flow separation and vortices the discretized computational domain for the channel flow model with a circular hole is depicted in fig 2 the steady form of rans equations is solved using a segregated solver based on the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme the realizable k ε turbulence model with all y wall treatment is used in the simulation additional details regarding the turbulence model are provided in section 3 2 after the cfd numerical calculation is completed fluid pressure is measured upstream and downstream and the pressure drop δ p between them is used to obtain the drag

calculation the strong water jet through a opening circular hole is seen due to sudden contraction it is obvious that due to sudden expansion of cross section the flow pattern is diverged and turbulent vortices are created in the downstream we obtained the numerical results for c d for five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 and three different reynolds numbers re 5000 15 000 and 40 000 the empirical formula of c d is determined through curve fitting with starccm s numerical results 29 c d 0 6 1 p c c 1 2 where the discharge coefficient c c for a sharp edged orifice is c c 0 6 0 4 p 3 fig 4 shows that there is a close agreement between the empirical formula 29 and numerical results and the effect of the reynolds numbers on c d is insignificant 3 2 3d turbulent model a 3d numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in a rolling rectangular tank with a vertical porous baffle was performed using a cfd software star ccm an incompressible turbulent flow model was adopted for numerical simulation and a vof method was used to trace the free surface behavior in a tank we introduce the tank fixed coordinate system where the x axis is aligned along the undisturbed free surface and the z axis points vertically upward the flow variation in the y direction is assumed to be small and thus the width of the tank model is set as 2 cm instead of actual tank width of 10 cm to reduce computational cost porous baffles with five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 are used for numerical calculation the fluid domain is discretized using a trimmed mesh model of star ccm it produces a predominantly hexahedral mesh and allows mesh refinement via different user defined controls a base mesh size of 10 mm is used and mesh refinement is achieved through volumetric and surface controls to represent the baffle geometry as well as to resolve local vorticity flow across the porous baffle the appropriate discretization of the baffle is achieved without increasing the total number of cells by using surface control an anisotropic cell with a height of 1 25 mm and a length of 2 5 mm is used near the free surface on the surface of the porous baffle the mesh size of the hole is set to 1 0 mm and that of the plate is set to 2 5 mm with the exception of the top of the tank which is set as the pressure outlet boundary all the boundaries of the fluid domain including the baffle plate are set as the wall boundary the number of holes in the baffle increase with porosity fig 5 thus the total number of cells increases correspondingly table 1 fig 6 a shows the overall mesh distribution on the x z cut plane fig 6b shows a mesh refinement near the free surface and on the porous baffle liquid sloshing motion in a rectangular tank is considered an incompressible multiphase fluid flow problem numerical simulation is performed by solving the continuity and navier stokes equations these equations are averaged with time to obtain the unsteady rans equations 30 v i x i 0 31 v i t v i v j x j 1 ρ p x i μ ρ 2 v i x i x j v i v j x j where i j 1 2 3 in eqs 30 and 31 v i is the time averaged velocity and v i is the fluctuating velocity a segregated flow solver is used to solve the unsteady rans equations along with the simple algorithm the convective term in eq 31 is discretized via the so called second order upwind scheme and the unsteady term is solved using the second order implicit time marching procedure an adaptive time step control based on the convective courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is applied to improve the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution the maximum cfl number is specified as 0 5 the reynolds stresses in eq 31 are represented by the mean flow quantities using the realizable k ε turbulent model as follows 32 k 1 2 v i v i ε ν t v i x j v i x j i j 1 2 3 where k is turbulent kinetic energy and ε is turbulent dissipation rate ν t is kinematic eddy viscosity defined as ν t c μ k 2 ε where model coefficient c μ is 0 09 the additional transport equations of turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are solved in the numerical simulation a two layer approach is used to incorporate the effect of the wall boundary on the turbulence in the viscous dominant region in addition all y wall treatment in star ccm is adopted this treatment uses a blended wall function that can describe the velocity and turbulence in the three boundary layers viscous sublayer buffer layer and log layer irrespective of the near wall cell size the free surface elevation in a rolling tank is traced using the vof method for two fluid phases air and water the volume fraction of the i fluid phase in a cell is given by α i v i v where v i is the volume of the i fluid phase in a cell and v is the volume of a cell in the vof method whole cells in a fluid domain are modeled as a single fluid with a newly defined density and viscosity with the phase indicator function α i such that ρ α i ρ i μ α i μ i these equivalent density and viscosity are also applied to the governing equations in addition the transport equation of the phase indicator function is used to update the evolution of free surface with space and time 33 α i t α i v i x i v r i α i 1 α i x i s α i the third term on the left side of eq 33 is known as the surface compression term and it only contributes to the free surface the term v r i denotes the relative velocity between the two phases the right side of eq 33 denotes the source term for the i fluid phase a high resolution interface capturing scheme is used as a discretization method for the convection term in the transport equation the forced roll excited motion of the tank is simulated by the rotation of the fluid domain the rotational velocity of the fluid domain in the tank is defined as ω θ a cos ω t the free surface elevation and dynamic pressure are monitored and plotted all the simulations are run until the monitoring parameters became steady 4 experiment to validate the analytical solutions developed in the preceding sections a series of experiments were conducted in a rolling rectangular tank with a submerged vertical porous baffle a rectangular tank length height width 50 50 10 cm of acrylic material is mounted on a movable platform allowing it to move only in a rolling motion the width of the tank is small compared with its length to avoid any 3d cross waves a forced roll excited motion is provided by using a cam mechanism comprised of a rotating disk and a connecting arm the amplitude of roll motion is controlled by positioning the end of the connecting arm at an appropriate place in a slot of the rotating disk with a diameter of 15 cm the rotating disk is connected to a servomotor the revolution per minute of the servomotor is changed accordingly to achieve different oscillation periods the porous baffles are made of a stainless steel plate with a uniform distribution of circular holes on it a staggered arrangement of pores with a radius of 1 5 mm is adopted for all the porosities and the center to center spacings are 5 6 8 10 and 12 mm for different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 the roll amplitudes of the tank are 0 5 and 1 0 and 16 periods ranging from 0 4 s to 1 4 s are considered the complete experimental set up and photo of the test scenes are shown in fig 7 an image processing technique is used to measure free surface elevation on the tank wall the accuracy of the measured data depends on the quality of the recorded video in the present study the resolution of the video is about 0 208 mm pixel and the sampling rate is 60 hz a matlab program is used for image processing the liquid is dyed red to improve optical detection the dynamic pressure acting on the tank wall is measured using a watertight disk type pressure transducer p310 02s at a sampling frequency of 100 hz the pressure transducer is installed on the left wall 2 cm above the tank bottom the oscillation time of the tank is 120 s for each motion period and the last 30 s is selected for image processing 5 results and discussion the anti sloshing performance of the vertical porous baffle in a rolling rectangular tank was investigated by utilizing the developed analytical model and cfd program the free surface elevation and dynamic pressure on the tank wall hydrodynamic moments added mass and damping coefficient and sloshing induced moments on the baffle were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the baffle calculations were performed for various important parameters such as porosities p submerged depths d h and tank oscillation periods meanwhile tank dimensions which is based on the experiment were fixed throughout the entire calculation besides the rotational center z r 16 cm was maintained first the convergence of the analytical solutions for the non dimensional added mass μ μ m l i q u i d h 2 m l i q u i d 2 a ρ h and damping coefficient ν ν m l i q u i d h 2 ω is shown in table 2 for the half submerged baffle n 80 is sufficient for engineering purposes and thus this value is used for rest of the present study the baffle averaged values for β z are overestimated a little bit compared with the six point gaussian quadrature integration but to reduce the computational time we used the baffle averaged values at the ensuing entire calculation the liquid sloshing of no baffle tank is demonstrated with the analytical experimental and numerical results the wall amplification factors and dynamic pressure in a rolling tank with no baffle are plotted in fig 8 with the roll period as an x axis the wall amplification factor is defined as the ratio of the surface elevation on the tank wall to the tank s rolling motion amplitude r a η a a θ θ and the dynamic pressure denotes the peak to trough pressure difference p m 2 ρ g θ a k φ a z a at z 0 8 h the solid lines in fig 8 are the meem solutions and the symbols and represent the experimental data and star ccm s numerical results respectively overall the analytical solutions agree well with the experimental and numerical results except resonance periods these discrepancies at resonance periods can be attributed to nonlinear and viscous effects which are not captured properly by the present potential based solutions two resonance peaks exist within the selected range of rolling periods for a 2d rectangular baffle free tank the natural periods t n for sloshing modes n 1 2 3 can be obtained analytically in terms of tank length 2a and filling depth h ibrahim 2005 34 t n 2 π ω n 2 π n π g 2 a tanh n π h 2 a n 1 2 3 three sloshing natural periods in a baffle free tank are expected to occur at 1 07 0 61 and 0 47 s the first and third mode natural periods coincide with the resonance periods shown in fig 8 however the even modes n 2 4 are insignificant because they generate nodes on the tank wall figs 9 and 10 show the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure on the wall in a rolling tank with the half submerged porous baffle the porous baffle has five different porosities p 0 0567 0 0816 0 1275 0 2267 and 0 3265 as shown in fig 5 despite the installation of the baffle the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure exhibit a similar tendency to that of a baffle free tank due to the free liquid movement through the opening part under the baffle however the significant reduction of the numerical and experimental results at the first mode resonance period t 1 07 s accounts for the energy dissipation caused by the porous baffle the theoretically predicted solutions correlate well with the experimental and numerical results except for the quantitative differences at resonance the quantitative difference at resonance appears to be greater for the baffle of low porosity in the present model the added damping by the installation of a porous baffle is caused by the small scale vortices formation across the small circular holes of the porous baffle and the tip vortices at the edge of the baffle the analytical model can t involve tip vortices at the edge of the porous baffle but can consider small scale vortices generated across the small holes of a porous baffle for this reason the present analytical model can yield more reliable results when contribution of tip vortices in damping is less the tip vortices are particularly predominant in a baffle with low porosity consequently the quantitative difference between the analytical and experimental results appears to be more significant for low porosity baffles on the contrary a closer agreement is observed between them at relatively large porosity p 0 2267 and 0 3265 figs 11 and 12 show the effects of the baffle s submergence depth d h on the wall amplification factor and dynamic pressure typical comparisons of theoretical numerical and experimental results are made at three different submergence depths d h 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 the general trend of the experimental and numerical results is reproduced well by the analytical solutions the smaller the submerged depth the higher the wall amplification factor due to the reduction of blocking effect and water contacting area of the porous baffle for the fully submerged low porosity baffles p 0 0567 0 0816 and 0 1275 the first mode resonance peak completely disappears the fully submerged baffle with low porosity separates the rectangular tank with a length of 2a into two tanks with the same length of a consequently the first mode natural period is changed from 1 07 s to 0 61 s from eq 34 as shown in fig 11 the first mode resonant peak occurs near 0 6 s moreover the vortices formation at the tip of the baffle doesn t occur in the fully submerged baffle accordingly the analytical solutions quantitatively follow the numerical results well as porosity increases the first mode resonant peak at t 1 07 s reappears and coincides with that of a baffle free tank to clarify energy dissipation according to the vortices formation described in figs 9 12 flow visualization from the cfd simulation is provided in fig 13 the figure shows the snapshots taken from the numerical simulation at the 3rd mode natural period t 0 437 s two different types of vortices are shown in the figure as mentioned before the strong tip vortices at the lower edge of the baffle are seen at the baffle of the lowest porosity p 0 0567 besides the small scale vortices across the small holes of the baffle is predominant at p 0 1275 these kinds of vortices formation near the porous baffle affect the energy dissipation by the porous baffle and plays an important role in the anti sloshing performance of porous baffles to get an insight into the nonlinearity of the problem the effect of the roll angle of the tank on the dynamic pressure is also investigated using the analytical and experimental results the comparison of the dynamic pressure is performed for the two roll angles 0 5 and 1 0 and five different porosities fig 14 the first mode natural period of the fully submerged baffle with low porosity is 0 61 s as an increase in porosity from p 0 0567 to p 0 3265 the resonance characteristics gradually approach to that of a baffle free tank the nonlinearity at θ a 1 0 is unobtrusive because the dynamic pressure at θ a 1 0 nearly doubles compared to θ a 0 5 in considering the variation of dynamic pressure by a porous baffle with different porosities the optimal porosity for anti sloshing exists near p 0 1275 next to gain additional insight into the effect of the enclosed fluid dynamics the non dimensional added mass μ μ m l i q u i d h 2 m l i q u i d 2 a ρ h and damping coefficient ν ν m l i q u i d h 2 ω are presented in fig 15 under the same conditions as figs 9 and 10 the fluctuations in added mass and damping coefficients appear evidently near the first mode resonance added mass sharply changes near the resonance and becomes negative while the damping coefficients reach maximum values a similar phenomenon occurs when resonant body oscillates in the enclosed fluid region such as floating torus floating bodies in proximity catamaran hull and moon pool a decrease in porosity results in an increase of the added mass and damping coefficient and a decrease in the width of the resonant peak fig 16 shows the non dimensional added mass and damping coefficient for the fully submerged baffle the fully submerged baffle with low porosity p 0 0567 causes the resonance period to occur at t 0 61 s after the first mode resonance the damping coefficient increases monotonously and the added mass continues to maintain negative values in case of moderate porosity p 0 1275 the added mass and damping coefficient do not exhibit clear resonance characteristics at resonance but maintain the lowest values for the entire period range at the largest porosity p 0 3265 the resonance characteristic becomes clearer and the added mass and damping coefficient larger fig 17 shows the non dimensional sloshing induced moments m b ρ g d 2 θ a on the vertical porous baffle at various porosities and submergence depths as porosity increases the water contacting areas and pressure differences across the porous baffle decrease it leads to a reduction of sloshing induced loads moreover energy dissipation across the porous baffle increases as the submerged depth increases consequently the sloshing induced moments decrease with increasing porosity and submergence depth the porous baffle helps reduce sloshing induced loads on the baffle as well as liquid sloshing motion in a tank 6 conclusions in this study the analytical model predicting the liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a vertical porous baffle was developed using the meem and an equivalent linearized quadratic loss model the empirical formula of a drag coefficient was determined through the curve fitting with star ccm s results for a simplified channel flow with a circular void hole the analytical model was verified through the comparison with the experimental and 3d cfd based numerical results comparisons were made for half and fully submerged baffles with five different porosities in addition the effect of submergence depths and roll angles on sloshing dynamics were also investigated the following conclusions could be drawn from the present study 1 in the half submerged baffle case the sloshing dynamics are analogous to that of a baffle free tank except reduction of resonance peaks however for the fully submerged baffle with low porosity the first mode natural period shifts from 1 1s to 0 6s due to the blocking effect of liquid movement by the porous baffle 2 the analytical solutions show a satisfactory agreement with 3d cfd based numerical and experimental results except the quantitative discrepancies near resonance periods the discrepancies are more noticeable for the half submerged case since the developed analytical tool can t consider energy dissipation by tip vortices at the lower edge of the baffle but with an increase in porosity the effect of tip vortices becomes smaller and the vortices formation through small openings of the baffle dominates as a results the analytical model shows good agreement with experiments 3 porous baffle with a porosity of 0 1275 provides maximum energy dissipation it is also observed through the flow visualization using cfd 4 near the first mode resonance the added mass sharply changes and becomes negative while the damping coefficient reaches the maximum values an increase in added mass and damping coefficient are observed with decreasing porosity the fully submerged baffle contributes to reduce the hydrodynamic moments added mass damping coefficient and exhibites peculiar hydrodynamic characteristics compared to the half submerged baffle 5 the sloshing induced moments on the baffle decrease with an increase in porosity the porous baffle is proved to help reduce sloshing induced loads on the baffle as well as liquid sloshing motion in a tank by capturing the essential dynamics of liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a porous baffle the present analytical model was proven to be a worthy initial design tool for anti sloshing porous baffles 3d cfd numerical simulations could be utilized for quantitative estimation at the final design stage and for gaining insights into complex vortices formation and the nonlinearity which are outside the scope of potential theory credit authorship contribution statement arun george experiments visualization i h cho writing original
