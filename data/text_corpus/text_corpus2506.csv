12530,isolated studies for the evaluation of coagulation considering either microscopic or macroscopic dimensions have largely been discussed however comprehensive analysis of coagulation including various dimensions is imperative to design an optimal coagulation system in this work a comprehensive methodology has been described which includes dosing approach mathematical modelling chemical analysis by ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy image analysis for floc properties and various analytical procedures jar tests were performed on simulated waters containing humic acid and kaolin using high basicity pacl poly aluminium chloride a podr point of diminishing return approach is used for the determination of coagulant dose corresponding to toc total organic carbon doc dissolved organic carbon and uv254 ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm on average podr for uv254 was slightly greater than that of toc followed by that of doc the correlation between the input toc and podr values was in the order toc r2 0 84 uv254 r2 0 83 doc r2 0 65 the isotherms are analyzed by non linear error functions rmse root mean square error hybrid hybrid fractional error function are average relative error mpsd marquardt s percent standard deviation and chi square it was observed that error functions rmse hybrid and chi square can be successfully used for non linear analysis however are and mpsd cannot be used at low concentrations as they showed high residual values further image processing is used to analyze floc size and fractal dimension the interactions of species and the physical structure of flocs derived based on adsorption isotherms are corroborated by using the ftir data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment coagulation adsorption isotherms floc structure fractal dimension data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation is a process wherein the turbidity causing negatively charged organic and inorganic colloidal solids are removed by the addition of positively charged coagulants coagulation is being used extensively for water treatment as well as industrial wastewater treatment coagulation performance can be ascertained by an empirical approach such as assessing the solids removal efficiency mathematical approach such as adsorption isotherms and advanced analysis by microscopic approaches several isolated studies related to coagulation have been reported but a comprehensive layout of complete microscopic 1 3 macroscopic 4 6 and mathematical approaches 7 9 has not been elucidated in the literature from a practical point of view all three approaches are closely linked to each other which must be understood in detail for a better interpretation of coagulation performance the optimum coagulation doses have largely been evaluated either as optimum for turbidity removal i e conventional coagulation or as optimum for toc removal i e enhanced coagulation in previous research works a comparison between the optimum doses for conventional coagulation and enhanced coagulation has been largely done 10 however the usepa united states environmental protection agency defines podr point of diminishing returns as a criterion to evaluate optimum doses with respect to toc this was implemented to control the dbp disinfection by product formation by improving the enhanced coagulation efficiency the usepa defines the podr as the point where the slope of total organic carbon toc removal per coagulant dose reaches 0 03 mg c mg alum 11 this serves as a clear inflection or a pivotal point that the treatment plant operators can use to decide on further increment decrement in the coagulant dose 12 however the same needs to be evaluated for other quantitative parameters also such as doc dissolved organic carbon and uv254 ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and other coagulants than alum a much more detailed perspective is needed to critically evaluate and further enhance the performance of coagulation flocculation by choosing a methodical approach apart from the coagulant dose the coagulation performance is essentially dependent on the settling characteristics of flocs which are affected by floc morphology the formation of flocs depends upon the reactor hydrodynamics and the interaction of coagulants and impurities 13 such interactions decide the shape compactness and density of flocs mathematical models such as the adsorption isotherms have been used to evaluate the type of interactions taking place between the impurities and coagulants further empirical models have also been developed to include the effect of reactor geometry in floc formation the interactions that take place in a hetero dispersed system can also be supported by using ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by evaluating the nature of functional groups before and after the coagulation moreover to physically substantiate the floc structure image analysis has emerged as a tool to evaluate the size and compactness of flocs by calculating fractal dimensions therefore a hierarchy has to be set for a comprehensive analysis of coagulation system performance the tools for coagulation performance analysis involve various analytical spectroscopic and microscopic tools which are not devoid of errors hence an idea of sources of errors is important largely the dose of coagulant is increased in stoichiometric ratios with the incoming turbidity however the contaminants may have adsorption sites so that they can adsorb other smaller contaminants which may have affinity due to physical or chemical adsorption such interactions have the potential to bring down the coagulant demand thus it is important to evaluate the presence of particle particle interactions for evaluating the coagulant dose and efficiency by modelling such interactions for modelling coagulation data isotherms such as langmuir freundlich bet brunauer emmett teller and temkin isotherms have been used largely the use of non linear modelling is advantageous over linear modelling however the choice of error functions in non linear modelling may lead to varying results as a number of error functions are available 14 the findings of these theoretical models can be furthered by ftir data for heterogeneous suspensions having dissolved organic matter dom along with turbidity the organics are not only neutralized by the coagulant but the organics may also get adsorbed onto the inorganic turbidity the organics further consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions ftir analysis can be used as qualitative and semi quantitative analysis to ascertain the presence and removal of various fractions of dom the presence of dom can result in changes in floc size and compactness such changes can be evaluated by image analysis of flocs in our previous work we have mentioned the bench scale doses for conventional coagulation and enhanced coagulation and subsequent doses for optimized coagulation 10 we have also elucidated the linear modelling for optimized coagulation data 15 the performance of pilot scale reactor and the impact of scale up on coagulation efficiency 16 coagulation modelling using a surface coverage hydraulic flocculation model 13 and floc properties 3 often the standalone studies based on the evaluation of particular aspects of coagulation i e removal efficiency dose calculation or mathematical modelling may not include a comprehensive evaluation of the system as a whole therefore the adoption of the right sequence of methodologies for the evaluation of coagulation system performance needs to be given due consideration as numerous parameters have been used to identify coagulation performance therefore the applicability of parameters solely and in combined form has been discussed in this work to enunciate their utility to judge coagulation performance the objective of this work is to streamline macroscopic and microscopic approaches for corroborating the findings of experimental results obtained from the batch mode coagulation process the sequence of the comprehensive methodology includes evaluation of coagulant dose by podr method evaluation of process efficiency isotherm modelling by using non linear error functions advanced analysis by ftir spectroscopy and image analysis for determination of floc properties 2 materials and method in this work simulated sample waters are prepared by using humic acid and kaolin to simulate organic matter and inorganic turbidity respectively the coagulation studies are performed using jar test apparatus a number of parameters affect coagulation bulk water parameters such as ph alkalinity turbidity temperature ionic strength and nom natural organic matter concentration coagulant characteristics such as type dose and basicity value of coagulant hydraulic parameters such as g value velocity gradient and mixing conditions and nom characteristics such as hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio the important analytical procedures relevant to this study are described in this section 2 1 preparation of sample simulated waters having alkaline ph and containing both inorganic turbidity and organics were prepared for bench scale coagulation to closely simulate surface water the synthetic test suspensions were prepared in the laboratory using tap water and adding humic acid for organic impurity and kaolin clay for inorganic impurity the characteristics of suspensions are shown in table 1 to simulate organics humic acid merck was used having chemical formula c187h186o89n9s1 and molecular weight varying from 1 kda kilo daltons to 1000 kda the humic acid stock solution was prepared by adding 1 5 g of powdered humic acid and 0 01 m naoh to 1 l of deionized water the solution was stirred for 5 h to completely dissolve the humic acid the toc and doc of the resulting solution were 736 9 mg l and 651 1 mg l respectively to simulate turbidity a stock kaolin suspension was prepared using powdered kaolin merck having chemical formula al2si2o5 oh 4 and molecular weight of 258 16 g mol 1 g of powdered kaolin in 1 l of water generated turbidity of 6 ntu the suspensions were diluted and mixed to make 29 different suspensions with toc varying from 0 to 10 mg l 0 2 4 6 8 10 mg l and turbidity varying from 0 to 20 ntu 0 5 10 15 20 ntu 2 2 bench scale study and dosing approach the bench scale experiments were performed using jar test apparatus the volume of each jar was 1 l and 500 ml of sample was taken in each jar poly aluminium chloride which is a pre hydrolyzed coagulant was used to coagulate the organic and inorganic impurities the coagulant was added to each of the jars using a micropipette after that rapid mixing was performed at 150 rpm g 360 s 1 for 1 to 2 min and slow mixing was performed at 30 rpm for 20 min to give a velocity gradient value of 30 s 1 when the slow mixing was completed the samples in the jar were allowed to settle under quiescent conditions for 30 min after settling the supernatant was pipetted out for further analysis for determining efficient coagulation conditions the optimum doses of pre hydrolyzed polyaluminium chloride pacl have been evaluated by using the concept of podr point of diminishing return for toc doc and uv254 the podr method is used for determining the optimum doses specifically for enhanced coagulation enhanced coagulation aims to optimize the removal of organics the common indicators used to quantify organics are total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 hence podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are evaluated to determine the optimum doses for toc doc and uv254 removal respectively the podr is the point where the slope of toc doc or uv254 removal per coagulant dose reaches 0 03 the removal ratio is plotted on the y axis and stoichiometric dose al toc or al doc or al uv254 is plotted on the x axis the point on the x axis corresponding to the slope of 0 03 is used to evaluate the optimum dose 2 3 isotherm modelling and error functions isotherm equations have been largely used for studying the adsorption nature of pollutants on the adsorbent media for e g adsorption of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater 17 18 this particular technique has also been utilized for studying coagulation data using the classical as well as modified isotherm models 19 20 as compared to the modified and complex adsorption models the classical adsorption models have shown certain advantages because of their simplicity and requirement of fewer parameters for gaining an adequate fit 14 several isotherms have been used to understand the adsorption of impurities on the adsorbents isotherms can be modelled linearly as well as non linearly the conversion of isotherms to a linear form for linear modelling introduces errors the most common indicator to evaluate the linear fit is r2 or the coefficient of determination on the contrary non linear modelling doesn t change the form of the equation and error functions are used to evaluate the non linear fit a number of error functions are available therefore it is crucial to determine the most appropriate error function to be used for a particular system the langmuir bet freundlich and temkin isotherms are the most commonly used isotherms for coagulation flocculation which are used in this study as shown in table 2 the error functions utilized for the non linear modelling are rmse root mean square error hybrid are average relative error chi square test mpsd marquardt s percent standard deviation 2 4 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy offers an empirical tool in addition to the mathematical tool i e adsorption isotherms ftir can serve as a basis to understand the selectivity of coagulants to bond or interact with certain kinds of impurities and could be helpful in the development of coagulants to target specific impurities the ftir spectrum of the raw water and the coagulated water can be compared to evaluate the interactions that occur after the addition of the coagulant the fingerprint region in infrared spectroscopy provides valuable information regarding the composition of the sample by determining the functional groups present in the samples ftir spectrophotometer was used for the analysis over a spectral wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the sample waters humic acid stock solution kaolin stock suspension mixed humic acid and kaolin stock and treated waters were analyzed for the presence of various chemical bonds by using ftir spectroscopy spectrophotometer perkin elmer spectrum version 10 4 00 the removal mechanisms as well as the subtle interactions of the organic and inorganic impurities can be supported by ftir data showing corresponding to various bonds and or functional groups 2 5 image analysis using microscopy in addition to the mathematical tool isotherm modelling and empirical tool ftir spectroscopy the visualization of flocs by the physical tools of image analysis offers additional insights to evaluate floc compactness and structure the fractal nature of flocs has much to tell about the coagulation flocculation efficiency a combination of a microscope mounted with a camera was used to take the images of flocs the images were further processed using open source software imagej the images were converted into binary form and the background noise and outliers were removed then the box counting method was used to evaluate the 2 d fractal dimensions the images of the flocs after slow mixing were further analyzed for size and fractal dimension the fractal dimension of the flocs can range from 1 to 2 a higher fractal dimension implies more compact flocs the method for determination of floc properties by image analysis is shown in brief in figs 1 and 2 2 6 analytical procedures the shimadzu toc l analyser was used for measuring toc and doc the shimadzu toc l comes with intrinsic acidification and sparging systems for liberating the inorganic carbon it uses the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method apha 5310 b for converting the organically bound carbon to co2 the doc and uv254 were measured using shimadzu toc l after filtering the sample with 0 45 μm filter paper by using a syringe filtration assembly 21 22 the suva specific ultraviolet absorbance is one way to characterize the nature of nom based on measurements of uv254 and doc it is the ratio of uv254 and doc multiplied by 100 for waters with suva 2 nom will have little effect on the coagulant dose for waters with suva 2 5 the amount of nom typically exerts a greater coagulant demand 5 turbidity was analyzed using a nephelometer lutron tu 2016 23 24 the zeta potential and particle size of the untreated simulated water and the treated supernatant after coagulation were analyzed using a zetasizer version 7 11 malvern instruments u k 25 the dynamic light scattering technique was employed for determining the zeta potential and particle size distribution of colloids present in the solutions the common sources of errors for some of the methodologies are shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 treated water quality the simulated samples waters prepared using humic acid and kaolin were treated by pacl as the coagulant by using a jar test apparatus the characteristics of the treated water at optimized doses are summarised in table 4 3 2 dosing approach the podr method is used for determining the optimum doses specifically for enhanced coagulation podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are evaluated to determine the optimum doses for toc doc and uv254 removal respectively the trends of the podr values with increasing input toc are shown in fig 3 the r2 values for podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are 0 84 0 65 and 0 83 respectively among the three podr values the r2 value is almost similar for podr toc and podr uv254 and is the least for podr doc this shows that the doses for doc removal are not much dependent on input toc and the removal mechanisms are quite certainly different from toc and uv254 the removal of toc and uv254 is more dependent on the input toc than doc the suva values of the untreated sample waters were 4 which implies the presence of hydrophobic organic fraction after the treatment the suva values were in the range of 1 5 2 5 indicating considerable removal of the hydrophobic organic fraction this suggests that optimizing the doses with toc or uv254 is a better option among the three in fig 4a the impact of input turbidity for podr toc is more pronounced at higher input turbidity i e 20 ntu the average podr toc for input toc 2 10 mg l was 3 76 2 93 2 80 3 0 and 3 19 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively in fig 4b the impact of the input turbidity for podr doc is pronounced at all the levels of turbidity which is shown by the scattering of the points of different turbidity and the impact is even more pronounced at higher turbidity only at an input toc of 6 mg l the impact of turbidity is low the impact of input turbidity was least on the podr uv254 as shown in fig 4c the average podr uv254 for input toc 2 10 mg l was 3 86 3 02 2 83 3 15 and 3 20 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively this suggests that interparticle interactions due to the presence of turbidity have a key role to play in the removal of doc the average podr doc for input toc 2 10 mg l was 4 46 3 18 3 18 3 08 and 2 92 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively the input turbidity values did not show much impact on the podr toc and podr uv254 in fig 5 the trends of doses with increasing turbidity are shown the addition of turbidity certainly reduced the doses when the turbidity was 0 the doses were higher and relatively higher for podr doc in heterogeneous suspensions as the floc growth progresses the cluster cluster aggregation becomes important for the development of flocs the pacl particles are adsorbed onto the kaolin clay particles and the organic particles are also adsorbed onto the pacl particles the flocs formed by kaolin are generally more spread and loosely bound and not compact whereas the flocs of humic acid form small clusters the small humic acid pacl compact clusters penetrate the inner pores of larger kaolin pacl clusters thus resulting in improved removal efficiency due to the compactness of flocs 26 a further increment in turbidity values from 5 to 10 ntu does not show much impact i e the doses are almost similar for 5 10 15 and 20 ntu hence the role of turbidity is important for doc removal therefore it can be concluded that the impact of the increase in input toc increases the podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 however the increase in turbidity from 0 to 5 ntu offers a reduction in the podr values but a further increase in turbidity does not lead to any more reduction in the doses if the trends of doc and uv254 had been similar then it could have been said that the removal is primarily of the hydrophobic portion of the doc which is represented by the uv254 fraction but the podr doc has shown a different trend from podr uv254 which indicates the removal of hydrophilic fraction also the synergisms of organic matter and turbidity have a role to play in the removal of organic matter which could be both hydrophobic fractions represented by uv254 of the doc as well as some hydrophilic portion of doc the residual turbidity ranged from 0 09 to 0 78 ntu the residual toc ranged from 0 75 to 2 mg l and the residual doc ranged from 0 5 to 1 4 mg l at optimum doses 3 3 non linear analysis of isotherm models the coagulation performance can be linked to the mechanisms by analyzing the adsorption isotherms linear as well as non linear methods can be used to analyze adsorption isotherms the non linear analysis is the preferred method of analysis when the non linear equations are transformed into linear ones then the error distribution is changed similarly the error structure of adsorption isotherms is also transformed when the isotherms are transformed from linear to non linear forms the non linear error functions try to minimize the distribution of error between the experimental data and predicted data therefore the non linear regression analysis of error functions is advantageous to be used over the linear analysis of adsorption isotherms 27 29 in this study the adsorption isotherms such as langmuir freundlich bet and temkin are used to model the adsorption data which have been commonly used for isotherm modelling in water wastewater treatment 30 further for non linear modelling of each isotherm the error functions were used namely rmse hybrid are chi square and mpsd the absolute residual values of error functions were in the order rmse mpsd chi square are hybrid the values of the error functions i e rmse hybrid are chi square and mpsd for various isotherms are shown in tables 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the disadvantages of applying the sum of square errors sse are that when the concentration is higher the squares of error increase this provides a good match most often and the best value when we get close to zero the lower the residual values the better the applicability of the error function 30 although the residual values for mpsd were the second lowest the trend was not similar to rmse or either of the error functions the trends of chi square are and hybrid were similar to rmse despite their higher residual values the error function values indicated the presence of temkin and bet models suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate adsorbate interactions the outcomes of this non linear modelling can be furthered by confirming the interactions by using ftir spectroscopy 3 4 ftir analysis the isotherm modelling suggested the presence of indirect adsorbate adsorbate interactions by the presence of temkin isotherm and multilayer adsorption by bet isotherm the presence of such interactions can be supported by using the ftir data which gives the wavenumber corresponding to the bonds present in a compound floc characterization using ftir has also been performed in other coagulation studies 31 a description of common functional groups and their respective wavenumber derived by ftir is shown in table 10 the ftir spectrum of the separate humic acid solution and separate kaolin suspension was generated also both the solutions were mixed and again the ftir spectrum was derived for the mixed suspension further the ftir spectrum of the flocs was also generated to understand the removal mechanisms the aromatic peaks were present in the stock solution of humic acid corresponding to 2928 and 1579 cm 1 when turbid suspension containing kaolin clay was mixed with the humic stock solution the aromatic peaks in the mixed suspension were absent this indicates the possibility of interactions between the unsaturated bonds of aromatic organics and kaolin clay the kaolin contains sio bonds which may further react with unsaturated bonds of the organic matter the presence of peaks at 1097 1116 and 1068 cm 1 corresponds to the sioc bond in the mixed suspension the presence of peaks at 1430 and 1110 cm 1 corresponds to the si benzene ring bond further the presence of more aliphatic peaks and fewer aromatic peaks in the treated suspension indicated the removal of aromatic organic compounds corresponding to the hydrophobic fraction of doc by coagulation the ftir spectrum showed the interactions of the unsaturated bonds of the functional groups of hydrophobic organic matter to inorganic clay were favored over that of hydrophilic organic matter resulting in agglomeration of humic acid in the absence of coagulant the presence of the aromatic hydrophobic fraction was confirmed in the settled floc by the peaks at 1595 and 1586 which represents the aromatic cc stretching which absorbs in the 1650 1430 cm 1 range the ftir spectrum is included in the appendix a figs 9 10 and 11 3 5 floc characterization by image analysis the sizes of primary particles amenable to be removed by coagulation typically range from 0 1 to 100 μm 34 coagulation flocculation can be considered as a two step process wherein the first step the primary particles are destabilized or coagulated by the coagulant to form micro flocs under rapid mixing conditions and in the second step the micro flocs are subjected to slow mixing conditions or flocculation to form larger flocs the efficient settling of such flocs formed after the flocculation step ensures the efficient working of subsequent treatment units particularly rapid sand filters in full scale water treatment plants 35 the floc sizes using image analysis have also been evaluated in other studies 36 37 the particle size before the coagulation and the growth of flocs during the process of coagulation are important tools for determining the floc size the isotherm modelling and ftir indicated the type of adsorption and interactions between the impurities i e kaolin clay and humic acid the furtherance of these possibilities can be provided through physical verification of the floc images the filamentous nature of the floc structure formed due to monolayer layer formation and compact structure formed through multilayer adsorption can be observed by image analysis the determination of the fractal dimension of the flocs has emerged as an important tool for evaluating the compactness of flocs image analysis can be used to analyze two dimensional floc size as well as the fractal dimension of the flocs the images of the flocs formed after coagulation flocculation are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the flocs formed when the turbidity was 20 ntu and toc was 0 fig 6b shows the flocs formed when turbidity was 20 ntu along with toc of 10 mg l the flocs formed by turbidity alone are larger than those formed by turbidity and toc together the presence of toc results in the formation of compact and smaller flocs the presence of turbidity and toc together results in synergistic effects as shown by isotherm modelling and ftir and their interactions result in smaller and more compact floc formation the floc sizes are significantly influenced by the type of impurities present in the raw water the two dimensional fractal dimensions were analyzed using the image analysis and box counting method the fractal dimension of the flocs ranged from 1 11 to 1 46 the fractal dimension of the flocs formed after the slow mix in jar test was seen to be decreasing with increasing input toc indicating the formation of compact flocs with increasing input toc a comprehensive analysis of the flocs size and fractal dimension suggests that the cluster cluster aggregation results in floc development wherein the small clusters of humic acid pacl get embedded into pores of large clusters of kaolin pacl thus the presence of a sufficient amount of turbidity enhances the coagulation of organics which reduces the coagulant demand 3 6 zeta potential and suva the charge characteristics of colloids can be efficiently evaluated by the zeta potential the coagulation efficiency is directly dependent on the reduction of the negative charge of the colloids by neutralizing them with positively charged coagulants the zeta potential of the treated water can be analyzed to ascertain the reduction in the negative charge the zeta potential of the untreated simulated suspensions ranged from 7 63 to 18 0 mv the initial ph of the synthetic test waters was on the alkaline side 8 14 8 45 the alkalinity after coagulation dropped and remained between 140 and 190 mg l as caco3 the suva values were 4 for all the simulated waters further the presence of residual doc and uv254 can be correlated with zeta potential to determine the major charge contributing fractions of the organic matter i e hydrophobic or hydrophilic fractions in the treated water the presence of hydrophilic or hydrophobic fraction can be analyzed by another important parameter suva specific uv absorbance which defines the treatability of organics by coagulation the value of suva has been proven to be a good indicator for providing information about the distribution of nom as hydrophobic hydrophilic and the treatability by coagulation and flocculation the hydrophobic and the high molecular weight fraction show higher suva values conforming to the presence of higher content of aromatic structures probably humic substances than the hydrophilics 38 39 suva has also been used to correlate the aromatic content of nom and dbp formation potential 40 for waters with low suva 2 nom will have little effect on the coagulant dose for waters with suva 2 5 the amount of nom typically exerts a greater coagulant demand than the number of particles 5 the zeta potential and suva specific uv absorbance values at the optimized conditions higher of the dose out of podr toc podr doc podr uv and the trends with increasing input toc are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the zeta potential of the treated water varied from 7 to 17 mv indicating incomplete charge neutralization of the suspended impurities only a few hydrophilic impurities could be possibly neutralized the removal of doc via coagulation processes is generally expected for source water with suva values 4 0 l mg m 41 in the present study the suva values of the untreated sample waters were 4 after the treatment the suva values were in the range of 1 5 2 5 indicating the removal of the hydrophobic fraction the zeta potential did not show any trend with the input toc or turbidity since uv254 removal was very efficient and the suva values were 1 5 2 the hydrophilic doc was responsible for the charge of water further as the reduction in the value of the zeta potential and hydrophilic doc removal was not very significant therefore it can be fairly said that the presence of residual doc contributed to the charge of the treated water previous studies have shown that doc removal correlates with zeta potential and charge neutralization is the dominant removal mechanism for doc removal 31 4 conclusion in nutshell this study provides insights to streamline the methods for analyzing coagulation performance i e dose optimization by analysis of turbidity toc doc and uv254 removal isotherm modelling floc characterization by image analysis and analysis of charge character of water by zeta potential this research concludes that dose optimization for coagulation is an exemplary art that has always and will always be an imperative part of process optimization it is important to note here that the stoichiometric approach is not always appropriate to scale the doses according to the input concentration of the impurities the dose requirement for hydrophobics removal increases linearly with increasing input toc and uv254 could also be used as an indicator to ascertain optimum coagulation doses the synergisms of organic matter and turbidity have a role to play in the removal of organic matter which could be both hydrophobic fractions represented by uv254 of the doc as well as some hydrophilic portion of doc the lower error function values indicated the presence of the temkin and bet model suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate adsorbate interactions it was observed that the error functions rmse hybrid and chi square can be successfully used for the non linear analysis however are and mpsd cannot be used at low concentrations as they showed excessively high residual values the ftir data suggested the presence of majorly hydrophobics in the untreated water and sharp peaks of hydrophilics in the treated water also the sic bonds corresponding to the interaction of si of kaolin clay and c of the humic acid dom were observed suggesting the possibility of adsorbate adsorbate interactions which was also corroborated by the isotherm data the reduction in the value of the zeta potential and hydrophilic doc removal was not very significant after coagulation therefore it can be fairly said that the presence of residual doc contributed to the charge of the treated water a number of methodologies are available the findings of one method may not be sufficient to derive concrete conclusions hence it is crucial to corroborate the findings of the macroscopic techniques with microscopic and advanced techniques and vice versa to summarize this research accentuates the importance of comprehending the source water quality to ensure the selection of a congruous methodology also the physical and chemical properties of flocs formed in the process are an important tool for the selection of doses further for understanding the underlying subtle and nuanced implications of reactor hydrodynamics and particle particle interactions modelling of experimental data has proven out be an effective tool that provides a transition between the experimental results and theoretical cognizance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12530,isolated studies for the evaluation of coagulation considering either microscopic or macroscopic dimensions have largely been discussed however comprehensive analysis of coagulation including various dimensions is imperative to design an optimal coagulation system in this work a comprehensive methodology has been described which includes dosing approach mathematical modelling chemical analysis by ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy image analysis for floc properties and various analytical procedures jar tests were performed on simulated waters containing humic acid and kaolin using high basicity pacl poly aluminium chloride a podr point of diminishing return approach is used for the determination of coagulant dose corresponding to toc total organic carbon doc dissolved organic carbon and uv254 ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm on average podr for uv254 was slightly greater than that of toc followed by that of doc the correlation between the input toc and

and the physical structure of flocs derived based on adsorption isotherms are corroborated by using the ftir data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment coagulation adsorption isotherms floc structure fractal dimension data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation is a process wherein the turbidity causing negatively charged organic and inorganic colloidal solids are removed by the addition of positively charged coagulants coagulation is being used extensively for water treatment as well as industrial wastewater treatment coagulation performance can be ascertained by an empirical approach such as assessing the solids removal efficiency mathematical approach such as adsorption isotherms and advanced analysis by microscopic approaches several isolated studies related to coagulation have been reported but a comprehensive layout of complete microscopic 1 3 macroscopic 4 6 and mathematical approaches 7 9 has not been elucidated in the literature from a practical point of view all three approaches are closely linked to each other which must be understood in detail for a better interpretation of coagulation performance the optimum coagulation doses have largely been evaluated either as optimum for turbidity removal i e conventional coagulation or as optimum for toc removal i e enhanced coagulation in previous research works a comparison between the optimum doses for conventional coagulation and enhanced coagulation has been largely done 10 however the usepa united states environmental protection agency defines podr point of diminishing returns as a criterion to evaluate optimum doses with respect to toc this was implemented to control the dbp disinfection by product formation by improving the enhanced coagulation efficiency the usepa defines the podr as the point where the slope of total organic carbon toc removal per coagulant dose reaches 0 03 mg c mg alum 11 this serves as a clear inflection or a pivotal point that the treatment plant operators can use to decide on further increment decrement in the coagulant dose 12 however the same needs to be evaluated for other quantitative parameters also such as doc dissolved organic carbon and uv254 ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and other coagulants than alum a much more detailed perspective is needed to critically evaluate and further enhance the performance of coagulation flocculation by choosing a methodical approach apart from the coagulant dose the coagulation performance is essentially dependent on the settling characteristics of flocs which are affected by floc morphology the formation of flocs depends upon the reactor hydrodynamics and the interaction of coagulants and impurities 13 such interactions decide the shape compactness and density of flocs mathematical models such as the adsorption isotherms have been used to evaluate the type of interactions taking place between the impurities and coagulants further empirical models have also been developed to include the effect of reactor geometry in floc formation the interactions that take place in a hetero dispersed system can also be supported by using ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by evaluating the nature of functional groups before and after the coagulation moreover to physically substantiate the floc structure image analysis has emerged as a tool to evaluate the size and compactness of flocs by calculating fractal dimensions therefore a hierarchy has to be set for a comprehensive analysis of coagulation system performance the tools for coagulation performance analysis involve various analytical spectroscopic and microscopic tools which are not devoid of errors hence an idea of sources of errors is important largely the dose of coagulant is increased in stoichiometric ratios with the incoming turbidity however the contaminants may have adsorption sites so that they can adsorb other smaller contaminants which may have affinity due to physical or chemical adsorption such interactions have the potential to bring down the coagulant demand thus it is important to evaluate the presence of particle particle interactions for evaluating the coagulant dose and efficiency by modelling such interactions for modelling coagulation data isotherms such as langmuir freundlich bet brunauer emmett teller and temkin isotherms have been used largely the use of non linear modelling is advantageous over linear modelling however the choice of error functions in non linear modelling may lead to varying results as a number of error functions are available 14 the findings of these theoretical models can be furthered by ftir data for heterogeneous suspensions having dissolved organic matter dom along with turbidity the organics are not only neutralized by the coagulant but the organics may also get adsorbed onto the inorganic turbidity the organics further consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions ftir analysis can be used as qualitative and semi quantitative analysis to ascertain the presence and removal of various fractions of dom the presence of dom can result in changes in floc size and compactness such changes can be evaluated by image analysis of flocs in our previous work we have mentioned the bench scale doses for conventional coagulation and enhanced coagulation and subsequent doses for optimized coagulation 10 we have also elucidated the linear modelling for optimized coagulation data 15 the performance of pilot scale reactor and the impact of scale up on coagulation efficiency 16 coagulation modelling using a surface coverage hydraulic flocculation model 13 and floc properties 3 often the standalone studies based on the evaluation of particular aspects of coagulation i e removal efficiency dose calculation or mathematical modelling may not include a comprehensive evaluation of the system as a whole therefore the adoption of the right sequence of methodologies for the evaluation of coagulation system performance needs to be given due consideration as numerous parameters have been used to identify coagulation performance therefore the applicability of parameters solely and in combined form has been discussed in this work to enunciate their utility to judge coagulation performance the objective of this work is to streamline macroscopic and microscopic approaches for corroborating the findings of experimental results obtained from the batch mode coagulation process the sequence of the comprehensive methodology includes evaluation of coagulant dose by podr method evaluation of process efficiency isotherm modelling by using non linear error functions advanced analysis by ftir spectroscopy and image analysis for determination of floc properties 2 materials and method in this work simulated sample waters are prepared by using humic acid and kaolin to simulate organic matter and inorganic turbidity respectively the coagulation studies are performed using jar test apparatus a number of parameters affect coagulation bulk water parameters such as ph alkalinity turbidity temperature ionic strength and nom natural organic matter concentration coagulant characteristics such as type dose and basicity value of coagulant hydraulic parameters such as g value velocity gradient and mixing conditions and nom characteristics such as hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio the important analytical procedures relevant to this study are described in this section 2 1 preparation of sample simulated waters having alkaline ph and containing both inorganic turbidity and organics were prepared for bench scale coagulation to closely simulate surface water the synthetic test suspensions were prepared in the laboratory using tap water and adding humic acid for organic impurity and kaolin clay for inorganic impurity the characteristics of suspensions are shown in table 1 to simulate organics humic acid merck was used having chemical formula c187h186o89n9s1 and molecular weight varying from 1 kda kilo daltons to 1000 kda the humic acid stock solution was prepared by adding 1 5 g of powdered humic acid and 0 01 m naoh to 1 l of deionized water the solution was stirred for 5 h to completely dissolve the humic acid the toc and doc of the resulting solution were 736 9 mg l and 651 1 mg l respectively to simulate turbidity a stock kaolin suspension was prepared using powdered kaolin merck having chemical formula al2si2o5 oh 4 and molecular weight of 258 16 g mol 1 g of powdered kaolin in 1 l of water generated turbidity of 6 ntu the suspensions were diluted and mixed to make 29 different suspensions with toc varying from 0 to 10 mg l 0 2 4 6 8 10 mg l and turbidity varying from 0 to 20 ntu 0 5 10 15 20 ntu 2 2 bench scale study and dosing approach the bench scale experiments were performed using jar test apparatus the volume of each jar was 1 l and 500 ml of sample was taken in each jar poly aluminium chloride which is a pre hydrolyzed coagulant was used to coagulate the organic and inorganic impurities the coagulant was added to each of the jars using a micropipette after that rapid mixing was performed at 150 rpm g 360 s 1 for 1 to 2 min and slow mixing was performed at 30 rpm for 20 min to give a velocity gradient value of 30 s 1 when the slow mixing was completed the samples in the jar were allowed to settle under quiescent conditions for 30 min after settling the supernatant was pipetted out for further analysis for determining efficient coagulation conditions the optimum doses of pre hydrolyzed polyaluminium chloride pacl have been evaluated by using the concept of podr point of diminishing return for toc doc and uv254 the podr method is used for determining the optimum doses specifically for enhanced coagulation enhanced coagulation aims to optimize the removal of organics the common indicators used to quantify organics are total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 hence podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are evaluated to determine the optimum doses for toc doc and uv254 removal respectively the podr is the point where the slope of toc doc or uv254 removal per coagulant dose reaches 0 03 the removal ratio is plotted on the y axis and stoichiometric dose al toc or al doc or al uv254 is plotted on the x axis the point on the x axis corresponding to the slope of 0 03 is used to evaluate the optimum dose 2 3 isotherm modelling and error functions isotherm equations have been largely used for studying the adsorption nature of pollutants on the adsorbent media for e g adsorption of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater 17 18 this particular technique has also been utilized for studying coagulation data using the classical as well as modified isotherm models 19 20 as compared to the modified and complex adsorption models the classical adsorption models have shown certain advantages because of their simplicity and requirement of fewer parameters for gaining an adequate fit 14 several isotherms have been used to understand the adsorption of impurities on the adsorbents isotherms can be modelled linearly as well as non linearly the conversion of isotherms to a linear form for linear modelling introduces errors the most common indicator to evaluate the linear fit is r2 or the coefficient of determination on the contrary non linear modelling doesn t change the form of the equation and error functions are used to evaluate the non linear fit a number of error functions are available therefore it is crucial to determine the most appropriate error function to be used for a particular system the langmuir bet freundlich and temkin isotherms are the most commonly used isotherms for coagulation flocculation which are used in this study as shown in table 2 the error functions utilized for the non linear modelling are rmse root mean square error hybrid are average relative error chi square test mpsd marquardt s percent standard deviation 2 4 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy offers an empirical tool in addition to the mathematical tool i e adsorption isotherms ftir can serve as a basis to understand the selectivity of coagulants to bond or interact with certain kinds of impurities and could be helpful in the development of coagulants to target specific impurities the ftir spectrum of the raw water and the coagulated water can be compared to evaluate the interactions that occur after the addition of the coagulant the fingerprint region in infrared spectroscopy provides valuable information regarding the composition of the sample by determining the functional groups present in the samples ftir spectrophotometer was used for the analysis over a spectral wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the sample waters humic acid stock solution kaolin stock suspension mixed humic acid and kaolin stock and treated waters were analyzed for the presence of various chemical bonds by using ftir spectroscopy spectrophotometer perkin elmer spectrum version 10 4 00 the removal mechanisms as well as the subtle interactions of the organic and inorganic impurities can be supported by ftir data showing corresponding to various bonds and or functional groups 2 5 image analysis using microscopy in addition to the mathematical tool isotherm modelling and empirical tool ftir spectroscopy the visualization of flocs by the physical tools of image analysis offers additional insights to evaluate floc compactness and structure the fractal nature of flocs has much to tell about the coagulation flocculation efficiency a combination of a microscope mounted with a camera was used to take the images of flocs the images were further processed using open source software imagej the images were converted into binary form and the background noise and outliers were removed then the box counting method was used to evaluate the 2 d fractal dimensions the images of the flocs after slow mixing were further analyzed for size and fractal dimension the fractal dimension of the flocs can range from 1 to 2 a higher fractal dimension implies more compact flocs the method for determination of floc properties by image analysis is shown in brief in figs 1 and 2 2 6 analytical procedures the shimadzu toc l analyser was used for measuring toc and doc the shimadzu toc l comes with intrinsic acidification and sparging systems for liberating the inorganic carbon it uses the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method apha 5310 b for converting the organically bound carbon to co2 the doc and uv254 were measured using shimadzu toc l after filtering the sample with 0 45 μm filter paper by using a syringe filtration assembly 21 22 the suva specific ultraviolet absorbance is one way to characterize the nature of nom based on measurements of uv254 and doc it is the ratio of uv254 and doc multiplied by 100 for waters with suva 2 nom will have little effect on the coagulant dose for waters with suva 2 5 the amount of nom typically exerts a greater coagulant demand 5 turbidity was analyzed using a nephelometer lutron tu 2016 23 24 the zeta potential and particle size of the untreated simulated water and the treated supernatant after coagulation were analyzed using a zetasizer version 7 11 malvern instruments u k 25 the dynamic light scattering technique was employed for determining the zeta potential and particle size distribution of colloids present in the solutions the common sources of errors for some of the methodologies are shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 treated water quality the simulated samples waters prepared using humic acid and kaolin were treated by pacl as the coagulant by using a jar test apparatus the characteristics of the treated water at optimized doses are summarised in table 4 3 2 dosing approach the podr method is used for determining the optimum doses specifically for enhanced coagulation podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are evaluated to determine the optimum doses for toc doc and uv254 removal respectively the trends of the podr values with increasing input toc are shown in fig 3 the r2 values for podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 are 0 84 0 65 and 0 83 respectively among the three podr values the r2 value is almost similar for podr toc and podr uv254 and is the least for podr doc this shows that the doses for doc removal are not much dependent on input toc and the removal mechanisms are quite certainly different from toc and uv254 the removal of toc and uv254 is more dependent on the input toc than doc the suva values of the untreated sample waters were 4 which implies the presence of hydrophobic organic fraction after the treatment the suva values were in the range of 1 5 2 5 indicating considerable removal of the hydrophobic organic fraction this suggests that optimizing the doses with toc or uv254 is a better option among the three in fig 4a the impact of input turbidity for podr toc is more pronounced at higher input turbidity i e 20 ntu the average podr toc for input toc 2 10 mg l was 3 76 2 93 2 80 3 0 and 3 19 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively in fig 4b the impact of the input turbidity for podr doc is pronounced at all the levels of turbidity which is shown by the scattering of the points of different turbidity and the impact is even more pronounced at higher turbidity only at an input toc of 6 mg l the impact of turbidity is low the impact of input turbidity was least on the podr uv254 as shown in fig 4c the average podr uv254 for input toc 2 10 mg l was 3 86 3 02 2 83 3 15 and 3 20 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively this suggests that interparticle interactions due to the presence of turbidity have a key role to play in the removal of doc the average podr doc for input toc 2 10 mg l was 4 46 3 18 3 18 3 08 and 2 92 at 0 5 10 15 and 20 ntu respectively the input turbidity values did not show much impact on the podr toc and podr uv254 in fig 5 the trends of doses with increasing turbidity are shown the addition of turbidity certainly reduced the doses when the turbidity was 0 the doses were higher and relatively higher for podr doc in heterogeneous suspensions as the floc growth progresses the cluster cluster aggregation becomes important for the development of flocs the pacl particles are adsorbed onto the kaolin clay particles and the organic particles are also adsorbed onto the pacl particles the flocs formed by kaolin are generally more spread and loosely bound and not compact whereas the flocs of humic acid form small clusters the small humic acid pacl compact clusters penetrate the inner pores of larger kaolin pacl clusters thus resulting in improved removal efficiency due to the compactness of flocs 26 a further increment in turbidity values from 5 to 10 ntu does not show much impact i e the doses are almost similar for 5 10 15 and 20 ntu hence the role of turbidity is important for doc removal therefore it can be concluded that the impact of the increase in input toc increases the podr toc podr doc and podr uv254 however the increase in turbidity from 0 to 5 ntu offers a reduction in the podr values but a further increase in turbidity does not lead to any more reduction in the doses if the trends of doc and uv254 had been similar then it could have been said that the removal is primarily of the hydrophobic portion of the doc which is represented by the uv254 fraction but the podr doc has shown a different trend from podr uv254 which indicates the removal of hydrophilic fraction also the synergisms of organic matter and turbidity have a role to play in the removal of organic matter which could be both hydrophobic fractions represented by uv254 of the doc as well as some hydrophilic portion of doc the residual turbidity ranged from 0 09 to 0 78 ntu the residual toc ranged from 0 75 to 2 mg l and the residual doc ranged from 0 5 to 1 4 mg l at optimum doses 3 3 non linear analysis of isotherm models the coagulation performance can be linked to the mechanisms by analyzing the adsorption isotherms linear as well as non linear methods can be used to analyze adsorption isotherms the non linear analysis is the preferred method of analysis when the non linear equations are transformed into linear ones then the error distribution is changed similarly the error structure of adsorption isotherms is also transformed when the isotherms are transformed from linear to non linear forms the non linear error functions try to minimize the distribution of error between the experimental data and predicted data therefore the non linear regression analysis of error functions is advantageous to be used over the linear analysis of adsorption isotherms 27 29 in this study the adsorption isotherms such as langmuir freundlich bet and temkin are used to model the adsorption data which have been commonly used for isotherm modelling in water wastewater treatment 30 further for non linear modelling of each isotherm the error functions were used namely rmse hybrid are chi square and mpsd the absolute residual values of error functions were in the order rmse mpsd chi square are hybrid the values of the error functions i e rmse hybrid are chi square and mpsd for various isotherms are shown in tables 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the disadvantages of applying the sum of square errors sse are that when the concentration is higher the squares of error increase this provides a good match most often and the best value when we get close to zero the lower the residual values the better the applicability of the error function 30 although the residual values for mpsd were the second lowest the trend was not similar to rmse or either of the error functions the trends of chi square are and hybrid were similar to rmse despite their higher residual values the error function values indicated the presence of temkin and bet models suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate adsorbate interactions the outcomes of this non linear modelling can be furthered by confirming the interactions by using ftir spectroscopy 3 4 ftir analysis the isotherm modelling suggested the presence of indirect adsorbate adsorbate interactions by the presence of temkin isotherm and multilayer adsorption by bet isotherm the presence of such interactions can be supported by using the ftir data which gives the wavenumber corresponding to the bonds present in a compound floc characterization using ftir has also been performed in other coagulation studies 31 a description of common functional groups and their respective wavenumber derived by ftir is shown in table 10 the ftir spectrum of the separate humic acid solution and separate kaolin suspension was generated also both the solutions were mixed and again the ftir spectrum was derived for the mixed suspension further the ftir spectrum of the flocs was also generated to understand the removal mechanisms the aromatic peaks were present in the stock solution of humic acid corresponding to 2928 and 1579 cm 1 when turbid suspension containing kaolin clay was mixed with the humic stock solution the aromatic peaks in the mixed suspension were absent this indicates the possibility of interactions between the unsaturated bonds of aromatic organics and kaolin clay the kaolin contains sio bonds which may further react with unsaturated bonds of the organic matter the presence of peaks at 1097 1116 and 1068 cm 1 corresponds to the sioc bond in the mixed suspension the presence of peaks at 1430 and 1110 cm 1 corresponds to the si benzene ring bond further the presence of more aliphatic peaks and fewer aromatic peaks in the treated suspension indicated the removal of aromatic organic compounds corresponding to the hydrophobic fraction of doc by coagulation the ftir spectrum showed the interactions of the unsaturated bonds of the functional groups of hydrophobic organic matter to inorganic clay were favored over that of hydrophilic organic matter resulting in agglomeration of humic acid in the absence of coagulant the presence of the aromatic hydrophobic fraction was confirmed in the settled floc by the peaks at 1595 and 1586 which represents the aromatic cc stretching which absorbs in the 1650 1430 cm 1 range the ftir spectrum is included in the appendix a figs 9 10 and 11 3 5 floc characterization by image analysis the sizes of primary particles amenable to be removed by coagulation typically range from 0 1 to 100 μm 34 coagulation flocculation can be considered as a two step process wherein the first step the primary particles are destabilized or coagulated by the coagulant to form micro flocs under rapid mixing conditions and in the second step the micro flocs are subjected to slow mixing conditions or flocculation to form larger flocs the efficient settling of such flocs formed after the flocculation step ensures the efficient working of subsequent treatment units particularly rapid sand filters in full scale water treatment plants 35 the floc sizes using image analysis have also been evaluated in other studies 36 37 the particle size before the coagulation and the growth of flocs during the process of coagulation are important tools for determining the floc size the isotherm modelling and ftir indicated the type of adsorption and interactions between the impurities i e kaolin clay and humic acid the furtherance of these possibilities can be provided through physical verification of the floc images the filamentous nature of the floc structure formed due to monolayer layer formation and compact structure formed through multilayer adsorption can be observed by image analysis the determination of the fractal dimension of the flocs has emerged as an important tool for evaluating the compactness of flocs image analysis can be used to analyze two dimensional floc size as well as the fractal dimension of the flocs the images of the flocs formed after coagulation flocculation are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the flocs formed when the turbidity was 20 ntu and toc was 0 fig 6b shows the flocs formed when turbidity was 20 ntu along with toc of 10 mg l the flocs formed by turbidity alone are larger than those formed by turbidity and toc together the presence of toc results in the formation of compact and smaller flocs the presence of turbidity and toc together results in synergistic effects as shown by isotherm modelling and ftir and their interactions result in smaller and more compact floc formation the floc sizes are significantly influenced by the type of impurities present in the raw water the two dimensional fractal dimensions were analyzed using the image analysis and box counting method the fractal dimension of the flocs ranged from 1 11 to 1 46 the fractal dimension of the flocs formed after the slow mix in jar test was seen to be decreasing with increasing input toc indicating the formation of compact flocs with increasing input toc a comprehensive analysis of the flocs size and fractal dimension suggests that the cluster cluster aggregation results in floc development wherein the small clusters of humic acid pacl get embedded into pores of large clusters of kaolin pacl thus the presence of a sufficient amount of turbidity enhances the coagulation of organics which reduces the coagulant demand 3 6 zeta potential and suva the charge characteristics of colloids can be efficiently evaluated by the zeta potential the coagulation efficiency is directly dependent on the reduction of the negative charge of the colloids by neutralizing them with positively charged coagulants the zeta potential of the treated water can be analyzed to ascertain the reduction in the negative charge the zeta potential of the untreated simulated suspensions ranged from 7 63 to 18 0 mv the initial ph of the synthetic test waters was on the alkaline side 8 14 8 45 the alkalinity after coagulation dropped and remained between 140 and 190 mg l as caco3 the suva values were 4 for all the simulated waters further the presence of residual doc and uv254 can be correlated with zeta potential to determine the major charge contributing fractions of the organic matter i e hydrophobic or hydrophilic fractions in the treated water the presence of hydrophilic or hydrophobic fraction can be analyzed by another important parameter suva specific uv absorbance which defines the treatability of organics by coagulation the value of suva has been proven to be a good indicator for providing information about the distribution of nom as hydrophobic hydrophilic and the treatability by coagulation and flocculation the hydrophobic and the high molecular weight fraction show higher suva values conforming to the presence of higher content of aromatic structures probably humic substances than the hydrophilics 38 39 suva has also been used to correlate the aromatic content of nom and dbp formation potential 40 for waters with low suva 2 nom will have little effect on the coagulant dose for waters with suva 2 5 the amount of nom typically exerts a greater coagulant demand than the number of particles 5 the zeta potential and suva specific uv absorbance values at the optimized conditions higher of the dose out of podr toc podr doc podr uv and the trends with increasing input toc are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the zeta potential of the treated water varied from 7 to 17 mv indicating incomplete charge neutralization of the suspended impurities only a few hydrophilic impurities could be possibly neutralized the removal of doc via coagulation processes is generally expected for source water with suva values 4 0 l mg m 41 in the present study the suva values of the untreated sample waters were 4 after the treatment the suva values were in the range of 1 5 2 5 indicating the removal of the hydrophobic fraction the zeta potential did not show any trend with the input toc or turbidity since uv254 removal was very efficient and the suva values were 1 5 2 the hydrophilic doc was responsible for the charge of water further as the reduction in the value of the zeta potential and hydrophilic doc removal was not very significant therefore it can be fairly said that the presence of residual doc contributed to the charge of the treated water previous studies have shown that doc removal correlates with zeta potential and charge neutralization is the dominant removal mechanism for doc removal 31 4 conclusion in nutshell this study provides insights to streamline the methods for analyzing coagulation performance i e dose optimization by analysis of turbidity toc doc and uv254 removal isotherm modelling floc characterization by image analysis and analysis of charge character of water by zeta potential this research concludes that dose optimization for coagulation is an exemplary art that has always and will always be an imperative part of process optimization it is important to note here that the stoichiometric approach is not always appropriate to scale the doses according to the input concentration of the impurities the dose requirement for hydrophobics removal increases linearly with increasing input toc and uv254 could also be used as an indicator to ascertain optimum coagulation doses the synergisms of organic matter and turbidity have a role to play in the removal of organic matter which could be both hydrophobic fractions represented by uv254 of the doc as well as some hydrophilic portion of doc the lower error function values indicated the presence of the temkin and bet model suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate adsorbate interactions it was observed that the error functions rmse hybrid and chi square can be successfully used for the non linear analysis however are and mpsd cannot be used at low concentrations as they showed excessively high residual values the ftir data suggested the presence of majorly hydrophobics in the untreated water and sharp peaks of hydrophilics in the treated water also the sic bonds corresponding to the interaction of si of kaolin clay and c of the humic acid dom were observed suggesting the possibility of adsorbate adsorbate interactions which was also corroborated by the isotherm data the reduction in the value of the zeta potential and hydrophilic doc removal was not very significant after coagulation therefore it can be fairly said that the presence of residual doc contributed to the charge of the treated water a number of methodologies are available the findings of one method may not be sufficient to derive concrete conclusions hence it is crucial to corroborate the findings of the macroscopic techniques with microscopic and advanced techniques and vice versa to summarize this research accentuates the importance of comprehending the source water quality to ensure the selection of a congruous methodology also the physical and chemical properties of flocs formed in the process are an important tool for the selection of doses further for understanding the underlying subtle and nuanced implications of reactor hydrodynamics and particle particle interactions modelling of experimental data has proven out be an effective tool that provides a transition between the experimental results and theoretical cognizance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a fig 9 ftir spectrum of humic acid stock suspension fig 9 fig 10 ftir spectrum of kaolin stock suspension fig 10 fig 11 ftir spectra of mixed kaolin

12531,high fat wastes are difficult to degrade and mineralize under biological methods it is imperative to identify suitable combinations of physicochemical and biological processes this study

dairy wastewater photocatalytic pretreatment anaerobic digestion reduced graphene oxide nano zerovalent iron data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the depletion of fossil fuel alarms the world about the need to depend on renewable energy resources and the adoption of energy efficient technologies 1 the energy generation from biogas technology may drastically rise since it has climatic benefits and efficient valorization of waste 2 according to world biogas association s report there was a 90 increase in global electricity production from biogas in just six years from 2010 to 2016 3 also the gaseous fuel produced through anaerobic digestion could be utilized for domestic fuel substitution in remote geographical areas where delivery of grid energy is uneconomical 4 biogas technology offers low carbon fuel and nutrient rich fertilizer by stabilizing the organic waste thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ghg from waste disposal sources 4 5 methane gas is a menace when present in the atmosphere as a potent ghg but it is also a good fuel with a heat value of 50 55 5 mj kg 6 dairy waste possesses a high potential to serve as a substrate for microbial metabolism and growth due to its rich composition containing proteins fats carbohydrates and other organic stabilizers 7 8 the improper management of these wastes may lead to uncontrolled evolution of intermediates and degradation products into the environment 9 studies reported that the biological treatment of dairy wastewater is cumbersome due to poorly soluble highly stable complex fat and lipid compounds 9 11 a layer of fat may act as a recalcitrant barrier between microbes and substrates reduce the mass transfer efficiency and cause clogging and floatation 8 12 this results in the extension of hydrolysis which is the major rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion 13 however these complex compounds contribute greatly to the total hydrocarbons in the waste and imparts good biomethane potential 14 15 pretreatment helps to increase the biodegradability of substrates by disrupting the recalcitrant linkages to form simpler molecules 16 ultrasound treatment 17 lipase hydrolysis for high fat wastewater 18 application of garbage enzymes 13 thermal and chemical coagulation treatments 19 are proven methods to improve the efficiency of biogas production pretreatment inactivated the resistive genes of pathogenic microbes and enhanced the concentration of proton donors rather than just improving the solubility and biodegradability 19 20 in a study peroxide oxidation showed better solid disintegration and benefitted in anaerobic digestion however it was not economically feasible to implement 21 the synergy of these enhancing mechanisms results in the acceleration of hydrolysis and acidogenesis and hence the lag time for methanogenesis would be reduced resulting in a high biogas yield from the process 22 photocatalysis is a rapid mineralization process to remove certain pharmaceutical compounds and nitrogen containing organics compared to biological methods 23 24 catalysts such as mno2 nanofibrous mesh go tio2 tio2 zno mg oh 2 were proved to be efficient in the removal of crystal violet amoxicillin and 1 4 dioxane respectively with catalyst dosages varying from 0 4 to 1 0 g l 1 table s1 25 27 but the factors such as the cost of catalysts and operation generation of toxic by products and high catalyst loading limit the applicability 28 30 a combination of photocatalysis and biological degradation may be beneficial compared to the efficiency and drawbacks of employing these depollution methods individually 31 32 table s2 presents few examples for combined photodegradation and biological treatment process however the choice of catalyst depends on the energy levels of the conductive and valence band which impacts the total energy required for pollutant degradation 33 the nano structured metal catalysts have favorable band gap large active surface area and good thermal and chemical stability 34 35 iron derived metal catalyst is an attractive choice for its high efficiency and cost effectiveness but researches showed that zerovalent iron is a better choice compared to higher valent iron catalysts which causes radical scavenging and low conversion rate 36 hsieh et al 2010 have reported that nzvi enhanced the photocatalytic activity of tio2 for the degradation of azo dye 37 also the properties of rgo such as absorption under visible light ability to stimulate oh and persulfate activation and faster electron transport were beneficial for its use in the photodegradation of organic compounds 38 40 the combined effectiveness of nzvi and rgo was utilized in the sono catalytic degradation of nonylphenol and observed high reusability of the catalyst 41 furthermore a previous research showed that magnetic rgo composite could enhance the microbial activity to produce biogas 42 this study evaluated the practicability of an integrated process incorporating photocatalysis and anaerobic degradation for dairy wastewater treatment the spent rgo nzvi photocatalyst was assessed for its efficiency in enhancing biogas production and methane enrichment from pretreated wastewater further the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion of pretreated wastewater was monitored to see the significance of photocatalytic pretreatment in wastewater degradation 2 materials methods and design of batch experiments 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade

inoculum was taken from an enriched methanogen growing media 43 rgo nzvi composite 2 1 w w ratio was prepared by edc nhs crosslinking explained by mehrabi et al 2019 44 the photocatalytic pretreatment was carried out as follows 200 ml of dairy wastewater containing 2 mm ammonium persulfate aps oxidant was taken in a beaker and the rgo nzvi catalyst was added the initial ph of the solution was adjusted in a range of 3 9 by dropwise addition of 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh photocatalysis was carried out in a photoreactor equipped with a 6 w led lamp and a magnetic stirrer no external aerator was employed to avoid oxidation of the catalyst the batch degradation was carried out under the visible spectrum and final samples were collected to measure scod doc and final ph in the second phase of research the anaerobic digestion of pretreated wastewater was carried out in digesters d1 and d2 with and without the addition of 0 1 g rgo nzvi composite respectively a control digester cd was set up for comparison the digester had a total working volume of 250 ml and the composition was as follows pretreated dairy wastewater containing the catalyst cow manure and methanogenic seed in a ratio of 31 8 1 and other nutrients and 1 ml of trace element solution given as per our previous publication the initial properties of pretreated wastewater are given in table 1 the aliquots of digestate were collected regularly and the volume and composition of biogas were measured by water displacement method and a biogas analyzer mm automation india respectively modified gompertz equation was applied to study temporally the conditions for optimum methane production the cod of the filtered 0 45 μ samples were measured in a multiparameter photometer hanna instruments method cod mr 16 after digestion at 150 c in a cod digester hanna instruments doc and fe2 concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically following the mebius and phenanthroline methods respectively 45 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of rgo nzvi composite the pattern of xrd analysis and raman spectra of the spent catalyst are provided in fig 1a and b respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 45 72 and 65 28 in the xrd pattern of the fresh catalyst disappeared after photocatalytic degradation this might be attributed to the leaching of nzvi into the liquid phase and the oxidation of nzvi during photocatalysis however the peaks at 30 73 35 32 and 55 03 were preserved which indicate the oxidized form of iron on the catalyst surface 44 the observations showed that the photodegradation of dairy wastewater caused the catalyst to modify its surface the raman spectra exhibited two dominant peaks at 1350 and 1584 cm 1 which represent d and g peaks of rgo respectively the 2d and g d peaks were also observed at 2700 and 2932 cm 1 respectively the pattern of spent catalyst has shown lesser intensity at every peak low intensity curves at 220 and 285 cm 1 stand for the nzvi molecules which was not prominent in the case of spent catalyst 47 further the variations in the ftir pattern fig 1c were not significant for the spent catalyst compared to the intact one other notable bands at 679 and 825 cm 1 represented typical oxides of iron with feo fe o h bending vibration 44 peaks at 2152 and 2983 cm 1 indicate the alkynes and alkane stretch in the rgo respectively 44 48 moreover a few minor peaks at 3610 and 3622 cm 1 stand for the free alcohol stretching and vibrations 49 similarly the presence of primary and secondary amine amide functional groups and isocyanates are shown by the peaks at 1540 cm 1 and 2270 cm 1 50 51 however the peak at 1695 cm 1 which appeared in the pattern of fresh catalyst has been split into two less intense peaks at 1640 and 1718 cm 1 also a new broad peak at 1010 cm 1 was introduced representing more co group morphology of rgo nzvi composite through sem analysis before and after photocatalytic degradation has been given in fig 1d and e the images implied that photocatalysis of wastewater using rgo nzvi catalyst had caused slight dissociation of carbon layers in rgo the initial catalytic surface was compact and compressed which after the degradation became a loose pack of carbon layers linked with weak van der waal s force of interaction yet these loose layers may be beneficial in biological degradation giving a more exposed surface area for the attached growth of microbes and intensifying the electron transport 3 2 efficiency of rgo nzvi in photocatalysis of dairy wastewater the synthetic dairy wastewater was treated by photocatalysis incorporating an rgo nzvi catalyst the preliminary batch studies showed that the photo degradative mineralization increased the scod of wastewater for certain duration the highest solubilization was observed after 4 h of photocatalysis with an increment of 23 51 0 8 scod at an initial scod of 4850 mg l 1 similarly 29 97 0 9 doc increase occurred at this time beyond 4 h no further solubilization was exhibited because the scod and doc started to decrease the pretreatment ceased at this point of maximum scod concentration to gain an economically feasible combination of the two processes as shown in fig 2a there was a slight drop in scod concentration until 30 min possibly due to the rapid conversion of easily accessible soluble organics generally the low valence transition metals such as iron help to disrupt oo bondage in the peroxy disulfate anions s2o8 to produce sulfate radicals so4 as per eq 1 in the absence of a catalyst this breakage requires high energy input because the activation energy for the reaction is 140 25 kj 52 here eq 1 represents the generation of highly reactive sulfate radicals from aps mediated by nzvi catalyst similarly photon induced electrons from excited rgo nzvi catalyst can decompose disulfate ions into reactive radicals eq 2 53 1 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 fe 3 so 4 2 2 e s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 3 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 fe 2 so 4 2 there is a possibility that air induced surface corrosion of zvi produces fe2 and h2o2 but studies showed that oxidative degradation of organic compounds by h2o2 in the presence of zvi is an ineffective and slow process 52 the effect of initial ph 4 9 on photocatalytic pretreatment was investigated and shown in fig 2b it was found that the rgo nzvi catalyst showed maximum efficiency in acidic range an increase of 38 77 0 85 scod and 39 05 1 3 doc was measured at an initial ph 5 however the solubilization significantly decreased as the initial ph increased to alkaline range activation of aps in the acidic region 6 favors the exclusive formation of sulfate radicals an increase in ph results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals but the abundant oh ions reacted with these active radicals sulfate and hydroxyl and reduced the overall degradation kinetics and caused a decline in solubility 53 scavenging of active radicals may also occur with excess metal catalyst eq 3 53 in this study the major part of the iron in the catalyst is zerovalent which eventually gets oxidized in the presence of oxygen so the scavenging effect could be neglected during the initial phase of photodegradation but as the catalysis progress the generated ferrous ions may start making the radicals unreactive and thus a longer duration of pretreatment may be undesirable due to this effect of ferrous ions however further experiments are required to analyze the effect of iron leaching and scavenging further as shown in fig 3b at higher catalyst dosages viz above 0 3 g the variation in the maximum scod concentration was insignificant the lower efficiency of the photodegradation despite having more free electrons released and facilitation of more conducting channels by large quantity of rgo might be due to the reduction of transmitted light through the solution by scattering the light and blocking the photons the deactivation of reactive moieties due to the collision with the ground state molecules also should have contributed to the less efficiency of mineralization 54 fig 3a represents the effect of initial organic loading as scod in photocatalytic performance it was found that an increase in initial organic loading resulted in a decrease of solubilization efficiency when the initial scod varied from 2200 to 17 460 mg l 1 the solubilization efficiency declined from 40 45 1 69 to 6 64 0 2 in terms of maximum scod and 35 5 1 2 to 11 77 0 5 in terms of doc at high substrate concentrations the number of reactive radicals produced to degrade the organic compounds might be insufficient 55 also high concentration of organic compounds imparted more turbidity as shown in fig s2 and reduced the uniform distribution of light 56 reactive radical scavenging could also occur by the organic radicals formed by the degradation of complex molecules 52 3 3 effect of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion the pretreated dairy wastewater was digested for 28 days to observe the biogas production fig 4a represents the cumulative biogas production on each sampling day the highest daily biogas production in d1 and d2 were 335 13 73 and 285 9 97 ml respectively on day 4 which was 55 81 2 3 and 32 55 0 8 higher than cd on the day of most biogas production day 6 with 215 9 24 ml the cumulative yields of biogas from d1 and d2 were 1870 65 45 ml and 1520 59 28 ml respectively which were 31 69 1 05 and 7 14 0 15 more than that obtained from cd 1420 58 22 ml fig 4b shows the composition of ch4 in the biogas comparing fig 4a and b the daily ch4 production in d1 and d2 were the highest on day 4 with 90 37 3 8 and 47 05 1 8 more than the maximum daily yield of ch4 in cd day 6 respectively these results also infer that active methanogenesis began earlier in d1 and d2 compared to cd 57 the high fat content of dairy wastewater hinders the permeability of cell walls and thus causes slow hydrolysis and consumption of these compounds in cd 58 since microbial growth and metabolism largely depend upon the soluble substrate concentration improved solubility in d1 and d2 showed better performance compared to cd the partial solubilization of organic pollutants helped to reduce the load on the hydrolytic microbes thus the usual lag time of methanogenesis has been reduced in d1 and d2 so it can be further deduced that the photocatalytic pretreatment influenced the biogas production positively the superior performance of d1 indicates the tremendous advantage of the amendment of biocatalyst after pretreatment as explained in section 3 1 during photocatalysis the rgo nzvi catalyst undergoes physicochemical changes and may have affected the electrical and conductive properties a slight amendment with fresh catalyst imparted the advantages of intact conductive additives in d1 fig 5a shows the performance of digester d1 in removing scod d1 exhibited better reduction of scod with 72 99 2 84 efficiency until day 28 whereas d2 and cd showed 67 72 2 91 and 61 08 1 89 of scod removal respectively studies reported the efficient anaerobic digestion of organic substrates in the presence of carbonaceous and magnetic additives 43 the boost of diet by the presence of conductive moieties in the digestion system improved ch4 production 42 in this study partial solubilization of organic compounds by photocatalytic pretreatment and the benefit of used catalyst for increased diet caused good digestion efficiency in terms of scod removal and ch4 enrichment the trend of iron dissolution into the liquid phase during anaerobic digestion is given in fig 5b d1 showed a slow increase of fe2 throughout the digestion period however the variation of fe2 in d2 was insignificant decomposition of solids in cow dung released some fe2 ions due to microbial activity which caused an increasing trend in cd at the start of anaerobic digestion fresh rgo nzvi was added to d1 due to which the iron dissolution showed an upward trend however d2 was not amended with the catalyst and thus the existing fe2 concentration did not change significantly the concentration of vfa plays a significant role in predicting the efficiency of anaerobic degradation high vfa concentrations indicate a slow rate of acetogenesis and methanogenesis also the downfall in media ph may hamper the growth of microbes fig 6a represents the changes in vfa concentration during the digestion of pretreated dairy wastewater the larger values indicate a higher rate of hydrolysis and acidogenesis compared to aceto and methanogenesis the initial phase of acclimatization and activation of methanogenic microbes causes a delay in converting these acids into acetic acid co2 and ch4 as seen in fig 4b the high composition of ch4 71 28 3 06 and 64 72 2 78 in d1 and d2 respectively was found on day 4 from this period of active methanation onwards the concentration of organic acids started declining the depleting substrate concentration caused the total vfa to fall to as low as 51 11 0 66 and 50 82 1 98 mg l 1 in d1 and d2 respectively however due to the delayed methanogenesis cd exhibited an increasing pattern of vfa concentration for longer from day 6 cd has started showing an eventual decrease in vfa concentration 3 4 modified gompertz model fitting fig 5b gives insights into the kinetics of biogas production according to modified gompertz model eq 4 4 m t m 0 exp exp r m e m 0 λ t 1 where m t ml represents the cumulative ch4 yield at time t and e is a mathematical constant equivalent to 2 718 after repeated iterations the maximum r2 values were obtained for the kinetic parameters m0 the maximum potential of ch4 production ml rm the peak biomethane production rate ml day and λ the duration of lag phase day 59 as given in table 2 similar to the experimental observations ch4 produced from d1 was the highest with 81 01 3 24 more than cd the ch4 generation from d2 was 38 93 1 1 higher than cd further the daily ch4 production in d1 and d2 were approximately 1 65 and 0 69 times more than cd respectively the significance of pretreatment could be explained also by examining the lag time in each reactor here cd had much higher values of λ with an order of λcd λd2 λd1 thus the solubilization of organic substances by photocatalytic pretreatment caused faster methanogenesis further the amendment of the biocatalyst aided in reducing λ in d1 4 conclusions this research analyzed the significance of pretreatment of dairy wastewater through photocatalysis before biological degradation the results indicated that photocatalysis facilitated partial solubilization of organic compounds after the pretreatment the spent photocatalyst has shown efficiency in mediating electron transport during the anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater also a slight amendment of rgo nzvi composite before anaerobic digestion caused significant increase in the volume and ch4 composition of biogas kinetics of biogas production showed that the digester amended with biocatalyst had 1 65 times more potential for ch4 production than the control digester similarly the reduction of scod from the wastewater was higher in the digester loaded with pretreated wastewater and catalyst amendment however the pretreatment duration might improve by incorporating high intensity light so from the study it can be inferred that photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method to improve the biogas production potential of the wastewater a combined photocatalytic anaerobic digester train in the dairy wastewater treatment plant would be promising

12531,high fat wastes are difficult to degrade and mineralize under biological methods it is imperative to identify suitable combinations of physicochemical and biological processes this study analyzed the prospects of combining photocatalysis and anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater using a nano catalyst made of reduced graphene oxide rgo and nano zerovalent iron nzvi the operational parameters of ammonium persulfate aps assisted photocatalytic pretreatment initial ph 4 9 organic loading 2200 17 900 mg l 1 and catalyst dosage 0 1 0 5 g were optimized the maximum solubilization was found at an initial ph 5 until 4 h of pretreatment with an increase of 38 77 0 85 soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and 39 05 1 3 dissolved organic carbon doc the anaerobic digestion of pretreated wastewater containing spent catalyst was carried out with slight amendment of fresh catalyst d1 and without any fresh supplement d2 the total biogas produced in d1 and d2 in 28 days was 31 69 1 05 and

of scod with 72 99 2 84 efficiency whereas d2 and cd showed only 67 72 2 91 and 61 08 1 89 respectively according to the modified gompertz model the lag phase time λ for cd is more than d1 and d2

dairy wastewater photocatalytic pretreatment anaerobic digestion reduced graphene oxide nano zerovalent iron data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the depletion of fossil fuel alarms the world about the need to depend on renewable energy resources and the adoption of energy efficient technologies 1 the energy generation from biogas technology may drastically rise since it has climatic benefits and efficient valorization of waste 2 according to world biogas association s report there was a 90 increase in global electricity production from biogas in just six years from 2010 to 2016 3 also the gaseous fuel produced through anaerobic digestion could be utilized for domestic fuel substitution in remote geographical areas where delivery of grid energy is uneconomical 4 biogas technology offers low carbon fuel and nutrient rich fertilizer by stabilizing the organic waste thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ghg from waste disposal sources 4 5 methane gas is a menace when present in the atmosphere as a potent ghg but it is also a good fuel with a heat value of 50 55 5 mj kg 6 dairy waste possesses a high potential to serve as a substrate for microbial metabolism and growth due to its rich composition containing proteins fats carbohydrates and other organic stabilizers 7 8 the improper management of these wastes may lead to uncontrolled evolution of intermediates and degradation products into the environment 9 studies reported that the biological treatment of dairy wastewater is cumbersome due to poorly soluble highly stable complex fat and lipid compounds 9 11 a layer of fat may act as a recalcitrant barrier between microbes and substrates reduce the mass transfer efficiency and cause clogging and floatation 8 12 this results in the extension of hydrolysis which is the major rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion 13 however these complex compounds contribute greatly to the total hydrocarbons in the waste and imparts good biomethane potential 14 15 pretreatment helps to increase the biodegradability of substrates by disrupting the recalcitrant linkages to form simpler molecules 16 ultrasound treatment 17 lipase hydrolysis for high fat wastewater 18 application of garbage enzymes 13 thermal and chemical coagulation treatments 19 are proven methods to improve the efficiency of biogas production pretreatment inactivated the resistive genes of pathogenic microbes and enhanced the concentration of proton donors rather than just improving the solubility and biodegradability 19 20 in a study peroxide oxidation showed better solid disintegration and benefitted in anaerobic digestion however it was not economically feasible to implement 21 the synergy of these enhancing mechanisms results in the acceleration of hydrolysis and acidogenesis and hence the lag time for methanogenesis would be reduced resulting in a high biogas yield from the process 22 photocatalysis is a rapid mineralization process to remove certain pharmaceutical compounds and nitrogen containing organics compared to biological methods 23 24 catalysts such as mno2 nanofibrous mesh go tio2 tio2 zno mg oh 2 were proved to be efficient in the removal of crystal violet amoxicillin and 1 4 dioxane respectively with catalyst dosages varying from 0 4 to 1 0 g l 1 table s1 25 27 but the factors such as the cost of catalysts and operation generation of toxic by products and high catalyst loading limit the applicability 28 30 a combination of photocatalysis and biological degradation may be beneficial compared to the efficiency and drawbacks of employing these depollution methods individually 31 32 table s2 presents few examples for combined photodegradation and biological treatment process however the choice of catalyst depends on the energy levels of the conductive and valence band which impacts the total energy required for pollutant degradation 33 the nano structured metal catalysts have favorable band gap large active surface area and good thermal and chemical stability 34 35 iron derived metal catalyst is an attractive choice for its high efficiency and cost effectiveness but researches showed that zerovalent iron is a better choice compared to higher valent iron catalysts which causes radical scavenging and low conversion rate 36 hsieh et al 2010 have reported that nzvi enhanced the photocatalytic activity of tio2 for the degradation of azo dye 37 also the properties of rgo such as absorption under visible light ability to stimulate oh and persulfate activation and faster electron transport were beneficial for its use in the photodegradation of organic compounds 38 40 the combined effectiveness of nzvi and rgo was utilized in the sono catalytic degradation of nonylphenol and observed high reusability of the catalyst 41 furthermore a previous research showed that magnetic rgo composite could enhance the microbial activity to produce biogas 42 this study evaluated the practicability of an integrated process incorporating photocatalysis and anaerobic degradation for dairy wastewater treatment the spent rgo nzvi photocatalyst was assessed for its efficiency in enhancing biogas production and methane enrichment from pretreated wastewater further the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion of pretreated wastewater was monitored to see the significance of photocatalytic pretreatment in wastewater degradation 2 materials methods and design of batch experiments 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification unless mentioned nh4 2s2o8 was purchased from sigma aldrich dairy wastewater was prepared by dissolving commercial milk powder amul india the seed inoculum was taken from an enriched methanogen growing media 43 rgo nzvi composite 2 1 w w ratio was prepared by edc nhs crosslinking explained by mehrabi et al 2019 44 the photocatalytic pretreatment was carried out as follows 200 ml of dairy wastewater containing 2 mm ammonium persulfate aps oxidant was taken in a beaker and the rgo nzvi catalyst was added the initial ph of the solution was adjusted in a range of 3 9 by dropwise addition of 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh photocatalysis was carried out in a photoreactor equipped with a 6 w led lamp and a magnetic stirrer no external aerator was employed to avoid oxidation of the catalyst the batch degradation was carried out under the visible spectrum and final samples were collected to measure scod doc and final ph in the second phase of research the anaerobic digestion of pretreated wastewater was carried out in digesters d1 and d2 with and without the addition of 0 1 g rgo nzvi composite respectively a control digester cd was set up for comparison the digester had a total working volume of 250 ml and the composition was as follows pretreated dairy wastewater containing the catalyst cow manure and methanogenic seed in a ratio of 31 8 1 and other nutrients and 1 ml of trace element solution given as per our previous publication the initial properties of pretreated wastewater are given in table 1 the aliquots of digestate were collected regularly and the volume and composition of biogas were measured by water displacement method and a biogas analyzer mm automation india respectively modified gompertz equation was applied to study temporally the conditions for optimum methane production the cod of the filtered 0 45 μ samples were measured in a multiparameter photometer hanna instruments method cod mr 16 after digestion at 150 c in a cod digester hanna instruments doc and fe2 concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically following the mebius and phenanthroline methods respectively 45 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of rgo nzvi composite the pattern of xrd analysis and raman spectra of the spent catalyst are provided in fig 1a and b respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 45 72 and 65 28 in the xrd pattern of the fresh catalyst disappeared after photocatalytic degradation this might be attributed to the leaching of nzvi into the liquid phase and the oxidation of nzvi during photocatalysis however the peaks at 30 73 35 32 and 55 03 were preserved which indicate the oxidized form of iron on the catalyst surface 44 the observations showed that the photodegradation of dairy wastewater caused the catalyst to modify its surface the raman spectra exhibited two dominant peaks at 1350 and 1584 cm 1 which represent d and g peaks of rgo respectively the 2d and g d peaks were also observed at 2700 and 2932 cm 1 respectively the pattern of spent catalyst has shown lesser intensity at every peak low intensity curves at 220 and 285 cm 1 stand for the nzvi molecules which was not prominent in the case of spent catalyst 47 further the variations in the ftir pattern fig 1c were not significant for the spent catalyst compared to the intact one other notable bands at 679 and 825 cm 1 represented typical oxides of iron with feo fe o h bending vibration 44 peaks at 2152 and 2983 cm 1 indicate the alkynes and alkane stretch in the rgo respectively 44 48 moreover a few minor peaks at 3610 and 3622 cm 1 stand for the free alcohol stretching and vibrations 49 similarly the presence of primary and secondary amine amide functional groups and isocyanates are shown by the peaks at 1540 cm 1 and 2270 cm 1 50 51 however the peak at 1695 cm 1 which appeared in the pattern of fresh catalyst has been split into two less intense peaks at 1640 and 1718 cm 1 also a new broad peak at 1010 cm 1 was introduced representing more co group morphology of rgo nzvi composite through sem analysis before and after photocatalytic degradation has been given in fig 1d and e the images implied that photocatalysis of wastewater using rgo nzvi catalyst had caused slight dissociation of carbon layers in rgo the initial catalytic surface was compact and compressed which after the degradation became a loose pack of carbon layers linked with weak van der waal s force of interaction yet these loose layers may be beneficial in biological degradation giving a more exposed surface area for the attached growth of microbes and intensifying the electron transport 3 2 efficiency of rgo nzvi in photocatalysis of dairy wastewater the synthetic dairy wastewater was treated by photocatalysis incorporating an rgo nzvi catalyst the preliminary batch studies showed that the photo degradative mineralization increased the scod of wastewater for certain duration the highest solubilization was observed after 4 h of photocatalysis with an increment of 23 51 0 8 scod at an initial scod of 4850 mg l 1 similarly 29 97 0 9 doc increase occurred at this time beyond 4 h no further solubilization was exhibited because the scod and doc started to decrease the pretreatment ceased at this point of maximum scod concentration to gain an economically feasible combination of the two processes as shown in fig 2a there was a slight drop in scod concentration until 30 min possibly due to the rapid conversion of easily accessible soluble organics generally the low valence transition metals such as iron help to disrupt oo bondage in the peroxy disulfate anions s2o8 to produce sulfate radicals so4 as per eq 1 in the absence of a catalyst this breakage requires high energy input because the activation energy for the reaction is 140 25 kj 52 here eq 1 represents the generation of highly reactive sulfate radicals from aps mediated by nzvi catalyst similarly photon induced electrons from excited rgo nzvi catalyst can decompose disulfate ions into reactive radicals eq 2 53 1 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 fe 3 so 4 2 2 e s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 3 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 fe 2 so 4 2 there is a possibility that air induced surface corrosion of zvi produces fe2 and h2o2 but studies showed that oxidative degradation of organic compounds by h2o2 in the presence of zvi is an ineffective and slow process 52 the effect of initial ph 4 9 on photocatalytic pretreatment was investigated and shown in fig 2b it was found that the rgo nzvi catalyst showed maximum efficiency in acidic range an increase of 38 77 0 85 scod and 39 05 1 3 doc was measured at an initial ph 5 however the solubilization significantly decreased as the initial ph increased to alkaline range activation of aps in the acidic region 6 favors the exclusive formation of sulfate radicals an increase in ph results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals but the abundant oh ions reacted with these active radicals sulfate and hydroxyl and reduced the overall degradation kinetics and caused a decline in solubility 53 scavenging of active radicals may also occur with excess metal catalyst eq 3 53 in this study the major part of the iron in the catalyst is zerovalent which eventually gets oxidized in the presence of oxygen so the scavenging effect could be neglected during the initial phase of photodegradation but as the catalysis progress the generated ferrous ions may start making the radicals unreactive and thus a longer duration of pretreatment may be undesirable due to this effect of ferrous ions however further experiments are required to analyze the effect of iron leaching and scavenging further as shown in fig 3b at higher catalyst dosages viz above 0 3 g the variation in the maximum scod concentration was insignificant the lower efficiency of the photodegradation despite having more free electrons released and facilitation of more conducting channels by large quantity of rgo might be due to the reduction of transmitted light through the solution by scattering the light and blocking the photons the deactivation of reactive moieties due to the collision with the ground state molecules also should have contributed to the less efficiency of mineralization 54 fig 3a represents the effect of initial organic loading as scod in photocatalytic performance it was found that an increase in initial organic loading resulted in a decrease of solubilization efficiency when the initial scod varied from 2200 to 17 460 mg l 1 the solubilization efficiency declined from 40 45 1 69 to 6 64 0 2 in terms of maximum scod and 35 5 1 2 to 11 77 0 5 in terms of doc at high substrate concentrations the number of reactive radicals produced to degrade the organic compounds might be insufficient 55 also high concentration of organic compounds imparted more turbidity as shown in fig s2 and reduced the uniform distribution of light 56 reactive radical scavenging could also occur by the organic radicals formed by the degradation of complex molecules 52 3 3 effect of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion the pretreated dairy wastewater was digested for 28 days to observe the biogas production fig 4a represents the cumulative biogas production on each sampling day the highest daily biogas production in d1 and d2 were 335 13 73 and 285 9 97 ml respectively on day 4 which was 55 81 2 3 and 32 55 0 8 higher than cd on the day of most biogas production day 6 with 215 9 24 ml the cumulative yields of biogas from d1 and d2 were 1870 65 45 ml and 1520 59 28 ml respectively which were 31 69 1 05 and 7 14 0 15 more than that obtained from cd 1420 58 22 ml fig 4b shows the composition of ch4 in the biogas comparing fig 4a and b the daily ch4 production in d1 and d2 were the highest on day 4 with 90 37 3 8 and 47 05 1 8 more than the maximum daily yield of ch4 in cd day 6 respectively these results also infer that active methanogenesis began earlier in d1 and d2 compared to cd 57 the high fat content of dairy wastewater hinders the permeability of cell walls and thus causes slow hydrolysis and consumption of these compounds in cd 58 since microbial growth and metabolism largely depend upon the soluble substrate concentration improved solubility in d1 and d2 showed better performance compared to cd the partial solubilization of organic pollutants helped to reduce the load on the hydrolytic microbes thus the usual lag time of methanogenesis has been reduced in d1 and d2 so it can be further deduced that the photocatalytic pretreatment influenced the biogas production positively the superior performance of d1 indicates the tremendous advantage of the amendment of biocatalyst after pretreatment as explained in section 3 1 during photocatalysis the rgo nzvi catalyst undergoes physicochemical changes and may have affected the electrical and conductive properties a slight amendment with fresh catalyst imparted the advantages of intact conductive additives in d1 fig 5a shows the performance of digester d1 in removing scod d1 exhibited better reduction of scod with 72 99 2 84 efficiency until day 28 whereas d2 and cd showed 67 72 2 91 and 61 08 1 89 of scod removal respectively studies reported the efficient anaerobic digestion of organic substrates in the presence of carbonaceous and magnetic additives 43 the boost of diet by the presence of conductive moieties in the digestion system improved ch4 production 42 in this study partial solubilization of organic compounds by photocatalytic pretreatment and the benefit of used catalyst for increased diet caused good digestion efficiency in terms of scod removal and ch4 enrichment the trend of iron dissolution into the liquid phase during anaerobic digestion is given in fig 5b d1 showed a slow increase of fe2 throughout the digestion period however the variation of fe2 in d2 was insignificant decomposition of solids in cow dung released some fe2 ions due to microbial activity which caused an increasing trend in cd at the start of anaerobic digestion fresh rgo nzvi was added to d1 due to which the iron dissolution showed an upward trend however d2 was not amended with the catalyst and thus the existing fe2 concentration did not change significantly the concentration of vfa plays a significant role in predicting the efficiency of anaerobic degradation high vfa concentrations indicate a slow rate of acetogenesis and methanogenesis also the downfall in media ph may hamper the growth of microbes fig 6a represents the changes in vfa concentration during the digestion of pretreated dairy wastewater the larger values indicate a higher rate of hydrolysis and acidogenesis compared to aceto and methanogenesis the initial phase of acclimatization and activation of methanogenic microbes causes a delay in converting these acids into acetic acid co2 and ch4 as seen in fig 4b the high composition of ch4 71 28 3 06 and 64 72 2 78 in d1 and d2 respectively was found on day 4 from this period of active methanation onwards the concentration of organic acids started declining the depleting substrate concentration caused the total vfa to fall to as low as 51 11 0 66 and 50 82 1 98 mg l 1 in d1 and d2 respectively however due to the delayed methanogenesis cd exhibited an increasing pattern of vfa concentration for longer from day 6 cd has started showing an eventual decrease in vfa concentration 3 4 modified gompertz model fitting fig 5b gives insights into the kinetics of biogas production according to modified gompertz model eq 4 4 m t m 0 exp exp r m e m 0 λ t 1 where m t ml represents the cumulative ch4 yield at time t and e is a mathematical constant equivalent to 2 718 after repeated iterations the maximum r2 values were obtained for the kinetic parameters m0 the maximum potential of ch4 production ml rm the peak biomethane production rate ml day and λ the duration of lag phase day 59 as given in table 2 similar to the experimental observations ch4 produced from d1 was the highest with 81 01 3 24 more than cd the ch4 generation from d2 was 38 93 1 1 higher than cd further the daily ch4 production in d1 and d2 were approximately 1 65 and 0 69 times more than cd respectively the significance of pretreatment could be explained also by examining the lag time in each reactor here cd had much higher values of λ with an order of λcd λd2 λd1 thus the solubilization of organic substances by photocatalytic pretreatment caused faster methanogenesis further the amendment of the biocatalyst aided in reducing λ in d1 4 conclusions this research analyzed the significance of pretreatment of dairy wastewater through photocatalysis before biological degradation the results indicated that photocatalysis facilitated partial solubilization of organic compounds after the pretreatment the spent photocatalyst has shown efficiency in mediating electron transport during the anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater also a slight amendment of rgo nzvi composite before anaerobic digestion caused significant increase in the volume and ch4 composition of biogas kinetics of biogas production showed that the digester amended with biocatalyst had 1 65 times more potential for ch4 production than the control digester similarly the reduction of scod from the wastewater was higher in the digester loaded with pretreated wastewater and catalyst amendment however the pretreatment duration might improve by incorporating high intensity light so from the study it can be inferred that photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method to improve the biogas production potential of the wastewater a combined photocatalytic anaerobic digester train in the dairy wastewater treatment plant would be promising

biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and the solid density and content were 1 1 g cm3 25 c and 50 w w respectively 2 2 was pretreatment and batch mode af test was pretreatment was conducted in ten identical saline bottles no 1 10 with working volume of 500 ml and 400 ml of was was added into each reactor the pretreatment conditions were shown in table 1 firstly 3 mol l nano2 stock solution was dosed to achieve the initial no2 n contents as 90 150 210 270 330 390 and 450 mg l respectively and all these reactors were maintained at ph 6 30 c for 48 h the corresponding fna concentration was 0 178 0 297 0 416 0 535 0 653 0 772 and 0 891 mg n l respectively which were calculated using the formula fna cno2 n ka 10ph and ka e 2300 t 273 for a given temperature after fna pretreatment 0 075 g g vss apg was added to further improve af performance and the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 another two groups of reactors with single fna pretreatment or single apg addition were carried out to test the impact of single factor on af performance the last group of reactors acted as the blank without fna or apg addition each bottle was purged with 2 l nitrogen gas 99 99 to exclude oxygen and then put in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 1 c for 10 days during which the ph was not controlled each group test was conducted in duplicate 2 3 sludge solubilization test to examine the impact of fna apg pretreatment on was solubilization four groups of replicate serum bottles were prepared and each bottle was fed with 500 ml was group 1 acted as the blank without any pretreatment and groups 2 and 3 was added with apg 0 075 g gvss and fna 0 653 mg n l respectively group 4 was pretreated by fna 0 653 mg n l integrated with apg 0 075 g gvss after 48 h pretreatment soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins in each reactor were tested in order to examine afl biodegradability it was further tested by three dimension excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectrometry 2 4 sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis test to examine the effects of fna and apg treatment on sludge hydrolysis and acidogenesis two groups of batch mode assays using corresponding model substrates were carried out eight identical 500 ml fermentation reactors were prepared and divided into two groups with four in one group each reactor was filled with 450 ml simulated wastewater and 50 ml af inocula and the inocula were collected from a semi continuous fermenter in our laboratory the inocula pretreatment conditions for each reactor were the same as section 2 3 group i the test was aimed to determine the influence of pretreatment on was hydrolysis the simulated wastewater contained 2 81 g l bovine serum albumin bsa mw 67 000 and 0 66 g l dextran mw 23 800 as fermentation substrates whose concentrations were similar to those of proteins and carbohydrates in the raw was the test was carried out for 3 days and the final bsa and dextran contents were determined meanwhile the activities of key hydrolase including α glucosidase and protease were tested group ii this test was aimed to reveal the impact of pretreatment on acidogenesis process which was the same with group i except that bsa and dextran were replaced with 2 81 g l l alanine and 0 66 g l glucose respectively the influence of pretreatment on methanogenesis was investigated by methane ch4 yield during the af process performed in section 2 2 2 5 microbial community analysis during af after 5 days of af conducted as outlined in section 2 2 the v4 region of bacterial community from the blank sample single fna 0 653 mg l single apg and fna 0 653 mg l combined with apg 0 075 g g vss reactors were analyzed by the 16 s rrna gene sequencing technology using the illumina hiseq platform bioengineering shanghai co ltd for these four samples suspended biomass was sampled from parallel reactors and a mixture sample was used for testing microbial community diversity and structure were analyzed in detail 2 6 anaerobic fermentation liquor for phas synthesis test the inocula for phas synthesis were cultured in a sequencing batch reactor using an aerobic dynamic feeding process and the detailed description can be found in the supplementary materials in order to improve phas synthesis performance nh3 n was removed from the afl firstly viz afl was adjusted at ph 10 and then put in a water bath with magnetic stirring at 50 c for 30 min phas synthesis was then conducted by fed batch culture mode in a beaker with a working volume of 500 ml 200 ml pre treated afl and 200 ml inocula were transferred to the beaker with aeration for 90 min and static settling for 30 min in an operation cycle afterward 200 ml supernatant was discharged before the next cycle the synthesis was carried out for five operation periods and phas content and composition as well as dissolved oxygen do in the reactor were measured at the beginning and end of each aeration phase after five operation periods the v4 region of the bacterial community from the batch reactor was analyzed as outlined in section 2 5 2 7 analytical methods cod tss vss ph do nh3 n phosphate and nitrite were examined according to the standard method 31 scfas and ch4 content were tested by gas chromatography ewai gc 4000a beijing china soluble proteins and carbohydrates were tested by the lowry folin and anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively 3d eem test and analysis was conducted by fluorescence spectroscopy according to chen et al 32 and the calculation method for the percent of fluorescence response pi n was conducted as presented in the previous literature 33 the measurements including l alanine content α glucosidase and protease activities were performed with the same approach as reported by zhao et al 34 the supplementary materials show the detailed test methods of phas content and composition all the tests were performed in duplicate one way analysis of variance anova was applied to evaluate the results significance and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of fna and apg on scfas production during af fig 1 a shows the tscfas yield during the af process with fna apg treatment at day 1 the tscfas yield increased for all the samples with the af time increasing the tscfas yield depended on the fna dosage the maximal tscfas yield occurred in the 0 653 fna apg reactor at day 5 reached 324 94 mg cod g vss 2541 03 mg cod l which was 1 55 and 5 53 fold of the sole apg 209 82 2 43 cod g vss and blank 58 76 0 67 mg cod g vss samples respectively when the fna dosage exceeded 0 653 mg l tscfas production decreased significantly p 0 01 mainly due to that excess fna including no and no2 inhibited acidogens activity moreover the individual scfa percentage was affected by various treatment conditions as shown in fig 1 b six individual scfas were detected in afl at day 5 and the total percentage of acetic and propionic acids was 60 in the 0 653 mg l fna apg reactor table 2 shows the vss reduction rate at day 5 of af under various conditions which was significantly influenced by the fna dosage the vss reduction rate increased with the increment of fna dosage and the highest value 37 21 occurred after af with 0 891 mg l fna apg treatment which verified that fna apg treatment could enhance sludge organics solubilization and sludge reduction during the af process most of the no2 n in the reactors could be removed through denitrification for example no2 n content in the 0 653 mg l fna apg reactor decreased from an initial 300 mg l to 0 after 48 h of af table s1 thus showing negligible adverse effect on subsequent scfas utilization as a c source for phas synthesis 3 2 effects of fna and apg on sludge solubilization was solubilization is the first step of af and one of the major rate limiting processes the particulate in was floc was disintegrated into soluble or macromolecule matters including proteins carbohydrates and lipids which could provide essential substrates for fermentation microbes 12 13 the impacts of various treatment conditions on was solubilization were expressed as scod soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate content in the afl fig 2 compared with the sole fna and sole apg treatment fna apg treatment after 48 h showed synergetic effects on sludge solubilization scod concentration in the fna apg reactor was 5 5 times of the blank whereas sole fna and sole apg were only 3 01 and 4 8 times of the blank respectively soluble proteins and carbohydrates contents showed the similar tendency as scod these results manifest that fna apg treatment is beneficial to was solubilization and release of intracellular organics which might be attributed to the destruction of microbial cell structure by synergistic treatment the characteristics of released soluble organics were further investigated by 3d eem fig 3 shows the 3d eem spectra of the afl under various conditions it was found that a new adsorption peak peak c tryptophan like substances nonbiodegradable occurred after various treatments the fluorescence intensities of peak a tyrosine like substances biodegradable peak b soluble microbial by product substances biodegradable and peak c were the highest for the fna apg samples indicating more soluble organics release meanwhile it could be found that both pi n and pvi n increased remarkably after fna apg treatment demonstrating that combined treatment could effectively release biodegradable substances and thus enhance scfas yield during subsequent af 3 3 effects of fna and apg on sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis three main bioprocesses including hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis that are involved in af can be affected by different treatment conditions two individual tests using model compounds as substrates were carried out to investigate hydrolysis and acidogenesis performances under various treatment conditions moreover accumulated ch4 production at day 5 of af was tested to examine methanogenesis performance the degradation rate of bsa and dextran was the highest under the fna apg condition at day 3 of af viz 75 00 and 79 84 fig 4 a respectively which indicated that fna apg treatment was beneficial to was hydrolysis similar results were found for l alanine and glucose manifesting that fna apg treatment was beneficial to was acidogenesis and showed synergistic effect fig 4 b during af the produced scfas would transform to ch4 due to methanogenesis and the accumulated ch4 yields at day 5 are shown in fig 4 c it is found that fna apg could severely inhibit ch4 production in the sole fna sole apg and fna apg reactors ch4 production was only 32 78 3 24 and 0 64 of that in the blank sample respectively previous study indicated that methanogens were very sensitive to environmental factors e g ph orp and inhibitors therefore the addition of fna and apg would destroy microbial cell structure which was the main contribution to methanogenesis inhibition in addition ph fluctuation under fna apg conditions also suppressed methanogenesis as shown in fig s1 the above analysis indicated that fna apg treatment could promote was hydrolysis and acidogenesis while inhibiting scfas consumption leading to more scfas accumulation in addition scfas accumulation during af was dominated by some key enzymes for example protease and α glucosidase were used for proteins and carbohydrates hydrolysis respectively 35 36 as shown in fig 4 d different treatment conditions could improve the hydrolase activities for example compared with the blank sample the activities of protease and α glucosidase increased by 98 and 55 respectively after fna apg treatment which was consistent with the hydrolysis results shown in fig 4 a 3 4 effects of fna and apg treatments on microbial community during af microbial communities played an important role in scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation 10 37 therefore microbial communities from the blank sample sole fna sole apg and fna apg reactors were analyzed by the illumina hiseq 16s rrna genes sequencing technique the rarefaction curves for all the microbial communities were carried out at 97 similarity level of operational taxonomic units otus and the results showed that the sequencing depth was enough to cover the whole diversity fig s2 a the number of otus from high to low were sole fna 3698 blank 3510 fna apg 3423 and apg 3159 with 883 otus shared by these four reactors fig s2 b these results showed that the fna apg treatment could decrease the microbial community diversity and change the microbial structure to some extent the relative abundances of microbial communities in different reactors were compared at the phylum and genus level proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in the blank and sole fna reactors accounting for 74 66 and 79 79 of the total microbial sequences respectively fig 5 a in the apg and fna apg reactors proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and planctomycetes became the main phyla accounting for 81 50 and 85 86 of the total sequences respectively it was reported that many microbes belonging to proteobacteria and firmicutes could utilize organics to produce scfas especially for acetic acid 38 therefore the increase of relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes could contribute to more scfas accumulation in the fna apg reactor in order to obtain more information about the effect of fna apg treatment on microbial community structure the genus level of different samples was also analyzed as shown in fig 5 b at the genus level the changes in composition and abundance of microbial species were consistent with the phylum level the percentages of enterococcus clostridium and anaerofilum affiliated to firmicutes methylocystis affiliated to proteobacteria and aquihabitans affiliated to actinobacteria had a significant increment in the fna apg reactor among them clostridium which could degrade complex organics to acetic acid increased from 0 46 blank to a maximum of 4 77 in the fna apg reactor enterococcus widely exited in the af environment 39 also increased sharply in the fna apg reactor with relative abundance of 4 39 in addition ottowia a type of nitrate reducing bacteria nrb and consumer of acetic acid which could perform denitrification meanwhile utilize acetate and other small molecule organics in the system 40 decreased to the lowest in the fna apg reactor and this was another reason for more scfas accumulation 3 5 phas synthesis from afl before phas synthesis afl extracted from the reactor with the maximum tscfas production was pretreated by alkali thermal method to remove nh3 n it was worth noting that the tscfas production for phas synthesis decreased slightly from 2541 03 mg cod l to 1689 44 mg cod l during the temporary closure of the laboratory due to covid 19 outbreak in april 2022 in china the characteristics of afl before and after alkali thermal treatment are shown in table s2 after pretreatment nh3 n level decreased from 196 32 mg l to 25 51 mg l and tscfas slightly increased from 1689 44 mg cod l to 1735 63 mg cod l fig 6 shows the phas synthesis performances using pre treated afl as the sole c source during five operation periods at the beginning of each period scfas rich afl was introduced into the media and then phas accumulation occurred immediately meanwhile scfas nh3 n and phosphate contents decreased obviously data not shown as shown in fig s3 do was fluctuant during each synthesis period at the beginning of each aeration period microorganisms that are highly active could consume large amounts of oxygen leading to a do decrease and then do increases gradually accompanied by nutrients consumption in one operation period these results indicated that the substrates could be utilized promptly by phas inocula where a part of the c source was used for cell growth and another for phas synthesis after five operation periods the phas yield increased from initial 15 40 to a maximum of 44 44 of biomass w w among them the polyhydroxybutyrate phb accounted for 61 45 it could be concluded that afl is able to remarkably reduce the phas synthesis cost during recovery and production of phas and has become a promising technology for was treatment and resource recovery fig 7 shows the relative abundance of bacterial community at the genus level from phas synthesis reactor after 5 operation periods lautropia 21 37 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 14 53 paracoccus 7 65 roseibacillus 7 01 flavobacterium 3 72 and leadbetterella 3 03 were the top 6 genera paracoccus was one of the predominant genera which could contribute to phb and phas synthesis using scfas as substrate 41 leadbetterella played a significant role in poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyhexanoate phbhhx synthesis 42 these results analyses indicated that the functional microbes including paracoccus and leadbetterella could utilize afl of fna apg treated sludge for phas synthesis successfully on the other hand in the study of kumar et al 43 acetic acid and ammonium chloride were applied as carbon and nitrogen source respectively the experimental results indicated that a higher c n ratio 144 w w was favorable for phb storage in the biomass achieving a maximum of 33 phb w w accumulation however the c n ratio of the afl in this assay was only 22 45 table s2 and the maximum phb accumulation was 27 31 therefore further study should be carried out to further increase the scfas production and the c n ratio in the afl to improve phas yield when utilizing afl as c source 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that fna apg treatment can improve scfas yield from sludge af when fna and apg dosage was 0 653 mg n l and 0 075 g g vss respectively a maximum tscfas yield of 324 94 mg cod g vss occurred at day 5 showing much more than that of single fna or apg treatment mechanisms analysis indicated that fna apg treatment could accelerate sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidogenesis with the inhibition of scfas consumption meanwhile the acid forming producer including enterococcus and clostridium evidently increased finally afl after ammonia removal was applied as the c source for phas synthesis which could reach a maximum value of 44 44 of biomass w w declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and the solid density and content were 1 1 g cm3 25 c and 50 w w respectively 2 2 was pretreatment and batch mode af test was pretreatment was conducted in ten identical saline bottles no 1 10 with working volume of 500 ml and 400 ml of was was added into each reactor the pretreatment conditions were shown in table 1 firstly 3 mol l nano2 stock solution was dosed to achieve the initial no2 n contents as 90 150 210 270 330 390 and 450 mg l respectively and all these reactors were maintained at ph 6 30 c for 48 h the corresponding fna concentration was 0 178 0 297 0 416 0 535 0 653 0 772 and 0 891 mg n l respectively which were calculated using the formula fna cno2 n ka 10ph and ka e 2300 t 273 for a given temperature after fna pretreatment 0 075 g g vss apg was added to further improve af performance and the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 another two groups of reactors with single fna pretreatment or single apg addition were carried out to test the impact of single factor on af performance the last group of reactors acted as the blank without fna or apg addition each bottle was purged with 2 l nitrogen gas 99 99 to exclude oxygen and then put in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 1 c for 10 days during which the ph was not controlled each group test was conducted in duplicate 2 3 sludge solubilization test to examine the impact of fna apg pretreatment on was solubilization four groups of replicate serum bottles were prepared and each bottle was fed with 500 ml was group 1 acted as the blank without any pretreatment and groups 2 and 3 was added with apg 0 075 g gvss and fna 0 653 mg n l respectively group 4 was pretreated by fna 0 653 mg n l integrated with apg 0 075 g gvss after 48 h pretreatment soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins in each reactor were tested in order to examine afl biodegradability it was further tested by three dimension excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectrometry 2 4 sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis test to examine the effects of fna and apg treatment on sludge hydrolysis and acidogenesis two groups of batch mode assays using corresponding model substrates were carried out eight identical 500 ml fermentation reactors were prepared and divided into two groups with four in one group each reactor was filled with 450 ml simulated wastewater and 50 ml af inocula and the inocula were collected from a semi continuous fermenter in our laboratory the inocula pretreatment conditions for each reactor were the same as section 2 3 group i the test was aimed to determine the influence of pretreatment on was hydrolysis the simulated wastewater contained 2 81 g l bovine serum albumin bsa mw 67 000 and 0 66 g l dextran mw 23 800 as fermentation substrates whose concentrations were similar to those of proteins and carbohydrates in the raw was the test was carried out for 3 days and the final bsa and dextran contents were determined meanwhile the activities of key hydrolase including α glucosidase and protease were tested group ii this test was aimed to reveal the impact of pretreatment on acidogenesis process which was the same with group i except that bsa and dextran were replaced with 2 81 g l l alanine and 0 66 g l glucose respectively the influence of pretreatment on methanogenesis was investigated by methane ch4 yield during the af process performed in section 2 2 2 5 microbial community analysis during af after 5 days of af conducted as outlined in section 2 2 the v4 region of bacterial community from the blank sample single fna 0 653 mg l single apg and fna 0 653 mg l combined with apg 0 075 g g vss reactors were analyzed by the 16 s rrna gene sequencing technology using the illumina hiseq platform bioengineering shanghai co ltd for these four samples suspended biomass was sampled from parallel reactors and a mixture sample was used for testing microbial community diversity and structure were analyzed in detail 2 6 anaerobic fermentation liquor for phas synthesis test the inocula for phas synthesis were cultured in a sequencing batch reactor using an aerobic dynamic feeding process and the detailed description can be found in the supplementary materials in order to improve phas synthesis performance nh3 n was removed from the afl firstly viz afl was adjusted at ph 10 and then put in a water bath with magnetic stirring at 50 c for 30 min phas synthesis was then conducted by fed batch culture mode in a beaker with a working volume of 500 ml 200 ml pre treated afl and 200 ml inocula were transferred to the beaker with aeration for 90 min and static settling for 30 min in an operation cycle afterward 200 ml supernatant was discharged before the next cycle the synthesis was carried out for five operation periods and phas content and composition as well as dissolved oxygen do in the reactor were measured at the beginning and end of each aeration phase after five operation periods the v4 region of the bacterial community from the batch reactor was analyzed as outlined in section 2 5 2 7 analytical methods cod tss vss ph do nh3 n phosphate and nitrite were examined according to the standard method 31 scfas and ch4 content were tested by gas chromatography ewai gc 4000a beijing china soluble proteins and carbohydrates were tested by the lowry folin and anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively 3d eem test and analysis was conducted by fluorescence spectroscopy according to chen et al 32 and the calculation method for the percent of fluorescence response pi n was conducted as presented in the previous literature 33 the measurements including l alanine content α glucosidase and protease activities were performed with the same approach as reported by zhao et al 34 the supplementary materials show the detailed test methods of phas content and composition all the tests were performed in duplicate one way analysis of variance anova was applied to evaluate the results significance and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of fna and apg on scfas production during af fig 1 a shows the tscfas yield during the af process with fna apg treatment at day 1 the tscfas yield increased for all the samples with the af time increasing the tscfas yield depended on the fna dosage the maximal tscfas yield occurred in the 0 653 fna apg reactor at day 5 reached 324 94 mg cod g vss 2541 03 mg cod l which was 1 55 and 5 53 fold of the sole apg 209 82 2 43 cod g vss and blank 58 76 0 67 mg cod g vss samples respectively when the fna dosage exceeded 0 653 mg l tscfas production decreased significantly p 0 01 mainly due to that excess fna including no and no2 inhibited acidogens activity moreover the individual scfa percentage was affected by various treatment conditions as shown in fig 1 b six individual scfas were detected in afl at day 5 and the total percentage of acetic and propionic acids was 60 in the 0 653 mg l fna apg reactor table 2 shows the vss reduction rate at day 5 of af under various conditions which was significantly influenced by the fna dosage the vss reduction rate increased with the increment of fna dosage and the highest value 37 21 occurred after af with 0 891 mg l fna apg treatment which verified that fna apg treatment could enhance sludge organics solubilization and sludge reduction during the af process most of the no2 n in the reactors could be removed through denitrification for example no2 n content in the 0 653 mg l fna apg reactor decreased from an initial 300 mg l to 0 after 48 h of af table s1 thus showing negligible adverse effect on subsequent scfas utilization as a c source for phas synthesis 3 2 effects of fna and apg on sludge solubilization was solubilization is the first step of af and one of the major rate limiting processes the particulate in was floc was disintegrated into soluble or macromolecule matters including proteins carbohydrates and lipids which could provide essential substrates for fermentation microbes 12 13 the impacts of various treatment conditions on was solubilization were expressed as scod soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate content in the afl fig 2 compared with the sole fna and sole apg treatment fna apg treatment after 48 h showed synergetic effects on sludge solubilization scod concentration in the fna apg reactor was 5 5 times of the blank whereas sole fna and sole apg were only 3 01 and 4 8 times of the blank respectively soluble proteins and carbohydrates contents showed the similar tendency as scod these results manifest that fna apg treatment is beneficial to was solubilization and release of intracellular organics which might be attributed to the destruction of microbial cell structure by synergistic treatment the characteristics of released soluble organics were further investigated by 3d eem fig 3 shows the 3d eem spectra of the afl under various conditions it was found that a new adsorption peak peak c tryptophan like substances nonbiodegradable occurred after various treatments the fluorescence intensities of peak a tyrosine like substances biodegradable peak b soluble microbial by product substances biodegradable and peak c were the highest for the fna apg samples indicating more soluble organics release meanwhile it could be found that both pi n and pvi n increased remarkably after fna apg treatment demonstrating that combined treatment could effectively release biodegradable substances and thus enhance scfas yield during subsequent af 3 3 effects of fna and apg on sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis three main bioprocesses including hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis that are involved in af can be affected by different treatment conditions two individual tests using model compounds as substrates were carried out to investigate hydrolysis and acidogenesis performances under various treatment conditions moreover accumulated ch4 production at day 5 of af was tested to examine methanogenesis performance the degradation rate of bsa and dextran was the highest under the fna apg condition at day 3 of af viz 75 00 and 79 84 fig 4 a respectively which indicated that fna apg treatment was beneficial to was hydrolysis similar results were found for l alanine and glucose manifesting that fna apg treatment was beneficial to was acidogenesis and showed synergistic effect fig 4 b during af the produced scfas would transform to ch4 due to methanogenesis and the accumulated ch4 yields at day 5 are shown in fig 4 c it is found that fna apg could severely inhibit ch4 production in the sole fna sole apg and fna apg reactors ch4 production was only 32 78 3 24 and 0 64 of that in the blank sample respectively previous study indicated that methanogens were very sensitive to environmental factors e g ph orp and inhibitors therefore the addition of fna and apg would destroy microbial cell structure which was the main contribution to methanogenesis inhibition in addition ph fluctuation under fna apg conditions also suppressed methanogenesis as shown in fig s1 the above analysis indicated that fna apg treatment could promote was hydrolysis and acidogenesis while inhibiting scfas consumption leading to more scfas accumulation in addition scfas accumulation during af was dominated by some key enzymes for example protease and α glucosidase were used for proteins and carbohydrates hydrolysis respectively 35 36 as shown in fig 4 d different treatment conditions could improve the hydrolase activities for example compared with the blank sample the activities of protease and α glucosidase increased by 98 and 55 respectively after fna apg treatment which was consistent with the hydrolysis results shown in fig 4 a 3 4 effects of fna and apg treatments on microbial community during af microbial communities played an important role in scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation 10 37 therefore microbial communities from the blank sample sole fna sole apg and fna apg reactors were analyzed by the illumina hiseq 16s rrna genes sequencing technique the rarefaction curves for all the microbial communities were carried out at 97 similarity level of operational taxonomic units otus and the results showed that the sequencing depth was enough to cover the whole diversity fig s2 a the number of otus from high to low were sole fna 3698 blank 3510 fna apg 3423 and apg 3159 with 883 otus shared by these four reactors fig s2 b these results showed that the fna apg treatment could decrease the microbial community diversity and change the microbial structure to some extent the relative abundances of microbial communities in different reactors were compared at the phylum and genus level proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in the blank and sole fna reactors accounting for 74 66 and 79 79 of the total microbial sequences respectively fig 5 a in the apg and fna apg reactors proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and planctomycetes became the main phyla accounting for 81 50 and 85 86 of the total sequences respectively it was reported that many microbes belonging to proteobacteria and firmicutes could utilize organics to produce scfas especially for acetic acid 38 therefore the increase of relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes could contribute to more scfas accumulation in the fna apg reactor in order to obtain more information about the effect of fna apg treatment on microbial community structure the genus level of different samples was also analyzed as shown in fig 5 b at the genus level the changes in composition and abundance of microbial species were consistent with the phylum level the percentages of enterococcus clostridium and anaerofilum affiliated to firmicutes methylocystis affiliated to proteobacteria and aquihabitans affiliated to actinobacteria had a significant increment in the fna apg reactor among them clostridium which could degrade complex organics to acetic acid increased from 0 46 blank to a maximum of 4 77 in the fna apg reactor enterococcus widely exited in the af environment 39 also increased sharply in the fna apg reactor with relative abundance of 4 39 in addition ottowia a type of nitrate reducing bacteria nrb and consumer of acetic acid which could perform denitrification meanwhile utilize acetate and other small molecule organics in the system 40 decreased to the lowest in the fna apg reactor and this was another reason for more scfas accumulation 3 5 phas synthesis from afl before phas synthesis afl extracted from the reactor with the maximum tscfas production was pretreated by alkali thermal method to remove nh3 n it was worth noting that the tscfas production for phas synthesis decreased slightly from 2541 03 mg cod l to 1689 44 mg cod l during the temporary closure of the laboratory due to covid 19 outbreak in april 2022 in china the characteristics of afl before and after alkali thermal treatment are shown in table s2 after pretreatment nh3 n level decreased from 196 32 mg l to 25 51 mg l and tscfas slightly increased from 1689 44 mg cod l to 1735 63 mg cod l fig 6 shows the phas synthesis performances using pre treated afl as the sole c source during five operation periods at the beginning of each period scfas rich afl was introduced into the media and then phas accumulation occurred immediately meanwhile scfas nh3 n and phosphate contents decreased obviously data not shown as shown in fig s3 do was fluctuant during each synthesis period at the beginning of each aeration period microorganisms that are highly active could consume large amounts of oxygen leading to a do decrease and then do increases gradually accompanied by nutrients consumption in one operation period these results indicated that the substrates could be utilized promptly by phas inocula where a part of the c source was used for cell growth and another for phas synthesis after five operation periods the phas yield increased from initial 15 40 to a maximum of 44 44 of biomass w w among them the polyhydroxybutyrate phb accounted for 61 45 it could be concluded that afl is able to remarkably reduce the phas synthesis cost during recovery and production of phas and has become a promising technology for was treatment and resource recovery fig 7 shows the relative abundance of bacterial community at the genus level from phas synthesis reactor after 5 operation periods lautropia 21 37 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 14 53 paracoccus 7 65 roseibacillus 7 01 flavobacterium 3 72 and leadbetterella 3 03 were the top 6 genera paracoccus was one of the predominant genera which could contribute to phb and phas synthesis using scfas as substrate 41 leadbetterella played a significant role in poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyhexanoate phbhhx synthesis 42 these results analyses indicated that the functional microbes including paracoccus and leadbetterella could utilize afl of fna apg treated sludge for phas synthesis successfully on the other hand in the study of kumar et al 43 acetic acid and ammonium chloride were applied as carbon and nitrogen source respectively the experimental results indicated that a higher c n ratio 144 w w was favorable for phb storage in the biomass achieving a maximum of 33 phb w w accumulation however the c n ratio of the afl in this assay was only 22 45 table s2 and the maximum phb accumulation was 27 31 therefore further study should be carried out to further increase the scfas production and the c n ratio in the afl to improve phas yield when utilizing afl as c source 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that fna apg treatment can improve scfas yield from sludge af when fna and apg dosage was 0 653 mg n l and 0 075 g g vss respectively a maximum tscfas yield of 324 94 mg cod g vss occurred at day 5 showing much more than that of single fna or apg treatment mechanisms analysis indicated that fna apg treatment could accelerate sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidogenesis with the inhibition of scfas consumption meanwhile the acid forming producer including enterococcus and clostridium evidently increased finally afl after ammonia removal was applied as the c source for phas synthesis which could reach a maximum value of 44 44 of biomass w w declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12533,to obtain a high nitrogen removal efficiency and fully use the carbon sources in raw wastewater a novel two step feed three stage anoxic oxic a o moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr system with ten chambers was established for municipal wastewater treatment the designed ten chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system played different roles in nitrogen and organic removals and they accomplished the task of achieving stable high nitrogen removal efficiency at different temperatures together concretely the average total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was improved to 72 88 from 61 55 without any external carbon sources by the second stage a o mbbr subsystem due to the two step feed configuration and it was further improved to 91 42 by the third stage a o mbbr subsystem due to the use of the external carbon sources specific functional biofilms with different bacterial communities r 0 85 p 0 001 and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification r 0 63 p 0 001 were formed in 4 groups of functional zones including the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers this study developed an efficient 2f 3s a o mbbr biological nitrogen removal process and investigated the performance characteristics and bacterial community to provide fundamental support for the application of this process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords step feed anoxic oxic moving bed biofilm reactor biological nitrogen removal municipal wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since last decades moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process has been extensively applied in numerous wastewater treatment plants wwtps and turned out to be a cost effective continual flow process 1 3 compare with conventional activated sludge mbbr systems do not require sludge returns 4 and has a minimal sludge production 90 lower than conventional systems 2 and compared with fixed bed biofilm reactor systems mbbr systems do not require periodic backwashing and it was benefit of low headloss and no filter bed channeling to reduce the nitrogen emissions the biological nitrogen removal bnr technology with nitrification and denitrification has been widely used in many wwtps 5 based on this technology the conventional configuration of mbbr systems for nitrogen removal is anoxic oxic a o mbbr and it has been studied extensively 6 8 as a pre denitrification process the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of a o mbbr is generally determined by internal recycling ratio r and influent carbon nitrogen c n ratio 9 even in the case of sufficient carbon sources for denitrification the nre is also limited by the r for a o mbbr system 10 the operation data of the williams monaco wwtp showed that the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of the a o mbbr was 50 70 at an r of 100 300 10 however the discharge quality standards for wwtps are becoming increasingly stringent 11 it indicated that stringent standards are challenging for the traditional a o mbbr system to obtain a high nre a two stage a o mbbr 2s a o mbbr system was set up in our previous study 12 the pre anoxic and post anoxic chambers in the system use the carbon sources in raw wastewater and external carbon sources for denitrification respectively the process has shown to have the advantages of high nre extreme compactness minimal sludge production and no sludge returns however the maximum removal efficiency of this system without external carbon source dosing was the same as that of a o mbbr system the carbon sources in raw wastewater should be more fully utilized to save cost step feeding strategies with multi stage a o process have been proven to be successful for nitrogen removal with the full use of the carbon sources in raw wastewater 5 zhu et al 13 demonstrated that 95 tn could be removed under a certain influent distribution ratio even without dosing external carbon sources or internal recycling in a step feed bnr process ge et al 14 showed that a three step feed a o system based on activated sludge reached 88 tn removal efficiency at an inflow distribution ratio of 40 30 30 without dosing any external carbon sources zhou et al 5 investigated a three step feed a o biological aerated filter and obtained the highest tn removal efficiency of 81 4 at an inflow distribution ratio of 32 49 19 therefore the introduction of step feed strategies into the 2s a o mbbr systems would be a suitable choice to improve the utilization of carbon sources in raw wastewater by the two step feed configuration and maintain the original advantages of the 2s a o mbbr system 12 15 thus a two step feed three stage a o mbbr 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be developed however there have been few studies on the step feed mbbr process unlike the activated sludge process a highly specialized active biofilm suited for the particular conditions could be formed in each individual functional chamber of the mbbr system and unlike other submerged bed biofilm processes such as biological aerated filter the mbbr process is a continuous flow through process 10 in addition one of the difficulties in the application of the mbbr systems lies in its meticulous design which is based on the concept that the removal goal is achieved with several chambers in series with specific functions 10 therefore all the chambers of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be designed meticulously to achieve the treatment goal 12 which is different from the two step feed process based on the activated sludge and biological aerated filter in addition microbial community is of great significance for the performance and stability of the biological wastewater treatment process 16 as a microorganism driven process the 2f 3s a o mbbr system would be highly dependent on its microbial communities in biofilms also because microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems have large correlations with influent characteristics 17 it is essential to investigate the microbiological information of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system treating real municipal wastewater in addition in mbbr systems biofilms are always maintained in each chamber so the microbial communities in each chamber are different due to the environmental selection effects 1 15 therefore the microbial communities in all the chambers of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be investigated and the differences in microbial communities among all the chambers in the system should be discovered in this study a pilot scale 2f 3s a o mbbr system was set up to obtain a high nre by utilizing the carbon sources in raw wastewater as much as possible to reduce the dosage of external carbon sources the treatment performance of the system was investigated and the details of the organics and nitrogen removal of each chamber in this system were further analyzed in addition high throughput sequencing technology was used to explore the bacterial communities of the chambers in this system and the functional genes for bnr were further analyzed by means of phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust this study proposed to build a practical technology for bnr and provide theoretical supports for its application in municipal wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation as shown in the photo fig 1a and the schematic fig 1b of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system this system contained first stage anoxic chambers a1 and a2 first stage oxic chambers o3 and o4 second stage anoxic chambers a5 and a6 second stage oxic chambers o7 and o8 a third stage anoxic chamber a9 and a third stage oxic chamber o10 in series the working volume of each chamber was 1 0 m3 the influent flow q was 1 0 0 3 m3 h resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h the inflow distribution ratio into a1 and a5 was 50 50 0 5 q 0 5 q ten chambers were seeded with suspended bio carriers k3 500 m2 m3 with a fraction of 35 stirrers and aeration devices were installed in the anoxic and oxic chambers to hold bio carriers in suspension respectively the dissolved oxygen do concentration was not limited in the oxic chambers 6 mg l the internal recycling was from o4 to a1 and from o8 to a5 in the first and second stage a o subsystem respectively the internal recycling flows were 0 6 0 1 m3 h and 1 0 0 4 m3 h respectively because the influent flow and the internal recycling flow fluctuated in this study which may happen during practical operations in wwtps the recycling ratios should be calculated after each measurement after statistical calculation the internal recycling ratios were 1 4 0 5 and 1 0 0 2 for the first stage and second stage a o subsystem respectively during the operation time in this study the total internal recycling ratio of this system was approximately 1 7 0 3 sodium acetates were added to the third stage anoxic chamber a9 as external carbon sources before the study began the system had been running for more than one month under this water quality condition for debugging and optimization and the biofilm had already been mature the system worked stably for 65 days in this study the operating temperature ranged from 10 4 c to 28 6 c the working condition of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system in different phases was shown in table 1 the purpose of setting three phases was mainly to explore the impact of temperature on the system and to investigate the performance characteristics of the system in the situation of excessive external carbon sources addition at the same time concretely firstly for phases i and ii the purpose of settling the two phases was to explore the impact of temperature on the ten chambers of the system secondly for phase iii the purpose of setting this phase was to investigate the performance of a9 and o10 in the situation of excessive external carbon sources addition the operating temperatures in phases ii and iii were close with values of 15 5 2 6 c during the two phases and the external carbon sources were added to a9 therefore the first eight chambers of phases ii and iii were similar in other words for the first eight chambers these two phases could be regarded as a phase the dosage of external carbon sources was excessive in phase iii which may happen during practical operations in wwtps due to improper control 2 2 wastewater characteristics the effluent wastewater of the primary settling tank of a wwtp in qingdao china was fed to this system after pretreatment by a dissolved air flotation system the water quality parameters fluctuated with values of 109 236 mg l for soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 18 16 49 19 mg l for ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 20 15 50 19 mg l for total inorganic nitrogen tin 1 0 mg l for total phosphorus tp 6 28 mg l for suspended solids ss and 6 9 for ph the c n ratio was only 4 3 1 2 2 3 chemical analytical methods during the operation time in this study the influent and effluent water samples of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system were taken every day and the water samples of all chambers in this system were taken at regular intervals immediately the parameters of scod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tp ss and ph were tested and the test methods referred to zhou et al 12 nox n consists of nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n tin consists of nh4 n and nox n 2 4 high throughput sequencing methods during the operation time in this study the bio carriers in all chambers were taken every week immediately the biofilms were scrapped from the bio carriers and stored at 80 c 15 the biofilm samples from the same chamber at the same phase were mixed evenly into a synthetic sample dna extractions and high throughput sequencings were conducted by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china according to standard protocols 18 the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primers 338f and 806r 12 the analysis was performed online by majorbio cloud platform 19 the raw data were submitted to national center for biotechnology information ncbi accession number prjna878628 2 5 predicted potential function analysis picrust has become increasingly accurate due to the upgrading and enlargement of reference genome databases 20 21 thus it was used in this study to further analyze the functional genes in this system the detailed steps of picrust2 were performed in accordance with the literature 22 23 and relevant analysis was done online by majorbio cloud platform 19 information on functional genes was analyzed based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg http www genome jp kegg and kegg orthology ko was applied to identify the functional genes of denitrification and nitrification 2 6 calculation assuming that the influent tin is in the form of nh4 n which is similar to municipal wastewater the theoretical maximum nre of a single stage a o mbbr system based on complete nitrification and denitrification can be calculated by citing standard for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2021 china as follows 1 ƞ max r r 1 100 where ƞ max is the theoretical maximum nre and r is the internal recycling ratio assuming that the influent wastewater is fed to each anoxic chamber at an equal flow rate the theoretical maximum tin removal efficiency can be calculated based on mass balance as follows 24 2 ƞ max 1 1 n 1 r n 1 100 where n is the number of feeding steps and has a value of 2 for a two step feed configuration and rn is the internal recycling ratio of the last step feed subsystem 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance even though the influent concentration and temperature varied during the operating time in phases i ii and iii the effluent scod concentration was 12 42 mg l which was consistently below 50 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 82 04 fig 2a and effluent nh4 n concentration was 0 00 3 25 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 98 56 fig 2b it indicated that at a temperature range of 10 4 28 6 c the 2f 3s a o mbbr system could achieve a stable and good nh4 n removal performance under fluctuating incoming concentrations this is mainly due to the advantage of the mbbr process which has been reported to result in significant nh4 n removal under a wide range of temperatures even at 1 c 25 during the phases i ii and iii the average tin removal efficiencies were 93 90 85 00 and 88 41 respectively fig 2c at a temperature of 26 4 1 7 c and an external carbon source dosage of 50 mg scod l during phase i the effluent tin was 2 36 2 02 mg l at a temperature of 16 9 2 3 c and an external carbon source dosage of 50 mg scod l during phase ii the effluent tin was 4 97 4 77 mg l and at a temperature of 13 5 1 4 c and an external carbon source dosage of 70 mg scod l during phase iii the effluent tin was 4 77 2 29 mg l in a word it is confirmed that 2f 3s a o mbbr system performed well in organics and nitrogen removal in addition the 2f 3s a o mbbr system inherits the advantages of mbbr system the effluent ss of this system was just 49 17 mg l it indicated that one of its advantages was less sludge production in comparison with conventional activated sludge process leading to less sludge disposal cost and smaller footprint and less construction cost of the separation reactor and the carriers of this system were never backwashed indicating its advantages of operational simplicity in comparison with the submerged bed biofilm processes 3 2 variations in pollutant concentrations to further analyze the working mechanism of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system the variations in pollutant concentrations were investigated fig 3 the influent wastewater to a1 included the raw wastewater and the recycling liquid from o4 the nox n concentration of the mixture into a1 was 6 22 1 41 mg l indicating that the first stage a o subsystem could only reduce 6 22 1 41 mg l nox n concentration at most by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater a1 removed nox n by use of carbon sources from raw wastewater in denitrification during the whole operating time a1 could always reduce nox n to a low concentration with an effluent concentration of only 2 13 1 74 mg l the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of a1 was 6 60 fig 3a and c due to the low influent nox n concentration 2 13 1 74 mg l a2 could not play its maximum role in denitrification and the effluent nox n concentration was 1 02 0 71 mg l fig 3c limited by the influent substrate concentration of a2 the nox n removal rate of the first stage a o subsystem did not show better denitrification which was similar to that in the 2s a o mbbr system 12 therefore only one chamber should be considered in the anoxic zones of the first stage a o subsystem and the subsystem should be designed with a shorter hrt concretely a2 could be removed and simultaneously a1 should be a little larger o3 played roles in both scod and nh4 n removal during the whole operating time o3 removed scod that was not used by a1 and a2 and reduced the concentration to 31 8 mg l fig 3a at temperatures of 26 4 1 7 c phase i and 15 5 2 6 c phases ii and iii the average nh4 n removal rates of o3 were 1 50 and 0 69 g nh4 n m2 d respectively fig 3b and the corresponding temperature coefficient 26 of o3 was 1 071 o4 removed the residual nh4 n from o3 and reduced the concentration to 2 46 2 05 mg l although the influent concentration of o4 which was also the effluent of o3 fluctuated in the range of 0 11 10 96 mg l the nox n concentration increased with the decreases in nh4 n concentration due to nitrification in o3 and o4 and the effluent tin concentration of o4 was 12 59 3 53 mg l fig 3b and c in conclusion as for the first stage a o subsystem the average tin removal efficiency was 61 55 by using the raw wastewater as the carbon sources which was similar to the maximum theoretical value 47 4 65 5 calculated by eq 1 the influent wastewater to a5 included the raw wastewater the effluent water from o4 and the recycling liquid from o8 the nox n concentration of the mixture into a5 was 8 79 2 02 mg l indicating that the second stage a o subsystem could reduce 8 79 2 02 mg l nox n concentration at most by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater due to the effluent water from the first stage a o subsystem into the second stage a o subsystem this concentration was significantly more than that of the mixture into a1 which was the reason why the two step feed configuration helped improve the nre the hydraulic loads of the chambers in the second stage a o subsystem were higher than those in the first stage subsystem similar to a1 a5 and a6 removed nox n by use of carbon sources from raw wastewater in denitrification there were no differences in the effluent nox n concentrations of a5 and a6 in different phases p 0 05 fig 3c the effluent nox n concentrations of a5 and a6 during the three phases were 5 94 2 54 and 3 21 1 61 mg l respectively and the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of the anoxic chambers in the second stage a o subsystem was 6 28 fig 3a and c the functions of o7 and o8 were similar to those of o3 and o4 o7 removed scod and reduced the concentration to 24 8 mg l fig 3a at the temperatures of 26 4 1 7 c phase i and 15 5 2 6 c phases ii and iii the average nh4 n removal rates of o7 were 1 36 and 0 54 g nh4 n m2 d respectively fig 3b and the corresponding temperature coefficient of o7 was 1 085 o8 further reduced the concentration to 1 67 1 82 mg l although the influent concentration fluctuated in the range of 0 11 10 36 mg l the effluent tin concentration of o8 was 9 18 3 56 mg l fig 3b and c therefore contributed by both the first and the second stage a o mbbr subsystems the average tin removal efficiency reached 72 88 by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater which was similar to the maximum theoretical value 72 2 77 3 calculated by eq 2 the setup of the second stage a o subsystem with the two step feed configuration increased the tin removal efficiency to 72 88 from 61 55 without dosing any external carbon sources for the 2s a o mbbr system without step feed configuration 12 15 the maximum theoretical nre could only be 47 4 65 5 at the same internal recycling ratio without the last stage a o subsystem for external carbon sources addition therefore it was superior to the 2s a o mbbr system in the utilization of the raw wastewater a9 removed nox n by use of external carbon sources in denitrification during the whole operating time a9 always reduced the nox n concentration to 1 22 1 14 mg l and the denitrification ability of a9 was not affected by either temperature changes or the addition of excessive external carbon sources fig 3c the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of a9 was 3 84 fig 3a and c which was lower than those of the anoxic chambers in the first stage and second stage a o subsystems because of the different types of carbon sources 10 the effluent scod concentration of a9 which was also the influent scod concentration of o10 was 45 10 57 7 and 79 13 mg l in phases i ii and iii respectively fig 3a however o10 always reduced the scod concentration to 24 9 mg l during the whole operating time therefore o10 eliminated the carbon leakage risk resulted from the excessive dosage of external carbon sources as for this system even if the external carbon sources were added in excess phase iii it would not cause carbon leakage the effluent tin concentration of this system o10 was 2 86 2 25 mg l fig 3c therefore the third stage a o subsystem further increased the tin removal efficiency to 91 42 from 72 88 by dosing external carbon sources in the future perspective multistage a o mbbr process may be considered instead of external carbon source addition in the last stage a o subsystem to further achieve energy saving and carbon reduction in conclusion the introduction of two step feed configuration to mbbr could increase the nre without dosing external carbon sources and the third stage a o subsystem could further guarantee the required nre by dosing external carbon sources the designed ten chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system played different roles in nitrogen and organic removals and accomplished the task of achieving stable high nre at different temperatures together the nitrogen removal characteristics of the multiple chambers elaborated in these findings would provide fundamental support for the design and application of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system in municipal wastewater treatment 3 3 bacterial community the bacterial communities of the chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system were explored the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa diagram at the level of 97 optical transform units otus similarity based on the bray curtis distance displayed that the biofilm samples were clustered into 4 groups which corresponded to the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers fig 4a analysis of similarity anosim further confirmed that there were significant differences in the bacterial community among the four biofilm groups r 0 85 p 0 001 the distributions of these four biofilm groups differed mainly on the pc1 axis 29 81 concretely the biofilms in the anoxic chambers and the oxic chambers were distributed further to the right and left sides of the pc1 axis respectively observed the distributions of the biofilm samples on the pc2 axis 14 38 the biofilm samples in phase i were distributed on the lower side of the pc2 axis and the biofilms in phases ii and iii were on the upper side anosim also further confirmed significant differences in the bacterial community between the biofilms in phase i and phases ii and iii r 0 28 p 0 05 however the r value 0 85 of the differences among the four biofilm groups from different chambers was more than three times the r value 0 28 of the differences among the two biofilm groups from phase i and phases ii and iii indicating that sample grouping according to functional chamber was more appreciate which was similar to the results for the 2s a o mbbr system 12 15 as shown in fig 4b 20 genera have been reported as denitrifying genera among the top 30 most abundant identified genera 27 43 nine genera were detected in all four functional chamber groups and their sequence number was over 50 including the functional denitrifying genera trichococcus rhodobacter acinetobacter flavobacterium defluviimonas and limnobacter fig 4c however the oxic chambers did not show a great denitrification ability at the macro scale which is maybe because that denitrification in oxic chambers was inhibited by the high do concentrations 44 in this system trichococcus and rhodobacter were the first and second most abundant genera respectively and have both been reported to be functional denitrifying bacteria 27 28 fig 4b moreover trichococcus has been reported to be the typical filamentous bacteria 45 and may be the skeleton for biofilm formation 46 the denitrifying bacteria acinetobacter and flavobacterium were significantly more abundant in the anoxic chambers than in the oxic chambers p 0 05 in particular they were significantly enriched in the third stage anoxic chamber compared with the other three groups of functional chambers p 0 05 acinetobacter was reported to be the dominant bacteria using nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors in a wastewater treatment system with sodium acetates as the carbon sources 47 flavobacterium was reported to be the dominant genus in reactors with an inoculum for denitrification using acetates as carbon sources 48 therefore the enrichment of the two genera in the third stage anoxic chamber may be due to the use of sodium acetates as external carbon sources hyphomicrobium was detected sequence number 50 in the oxic and second anoxic chambers fig 4c moreover hyphomicrobium was significantly more abundant in the oxic chambers than in the other three groups of functional chambers p 0 001 this genus was reported to be enriched in simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd reactors under aerobic conditions 49 at the macro scale the decreased nh4 n concentration average value 10 30 mg l was significantly higher than the increased nox n concentration average value 9 70 mg l in the oxic chambers of the first stage a o subsystem p 0 05 but the difference was only 0 60 mg l therefore it was speculated that snd was in this system 50 but it was finite denitratisoma was detected sequence number 50 in only the first stage and second stage anoxic chambers this genus was the most dominant genus in the first stage anoxic chambers fig 4b it was also reported to be the dominant denitrifying bacteria in full scale wwtps for domestic wastewater treatment 51 therefore denitratisoma could be dominant in raw wastewater environment there were two nitrifying genera among the top thirty most abundant identified genera which were nitrospira and ellin6067 52 however nitrosomonas and pseudomonas which are categorized as nitrifying bacteria and are usually detected in nitrification systems 52 were not detected sequence number 50 in this system fig 4c ellin6067 was detected sequence number 50 in all 4 groups functional chambers nitrospira was markedly more abundant in the oxic chambers than in other 3 groups of anoxic chambers p 0 001 fig 4b moreover this genus was detected sequence number 50 only in oxic chambers fig 4c correspondingly at the macro scale the nh4 n concentration decreased mainly in the oxic chambers nitrospira was reported to be positively related to the nh4 n removal rate 15 which was consistent with this study therefore the nitrifying and denitrifying genera were abundant in this system and their abundances were different in different functional chambers 3 4 environmental factors affecting bacterial communities there were some environmental factors including do hydraulic load temperature scod load substrate load nh4 n load for oxic chambers and nox n load for anoxic chambers and the external carbon sources selected for analysis because of their different values of different biofilm samples network analysis based on spearman rank correlation was performed to explore the correlations between environmental factors and the top thirty abundant identified bacterial genera r 0 5 p 0 05 the degree of influence of the environmental factors on the bacterial communities was analyzed by the mantel test and was determined by mantel s r in the anoxic chambers of this system the external carbon source was the most influential environmental factor on bacterial communities r 0 51 p 0 01 this environmental factor was correlated with 36 7 11 of the top thirty most abundant identified genera including eight denitrifying bacteria fig 5a acinetobacter and flavobacterium had positive correlations with the external carbon source which further indicated that they were enriched in the chambers with the external carbon source sodium acetate while denitratisoma exhibited the opposite behavior the next most influential environmental factors were hydraulic load r 0 32 p 0 05 scod load r 0 31 p 0 05 and nox n load r 0 27 p 0 05 the hydraulic load and nox n load were both correlated with 26 7 8 of the thirty genera these two factors had positive correlations with the denitrifying bacteria olb13 terrimonas and cl500 29 marine group among them olb13 and cl500 29 marine group also had positive correlations with scod load and were both reported to be heterotrophic 53 54 however because the carbon sources were sufficient for denitrification in this system the scod load was negatively correlated with many denitrifying genera including rhodobacter flavobacterium thermomonas and simplicispira these genera did not have competitive advantages under a high scod load temperature was correlated with only 13 3 4 of the thirty genera including the denitrifying genera rhodobacter thermomonas and simplicispira these genera did not have competitive advantages at low temperature and they were reported to be enriched at high temperature 55 57 in conclusion the external carbon source nox n load hydraulic load scod load and temperature influenced denitrifying genera in the anoxic chambers of this system in the oxic chambers of this system temperature was the most influential environmental factor on bacterial communities r 0 57 p 0 001 which was the opposite of the result in the anoxic chambers this environmental factor was correlated with 30 0 9 of the top thirty most abundant identified genera including the nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and ellin6067 fig 5b however temperature had negative and positive correlations with nitrospira and ellin6067 respectively ellin6067 was dominant in a pyrite based bioretention at low temperature 20 c in a previous study 42 therefore ellin6067 had a competitive advantage at low temperature nitrospira was negatively correlated with not only temperature but also scod load but did not have significant correlations with nh4 n load in conclusion temperature and scod load influenced nitrifying genera in the oxic chambers of this system 3 5 functional genes of denitrification and nitrification denitrification and nitrification were the key pathways in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system for bnr so the functional genes involved in denitrification and nitrification were analyzed the observed genes included k00370 narg narz k00371 narh nary k00374 nari narv k02567 napa k02568 napb k00368 nirk k15864 nirs k04561 norb k02305 norc and k00376 nosz which are involved in denitrification as well as k10944 amoa k10945 amob k10946 amoc k10535 hao k00370 nxra and k00371 nxrb which are involved in nitrification 15 58 59 among them k00370 and k00371 are involved in both denitrification and nitrification as shown in fig 6a based on principal component analysis pca there were four clustered groups in kos involved in denitrification and nitrification which was similar to the results for the bacterial community the 4 groups of samples were also from the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers with a total variance explanation of 74 35 and anosim further confirmed the significant differences among them r 0 63 p 0 001 however the samples taken from phases i ii and iii were not significantly different in kos involved in denitrification and nitrification r 0 02 p 0 05 as shown in fig 6b in the first stage anoxic chambers the total relative abundances of nitrate reductase k00370 k00371 k00374 k02567 and k02568 nitrite reductase k00368 and k15864 nitric oxide reductase k04561 and k02305 and nitrous oxide reductase k00376 were 32 23 28 and 17 respectively in the second stage anoxic chambers they were 29 26 24 and 19 in the third stage anoxic chamber they were 33 18 35 and 14 and in the oxic chambers they were 31 17 20 and 24 therefore the 4 groups of functional chambers all had functional genes of complete denitrification however the relative abundances of k02567 k02568 k15864 k04561 and k02305 were significantly higher in the anoxic chambers than in the oxic chambers p 0 05 fig 6c the corresponding phenomenon at the macro scale was that nox n concentrations were mainly decreased in the anoxic chambers the relative abundances of k10944 k10945 k10946 and k10535 in the oxic chambers were 55 54 56 and 58 respectively which were all greater than the total relative abundances in the three groups of functional anoxic chambers fig 6b moreover more abundant genes of the four kos were found in oxic chambers than in anoxic chambers p 0 05 fig 6c the corresponding phenomenon at the macro scale was that the nh4 n concentrations were mainly decreased in the oxic chambers therefore functional biofilms were formed with different kos for denitrification and nitrification in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system 3 6 environmental factors affecting functional genes of denitrification and nitrification the correlations between environmental factors and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification were explored as shown in fig 7 do affected functional genes of denitrification and nitrification and was correlated with 64 3 9 of the fourteen kos p 0 01 indicating that the division of the anoxic and oxic chambers led to the different functional ko compositions of denitrification and nitrification in particular do was strongly correlated with kos of ammonia nitrogen oxygenase k10944 k10945 and k10946 r 0 4 p 0 01 the external carbon source factor was correlated with 90 9 of the ten kos involved in denitrification p 0 05 higher than the other six factors this results indicated that the external carbon source was the main factor leading to the different functional genetic compositions for denitrification in the third stage anoxic chambers from those in the other two groups of anoxic chambers nh4 n load was correlated with several functional genes of denitrification p 0 05 presumably because the nh4 n load was usually high in the anoxic chambers however temperature and scod load did not show significant correlations with any of the fourteen functional genes p 0 05 hydraulic load was only weakly correlated with k10945 and k10946 r 0 2 p 0 05 and nox n load was only correlated with k00376 nosz r 0 2 p 0 05 therefore temperature scod load hydraulic load and nox n load had little effect on functional genes of denitrification and nitrification in addition all the kos involved only in denitrification were negatively correlated with all the kos involved only in nitrification all the kos involved only in denitrification had positive correlations with each other and all the kos involved only in nitrification had positive correlations with each other further indicating that specific biofilm functional genes of nitrification or denitrification were formed in different chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system 4 conclusions in the present study a pilot scale 2f 3s a o mbbr system was established the two step feed style configuration played important roles in improving the nre in the first stage and second stage a o mbbr subsystems by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater and the required high nre was guaranteed in the third stage subsystem by using external carbon sources specific functional biofilms were formed in the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers with different bacterial communities and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification which contributed to the excellent nitrogen removal of the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12533,to obtain a high nitrogen removal efficiency and fully use the carbon sources in raw wastewater a novel two step feed three stage anoxic oxic a o moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr system with ten chambers was established for municipal wastewater treatment the designed ten chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system played different roles in nitrogen and organic removals and they accomplished the task of achieving stable high nitrogen removal efficiency at different temperatures together concretely the average total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was improved to 72 88 from 61 55 without any external carbon sources by the second stage a o mbbr subsystem due to the two step feed configuration and it was further improved to 91 42 by the third stage a o mbbr subsystem due to the use of the external carbon sources specific functional biofilms with different bacterial communities r 0 85 p 0 001 and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification r 0 63 p 0 001 were formed in 4 groups of functional zones including the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers this study developed an efficient 2f 3s a o mbbr biological nitrogen removal process and investigated the performance characteristics and bacterial community to provide fundamental support for the application of this process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords step feed anoxic oxic moving bed biofilm reactor biological nitrogen removal municipal wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since last decades moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process has been extensively applied in numerous wastewater treatment plants wwtps and turned out to be a cost effective continual flow process 1 3 compare with conventional activated sludge mbbr systems do not require sludge returns 4 and has a minimal sludge production 90 lower than conventional systems 2 and compared with fixed bed biofilm reactor systems mbbr systems do not require periodic backwashing and it was benefit of low headloss and no filter bed channeling to reduce the nitrogen emissions the biological nitrogen removal bnr technology with nitrification and denitrification has been widely used in many wwtps 5 based on this technology the conventional configuration of mbbr systems for nitrogen removal is anoxic oxic a o mbbr and it has been studied extensively 6 8 as a pre denitrification process the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of a o mbbr is generally determined by internal recycling ratio r and influent carbon nitrogen c n ratio 9 even in the case of sufficient carbon sources for denitrification the nre is also limited by the r for a o mbbr system 10 the operation data of the williams monaco wwtp showed that the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of the a o mbbr was 50 70 at an r of 100 300 10 however the discharge quality standards for wwtps are becoming increasingly stringent 11 it indicated that stringent standards are challenging for the traditional a o mbbr system to obtain a high nre a two stage a o mbbr 2s a o mbbr system was set up in our previous study 12 the pre anoxic and post anoxic chambers in the system use the carbon sources in raw wastewater and external carbon sources for denitrification respectively the process has shown to have the advantages of high nre extreme compactness minimal sludge production and no sludge returns however the maximum removal efficiency of this system without external carbon source dosing was the same as that of a o mbbr system the carbon sources in raw wastewater should be more fully utilized to save cost step feeding strategies with multi stage a o process have been proven to be successful for nitrogen removal with the full use of the carbon sources in raw wastewater 5 zhu et al 13 demonstrated that 95 tn could be removed under a certain influent distribution ratio even without dosing external carbon sources or internal recycling in a step feed bnr process ge et al 14 showed that a three step feed a o system based on activated sludge reached 88 tn removal efficiency at an inflow distribution ratio of 40 30 30 without dosing any external carbon sources zhou et al 5 investigated a three step feed a o biological aerated filter and obtained the highest tn removal efficiency of 81 4 at an inflow distribution ratio of 32 49 19 therefore the introduction of step feed strategies into the 2s a o mbbr systems would be a suitable choice to improve the utilization of carbon sources in raw wastewater by the two step feed configuration and maintain the original advantages of the 2s a o mbbr system 12 15 thus a two step feed three stage a o mbbr 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be developed however there have been few studies on the step feed mbbr process unlike the activated sludge process a highly specialized active biofilm suited for the particular conditions could be formed in each individual functional chamber of the mbbr system and unlike other submerged bed biofilm processes such as biological aerated filter the mbbr process is a continuous flow through process 10 in addition one of the difficulties in the application of the mbbr systems lies in its meticulous design which is based on the concept that the removal goal is achieved with several chambers in series with specific functions 10 therefore all the chambers of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be designed meticulously to achieve the treatment goal 12 which is different from the two step feed process based on the activated sludge and biological aerated filter in addition microbial community is of great significance for the performance and stability of the biological wastewater treatment process 16 as a microorganism driven process the 2f 3s a o mbbr system would be highly dependent on its microbial communities in biofilms also because microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems have large correlations with influent characteristics 17 it is essential to investigate the microbiological information of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system treating real municipal wastewater in addition in mbbr systems biofilms are always maintained in each chamber so the microbial communities in each chamber are different due to the environmental selection effects 1 15 therefore the microbial communities in all the chambers of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system should be investigated and the differences in microbial communities among all the chambers in the system should be discovered in this study a pilot scale 2f 3s a o mbbr system was set up to obtain a high nre by utilizing the carbon sources in raw wastewater as much as possible to reduce the dosage of external carbon sources the treatment performance of the system was investigated and the details of the organics and nitrogen removal of each chamber in this system were further analyzed in addition high throughput sequencing technology was used to explore the bacterial communities of the chambers in this system and the functional genes for bnr were further analyzed by means of phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust this study proposed to build a practical technology for bnr and provide theoretical supports for its application in municipal wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation as shown in the photo fig 1a and the schematic fig 1b of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system this system contained first stage anoxic chambers a1 and a2 first stage oxic chambers o3 and o4 second stage anoxic chambers a5 and a6 second stage oxic chambers o7 and o8 a third stage anoxic chamber a9 and a third stage oxic chamber o10 in series the working volume of each chamber was 1 0 m3 the influent flow q was 1 0 0 3 m3 h resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h the inflow distribution ratio into a1 and a5 was 50 50 0 5 q 0 5 q ten chambers were seeded with suspended bio carriers k3 500 m2 m3 with a fraction of 35 stirrers and aeration devices were installed in the anoxic and oxic chambers to hold bio carriers in suspension respectively the dissolved oxygen do concentration was not limited in the oxic chambers 6 mg l the internal recycling was from o4 to a1 and from o8 to a5 in the first and second stage a o subsystem respectively the internal recycling flows were 0 6 0 1 m3 h and 1 0 0 4 m3 h respectively because the influent flow and the internal recycling flow fluctuated in this study which may happen during practical operations in wwtps the recycling ratios should be calculated after each measurement after statistical calculation the internal recycling ratios were 1 4 0 5 and 1 0 0 2 for the first stage and second stage a o subsystem respectively during the operation time in this study the total internal recycling ratio of this system was approximately 1 7 0 3 sodium acetates were added to the third stage anoxic chamber a9 as external carbon sources before the study began the system had been running for more than one month under this water quality condition for debugging and optimization and the biofilm had already been mature the system worked stably for 65 days in this study the operating temperature ranged from 10 4 c to 28 6 c the working condition of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system in different phases was shown in table 1 the purpose of setting three phases was mainly to explore the impact of temperature on the system and to investigate the performance characteristics of the system in the situation of excessive external carbon sources addition at the same time concretely firstly for phases i and ii the purpose of settling the two phases was to explore the impact of temperature on the ten chambers of the system secondly for phase iii the purpose of setting this phase was to investigate the performance of a9 and o10 in the situation of excessive external carbon sources addition the operating temperatures in phases ii and iii were close with values of 15 5 2 6 c during the two phases and the external carbon sources were added to a9 therefore the first eight chambers of phases ii and iii were similar in other words for the first eight chambers these two phases could be regarded as a phase the dosage of external carbon sources was excessive in phase iii which may happen during practical operations in wwtps due to improper control 2 2 wastewater characteristics the effluent wastewater of the primary settling tank of a wwtp in qingdao china was fed to this system after pretreatment by a dissolved air flotation system the water quality parameters fluctuated with values of 109 236 mg l for soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 18 16 49 19 mg l for ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 20 15 50 19 mg l for total inorganic nitrogen tin 1 0 mg l for total phosphorus tp 6 28 mg l for suspended solids ss and 6 9 for ph the c n ratio was only 4 3 1 2 2 3 chemical analytical methods during the operation time in this study the influent and effluent water samples of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system were taken every day and the water samples of all chambers in this system were taken at regular intervals immediately the parameters of scod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tp ss and ph were tested and the test methods referred to zhou et al 12 nox n consists of nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n tin consists of nh4 n and nox n 2 4 high throughput sequencing methods during the operation time in this study the bio carriers in all chambers were taken every week immediately the biofilms were scrapped from the bio carriers and stored at 80 c 15 the biofilm samples from the same chamber at the same phase were mixed evenly into a synthetic sample dna extractions and high throughput sequencings were conducted by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china according to standard protocols 18 the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primers 338f and 806r 12 the analysis was performed

has become increasingly accurate due to the upgrading and enlargement of reference genome databases 20 21 thus it was used in this study to further analyze the functional genes in this system the detailed steps of picrust2 were performed in accordance with the literature 22 23 and relevant analysis was done online by majorbio cloud platform 19 information on functional genes was analyzed based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg http www genome jp kegg and kegg orthology ko was applied to identify the functional genes of denitrification and nitrification 2 6 calculation assuming that the influent tin is in the form of nh4 n which is similar to municipal wastewater the theoretical maximum nre of a single stage a o mbbr system based on complete nitrification and denitrification can be calculated by citing standard for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2021 china as follows 1 ƞ max r r 1 100 where ƞ max is the theoretical maximum nre and r is the internal recycling ratio assuming that the influent wastewater is fed to each anoxic chamber at an equal flow rate the theoretical maximum tin removal efficiency can be calculated based on mass balance as follows 24 2 ƞ max 1 1 n 1 r n 1 100 where n is the number of feeding steps and has a value of 2 for a two step feed configuration and rn is the internal recycling ratio of the last step feed subsystem 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance even though the influent concentration and temperature varied during the operating time in phases i ii and iii the effluent scod concentration was 12 42 mg l which was consistently below 50 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 82 04 fig 2a and effluent nh4 n concentration was 0 00 3 25 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 98 56 fig 2b it indicated that at a temperature range of 10 4 28 6 c the 2f 3s a o mbbr system could achieve a stable and good nh4 n removal performance under fluctuating incoming concentrations this is mainly due to the advantage of the mbbr process which has been reported to result in significant nh4 n removal under a wide range of temperatures even at 1 c 25 during the phases i ii and iii the average tin removal efficiencies were 93 90 85 00 and 88 41 respectively fig 2c at a temperature of 26 4 1 7 c and an external carbon source dosage of 50 mg scod l during phase i the effluent tin was 2 36 2 02 mg l at a temperature of 16 9 2 3 c and an external carbon source dosage of 50 mg scod l during phase ii the effluent tin was 4 97 4 77 mg l and at a temperature of 13 5 1 4 c and an external carbon source dosage of 70 mg scod l during phase iii the effluent tin was 4 77 2 29 mg l in a word it is confirmed that 2f 3s a o mbbr system performed well in organics and nitrogen removal in addition the 2f 3s a o mbbr system inherits the advantages of mbbr system the effluent ss of this system was just 49 17 mg l it indicated that one of its advantages was less sludge production in comparison with conventional activated sludge process leading to less sludge disposal cost and smaller footprint and less construction cost of the separation reactor and the carriers of this system were never backwashed indicating its advantages of operational simplicity in comparison with the submerged bed biofilm processes 3 2 variations in pollutant concentrations to further analyze the working mechanism of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system the variations in pollutant concentrations were investigated fig 3 the influent wastewater to a1 included the raw wastewater and the recycling liquid from o4 the nox n concentration of the mixture into a1 was 6 22 1 41 mg l indicating that the first stage a o subsystem could only reduce 6 22 1 41 mg l nox n concentration at most by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater a1 removed nox n by use of carbon sources from raw wastewater in denitrification during the whole operating time a1 could always reduce nox n to a low concentration with an effluent concentration of only 2 13 1 74 mg l the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of a1 was 6 60 fig 3a and c due to the low influent nox n concentration 2 13 1 74 mg l a2 could not play its maximum role in denitrification and the effluent nox n concentration was 1 02 0 71 mg l fig 3c limited by the influent substrate concentration of a2 the nox n removal rate of the first stage a o subsystem did not show better denitrification which was similar to that in the 2s a o mbbr system 12 therefore only one chamber should be considered in the anoxic zones of the first stage a o subsystem and the subsystem should be designed with a shorter hrt concretely a2 could be removed and simultaneously a1 should be a little larger o3 played roles in both scod and nh4 n removal during the whole operating time o3 removed scod that was not used by a1 and a2 and reduced the concentration to 31 8 mg l fig 3a at temperatures of 26 4 1 7 c phase i and 15 5 2 6 c phases ii and iii the average nh4 n removal rates of o3 were 1 50 and 0 69 g nh4 n m2 d respectively fig 3b and the corresponding temperature coefficient 26 of o3 was 1 071 o4 removed the residual nh4 n from o3 and reduced the concentration to 2 46 2 05 mg l although the influent concentration of o4 which was also the effluent of o3 fluctuated in the range of 0 11 10 96 mg l the nox n concentration increased with the decreases in nh4 n concentration due to nitrification in o3 and o4 and the effluent tin concentration of o4 was 12 59 3 53 mg l fig 3b and c in conclusion as for the first stage a o subsystem the average tin removal efficiency was 61 55 by using the raw wastewater as the carbon sources which was similar to the maximum theoretical value 47 4 65 5 calculated by eq 1 the influent wastewater to a5 included the raw wastewater the effluent water from o4 and the recycling liquid from o8 the nox n concentration of the mixture into a5 was 8 79 2 02 mg l indicating that the second stage a o subsystem could reduce 8 79 2 02 mg l nox n concentration at most by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater due to the effluent water from the first stage a o subsystem into the second stage a o subsystem this concentration was significantly more than that of the mixture into a1 which was the reason why the two step feed configuration helped improve the nre the hydraulic loads of the chambers in the second stage a o subsystem were higher than those in the first stage subsystem similar to a1 a5 and a6 removed nox n by use of carbon sources from raw wastewater in denitrification there were no differences in the effluent nox n concentrations of a5 and a6 in different phases p 0 05 fig 3c the effluent nox n concentrations of a5 and a6 during the three phases were 5 94 2 54 and 3 21 1 61 mg l respectively and the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of the anoxic chambers in the second stage a o subsystem was 6 28 fig 3a and c the functions of o7 and o8 were similar to those of o3 and o4 o7 removed scod and reduced the concentration to 24 8 mg l fig 3a at the temperatures of 26 4 1 7 c phase i and 15 5 2 6 c phases ii and iii the average nh4 n removal rates of o7 were 1 36 and 0 54 g nh4 n m2 d respectively fig 3b and the corresponding temperature coefficient of o7 was 1 085 o8 further reduced the concentration to 1 67 1 82 mg l although the influent concentration fluctuated in the range of 0 11 10 36 mg l the effluent tin concentration of o8 was 9 18 3 56 mg l fig 3b and c therefore contributed by both the first and the second stage a o mbbr subsystems the average tin removal efficiency reached 72 88 by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater which was similar to the maximum theoretical value 72 2 77 3 calculated by eq 2 the setup of the second stage a o subsystem with the two step feed configuration increased the tin removal efficiency to 72 88 from 61 55 without dosing any external carbon sources for the 2s a o mbbr system without step feed configuration 12 15 the maximum theoretical nre could only be 47 4 65 5 at the same internal recycling ratio without the last stage a o subsystem for external carbon sources addition therefore it was superior to the 2s a o mbbr system in the utilization of the raw wastewater a9 removed nox n by use of external carbon sources in denitrification during the whole operating time a9 always reduced the nox n concentration to 1 22 1 14 mg l and the denitrification ability of a9 was not affected by either temperature changes or the addition of excessive external carbon sources fig 3c the corresponding average consumed c n ratio of a9 was 3 84 fig 3a and c which was lower than those of the anoxic chambers in the first stage and second stage a o subsystems because of the different types of carbon sources 10 the effluent scod concentration of a9 which was also the influent scod concentration of o10 was 45 10 57 7 and 79 13 mg l in phases i ii and iii respectively fig 3a however o10 always reduced the scod concentration to 24 9 mg l during the whole operating time therefore o10 eliminated the carbon leakage risk resulted from the excessive dosage of external carbon sources as for this system even if the external carbon sources were added in excess phase iii it would not cause carbon leakage the effluent tin concentration of this system o10 was 2 86 2 25 mg l fig 3c therefore the third stage a o subsystem further increased the tin removal efficiency to 91 42 from 72 88 by dosing external carbon sources in the future perspective multistage a o mbbr process may be considered instead of external carbon source addition in the last stage a o subsystem to further achieve energy saving and carbon reduction in conclusion the introduction of two step feed configuration to mbbr could increase the nre without dosing external carbon sources and the third stage a o subsystem could further guarantee the required nre by dosing external carbon sources the designed ten chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system played different roles in nitrogen and organic removals and accomplished the task of achieving stable high nre at different temperatures together the nitrogen removal characteristics of the multiple chambers elaborated in these findings would provide fundamental support for the design and application of the 2f 3s a o mbbr system in municipal wastewater treatment 3 3 bacterial community the bacterial communities of the chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system were explored the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa diagram at the level of 97 optical transform units otus similarity based on the bray curtis distance displayed that the biofilm samples were clustered into 4 groups which corresponded to the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers fig 4a analysis of similarity anosim further confirmed that there were significant differences in the bacterial community among the four biofilm groups r 0 85 p 0 001 the distributions of these four biofilm groups differed mainly on the pc1 axis 29 81 concretely the biofilms in the anoxic chambers and the oxic chambers were distributed further to the right and left sides of the pc1 axis respectively observed the distributions of the biofilm samples on the pc2 axis 14 38 the biofilm samples in phase i were distributed on the lower side of the pc2 axis and the biofilms in phases ii and iii were on the upper side anosim also further confirmed significant differences in the bacterial community between the biofilms in phase i and phases ii and iii r 0 28 p 0 05 however the r value 0 85 of the differences among the four biofilm groups from different chambers was more than three times the r value 0 28 of the differences among the two biofilm groups from phase i and phases ii and iii indicating that sample grouping according to functional chamber was more appreciate which was similar to the results for the 2s a o mbbr system 12 15 as shown in fig 4b 20 genera have been reported as denitrifying genera among the top 30 most abundant identified genera 27 43 nine genera were detected in all four functional chamber groups and their sequence number was over 50 including the functional denitrifying genera trichococcus rhodobacter acinetobacter flavobacterium defluviimonas and limnobacter fig 4c however the oxic chambers did not show a great denitrification ability at the macro scale which is maybe because that denitrification in oxic chambers was inhibited by the high do concentrations 44 in this system trichococcus and rhodobacter were the first and second most abundant genera respectively and have both been reported to be functional denitrifying bacteria 27 28 fig 4b moreover trichococcus has been reported to be the typical filamentous bacteria 45 and may be the skeleton for biofilm formation 46 the denitrifying bacteria acinetobacter and flavobacterium were significantly more abundant in the anoxic chambers than in the oxic chambers p 0 05 in particular they were significantly enriched in the third stage anoxic chamber compared with the other three groups of functional chambers p 0 05 acinetobacter was reported to be the dominant bacteria using nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors in a wastewater treatment system with sodium acetates as the carbon sources 47 flavobacterium was reported to be the dominant genus in reactors with an inoculum for denitrification using acetates as carbon sources 48 therefore the enrichment of the two genera in the third stage anoxic chamber may be due to the use of sodium acetates as external carbon sources hyphomicrobium was detected sequence number 50 in the oxic and second anoxic chambers fig 4c moreover hyphomicrobium was significantly more abundant in the oxic chambers than in the other three groups of functional chambers p 0 001 this genus was reported to be enriched in simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd reactors under aerobic conditions 49 at the macro scale the decreased nh4 n concentration average value 10 30 mg l was significantly higher than the increased nox n concentration average value 9 70 mg l in the oxic chambers of the first stage a o subsystem p 0 05 but the difference was only 0 60 mg l therefore it was speculated that snd was in this system 50 but it was finite denitratisoma was detected sequence number 50 in only the first stage and second stage anoxic chambers this genus was the most dominant genus in the first stage anoxic chambers fig 4b it was also reported to be the dominant denitrifying bacteria in full scale wwtps for domestic wastewater treatment 51 therefore denitratisoma could be dominant in raw wastewater environment there were two nitrifying genera among the top thirty most abundant identified genera which were nitrospira and ellin6067 52 however nitrosomonas and pseudomonas which are categorized as nitrifying bacteria and are usually detected in nitrification systems 52 were not detected sequence number 50 in this system fig 4c ellin6067 was detected sequence number 50 in all 4 groups functional chambers nitrospira was markedly more abundant in the oxic chambers than in other 3 groups of anoxic chambers p 0 001 fig 4b moreover this genus was detected sequence number 50 only in oxic chambers fig 4c correspondingly at the macro scale the nh4 n concentration decreased mainly in the oxic chambers nitrospira was reported to be positively related to the nh4 n removal rate 15 which was consistent with this study therefore the nitrifying and denitrifying genera were abundant in this system and their abundances were different in different functional chambers 3 4 environmental factors affecting bacterial communities there were some environmental factors including do hydraulic load temperature scod load substrate load nh4 n load for oxic chambers and nox n load for anoxic chambers and the external carbon sources selected for analysis because of their different values of different biofilm samples network analysis based on spearman rank correlation was performed to explore the correlations between environmental factors and the top thirty abundant identified bacterial genera r 0 5 p 0 05 the degree of influence of the environmental factors on the bacterial communities was analyzed by the mantel test and was determined by mantel s r in the anoxic chambers of this system the external carbon source was the most influential environmental factor on bacterial communities r 0 51 p 0 01 this environmental factor was correlated with 36 7 11 of the top thirty most abundant identified genera including eight denitrifying bacteria fig 5a acinetobacter and flavobacterium had positive correlations with the external carbon source which further indicated that they were enriched in the chambers with the external carbon source sodium acetate while denitratisoma exhibited the opposite behavior the next most influential environmental factors were hydraulic load r 0 32 p 0 05 scod load r 0 31 p 0 05 and nox n load r 0 27 p 0 05 the hydraulic load and nox n load were both correlated with 26 7 8 of the thirty genera these two factors had positive correlations with the denitrifying bacteria olb13 terrimonas and cl500 29 marine group among them olb13 and cl500 29 marine group also had positive correlations with scod load and were both reported to be heterotrophic 53 54 however because the carbon sources were sufficient for denitrification in this system the scod load was negatively correlated with many denitrifying genera including rhodobacter flavobacterium thermomonas and simplicispira these genera did not have competitive advantages under a high scod load temperature was correlated with only 13 3 4 of the thirty genera including the denitrifying genera rhodobacter thermomonas and simplicispira these genera did not have competitive advantages at low temperature and they were reported to be enriched at high temperature 55 57 in conclusion the external carbon source nox n load hydraulic load scod load and temperature influenced denitrifying genera in the anoxic chambers of this system in the oxic chambers of this system temperature was the most influential environmental factor on bacterial communities r 0 57 p 0 001 which was the opposite of the result in the anoxic chambers this environmental factor was correlated with 30 0 9 of the top thirty most abundant identified genera including the nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and ellin6067 fig 5b however temperature had negative and positive correlations with nitrospira and ellin6067 respectively ellin6067 was dominant in a pyrite based bioretention at low temperature 20 c in a previous study 42 therefore ellin6067 had a competitive advantage at low temperature nitrospira was negatively correlated with not only temperature but also scod load but did not have significant correlations with nh4 n load in conclusion temperature and scod load influenced nitrifying genera in the oxic chambers of this system 3 5 functional genes of denitrification and nitrification denitrification and nitrification were the key pathways in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system for bnr so the functional genes involved in denitrification and nitrification were analyzed the observed genes included k00370 narg narz k00371 narh nary k00374 nari narv k02567 napa k02568 napb k00368 nirk k15864 nirs k04561 norb k02305 norc and k00376 nosz which are involved in denitrification as well as k10944 amoa k10945 amob k10946 amoc k10535 hao k00370 nxra and k00371 nxrb which are involved in nitrification 15 58 59 among them k00370 and k00371 are involved in both denitrification and nitrification as shown in fig 6a based on principal component analysis pca there were four clustered groups in kos involved in denitrification and nitrification which was similar to the results for the bacterial community the 4 groups of samples were also from the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers with a total variance explanation of 74 35 and anosim further confirmed the significant differences among them r 0 63 p 0 001 however the samples taken from phases i ii and iii were not significantly different in kos involved in denitrification and nitrification r 0 02 p 0 05 as shown in fig 6b in the first stage anoxic chambers the total relative abundances of nitrate reductase k00370 k00371 k00374 k02567 and k02568 nitrite reductase k00368 and k15864 nitric oxide reductase k04561 and k02305 and nitrous oxide reductase k00376 were 32 23 28 and 17 respectively in the second stage anoxic chambers they were 29 26 24 and 19 in the third stage anoxic chamber they were 33 18 35 and 14 and in the oxic chambers they were 31 17 20 and 24 therefore the 4 groups of functional chambers all had functional genes of complete denitrification however the relative abundances of k02567 k02568 k15864 k04561 and k02305 were significantly higher in the anoxic chambers than in the oxic chambers p 0 05 fig 6c the corresponding phenomenon at the macro scale was that nox n concentrations were mainly decreased in the anoxic chambers the relative abundances of k10944 k10945 k10946 and k10535 in the oxic chambers were 55 54 56 and 58 respectively which were all greater than the total relative abundances in the three groups of functional anoxic chambers fig 6b moreover more abundant genes of the four kos were found in oxic chambers than in anoxic chambers p 0 05 fig 6c the corresponding phenomenon at the macro scale was that the nh4 n concentrations were mainly decreased in the oxic chambers therefore functional biofilms were formed with different kos for denitrification and nitrification in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system 3 6 environmental factors affecting functional genes of denitrification and nitrification the correlations between environmental factors and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification were explored as shown in fig 7 do affected functional genes of denitrification and nitrification and was correlated with 64 3 9 of the fourteen kos p 0 01 indicating that the division of the anoxic and oxic chambers led to the different functional ko compositions of denitrification and nitrification in particular do was strongly correlated with kos of ammonia nitrogen oxygenase k10944 k10945 and k10946 r 0 4 p 0 01 the external carbon source factor was correlated with 90 9 of the ten kos involved in denitrification p 0 05 higher than the other six factors this results indicated that the external carbon source was the main factor leading to the different functional genetic compositions for denitrification in the third stage anoxic chambers from those in the other two groups of anoxic chambers nh4 n load was correlated with several functional genes of denitrification p 0 05 presumably because the nh4 n load was usually high in the anoxic chambers however temperature and scod load did not show significant correlations with any of the fourteen functional genes p 0 05 hydraulic load was only weakly correlated with k10945 and k10946 r 0 2 p 0 05 and nox n load was only correlated with k00376 nosz r 0 2 p 0 05 therefore temperature scod load hydraulic load and nox n load had little effect on functional genes of denitrification and nitrification in addition all the kos involved only in denitrification were negatively correlated with all the kos involved only in nitrification all the kos involved only in denitrification had positive correlations with each other and all the kos involved only in nitrification had positive correlations with each other further indicating that specific biofilm functional genes of nitrification or denitrification were formed in different chambers in the 2f 3s a o mbbr system 4 conclusions in the present study a pilot scale 2f 3s a o mbbr system was established the two step feed style configuration played important roles in improving the nre in the first stage and second stage a o mbbr subsystems by using the carbon sources in raw wastewater and the required high nre was guaranteed in the third stage subsystem by using external carbon sources specific functional biofilms were formed in the first stage anoxic second stage anoxic third stage anoxic and oxic chambers with different bacterial communities and functional genes of denitrification and nitrification which contributed to the excellent nitrogen removal of the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12534,the cutting fluid wastewater was treated by freezing air thawing method after thawing stable stratification occurred in the thawing wastewater and the froth floated on the liquid surface and the liquid from top to bottom was divided into the first layer the second layer the third layer and the fourth layer the molecular weight mw distribution and organics characteristics of the froth layer and each layer wastewater were analyzed by ultrafiltration membrane filtration combined with mass balance three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy flourier transform infrared spectroscopy and droplet size analysis the results showed that the cutting fluid wastewater contained 66 74 organics with mw 100 kda and 17 04 organics with mw 1 kda and the organics might contain aromatic and heterocyclic compounds after three times of freezing air thawing 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air the froth layer was mainly macromolecular organic matter with mw 100 kda accounting for 94 59 from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater the content of macromolecules with mw 100 kda gradually decreased while the content of small molecules with mw 1 kda gradually increased the results of molecular weight distribution analysis spectroscopy analysis and droplet size analysis indicated that during the freezing air thawing process there was not only the demulsification maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure the molecular weight distribution of the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater were close to that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater so the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater could be reused in metal process the wastewater in the first second and third layers had better biodegradability which could be treated by biological method graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cutting fluid wastewater freezing air thawing pretreatment organics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cutting fluid consists of mineral oil preservative rust remover surfactant water and other additives and it has the functions of cooling lubrication cleaning and rust prevention in the process of metalworking however as a kind of refractory industrial wastewater waste cutting fluid contains a large amount of organic matter and has poor biodegradability 1 in addition the cutting fluid wastewater always contains a lot of oil 2 4 in order to avoid the environmental pollution caused by cutting fluid wastewater physical or chemical methods were usually used for demulsification pretreatment of this kind of wastewater tembhurkar and deshpande 5 adsorbed cutting oil from wastewater with powdered activated lemon peels as adsorbent but the used adsorbent was difficult to treat or recycle the treatment of oily wastewater with membranes 6 9 had a higher removal efficiency but the membrane was easy to be blocked and polluted and the membrane flux was prone to decrease an et al 10 reviewed oil containing wastewater treatment by electrocoagulation and it was pointed out that corrosive coagulants might produce a large amount of hazardous sludge zhang et al 11 pretreated cutting fluid wastewater by fenton oxidation but the cost of fenton process was high for wastewater treatment xiong et al 12 used fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps to enhance polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide coagulation demulsification but the recycling of mnps was a problem to be solved yu et al 13 reviewed coagulation treatment of oily wastewater and summarized that the components of cutting fluid wastewater produced by different metalworking industries varied greatly a large number of experiments were needed to screen coagulants for each kind of cutting fluid wastewater and meanwhile a large amount of floc precipitation would be produced during the coagulation process which was difficult to treat and easy to cause secondary pollution according to lin et al 14 and feng et al 15 the freezing air thawing showed strong demulsification ability for emulsion wastewater with high stability and it did not need any chemical additions and did not cause secondary pollution to the environment and the treatment process was simple feng et al 15 treated the cutting fluid wastewater by freeze thaw method and investigated the effects of two freezing ways i e cryogenic bath and refrigerator freezing temperature freezing time ph and nacl on the cod removal efficiency and oil recovery concentration and meanwhile determined the optimum operation conditions of freeze thaw by single factor experiment chang et al 16 pretreated cutting fluid wastewater by freezing air thawing method based on the stratified analysis of organic matter concentration in the thawing wastewater chang et al 16 obtained the optimal freezing time thawing time and freezing air thawing times by response surface methodology although feng et al 15 and chang et al 16 obtained their own optimum operation conditions they did not measure and analyze the distribution transfer and transformation of organic matter before and after freezing air thawing so this study pretreated the real cutting fluid wastewater by freezing air thawing and the molecular weight mw distribution biodegradability three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy ultraviolet uv absorption spectroscopy flourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and micrograph of wastewater before and after pretreatment were analyzed to explore the effect of freezing air thawing on the distribution transfer and transformation of the organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater characteristics the cutting fluid wastewater was taken from an aluminum metalworking plant in tianjin and as shown in fig 1 a its color was milky white the raw wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 in order to determine the emulsion type of the wastewater the raw cutting fluid wastewater was diluted with water or organic liquid 17 based on the similarity intermiscibility principle 200 μl of raw cutting fluid wastewater was dropped into the test tube containing 5 ml deionized water or 5 ml methanol respectively 2 2 freezing air thawing procedure 550 ml of raw cutting fluid wastewater was taken into a glass beaker of 9 cm diameter and 12 cm height along the outer wall of the glass beaker 3 marking lines were made at 2 5 cm intervals from the bottom the glass beaker containing raw wastewater was frozen in the refrigerator bcd 208 k a refrigerator haier china at 20 c for 19 84 h and then thawed in air for 6 94 h 16 after freezing all cutting fluid wastewater was frozen at the beginning of thawing the surface of frozen ice and the surrounding wall of the beaker were in contact with air so the temperature rose rapidly and ice melted into liquid first in these places as the thawing continued more liquid was melted out and meanwhile the frozen ice shrank and froth began to appear when the thawing liquid increased to a certain amount and the ice shrank to a certain degree the lower part of the ice floated in the liquid and the upper part exposed to air through the froth until the ice melted completely after thawing stable stratification occurred in the thawing wastewater as shown in fig 1 b the froth floated on the liquid surface and the middle liquid below froth was relatively clear and the bottom liquid was relatively turbid after each freezing air thawing the surface froth was skimmed off and the remaining wastewater was stirred evenly for the next freezing the freezing air thawing was repeated 3 times 16 and the skimmed froth after each freezing air thawing was collected and mixed together which was called the froth layer after the third freezing air thawing the liquid from top to bottom was divided into the first layer namely the liquid from the surface to the upper marking line the second layer namely the liquid from the upper marking line to the middle marking line the third layer namely the liquid from the middle marking line to the lower marking line and the fourth layer namely the liquid from the lower marking line to the bottom 2 3 sample analysis the raw cutting fluid wastewater each layer of wastewater after the

and the froth layer were filtered step by step the ultrafiltration membrane was pretreated before use that is put the smooth surface of the membrane downward into ultrapure water for immersion and then changed the water once every hour and repeated it three times 18 the raw cutting fluid wastewater the froth layer and the first to fourth layer of wastewater after freezing air thawing were diluted by 100 times and were put into an ultrafiltration cup respectively with high pure nitrogen 99 999 as the driving force 0 2 mpa the diluted samples were step by step filtered by 100 kda 50 kda 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda ultrafiltration membranes φ 80 mm 19 for each sample took some filtrate to determine toc after each filtration and then the molecular weight distribution of organic matter in the sample was calculated the average droplet size zetasizer nano zs england and microscopic morphology observation microscope zeiss germany of the raw cutting fluid wastewater the froth after the first second and third freezing air thawing the fourth layer wastewater and the mixed wastewater of the first second and third layer after the third freezing air thawing were carried out 2 4 percentage calculation of molecular weight distribution the toc and oil mass which were volatilized into the air was calculated by the mass balance method the formulas are as follows 1 m 0 c 0 v 0 2 m

the volume of the raw cutting fluid wastewater l in formula 2 subscript i could be replaced by f 1 2 3 and 4 which respectively represent the froth layer and the first to fourth layer wastewater after freezing air thawing m i is toc or oil mass of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater mg c i is the toc or oil concentration of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater mg l v i is the volume of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater l in formula 3 m v is the toc or oil mass mg volatilized into the air the proportion of m v and m i in m 0 can be expressed as 4 η v m v 100 m 0 5 η i m i 100 m 0 in formula 4 and formula 5 η v is the ratio of m v to m 0 η i is the ratio of m i to m 0 2 5 chemical analysis cod toc bod5 and oil content were analyzed according to chinese standard methods 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of emulsion type the droplet in the emulsion is called the internal phase or dispersed phase and the part surrounding the droplet is called the external phase or continuous phase one phase of emulsion is water or aqueous solution which is called aqueous phase and the other phase is organic liquid which is insoluble in water and is called oil phase 21 as shown in fig 2 the emulsion with oil as the external phase and water as the internal phase is called water in oil w o emulsion while the emulsion with water as the external phase and oil as the internal phase is called oil in water o w emulsion the raw cutting fluid wastewater dropped into the deionized water showing milky white and dispersing slowly however when the raw cutting fluid wastewater dropped into the methanol it dispersed rapidly and kept the liquid transparent the external phase of w o emulsion is oil phase which is easy to dissolve in methanol so it can disperse rapidly in methanol and keep it transparent however the external oil phase of w o emulsion is insoluble in water so it disperses slowly in water and makes the water turbid thus the raw cutting fluid wastewater was w o emulsion the final state was shown in fig 3 3 2 molecular weight distribution as shown in fig 4 the main raw cutting fluid wastewater were the fraction with mw 100 kda and the fraction with mw 1 kda and the above two parts respectively accounted for 66 74 and 17 04 of total toc and the fraction with mw 100 1 kda only accounted for 16 22 as shown in fig 4 and table 2 after freezing air thawing from the first layer to the fourth layer the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda decreased and the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda increased the content of fractions with mw 100 50 kda mw 50 10 kda mw 10 3 kda and mw 3 1 kda in the fourth layer were significantly higher than that in the first second and third layers the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda in the froth layer was much higher than that in the first second third and fourth layer wastewater while the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda were very low in the froth layer the proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda accounted for 94 59 of total toc which indicated that the froth layer mainly contained macromolecular organic matter and oil with mw 100 kda during freezing process both the internal phase water droplets and the external oil phase of the cutting fluid wastewater froze and solidified into ice crystals the ice crystals pierced the oil water interfacial film 22 so that the surfactant was discharged from the oil water interfacial film 23 and the strength of the oil water interfacial film was reduced therefore during the thawing process due to the incomplete oil water interfacial film water droplets and oil gathered respectively as the size of water droplets became larger it was easier to sink into the lower layer while the oil floated up after gathering because their density is less than that of water as a result as shown in table 2 oil content of the froth layer was 18 740 mg l after three times of freezing air thawing which was much higher than that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater due to the strong lipophilicity of macromolecular organic matter with mw 100 kda the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda was higher in the froth layer and the first layer while due to the strong hydrophilicity of small molecule organic matter with mw 1 kda the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda was increased from top to bottom namely from the froth layer to the fourth layer after freezing air thawing the sum of toc mass from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater accounted for 72 47 of total toc mass in the raw cutting fluid wastewater based on the mass balance method according to formulas 3 and 4 the η v was calculated to be 27 53 which indicated that 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air after freezing air thawing three times lu et al 24 found that the volatile content of oil based cutting fluid was 5 7 6 0 g l suuronen et al 25 found that the volatile organic matter in the metalworking fluid could be collected on tenax adsorbent and detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometer after thermal desorption this also indicated that there was volatile organic matter in the cutting fluid as shown in table 2 the oil volatilized into the air m v was calculated to be 533 mg by formula 3 the result also showed that the 64 76 organic matter which was volatilized into the air during freezing air thawing was oil compared with the toc mass of different fractions in the raw cutting fluid wastewater the sum of toc mass from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater with mw 100 kda decreased by 53 83 and with mw 10 3 kda decreased by 42 50 and with 100 50 kda 50 10 kda 3 1 kda and 1 kda increased by 164 56 81 58 10 00 and 29 47 respectively the above result showed that there was not only the demulsification that led to the gathering of water droplets or oil phase during the freezing air thawing process maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure by ice crystal extrusion that led to destroy macromolecules into small molecules after mixing the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater together the proportions of the fraction with the different molecular weight were shown in fig 4 in the above mixture the proportions of the fraction with mw 100 kda mw 100 1 kda and mw 1 kda and were 53 39 27 37 and 19 24 respectively which were close to that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater so it indicated that the mixture composition of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater was similar to the raw cutting fluid wastewater meanwhile as shown in table 2 the oil contents of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater were also high according to the common reuse method of cutting fluid wastewater in machinery factory that is after filtering the cutting fluid wastewater by membrane the filtrate was supplemented with new cutting fluid and then reused in the metal process 4 26 so ultrafiltration membrane was used to filter the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater and then new cutting fluid was added into the filtrate which was reused in metal process as shown in fig 4 the macromolecular organics with mw 100 kda accounted for a large proportion in the raw cutting fluid wastewater and froth layer while the small molecular organics with mw 1 kda accounted for a small proportion according to table 3 it could be seen that the biodegradability of the raw cutting fluid wastewater and froth layer was poor with b c of 0 07 and 0 06 respectively however after freezing air thawing the macromolecular organics with mw 100 kda accounted for less in the first the second and the third layer wastewater while the small molecular organics with mw 1 kda accounted for more as listed in table 3 after freezing air thawing the wastewater in the first the second and the third layer had better biodegradability with b c values of 0 24 0 30 and 0 27 respectively bod5 cod values were between 0 2 and 0 3 which could be treated by biological method 27 3 3 three dimensional fluorescence characteristics of wastewater as shown in fig 5 two fluorescence peaks with ex em of 225 240 340 370 nm and ex em of 250 300 345 390 nm were observed in the 3d eem spectra in each wastewater sample according to khan et al 28 peak t2 with ex em at 225 237 340 381 nm indicated the tryptophan like compounds peak b with ex em 250 300 320 410 nm indicated the presence of tyrosine like compounds meanwhile proteins and peptides were identified by fluorescence by amino acids i e phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine 28 and these amino acids generated fluorescence due to the presence of homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic moieties 29 so peak b and peak t2 were also referred to protein like organic matter 28 huang et al 30 showed that petroleum matters were mainly composed of hydrocarbons such as alkanes cycloalkanes and aromatics and the fluorescence measurement results of petroleum matters were mainly peak b and peak t2 compared with the raw cutting fluid wastewater the intensities of the two fluorescence peaks peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer were significantly enhanced the reason might be that the density of oil is less than that of water and oil floated up into the froth layer after freezing air thawing which led to the enhancement of peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer combined with fig 4 the proportion of macromolecules with mw 100 kda in the froth layer was much higher than that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater so the two fluorescence peaks peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer might be mainly caused by the macromolecules with mw 100 kda the intensities of peak b and peak t2 in the first the second and the third layer wastewater were obviously weaker than those in the raw cutting fluid wastewater which might be because the toc concentrations and oil contents in the those layers decreased significantly compared with that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater the intensities of peak b and peak t2 in the fourth layer waste water was almost unchanged as the toc concentration and oil content didn t change significantly compared with that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater 3 4 ultraviolet absorption characteristics of wastewater as the uv absorbance of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds represented in 240 250 nm 31 32 as shown in fig 6 the uv absorbance before and after freezing air thawing were all between 200 and 250 nm which indicated that the organic compounds in the cutting fluid wastewater contained aromatic compounds and heterocyclic compounds the result was consistent with that of the 3d eem spectra namely there was the protein like organic matter with homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic moieties in the cutting fluid wastewater compared with the raw cutting fluid wastewater the uv absorbances of the first the second and the third layer thawing wastewater decreased significantly which might be because the toc concentration of each layer thawing wastewater was obviously lower than that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater 3 5 infrared spectral characteristics of wastewater as shown in fig 7 the peak at 1646 cm 1 and the band of 3000 3700 cm 1 were related to the oh bending and h oh stretching of water molecules 33 the peaks of 2850 3000 cm 1 was associated with asymmetrical stretching of ch bond in ch3 and ch2 34 36 the peaks of 1700 1800 cm 1 was assigned to co group of esters 37 the peaks around 1660 2000 cm 1 was related to aromatic compounds 34 38 the peaks at 1378 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were related to the symmetrical bending of ch in ch3 and ch2 respectively 34 36 the peaks around 1240 1340 cm 1 was attributed to the cn amide iii band 39 the peaks around 1200 1000 cm 1 was associated to c o c group 35 39 these results showed that there might be aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in wastewater which was in agreement with the results of 3d eem spectra and uv absorption spectra the peaks around 445 570 cm 1 was associated with branched chain alkanes 38 which appeared in the first second third layer wastewater and the froth layer so these might be indicated that freezing air thawing process could destroy macromolecules into small molecules 3 6 droplet size analysis the average droplet size of the raw cutting fluid wastewater was 281 nm as shown in fig 8 after freezing air thawing three times the average droplet sizes of the mixture of the first the second and the third layer wastewater and the fourth layer wastewater were 1887 nm and 2239 nm respectively which were significantly larger than that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater and meanwhile the droplet size of the fourth layer wastewater was larger than that of the mixture of the first second and third layer wastewater too the average droplet sizes of the froth grew significantly with the increase of freezing air thawing times after the first second and third thawing which were 2160 nm 3992 nm and 5982 nm respectively and after the third thawing the droplets in the froth gathered into a cluster chi 40 extracted peanut oil from aqueous emulsion by freezing thawing and found that the droplet size increased significantly after thawing feng et al 15 also found that the droplet size significantly increased after freeze thaw treatment of cutting fluid wastewater 4 conclusions the raw cutting fluid wastewater used in the experiment was water in oil emulsion and it contained 66 74 organic matter with mw 100 kda and 17 04 organic matter with mw 1 kda the cutting fluid wastewater contained aromatic and heterocyclic compounds before and after freezing air thawing during the freezing air thawing process there was not only the demulsification maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure after three times of freezing air thawing 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda decreased and the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda increased from the froth layer to the fourth layer the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater could be reused in metal process while the wastewater in the first second and third layers could be treated by biological method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12534,the cutting fluid wastewater was treated by freezing air thawing method after thawing stable stratification occurred in the thawing wastewater and the froth floated on the liquid surface and the liquid from top to bottom was divided into the first layer the second layer the third layer and the fourth layer the molecular weight mw distribution and organics characteristics of the froth layer and each layer wastewater were analyzed by ultrafiltration membrane filtration combined with mass balance three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy flourier transform infrared spectroscopy and droplet size analysis the results showed that the cutting fluid wastewater contained 66 74 organics with mw 100 kda and 17 04 organics with mw 1 kda and the organics might contain aromatic and heterocyclic compounds after three times of freezing air thawing 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air the froth layer was mainly macromolecular organic matter with mw 100 kda accounting for 94 59 from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater the content of macromolecules with mw 100 kda gradually decreased while the content of small molecules with mw 1 kda gradually increased the results of molecular weight distribution analysis spectroscopy analysis and droplet size analysis indicated that during the freezing air thawing process there was not only the demulsification maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure the molecular weight distribution of the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater were close to that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater so the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater could be reused in metal process the wastewater in the first second and third layers had better biodegradability which could be treated by biological method graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cutting fluid wastewater freezing air thawing pretreatment organics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cutting fluid consists of mineral oil preservative rust remover surfactant water and other additives and it has the functions of cooling lubrication cleaning and rust prevention in the process of metalworking however as a kind of refractory industrial wastewater waste cutting fluid contains a large amount of organic matter and has poor biodegradability 1 in addition the cutting fluid wastewater always contains a lot of oil 2 4 in order to avoid the environmental pollution caused by cutting fluid wastewater physical or chemical methods were usually used for demulsification pretreatment of this kind of wastewater tembhurkar and deshpande 5 adsorbed cutting oil from wastewater with powdered activated lemon peels as adsorbent but the used adsorbent was difficult to treat or recycle the treatment of oily wastewater with membranes 6 9 had a higher removal efficiency but the membrane was easy to be blocked and polluted and the membrane flux was prone to decrease an et al 10 reviewed oil containing wastewater treatment by electrocoagulation and it was pointed out that corrosive coagulants might produce a large amount of hazardous sludge zhang et al 11 pretreated cutting fluid wastewater by fenton oxidation but the cost of fenton process was high for wastewater treatment xiong et al 12 used fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps to enhance polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide coagulation demulsification but the recycling of mnps was a problem to be solved yu et al 13 reviewed coagulation treatment of oily wastewater and summarized that the components of cutting fluid wastewater produced by different metalworking industries varied greatly a large number of experiments were needed to screen coagulants for each kind of cutting fluid wastewater and meanwhile a large amount of floc precipitation would be produced during the coagulation process which was difficult to treat and easy to cause secondary pollution according to lin et al 14 and feng et al 15 the freezing air thawing showed strong demulsification ability for emulsion wastewater with high stability and it did not need any chemical additions and did not cause secondary pollution to the environment and the treatment process was simple feng et al 15 treated the cutting fluid wastewater by freeze thaw method and investigated the effects of two freezing ways i e cryogenic bath and refrigerator freezing temperature freezing time ph and nacl on the cod removal efficiency and oil recovery concentration and meanwhile determined the optimum operation conditions of freeze thaw by single factor experiment chang et al 16 pretreated cutting fluid wastewater by freezing air thawing method based on the stratified analysis of organic matter concentration in the thawing wastewater chang et al 16 obtained the optimal freezing time thawing time and freezing air thawing times by response surface methodology although feng et al 15 and chang et al 16 obtained their own optimum operation conditions they did not measure and analyze the distribution transfer and transformation of organic matter before and after freezing air thawing so this study pretreated the real cutting fluid wastewater by freezing air thawing and the molecular weight mw distribution biodegradability three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy ultraviolet uv absorption spectroscopy flourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and micrograph of wastewater before and after pretreatment were analyzed to explore the effect of freezing air thawing on the distribution transfer and transformation of the organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater characteristics the cutting fluid wastewater was taken from an aluminum metalworking plant in tianjin and as shown in fig 1 a its color was milky white the raw wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 in order to determine the emulsion type of the wastewater the raw cutting fluid wastewater was diluted with water or organic liquid 17 based on the similarity intermiscibility principle 200 μl of raw cutting fluid wastewater was dropped into the test tube containing 5 ml deionized water or 5 ml methanol respectively 2 2 freezing air thawing procedure 550 ml of raw cutting fluid wastewater was taken into a glass beaker of 9 cm diameter and 12 cm height along the outer wall of the glass beaker 3 marking lines were made at 2 5 cm intervals from the bottom the glass beaker containing raw wastewater was frozen in the refrigerator bcd 208 k a refrigerator haier china at 20 c for 19 84 h and then thawed in air for 6 94 h 16 after freezing all cutting fluid wastewater was frozen at the beginning of thawing the surface of frozen ice and the surrounding wall of the beaker were in contact with air so the temperature rose rapidly and ice melted into liquid first in these places as the thawing continued more liquid was melted out and meanwhile the frozen ice shrank and froth began to appear when the thawing liquid increased to a certain amount and the ice shrank to a certain degree the lower part of the ice floated in the liquid and the upper part exposed to air through the froth until the ice melted completely after thawing stable stratification occurred in the thawing wastewater as shown in fig 1 b the froth floated on the liquid surface and the middle liquid below froth was relatively clear and the bottom liquid was relatively turbid after each freezing air thawing the surface froth was skimmed off and the remaining wastewater was stirred evenly for the next freezing the freezing air thawing was repeated 3 times 16 and the skimmed froth after each freezing air thawing was collected and mixed together which was called the froth layer after the third freezing air thawing the liquid from top to bottom was divided into the first layer namely the liquid from the surface to the upper marking line the second layer namely the liquid from the upper marking line to the middle marking line the third layer namely the liquid from the middle marking line to the lower marking line and the fourth layer namely the liquid from the lower marking line to the bottom 2 3 sample analysis the raw cutting fluid wastewater each layer of wastewater after the

hach usa oil content and bod5 oxitop bod analyzer wtw germany at same time and then b c was calculated the raw cutting fluid wastewater each layer of wastewater after the third freezing air thawing and the froth layer were filtered step by step the ultrafiltration membrane was pretreated before use that is put the smooth surface of the membrane downward into ultrapure water for immersion and then changed the water once every hour and repeated it three times 18 the raw cutting fluid wastewater the froth layer and the first to fourth layer of wastewater after freezing air thawing were diluted by 100 times and were put into an ultrafiltration cup respectively with high pure nitrogen 99 999 as the driving force 0 2 mpa the diluted samples were step by step filtered by 100 kda 50 kda 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda ultrafiltration membranes φ 80 mm 19 for each sample took some filtrate to determine toc after each filtration and then the molecular weight distribution of organic matter in the sample was calculated the average droplet size zetasizer nano zs england and microscopic morphology observation microscope zeiss germany of the raw cutting fluid wastewater the froth after the first second and third freezing air thawing the fourth layer wastewater and the mixed wastewater of the first second and third layer after the third freezing air thawing were carried out 2 4 percentage calculation of molecular weight distribution the toc and oil mass which were volatilized into the air was calculated by the mass balance method the formulas are as follows 1 m 0 c 0 v 0 2 m i c i v i 3 m v m 0 m f m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 in formula 1 m 0 is the toc or oil mass of the raw cutting fluid wastewater mg c 0 is toc or oil concentration of the raw cutting fluid wastewater mg l v 0 is the volume of the raw cutting fluid wastewater l in formula 2 subscript i could be replaced by f 1 2 3 and 4 which respectively represent the froth layer and the first to fourth layer wastewater after freezing air thawing m i is toc or oil mass of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater mg c i is the toc or oil concentration of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater mg l v i is the volume of the froth layer or the first to fourth layer wastewater l in formula 3 m v is the toc or oil mass mg volatilized into the air the proportion of m v and m i in m 0 can be expressed as 4 η v m v 100 m 0 5 η i m i 100 m 0 in formula 4 and formula 5 η v is the ratio of m v to m 0 η i is the ratio of m i to m 0 2 5 chemical analysis cod toc bod5 and oil content were analyzed according to chinese standard methods 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of emulsion type the droplet in the emulsion is called the internal phase or dispersed phase and the part surrounding the droplet is called the external phase or continuous phase one phase of emulsion is water or aqueous solution which is called aqueous phase and the other phase is organic liquid which is insoluble in water and is called oil phase 21 as shown in fig 2 the emulsion with oil as the external phase and water as the internal phase is called water in oil w o emulsion while the emulsion with water as the external phase and oil as the internal phase is called oil in water o w emulsion the raw cutting fluid wastewater dropped into the deionized water showing milky white and dispersing slowly however when the raw cutting fluid wastewater dropped into the methanol it dispersed rapidly and kept the liquid transparent the external phase of w o emulsion is oil phase which is easy to dissolve in methanol so it can disperse rapidly in methanol and keep it transparent however the external oil phase of w o emulsion is insoluble in water so it disperses slowly in water and makes the water turbid thus the raw cutting fluid wastewater was w o emulsion the final state was shown in fig 3 3 2 molecular weight distribution as shown in fig 4 the main raw cutting fluid wastewater were the fraction with mw 100 kda and the fraction with mw 1 kda and the above two parts respectively accounted for 66 74 and 17 04 of total toc and the fraction with mw 100 1 kda only accounted for 16 22 as shown in fig 4 and table 2 after freezing air thawing from the first layer to the fourth layer the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda decreased and the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda increased the content of fractions with mw 100 50 kda mw 50 10 kda mw 10 3 kda and mw 3 1 kda in the fourth layer were significantly higher than that in the first second and third layers the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda in the froth layer was much higher than that in the first second third and fourth layer wastewater while the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda were very low in the froth layer the proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda accounted for 94 59 of total toc which indicated that the froth layer mainly contained macromolecular organic matter and oil with mw 100 kda during freezing process both the internal phase water droplets and the external oil phase of the cutting fluid wastewater froze and solidified into ice crystals the ice crystals pierced the oil water interfacial film 22 so that the surfactant was discharged from the oil water interfacial film 23 and the strength of the oil water interfacial film was reduced therefore during the thawing process due to the incomplete oil water interfacial film water droplets and oil gathered respectively as the size of water droplets became larger it was easier to sink into the lower layer while the oil floated up after gathering because their density is less than that of water as a result as shown in table 2 oil content of the froth layer was 18 740 mg l after three times of freezing air thawing which was much higher than that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater due to the strong lipophilicity of macromolecular organic matter with mw 100 kda the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda was higher in the froth layer and the first layer while due to the strong hydrophilicity of small molecule organic matter with mw 1 kda the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda was increased from top to bottom namely from the froth layer to the fourth layer after freezing air thawing the sum of toc mass from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater accounted for 72 47 of total toc mass in the raw cutting fluid wastewater based on the mass balance method according to formulas 3 and 4 the η v was calculated to be 27 53 which indicated that 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air after freezing air thawing three times lu et al 24 found that the volatile content of oil based cutting fluid was 5 7 6 0 g l suuronen et al 25 found that the volatile organic matter in the metalworking fluid could be collected on tenax adsorbent and detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometer after thermal desorption this also indicated that there was volatile organic matter in the cutting fluid as shown in table 2 the oil volatilized into the air m v was calculated to be 533 mg by formula 3 the result also showed that the 64 76 organic matter which was volatilized into the air during freezing air thawing was oil compared with the toc mass of different fractions in the raw cutting fluid wastewater the sum of toc mass from the froth layer to the fourth layer wastewater with mw 100 kda decreased by 53 83 and with mw 10 3 kda decreased by 42 50 and with 100 50 kda 50 10 kda 3 1 kda and 1 kda increased by 164 56 81 58 10 00 and 29 47 respectively the above result showed that there was not only the demulsification that led to the gathering of water droplets or oil phase during the freezing air thawing process maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure by ice crystal extrusion that led to destroy macromolecules into small molecules after mixing the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater together the proportions of the fraction with the different molecular weight were shown in fig 4 in the above mixture the proportions of the fraction with mw 100 kda mw 100 1 kda and mw 1 kda and were 53 39 27 37 and 19 24 respectively which were close to that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater so it indicated that the mixture composition of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater was similar to the raw cutting fluid wastewater meanwhile as shown in table 2 the oil contents of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater were also high according to the common reuse method of cutting fluid wastewater in machinery factory that is after filtering the cutting fluid wastewater by membrane the filtrate was supplemented with new cutting fluid and then reused in the metal process 4 26 so ultrafiltration membrane was used to filter the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater and then new cutting fluid was added into the filtrate which was reused in metal process as shown in fig 4 the macromolecular organics with mw 100 kda accounted for a large proportion in the raw cutting fluid wastewater and froth layer while the small molecular organics with mw 1 kda accounted for a small proportion according to table 3 it could be seen that the biodegradability of the raw cutting fluid wastewater and froth layer was poor with b c of 0 07 and 0 06 respectively however after freezing air thawing the macromolecular organics with mw 100 kda accounted for less in the first the second and the third layer wastewater while the small molecular organics with mw 1 kda accounted for more as listed in table 3 after freezing air thawing the wastewater in the first the second and the third layer had better biodegradability with b c values of 0 24 0 30 and 0 27 respectively bod5 cod values were between 0 2 and 0 3 which could be treated by biological method 27 3 3 three dimensional fluorescence characteristics of wastewater as shown in fig 5 two fluorescence peaks with ex em of 225 240 340 370 nm and ex em of 250 300 345 390 nm were observed in the 3d eem spectra in each wastewater sample according to khan et al 28 peak t2 with ex em at 225 237 340 381 nm indicated the tryptophan like compounds peak b with ex em 250 300 320 410 nm indicated the presence of tyrosine like compounds meanwhile proteins and peptides were identified by fluorescence by amino acids i e phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine 28 and these amino acids generated fluorescence due to the presence of homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic moieties 29 so peak b and peak t2 were also referred to protein like organic matter 28 huang et al 30 showed that petroleum matters were mainly composed of hydrocarbons such as alkanes cycloalkanes and aromatics and the fluorescence measurement results of petroleum matters were mainly peak b and peak t2 compared with the raw cutting fluid wastewater the intensities of the two fluorescence peaks peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer were significantly enhanced the reason might be that the density of oil is less than that of water and oil floated up into the froth layer after freezing air thawing which led to the enhancement of peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer combined with fig 4 the proportion of macromolecules with mw 100 kda in the froth layer was much higher than that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater so the two fluorescence peaks peak b and peak t2 in the froth layer might be mainly caused by the macromolecules with mw 100 kda the intensities of peak b and peak t2 in the first the second and the third layer wastewater were obviously weaker than those in the raw cutting fluid wastewater which might be because the toc concentrations and oil contents in the those layers decreased significantly compared with that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater the intensities of peak b and peak t2 in the fourth layer waste water was almost unchanged as the toc concentration and oil content didn t change significantly compared with that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater 3 4 ultraviolet absorption characteristics of wastewater as the uv absorbance of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds represented in 240 250 nm 31 32 as shown in fig 6 the uv absorbance before and after freezing air thawing were all between 200 and 250 nm which indicated that the organic compounds in the cutting fluid wastewater contained aromatic compounds and heterocyclic compounds the result was consistent with that of the 3d eem spectra namely there was the protein like organic matter with homocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic moieties in the cutting fluid wastewater compared with the raw cutting fluid wastewater the uv absorbances of the first the second and the third layer thawing wastewater decreased significantly which might be because the toc concentration of each layer thawing wastewater was obviously lower than that in the raw cutting fluid wastewater 3 5 infrared spectral characteristics of wastewater as shown in fig 7 the peak at 1646 cm 1 and the band of 3000 3700 cm 1 were related to the oh bending and h oh stretching of water molecules 33 the peaks of 2850 3000 cm 1 was associated with asymmetrical stretching of ch bond in ch3 and ch2 34 36 the peaks of 1700 1800 cm 1 was assigned to co group of esters 37 the peaks around 1660 2000 cm 1 was related to aromatic compounds 34 38 the peaks at 1378 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were related to the symmetrical bending of ch in ch3 and ch2 respectively 34 36 the peaks around 1240 1340 cm 1 was attributed to the cn amide iii band 39 the peaks around 1200 1000 cm 1 was associated to c o c group 35 39 these results showed that there might be aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in wastewater which was in agreement with the results of 3d eem spectra and uv absorption spectra the peaks around 445 570 cm 1 was associated with branched chain alkanes 38 which appeared in the first second third layer wastewater and the froth layer so these might be indicated that freezing air thawing process could destroy macromolecules into small molecules 3 6 droplet size analysis the average droplet size of the raw cutting fluid wastewater was 281 nm as shown in fig 8 after freezing air thawing three times the average droplet sizes of the mixture of the first the second and the third layer wastewater and the fourth layer wastewater were 1887 nm and 2239 nm respectively which were significantly larger than that of the raw cutting fluid wastewater and meanwhile the droplet size of the fourth layer wastewater was larger than that of the mixture of the first second and third layer wastewater too the average droplet sizes of the froth grew significantly with the increase of freezing air thawing times after the first second and third thawing which were 2160 nm 3992 nm and 5982 nm respectively and after the third thawing the droplets in the froth gathered into a cluster chi 40 extracted peanut oil from aqueous emulsion by freezing thawing and found that the droplet size increased significantly after thawing feng et al 15 also found that the droplet size significantly increased after freeze thaw treatment of cutting fluid wastewater 4 conclusions the raw cutting fluid wastewater used in the experiment was water in oil emulsion and it contained 66 74 organic matter with mw 100 kda and 17 04 organic matter with mw 1 kda the cutting fluid wastewater contained aromatic and heterocyclic compounds before and after freezing air thawing during the freezing air thawing process there was not only the demulsification maybe but also the destruction of molecular structure after three times of freezing air thawing 27 53 of organic matter was volatilized into the air the content and proportion of the fraction with mw 100 kda decreased and the content of the fraction with mw 1 kda increased from the froth layer to the fourth layer the mixture of the froth layer and the fourth layer wastewater could be reused in metal process while the wastewater in the first second and third layers could be treated by biological method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
