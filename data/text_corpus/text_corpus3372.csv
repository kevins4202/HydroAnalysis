16860,the objective of this study was to develop models to predict the formation of hans under uniform formation conditions ufc in chlorinated choraminated and perchlorinated chloraminated waters of different origins model equations were developed using multiple linear regression analysis to predict the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan han4 trichloroacetonitrile tcan dcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban and han6 han4 plus monochloroacetonitrile monobromoacetonitrile the independent variables covered a wide range of values and included

coefficients r2 of han4 and han6 models for natural organic matter nom algal organic matter aom and effluent organic matter efom impacted waters were within the range of 60 88 while the r2 values of han4 and dcan models for both groundwater and distribution systems were lower in the range of 41 66 the r2 values for the dcan model were mostly higher in the individual types as compared to the cumulative analysis of all source water data together this was attributed to differences in han precursor characteristics for chlorination among all variables ph was found to be the most significant descriptor in the model equations describing the formation of dcan han4 and han6 and it was negatively correlated with han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom samples while it showed an inverse relationship with han6 formation in efom impacted waters during chloramination ph was the most influential model descriptor for dcan formation in the nom prechlorination dose was the most predominant parameter for prechlorination chloramination and it was positively correlated with han4 formation in aom impacted waters keywords haloacetonitriles predictive modeling uniform

chloramination bougeard et al 2010 krasner et al 2006 krasner et al 2008 obolensky et al 2007 sfynia et al 2017 the measured molar concentration of hans is usually one order of magnitude lower than

hans species han4 dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban are the most commonly detected species in the treated waters krasner et al 1989a b among them dcan has been the most prevalent han species which has been detected in the distribution system up to 9 µg l following chlorination obolensky et al 2007 yang et al 2008 chen and

time and temperature can play a role in the formation of hans ersan et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2018 the ability to predict the dbp formation is valuable to water utilities as solely relying on chemical analyses can be expensive and time consuming several researchers have been proposed different empirical models for dbp formation as seen in table s1 in the supporting information si section most of these models were derived from linear and non linear regression analysis compared to multiple linear regression mlr analysis the nonlinear approach i e especially using modern learning algorithms is more accurate for the prediction of dbp formation when a wide range of datasets is available milot et al 2002 platikanov et al 2012 ike et al 2020 whereas the linear regression analysis is more appropriate for the much narrower dbp datasets ike et al 2020 in previous studies mlr models have been developed to predict the formation of dbps under different range of environmental and water treatment conditions bergier et al 2017 engerholm and amy 2017 feungpean et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2009 2010 uyak et al 2005 sohn et al 2004 westerhoff et al 2000 morrow and minear 1987 in addition to their prediction capabilities these models can also provide insights into the factors affecting dbp formation to date numerous models have been developed for predicting c dbp formation in water table s1 in the si section whereas limited number of modeling studies under formation potential fp test conditions or the samples were collected and analyzed from distributions systems are available table 1 to predict dcan and han4 formation in the presence of free chlorine bergier et al 2017 chen and westerhoff 2010 chhipi shrestha et al 2018 guilherme and rodriguez 2017 kolla 2004 mian et al 2020 and chloramine line et al 2018 fp test employs high concentrations of oxidants to assess the precursor levels of dbps in water we recently showed that measuring hans under fp conditions has limitations because of the decomposition of hans at elevated free chlorine concentrations this may cause an underestimation of han precursors in water kanan and karanfil 2020 there is currently no han model in the literature under the uniform formation conditions ufc a test method developed for the representative conditions of distribution systems in the united states summers et al 1996 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first comprehensive modeling effort for the formation of dcan han4 and han6 monochloroacetonitrile mcan monobromoacetonitrile mban tcan dcan bcan and dban during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination under ufc conditions multivariable predictive models were developed including several parameters such as uv254 doc don doc suva254 br oxidant dose ph contact time and temperature for different water matrices e g nom aom efom impacted waters distribution system and groundwater furthermore this study evaluated the impact of ph on the correlation of han4 han6 vs thm4 formation during chlorination process 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation a comprehensive han database under ufc was collected from the existing literature in addition to our own laboratory results the correlation matrix of independent variables was performed after the log transformation of variables for model development since the log transformation can reduce or remove the skewness of the original dataset the water quality parameters for chlorination chloramination and prechlorination data sets are presented in tables s2 s3 and s4 the formation dataset under chlorination conditions for dcan sample number n 216 han4 n 208 and han6 n 142 samples covered a range of uv254 0 014 1 472 cm 1 doc 0 3 9 8 mg l br concentration 0 0015 9 mg l ph 5 5 9 chlorine dose 0 5 10 mg l contact time 0 5 72 h and temperature 16 5 21 c the database included the results for samples from different water sources including distribution systems n 30 groundwater sources n 29 efom samples from secondary effluents of different wwtps n 54 laboratory grown aoms samples n 38 from different algal species and isolated natural noms samples n 57 among all water sources don concentrations were only available for efom samples ranging from 1 5 to 30 7 mg l as n table s2 in the si section because of the limited number of available chloramination and prechlorination datasets in the literature the chloramine dataset only included isolated natural noms samples n 35 with a range of doc 2 5 4 mg l br 0 0 5 mg l ph 4 7 5 chloramine dose 2 3 8 mg l as cl2 contact time 5 72 h and temperature 10 30 c on the other hand the dataset for chlorination followed by chloramination cl2 nh2cl process prechlorination followed by ammonia addition for aom impacted waters is obtained from liu et al 2019 prechlorination dataset only included formation of han4 n 56 from laboratory grown aoms samples at room temperature 21 c and a range of doc 0 5 4 mg l br 0 0 4 mg l ph 6 5 8 prechlorination time 0 5 30 mins and dose 1 3 7 mg l as cl2 and temperature 2 2 predictive model equations a multivariable equation equation eq 1 which includes water quality uv254 doc and br and operational parameters ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature was employed for statistical prediction of han formation the predictive model has the following form 1 loghans a logu v 254 b logdoc c logb r d logph e logoxidant dose f logtime g logtemperature h in this model uv254 cm 1 doc mg l br mg l ph oxidant dose mg l time hour and temperature c are the independent variables while hans mg l is the dependent variable the coefficients a b c d e f and g are the regression coefficients and h is the regression constant eq 1 was employed for the prediction of han formation in all tested water sources except efom and aom during chlorination for the efom model the ratio of don doc term was used in the predictive model formula instead of only doc because the don data was available for the aom impacted waters suva254 term was used in the model instead of uv254 and doc due to the constant doc concentrations 2 mg l in the aom dataset the coefficients i and j are the regression coefficients of don doc and suva254 respectively the equation terms considered water quality and operational parameters that have been shown to influence the formation of hans during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination liu et al 2019 bond et al 2011 dotson et al 2009 previous experimental studies showed that increasing doc br oxidant dose contact time and temperature positively correlate with han formation while ph negatively correlates and decreases the formation of hans chu et al 2010 glezer et al 1999 hua et al 2006 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2014 yang et al 2008 in a study conducted by lee et al 2007 authors reported that wastewater sources with high don contents 0 18 0 27 mg l containing amino sugars 0 22 nmol mg of doc and proteins 0 82 nmol mg of doc showed higher dcan yields upon chlorination likewise huo et al 2013 showed that more than 80 of don in wastewater effluents contains hydrophilic moieties low suva254 therefore don is expected to serve as potential precursors for han formation and it was included in the efom model 2 3 statistical data analysis the development of model equations was accomplished by performing mlr analysis all statistical analysis results were conducted by sas v 9 3 software the generalized linear model glm procedure of sas was applied for parameter selection the mlr analysis was used to develop correlations between water quality and operational parameters and han formation regression assumption was evaluated with a linear relationship for describing a straight line relationship between independent and dependent variables therefore the linear relationship between the independent variables water quality and operational parameters and the dependent variable han formation was examined side by side the linearity of the model equations was examined by the coefficient of determination r2 the regression models were checked by p values assessed with the analysis of variance anova a small p value 05 indicates strong evidence that at least one of the independent variables of the developed equation is significantly important to predict the dependent variable the intercorrelations of independent variables were controlled by the variation inflation factor vif vif value is the reciprocal of the tolerance value and their small values vif 4 indicate low correlation among variables under ideal conditions as vif values higher than 10 this may suggest that there is a problem with multicollinearity hair et al 2010 the predictive performance of models was also estimated with percent difference between measured and predicted values mian et al 2020 while root mean squared error rmse was used as a measure of external validation data the predictive precision for models evaluated by prediction error sum of squares press a detailed explanation of the multiple regression modeling technique can be found in our previous publications ersan et al 2016 2019 apul et al 2020 croue and roux 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 the prediction of han formation during chlorination since the mass and molar based models developed for dcan han4 and han6 were mostly in agreement the mass based model results were presented and discussed in this manuscript the modeling variables uv254 doc br ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature for dcan han4 and han6 during chlorination under ufc are presented in table s2 in the si section to examine the model correlations in different types of waters hans models were developed for each water type the equations obtained for han4 formation in five different water sources are shown in eqs 2 7 the coefficient of determinations r2 is the key output of regression analysis to evaluate the developed models for hans formation the r2 values of the hans model were in general higher in the individual types as compared to the cumulative analysis of the data eq 2 7 the r2 values of han4 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 74 81 which indicated the suitability of models for predicting han formation on the other hand the r2 values of han4 models for both groundwater and distribution systems were lower than those of other waters 52 and 41 respectively the lowest r2 value observed for distribution systems may be attributed to varying water quality conditions and complex operating conditions besides when all water types were included in the prediction model the r2 value was lower than individual water types except distribution systems the cumulative models developed including only nom aom and efom data still resulted lower r2 values dcan model r2 0 59 han4 model r2 0 62 han6 model r2 0 70 data is not shown this indicated that the characteristics of han precursors vary among these different type of organic matter therefore the prediction modeling for individual water types has been shown to be more reliable than cumulative analysis of the han data in this study loghan 4 nom 0 11 0 05 logu v 254

coefficients along with statistical comparisons of dcan han4 and han6 formation in five different water sources the impact of water source type on r2 of models for dcan han4 and han6 formations are presented in fig 1 the r2 values of the dcan model were in general higher in the individual water types as compared with all water sources collectively the r2 values of han4 and han6 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 60 88 while the r2 values of han4 and dcan models for both groundwater and distribution systems were lower in the range of 41 66 fig 1 when the predicted and measured data of han4 and han6 formation for different water sources was compared the predicted han4 and han6 formation fitted well with their measured data in all water sources especially for water sources with the highest r2 values fig 2 besides the average percentage difference values between measured and predicted values from all models were less than 35 for each dcan han4 and han6 formations in the different water sources table 2 the values for all the model parameter coefficients of dcan han4 and han6 formation from different water sources are shown in fig 3 among all variables ph parameter was negatively correlated with han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom samples previous studies showed increasing ph decreased the formation of hans due to base catalyzed hydrolysis singer et al 1995 heller grossman et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 na and olson 2004 however ph showed an inverse relationship in the efom impacted water resulting in an increased formation of hans with increasing ph the calculated ph coefficients for efom impacted water model were consistent with a previous study where chlorination of secondary effluent waters at high ph led to an increased formation of some of the hans while an opposite trend was observed for the other water sources doederer et al 2013 the observed positive correlation may be associated with the characteristics of efom impacted water samples which may contain a mixture of precursors including nom aom and soluble microbial products smp excreted during biological wastewater treatment processes as well as other anthropogenic compounds further data for the formation of han in wastewater effluents under ufc conditions is needed due to the lack of available temperature data for different water sources in the literature the temperature impacts on han formation were only examined for distribution systems and nom waters temperature showed a positive correlation in the chlorinated humic acid samples when temperature were increased from 4 to 15 c on the other hand dcan formation decreased with increasing temperature from 25 to 50 c zhang et al 2013 however the formation of hans in the nom water samples exhibited a different behavior the absolute value of temperature for nom water was the most predominant descriptor and was negatively correlated with han formation fig 3 the formation rates of dcan han4 and han6 and their decomposition rates could be enhanced with increasing temperature during chlorination of nom waters another study concluded that increasing temperature enhanced the decomposition rates of dcan nikolaou et al 2004 when more brominated species were included within the models the impact of br and chlorine dose on the model equations increased for all water sources fig 3 when the han speciation shifted from chlorinated to chloro bromo and or brominated hans as a result of an increase in br concentration i e from dcan to bcan and dban the br contribution in the model equation became more apparent dcan to han6 in table 2 therefore the model results clearly showed that increasing br concentration shifted the speciation to more brominated hans and increasing chlorine dose increased the decomposition of hans chow et al 2011 soyluoglu et al 2020 hua et al 2006 for the uv254 a negative correlation was only observed in efom impacted waters the suva254 parameter within the dcan han4 and han6 model equations of aom impacted showed a positive correlation with han formation on the other hand doc parameter showed different impact on the model equations for different water sources table 2 don doc ratios in efom impacted waters were positively correlated with dcan han4 and han6 modelings supporting that don can be a significant source of han precursors westerhoff and mash 2002 lee et al 2007 on the other hand increasing contact time during chlorination increased han formation in both nom and aom impacted waters it should be noted that the dataset for han6 under ufc conditions is much smaller as compared to dcan and han4 in the literature when all data were modeled together the prediction strength of each regression coefficients r2 decreased table 2 this is due to weaker correlations of distribution systems and groundwater systems as well as the difference in the nature of han precursors in different waters overall in the presence of free chlorine the r2 values which is the indicator of the prediction model strenghts highly depends on the availability of han formation dataset including the number of dcan han4 and han6 independent variables uv254 doc br ph dose contact time and temperature and type of water sources reporting complete han6 speciation data sets with several water quality parameters especially including don and doc together will be valuable to further advance the han modeling efforts furthermore don values will be valuable for modeling of other nitrogeneous dbps that may be measured during the same studies 3 2 the prediction of han formation during chloramination the modeling variables doc ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature that are used for developing a predictive model for dcan in the presence of chloramine under ufc are compiled in table s3 in the si section due to limited number of studies in the literature which includes all the investigated model parameters in this study the predictive modeling for chloramination was only evaluated for dcan formation in the nom water samples logd can 0 91 1 21 logd oc 2 06 1 52 logph 0 75 0

samples are given in eq 5 and shown in fig 4 among all descriptors the ph term has a negative correlation in the chloramination model due to the base catalyzed decomposition of dcan roux and croue 2012 croue and roux 2011 yu and reckhow 2015 increasing ph enhanced the degradation rates of dcan which has been observed in previous studies ersan et al 2019b lee and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2007 on the other hand except the doc term chloramine dose contact time and temperature terms for dcan formation showed positive correlations which is in agreement with previous studies where the formation of dcan increased with increasing chloramine dose contact time and temperature nikolaou et al 2004 reckhow et al 2001 yang et al 2007 in terms of the impact of oxidant type chlorine vs chloramine on the modeling of dcan formation the r2 value of dcan formation modeling under chloramination r2 0 49 n 35 was lower than during chlorination r2 0 88 n 68 this was attributed to narrower independent variable ranges for chloramination dataset shown in fig s3 which impacted the prediction strength of the model the values for all model parameter coefficients of dcan formation in nom water are presented in fig 4 the trends of regression coefficient values doc ph oxidant dose time and temperature for both chlorination and chloramination datasets were slightly different among all variables in fig 4 the ph parameter for both oxidants showed negative correlation with dcan formation in surface waters on the other hand temperature term was also negatively correlated with dcan formation under chlorination which may be due to enhanced decomposition rates of dcan at increasing temperatures nikolaou et al 2004 reckhow et al 2001 for the chloramination dataset the temperature parameter showed a positive correlation in the nom samples it should be noted that the temperature parameter for chloramination dataset 10 25 c was much narrower than chlorination 4 50 c table s2 and s3 in the si section thus the modeling of dcan formation under varying temperature conditions warrants further investigation during chloramination process it has been also shown that increasing doc concentration oxidant dose and contact time in chlorination and chloramination increased dcan formation however the regression coefficients of the chlorination dataset are less impacted than the chloramination dataset when each parameter was compared according to the oxidant type this difference can be attributed to the less stability of dcan in the presence of free chlorine versus monochloramine the modeling of han formation under ufc warrants further investigation when more chloramination data becomes available in the literature to better visualize the multicollinearity the change in vif values during han formation modeling for chlorination and chloramination is shown by using a radar chart in fig 5 and fig s1 among all variables while the vif value for doc term in chlorination vif 1 95 was higher during chloramination vif value was higher for the oxidant dose vif 1 4 as compared to other variables besides the vif value for temperature term was higher during chlorination vif 1 66 than chloramination vif 1 but multicollinearity vif 10 was not observed for both chlorine and chloramine datasets fig s5 s6 in the si section 3 3 the prediction of han formation during prechlorination chloramination the modeling variables doc ph br concentration prechlorination time and prechlorination dose for prechlorination chloramination that were used for developing a predictive model for han4 under ufc were compiled in table s4 in the si section due to the limited number of prechlorination chloramination datasets with all parameter values for han4 formation in the literature predictive modeling was only examined for aom impacted waters the r2 value of model variables and coefficients for han4 formation during prechlorination chloramination in aom impacted water samples were given in eq 6 loghan 4 0 80 0 95 logdoc 0 75 0 39 logbr 0 03 0 78 logph 0 56 0 05 logprechlorinationtime 1 90 1 12 logprechlorinationdose 1 49 0 67 6 n 51 r 2 0 83 p valu es 0001 among all independent variables prechlorination dose was the most influential parameter p values 0 0001 and positively correlated with han formation in the aom impacted waters while doc and ph terms were negatively correlated in the prechlorination process as shown in fig 6 br and prechlorination contact time for han4 formation showed positive correlations this suggests that the formation of han4 increased with increasing prechlorination dose contact time and initial br concentration which agrees well with previous research tian et al 2013 since there is no full dataset available for hans formation during chloramination in aom impacted waters the prechlorination chloramination process was compared with only the chlorination model in aom impacted waters the model prediction of han4 during prechlorination chloramination r2 0 83 n 51 was slightly higher than chlorination process r2 0 76 n 38 with increasing chlorine contact times in both prechlorination chloramination and chlorination processes the formation of han4 declined with increasing ph due to lower stability of hans under alkaline conditions yu and reckhow et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in contrast to chlorination a lesser ph impact was observed on the han4 model in prechlorination chloramination fig 6 this may be due to narrower ph ranges used in the prechlorination chloramination dataset table s4 in the si section which may have influenced the prediction strength of the model meanwhile the formation of han4 in the prechlorination chloramination process increased with increasing br concentration fig 6 this finding was in agreement with han4 formation results reported by tian et al 2013 and liu et al 2019 3 4 hans vs thms correlations since thm data was available for the han datasets the correlations between han and thm formation were also examined however ph is an important parameter in this analysis because with increasing ph the formation of thms is enhanced due to the base catalyzed reactions whereas at high ph conditions i e ph 8 hans undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 ersan et al 2019a hua and reckhow 2006 reckhow et al 1990 among all ph ranges han4 vs thm4 y 0 1047x 0 0014 r2 0 72 n 103 and han6 vs thm4 y 0 1118x 0 002 r2 0 80 n 71 was found highly correlated in the ph range of 7 to 8 of chlorination fig 7 at higher ph levels ph 8 0 the correlations between hans and thms decreased table s8 in the si section which was attributed to hydrolysis of hans singer et al 1994 reckhow 2001 when thms vs hans correlations were performed in individual water sources distribution systems groundwater efom aom and nom waters under similar ph ranges 7 8 thms highly correlated with hans in distribution system efom and aom impacted waters r2 0 62 0 91 table s9 in the si section due to the limited data sets for each water sources ph impacts on the correlation between han4 han6 vs thm4 was not individually evaluated in this study on the other hand when the data for all ph values analyzed together the correlation coefficient r2 was 0 52 for both han4 vs thm4 han6 vs thm4 correlations table s8 in the si section therefore these results show that ph is an important parameter for both han formation prediction as well as developing thm vs han correlations at ph 7 8 range han formation on a mass basis was approximately 10 of thm formation 4 conclusions poly parameter uv254 doc don doc suva254 br oxidant dose ph contact time and temperature model equations were developed for the prediction of hans formation in distribution system conditions during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination chloramination processes this comprehensive analysis showed that the type of water source during chlorination influenced the linearity r2 of the model equations the r2 values for the dcan model were mostly higher in the individual types except distribution systems as compared to the cumulative analysis of the data this was attributed to differences in han precursor characteristics the r2 values of han4 and han6 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 60 88 which indicated the success of the models in predicting han formations on the other hand the r2 values of han4 models for both groundwater and distribution systems were within the range of 41 66 among all variables ph was the most significant descriptor p values 0001 for dcan han4 and han6 in the chlorination process and inversely affected the han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom waters on the contrary increasing ph positively affected the formation of han in the efom impacted water a positive correlation between don doc term and dcan han4 and han6 models observed in efom impacted waters indicated the role of organic nitrogen species in wastewater effluent however don concentrations has not been reported for other types of waters therefore reporting both doc and don in dbp studies is important for future modeling efforts of nitrogeneous dbps for chloramination ph was the significant parameter and it was negatively correlated with dcan formation in nom waters the model prediction of dcan during chlorination was higher r2 0 88 n 68 than chloramination r2 0 49 n 35 which is attributed to the higher han stability in the presence of chloramine for prechlorination chloramination prechlorination dose was the most influential parameter p values 0001 which was positively correlated with han formation in the aom impacted waters the model prediction of han4 formation in prechlorination chloramination r2 0 83 n 51 was higher than chlorination r2 0 76 n 38 ph is an important parameter while examining thm vs han correlations among all ph ranges the ph range of 7 to 8 showed the highest correlation between han4 and thm4 r2 0 72 and han6 and thm4 r2 0 80 during chlorination at this ph range han formation was approximately 10 of han4 and han6 formation on a mass basis future papers providing the values for all model parameters especially don and doc listed above along with han formation and speciation will help to create larger and more complete datasets and advance the

descriptor in the model equations describing the formation of dcan han4 and han6 and it was negatively correlated with han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom samples while it showed an inverse relationship with han6 formation in efom impacted waters during chloramination ph was the most influential model descriptor for dcan formation in the nom prechlorination dose was the most predominant parameter for prechlorination chloramination and it was positively correlated with han4 formation in aom impacted waters keywords haloacetonitriles predictive modeling uniform

chemical analyses can be expensive and time consuming several researchers have been proposed different empirical models for dbp formation as seen in table s1 in the supporting information si section most of these models were derived from linear and non linear regression analysis compared to multiple linear regression mlr analysis the nonlinear approach i e especially using modern learning algorithms is more accurate for the prediction of dbp formation when a wide range of datasets is available milot et al 2002 platikanov et al 2012 ike et al 2020 whereas the linear regression analysis is more appropriate for the much narrower dbp datasets ike et al 2020 in previous studies mlr models have been developed to predict the formation of dbps under different range of environmental and

addition to their prediction capabilities these models can also provide insights into the factors affecting dbp formation to date numerous models have been developed for predicting c dbp formation in

mian et al 2020 and chloramine line et al 2018 fp test employs high concentrations of oxidants to assess the precursor levels of dbps in water we recently showed that measuring hans under fp conditions has limitations because of the decomposition of hans at elevated free chlorine concentrations this may cause an underestimation of han precursors in water kanan and karanfil 2020 there is currently no han model in the literature under the uniform formation conditions ufc a test method developed for the representative conditions of distribution systems in the united states summers et al 1996 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first comprehensive modeling effort for the formation of dcan han4 and han6 monochloroacetonitrile mcan monobromoacetonitrile mban tcan dcan bcan and dban during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination under ufc conditions multivariable predictive models were developed including several parameters such as uv254 doc don doc suva254 br oxidant dose ph contact time and temperature for different water matrices e g nom aom efom impacted waters distribution system and groundwater furthermore this study evaluated the impact of ph on the correlation of han4 han6 vs thm4 formation during chlorination process 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation a comprehensive han database under ufc was collected from the existing literature in addition to our own laboratory results the correlation matrix of independent variables was performed after the log transformation of variables for model development since the log transformation can reduce or remove the skewness of the original dataset the water quality parameters for chlorination chloramination and prechlorination data sets are presented in tables s2 s3 and s4 the formation dataset under chlorination conditions for dcan sample number n 216 han4 n 208 and han6 n 142 samples covered a range of uv254 0 014 1 472 cm 1 doc 0 3 9 8 mg l br concentration 0 0015 9 mg l ph 5 5 9 chlorine dose 0 5 10 mg l contact time 0 5 72 h and temperature 16 5 21 c the database included the results for samples from different water sources including distribution systems n 30 groundwater sources n 29 efom samples from secondary effluents of different wwtps n 54 laboratory grown aoms samples n 38 from different algal species and isolated natural noms samples n 57 among all water sources don concentrations were only available for efom samples ranging from 1 5 to 30 7 mg l as n table s2 in the si section because of the limited number of available chloramination and prechlorination datasets in the literature the chloramine dataset only included isolated natural noms samples n 35 with a range of doc 2 5 4 mg l br 0 0 5 mg l ph 4 7 5 chloramine dose 2 3 8 mg l as cl2 contact time 5 72 h and temperature 10 30 c on the other hand the dataset for chlorination followed by chloramination cl2 nh2cl process prechlorination followed by ammonia addition for aom impacted waters is obtained from liu et al 2019 prechlorination dataset only included formation of han4 n 56 from laboratory grown aoms samples at room temperature 21 c and a range of doc 0 5 4 mg l

uv254 doc and br and operational parameters ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature was employed for statistical prediction of han formation the predictive model has the following form 1 loghans a logu v 254 b logdoc c logb r d logph e logoxidant dose f logtime g logtemperature h in this model uv254 cm 1 doc mg l br mg l ph oxidant dose mg l time hour and temperature c are the independent variables while hans mg l is the dependent variable the coefficients a b c d e f and g are the regression coefficients and h is the regression constant eq 1 was employed for the prediction of han formation in all tested water sources except efom and aom during chlorination for the efom model the ratio of don doc term was used in the predictive model formula instead of only doc because the don data was available for the aom impacted waters suva254 term was used in the model instead of uv254 and doc due to the constant doc concentrations 2 mg l in the aom dataset the coefficients i and j are the regression coefficients of don doc and suva254 respectively the equation terms considered water quality and operational parameters that have been shown to influence the formation of hans during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination liu et al 2019 bond et al 2011 dotson et al 2009 previous experimental studies showed that increasing doc br oxidant dose contact time and temperature positively correlate with han formation while ph negatively correlates and decreases the formation of hans chu et al 2010 glezer et al 1999 hua et al 2006 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2014 yang et al 2008 in a study conducted by lee et al 2007 authors reported that wastewater sources with high don contents 0 18 0 27 mg l containing amino sugars 0 22 nmol mg of doc and proteins 0 82 nmol mg of doc showed higher dcan yields upon chlorination likewise huo et al 2013 showed that more than 80 of don in wastewater effluents contains hydrophilic moieties low suva254 therefore don is expected to serve as potential precursors for han formation and it was included in the efom model 2 3 statistical data analysis the development of model equations was accomplished by performing mlr analysis all statistical analysis results were conducted by sas v 9 3 software the generalized linear model glm procedure of sas was applied for parameter selection the mlr analysis was used to develop correlations between water quality and operational parameters and han formation regression assumption was evaluated with a linear relationship for describing a straight line relationship between independent and dependent variables therefore the linear relationship between the independent variables water quality and operational parameters and the dependent variable han formation was examined side by side the linearity of the model equations was examined by the coefficient of determination r2 the regression models were checked by p values assessed with the analysis of variance anova a small p value 05 indicates strong evidence that at least one of the independent variables of the developed equation is significantly important to predict the dependent variable the intercorrelations of independent variables were controlled by the variation inflation factor vif vif value is the reciprocal of the tolerance value and their small values vif 4 indicate low correlation among variables under ideal conditions as vif values higher than 10 this may suggest that there is a problem with multicollinearity hair et al 2010 the predictive performance of models was also estimated with percent difference between measured and predicted values mian et al 2020 while root mean squared error rmse was used as a measure of external validation data the predictive precision for models evaluated by prediction error sum of squares press a detailed explanation of the multiple regression modeling technique can be found in our previous publications ersan et al 2016 2019 apul et al 2020 croue and roux 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 the prediction of han formation during chlorination since the mass and molar based models developed for dcan han4 and han6 were mostly in agreement the mass based model results were presented and discussed in this manuscript the modeling variables uv254 doc br ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature for dcan han4 and han6 during chlorination under ufc are presented in table s2 in the si section to examine the model correlations in different types of waters hans models were developed for each water type the equations obtained for han4 formation in five different water sources are shown in eqs 2 7 the coefficient of determinations r2 is the key output of regression analysis to evaluate the developed models for hans formation the r2 values of the hans model were in general higher in the individual types as compared to the cumulative analysis of the data eq 2 7 the r2 values of han4 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 74 81 which indicated the suitability of models for predicting han formation on the other hand the r2 values of han4 models for both groundwater and distribution systems were lower than those of other waters 52 and 41 respectively the lowest r2 value observed for distribution systems may be attributed to varying water quality conditions and complex operating conditions besides when all water types were included in the prediction model the r2 value was lower than individual water types except distribution systems the cumulative models developed including only nom aom and efom data still resulted lower r2 values dcan model r2 0 59 han4 model r2 0 62 han6 model r2 0 70 data is not shown this indicated that the characteristics of han precursors vary among these different type of organic matter therefore the prediction modeling for individual water types has been shown to be more reliable than cumulative analysis of the han data in this study loghan 4 nom 0 11 0 05 logu v 254

coefficients along with statistical comparisons of dcan han4 and han6 formation in five different water sources the impact of water source type on r2 of models for dcan han4 and han6 formations are presented in fig 1 the r2 values of the dcan model were in general higher in the individual water types as compared with all water sources collectively the r2 values of han4 and han6 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 60 88 while the r2 values of han4 and dcan models for both groundwater and distribution systems were lower in the range of 41 66 fig 1 when the predicted and measured data of han4 and han6 formation for different water sources was compared the predicted han4 and han6 formation fitted well with their measured data in all water sources especially for water sources with the highest r2 values fig 2 besides the average percentage difference values between measured and predicted values from all models were less than 35 for each dcan han4 and han6 formations in the different water sources table 2 the values for all the model parameter coefficients of dcan han4 and han6 formation from different water sources are shown in fig 3 among all variables ph parameter was negatively correlated with han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom samples previous studies showed increasing ph decreased the formation of hans due to base catalyzed hydrolysis singer et al 1995 heller grossman et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 na and olson 2004 however ph showed an inverse relationship in the efom impacted water resulting in an increased formation of hans with increasing ph the calculated ph coefficients for efom impacted water model were consistent with a previous study where chlorination of secondary effluent waters at high ph led to an increased formation of some of the hans while an opposite trend was observed for the other water sources doederer et al 2013 the observed positive correlation may be associated with the characteristics of efom impacted water samples which may contain a mixture of precursors including nom aom and soluble microbial products smp excreted during biological wastewater treatment processes as well as other anthropogenic compounds further data for the formation of han in wastewater effluents under ufc conditions is needed due to the lack of available temperature data for different water sources in the literature the temperature impacts on han formation were only examined for distribution systems and nom waters temperature showed a positive correlation in the chlorinated humic acid samples when temperature were increased from 4 to 15 c on the other hand dcan formation decreased with increasing temperature from 25 to 50 c zhang et al 2013 however the formation of hans in the nom water samples exhibited a different behavior the absolute value of temperature for nom water was the most predominant descriptor and was negatively correlated with han formation fig 3 the formation rates of dcan han4 and han6 and their decomposition rates could be enhanced with increasing temperature during chlorination of nom waters another study concluded that increasing temperature enhanced the decomposition rates of dcan nikolaou et al 2004 when more brominated species were included within the models the impact of br and chlorine dose on the model equations increased for all water sources fig 3 when the han speciation shifted from chlorinated to chloro bromo and or brominated hans as a result of an increase in br concentration i e from dcan to bcan and dban the br contribution in the model equation became more apparent dcan to han6 in table 2 therefore the model results clearly showed that increasing br concentration shifted the speciation to more brominated hans and increasing chlorine dose increased the decomposition of hans chow et al 2011 soyluoglu et al 2020 hua et al 2006 for the uv254 a negative correlation was only observed in efom impacted waters the suva254 parameter within the dcan han4 and han6 model equations of aom impacted showed a positive correlation with han formation on the other hand doc parameter showed different impact on the model equations for different water sources table 2 don doc ratios in efom impacted waters were positively correlated with dcan han4 and han6 modelings supporting that don can be a significant source of han precursors westerhoff and mash 2002 lee et al 2007 on the other hand increasing contact time during chlorination increased han formation in both nom and aom impacted waters it should be noted that the dataset for han6 under ufc conditions is much smaller as compared to dcan and han4 in the literature when all data were modeled together the prediction strength of each regression coefficients r2 decreased table 2 this is due to weaker correlations of distribution systems and groundwater systems as well as the difference in the nature of han precursors in different waters overall in the presence of free chlorine the r2 values which is the indicator of the prediction model strenghts highly depends on the availability of han formation dataset including the number of dcan han4 and han6 independent variables uv254 doc br ph dose contact time and temperature and type of water sources reporting complete han6 speciation data sets with several water quality parameters especially including don and doc together will be valuable to further advance the han modeling efforts furthermore don values will be valuable for modeling of other nitrogeneous dbps that may be measured during the same studies 3 2 the prediction of han formation during chloramination the modeling variables doc ph oxidant dose contact time and temperature that are used for developing a predictive model for dcan in the presence of chloramine under ufc are compiled in table s3 in the si section due to limited number of studies in the literature which includes all the investigated model parameters in this study the predictive modeling for chloramination was only evaluated for dcan formation in the nom water samples logd can 0 91 1 21 logd oc 2 06 1 52 logph 0 75 0

samples are given in eq 5 and shown in fig 4 among all descriptors the ph term has a negative correlation in the chloramination model due to the base catalyzed decomposition of dcan roux and croue 2012 croue and roux 2011 yu and reckhow 2015 increasing ph enhanced the degradation rates of dcan which has been observed in previous studies ersan et al 2019b lee and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2007 on the other hand except the doc term chloramine dose contact time and temperature terms for dcan formation showed positive correlations which is in agreement with previous studies where the formation of dcan increased with increasing chloramine dose contact time and temperature nikolaou et al 2004 reckhow et al 2001 yang et al 2007 in terms of the impact of oxidant type chlorine vs chloramine on the modeling of dcan formation the r2 value of dcan formation modeling under chloramination r2 0 49 n 35 was lower than during chlorination r2 0 88 n 68 this was attributed to narrower independent variable ranges for chloramination dataset shown in fig s3 which impacted the prediction strength of the model the values for all model parameter coefficients of dcan formation in nom water are presented in fig 4 the trends of regression coefficient values doc ph oxidant dose time and temperature for both chlorination and chloramination datasets were slightly different among all variables in fig 4 the ph parameter for both oxidants showed negative correlation with dcan formation in surface waters on the other hand temperature term was also negatively correlated with dcan formation under chlorination which may be due to enhanced decomposition rates of dcan at increasing temperatures nikolaou et al 2004 reckhow et al 2001 for the chloramination dataset the temperature parameter showed a positive correlation in the nom samples it should be noted that the temperature parameter for chloramination dataset 10 25 c was much narrower than chlorination 4 50 c table s2 and s3 in the si section thus the modeling of dcan formation under varying temperature conditions warrants further investigation during chloramination process it has been also shown that increasing doc concentration oxidant dose and contact time in chlorination and chloramination increased dcan formation however the regression coefficients of the chlorination dataset are less impacted than the chloramination dataset when each parameter was compared according to the oxidant type this difference can be attributed to the less stability of dcan in the presence of free chlorine versus monochloramine the modeling of han formation under ufc warrants further investigation when more chloramination data becomes available in the literature to better visualize the multicollinearity the change in vif values during han formation modeling for chlorination and chloramination is shown by using a radar chart in fig 5 and fig s1 among all variables while the vif value for doc term in chlorination vif 1 95 was higher during chloramination vif value was higher for the oxidant dose vif 1 4 as compared to other variables besides the vif value for temperature term was higher during chlorination vif 1 66 than chloramination vif 1 but multicollinearity vif 10 was not observed for both chlorine and chloramine datasets fig s5 s6 in the si section 3 3 the prediction of han formation during prechlorination chloramination the modeling variables doc ph br concentration prechlorination time and prechlorination dose for prechlorination chloramination that were used for developing a predictive model for han4 under ufc were compiled in table s4 in the si section due to the limited number of prechlorination chloramination datasets with all parameter values for han4 formation in the literature predictive modeling was only examined for aom impacted waters the r2 value of model variables and coefficients for han4 formation during prechlorination chloramination in aom impacted water samples were given in eq 6 loghan 4 0 80 0 95 logdoc 0 75 0 39 logbr 0 03 0 78 logph 0 56 0 05 logprechlorinationtime 1 90 1 12 logprechlorinationdose 1 49 0 67 6 n 51 r 2 0 83 p valu es 0001 among all independent variables prechlorination dose was the most influential parameter p values 0 0001 and positively correlated with han formation in the aom impacted waters while doc and ph terms were negatively correlated in the prechlorination process as shown in fig 6 br and prechlorination contact time for han4 formation showed positive correlations this suggests that the formation of han4 increased with increasing prechlorination dose contact time and initial br concentration which agrees well with previous research tian et al 2013 since there is no full dataset available for hans formation during chloramination in aom impacted waters the prechlorination chloramination process was compared with only the chlorination model in aom impacted waters the model prediction of han4 during prechlorination chloramination r2 0 83 n 51 was slightly higher than chlorination process r2 0 76 n 38 with increasing chlorine contact times in both prechlorination chloramination and chlorination processes the formation of han4 declined with increasing ph due to lower stability of hans under alkaline conditions yu and reckhow et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in contrast to chlorination a lesser ph impact was observed on the han4 model in prechlorination chloramination fig 6 this may be due to narrower ph ranges used in the prechlorination chloramination dataset table s4 in the si section which may have influenced the prediction strength of the model meanwhile the formation of han4 in the prechlorination chloramination process increased with increasing br concentration fig 6 this finding was in agreement with han4 formation results reported by tian et al 2013 and liu et al 2019 3 4 hans vs thms correlations since thm data was available for the han datasets the correlations between han and thm formation were also examined however ph is an important parameter in this analysis because with increasing ph the formation of thms is enhanced due to the base catalyzed reactions whereas at high ph conditions i e ph 8 hans undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 ersan et al 2019a hua and reckhow 2006 reckhow et al 1990 among all ph ranges han4 vs thm4 y 0 1047x 0 0014 r2 0 72 n 103 and han6 vs thm4 y 0 1118x 0 002 r2 0 80 n 71 was found highly correlated in the ph range of 7 to 8 of chlorination fig 7 at higher ph levels ph 8 0 the correlations between hans and thms decreased table s8 in the si section which was attributed to hydrolysis of hans singer et al 1994 reckhow 2001 when thms vs hans correlations were performed in individual water sources distribution systems groundwater efom aom and nom waters under similar ph ranges 7 8 thms highly correlated with hans in distribution system efom and aom impacted waters r2 0 62 0 91 table s9 in the si section due to the limited data sets for each water sources ph impacts on the correlation between han4 han6 vs thm4 was not individually evaluated in this study on the other hand when the data for all ph values analyzed together the correlation coefficient r2 was 0 52 for both han4 vs thm4 han6 vs thm4 correlations table s8 in the si section therefore these results show that ph is an important parameter for both han formation prediction as well as developing thm vs han correlations at ph 7 8 range han formation on a mass basis was approximately 10 of thm formation 4 conclusions poly parameter uv254 doc don doc suva254 br oxidant dose ph contact time and temperature model equations were developed for the prediction of hans formation in distribution system conditions during chlorination chloramination and prechlorination chloramination processes this comprehensive analysis showed that the type of water source during chlorination influenced the linearity r2 of the model equations the r2 values for the dcan model were mostly higher in the individual types except distribution systems as compared to the cumulative analysis of the data this was attributed to differences in han precursor characteristics the r2 values of han4 and han6 models of nom aom and efom impacted waters were within the range of 60 88 which indicated the success of the models in predicting han formations on the other hand the r2 values of han4 models for both groundwater and distribution systems were within the range of 41 66 among all variables ph was the most significant descriptor p values 0001 for dcan han4 and han6 in the chlorination process and inversely affected the han formation in the distribution system groundwater aom and nom waters on the contrary increasing ph positively affected the formation of han in the efom impacted water a positive correlation between don doc term and dcan han4 and han6 models observed in efom impacted waters indicated the role of organic nitrogen species in wastewater effluent however don concentrations has not been reported for other types of waters therefore reporting both doc and don in dbp studies is important for future modeling efforts of nitrogeneous dbps for chloramination ph was the significant parameter and it was negatively correlated with dcan formation in nom waters the model prediction of dcan during chlorination was higher r2 0 88 n 68 than chloramination r2 0 49 n 35 which is attributed to the higher han stability in the presence of chloramine for prechlorination chloramination prechlorination dose was the most influential parameter p values 0001 which was positively correlated with han formation in the aom impacted waters the model prediction of han4 formation in prechlorination chloramination r2 0 83 n 51 was higher than chlorination r2 0 76 n 38 ph is an important parameter while examining thm vs han correlations among all ph ranges the ph range of 7 to 8 showed the highest correlation between han4 and thm4 r2 0 72 and han6 and thm4 r2 0 80 during chlorination at this ph range han formation was approximately 10 of han4 and han6 formation on a mass basis future papers providing the values for all model parameters especially don and doc listed above along with han formation and speciation will help to create larger and more complete datasets and advance the

pk a1 2 23 pk a2 6 95 and pk a3 11 52 while as iii is in the form of nonionized molecules pk a1 9 30 pk a2 12 03 and pk a3 13 40 fig s2 modelled by the mineql 5 0 schecher and mcavoy 2015 at low ph as iii is prevalent at e h between 0 and 500 mv and as v is stable at e h above 500 mv smedley and kinniburgh 2002 several studies demonstrate that 50 90 of arsenic is in the form of as iii in groundwater due to the reductive environment si et al 2016 yu et al 2017 ahmad et al 2018 wei et al 2018 as iii has a higher toxicity than as v and its mobility is lower and treatment e g by adsorption coagulation and precipitation is less efficient than as v kim and kim 2014 watts et al 2014 jacukowicz sobala et al 2020 therefore the pre oxidation of as iii to as v has commonly been regarded as the necessary way to efficiently remove total as however the extra as v removal is needed which will increase the total cost therefore simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii is drawing more and more interest at present many functional materials are prepared such as iron manganese oxide zhang et al 2007 mno2 loaded polystyrene resin lenoble et al 2004 cuo zno photocatalyst samad et al 2016 and zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron li et al 2017 and the corresponding heterogeneous systems are designed for improving simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii however the additional material preparation and energy input will increase the processing cost in practical applications and most of these functional materials are still in the laboratory research stage and they have not been applied in practice the fenton fenton like process which has been widely used has good potentials to achieve simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii without the need to prepare new materials it can generate such powerful reactive oxygen species ros as hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 for the as iii oxidation hug and leupin 2003 wang et al 2013 on the other hand the coagulation adsorption effects of fe iii contribute to as iii removal due to the high affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for the arsenic species qin et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 however there are several drawbacks limiting the practical applications of the process 1 the working ph range is narrow ph 2 0 3 0 2 in order to use the coagulation effect of iron ions to remove total arsenic it is necessary to increase the ph which greatly increases the cost 3 the utilization efficiency of hydrogen peroxide is low and a large amount of hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to produce oxygen and water 4 hydrogen peroxide is explosive and it needs to be stored in a specific container and place as an oxidant in solid form chemically similar to h2o2 in aqueous phase calcium peroxide cao2 is attracting more attentions because it is relatively easier to be stored and transported than h2o2 qian et al 2013 the release rate of oxidants e g h2o2 from cao2 can be regulated by controlling ph and temperature which overcomes the poor utilization of oxidants due to the rapid decomposition lu et al 2017 xue et al 2019 based on the stability of fe iii the fe iii cao2 fenton like process was developed for the degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol and trichloroethene zhang et al 2016 pan et al 2018 the fe iii cao2 system shows higher oxidation capacity than fe iii h2o2 system at ph 6 bogan et al 2003 northup and cassidy 2008 although fe iii cao2 fenton like system have been used for the removal of organic pollutants the physical and chemical properties of as iii is quite different with organic pollutants as far as we know no research about using fe iii cao2 fenton like system in the redox conversion and removal of inorganic species have been reported moreover the related research does not pay attention to the role of calcium in pollutants removal it is known that calcium ion can help to improve the coagulation efficiency in the wastewater treatment due to the formation of ca oh 2 the calcium ion can lead to the arsenic removal by the sweep precipitation the ca fe nascent colloids might be formed due to hydrolysis and complexation of the dissolved metals e g ca ii fe ii and fe iii these colloidal matters are composed of a group of nano scaled solids in nature and may adsorb arsenic species from aqueous solutions leading to the purification of contamination it is therefore of scientific interest and of practical importance to study the fe iii cao2 technology for the oxidation and adsorption processes on the as iii removal the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the fe iii cao2 technology for as iii removal ii to identify the mechanisms for the enhanced removal of as iii a series of oxidation and adsorption studies were conducted to obtain the optimized treatment conditions the experimental studies and instrumental analysis were performed to better understand the removal mechanisms 2 materials and

2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp purchased from the aladdin chemistry co ltd was used to identify the generation of singlet oxygen during as iii oxidation the stock solution of 10 mm as iii was prepared by using na3aso3 the stock solutions of 100 mm fe iii h2o2 and cao2 were prepared by using fe no3 3 9h2o h2o2 and cao2 respectively all stock solutions were stored under the ambient condition with an aluminum foil covered the ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm from the water purification system milli q gard 2 millipore corporation was used during the experimental studies 2 2 analytical methods a 5 ml sample was filtered through the 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to remove the possible suspended solids another 2 ml sample solution was taken and then acidified by 2 hcl 0 75 ml to dissolve the suspended solids in order that the as iii and as v adsorbed in the ca fe nascent colloids were dissolved and the concentrations were measured the total arsenic concentration of the filtered samples and acidified samples were determined by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 3000dv perkin elmer the as v concentration of the filtered samples and acidified samples was measured by the molybdenum blue detection method described in text s1 of the supporting information si joyati and sarkar 2016 the concentration of as iii was determined by subtracting the value of as v concentration from that of the total arsenic concentration the concentration of h2o2 in the filtered sample was determined by a spectrophotometric method using titanium potassium oxalate as the chromogenic reagent at 410 nm sellers 1980 the measurement approach for h2o2 was described in text s2 of si the concentration of fe ii in the solution was determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method at 512 nm tamura et al 1974 this method was described in text s3 of si in the measurement of total iron concentration the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used to reduce all other iron species and the total iron concentration of the resulting solution was tested by the aforementioned approach this method for the total iron concentration measurement was also verified by the icp oes the performance of oxidation and removal of as iii was evaluated by three parameters 1 as iii t as iii 0 2 adsorption of as v formed and 3 removal efficiency where as iii t is concentration of as iii in system as iii in both supernatant solution phase and colloids colloidal phase at time t and as iii 0 is initial as iii concentration the detailed information was given in text s4 of si 2 3 as iii oxidation and removal in the as iii removal experiments the borate buffer prepared by h3bo3 nacl and na2b4o7 solution was used to control the solution ph 7 0 all the experiments were carried out in triple parallels and the error bars were determined and given the kinetics experiments of as iii oxidation and removal by fe iii cao2 system were first carried out the experimental details were as follows the 0 1 mm as iii solution ph 7 0 0 1 was prepared and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm at the room temperature the reactions for oxidation removal were immediately initiated after adding fe iii and cao2 solution step by step at the given time a sample solution was taken for further detection and analysis the as iii oxidation is described by the pseudo first order kinetics equation as 1 d c d t k 1 c where c is the concentration of as iii at time t k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant in order to find out the mechanisms on the oxidation and removal of as iii by fe iii cao2 system additional kinetics studies with cao2 h2o2 fe iii and fe iii h2o2 were conducted the experimental conditions and procedures were the same as the fe iii cao2 system the effect of the ratio of fe iii cao2 with 3 mm cao2 and the dosage of cao2 on as iii removal were also studied text s5 in si the details of experiments about effects of water chemistry factors were listed in si text s6 the significant difference analysis of the experimental data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences spss software version 20 the experimental statistical analysis was conducted with the results given in figure the error bars are given in the figures the experimental errors are all within the acceptable range 2 4 quantitative experiments for mechanism study fe iv may be generated in the process and affect the oxidation of arsenite in order to identify the possible generation of fe iv the dmso 0 1 and 1 m or pmso 5 and 50 mm was added initially to the solution before the addition of fe iii and cao2 the experiment was conducted with the aforementioned kinetics experimental procedures in order to find out the generation of rros and their effects on the oxidation a few kinetics experiments on the oxidation of arsenite were conducted l histidine nan3 p bq and ffa were first added to the solution the aforementioned experimental procedures were followed the data were fitted by the 1st order kinetics reaction equation the generation of 1o2 in the reaction solution were tested by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer the epr spectra were obtained on bruker a300 when the reaction takes 10 min under the following condition 3509 44 g of center magnetic field 100 g of sweep width 9 87 ghz of microwave frequency and 20 00 mw of microwave power the solvent replacement experiment with d2o was conducted to identify the formation of 1o2 2 5 characterization of nascent colloid the nascent colloids were collected by filtering washing with ultrapure water and freeze drying for 24 h the collected samples were used for the following characterization the chemical state of fe and as in the samples was determined by the x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps aes430s anelva with the monochromatic al kα radiation at voltage of 15 kv and current of 5 ma the scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin was used to determine the particle size and morphology of colloidal samples the existence of fe as and ca in the colloids was detected by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimized fe iii cao2 ratio the fe iii cao2 ratio from 1 6 to 1 3 was used to find out the best ratio for the as iii oxidation and the as v adsorption as shown in fig s3 the very similar behaviors in the as iii oxidation and removal are observed when the ratios of fe iii cao2 are 1 3 and 1 2 thus the ratio of 1 3 was used throughout the study another experiment was conducted at the fe iii cao2 ratio 1 3 and the cao2 concentration varied from 1 to 4 mm as demonstrated in fig s4 the as iii oxidation and as v adsorption are strongly dependent upon on the dosage of fe iii and cao2 at the given experimental conditions the 3 or 4 mm cao2 shows the best performance the treatment of arsenite is likely due to the fast adsorption of arsenic species mainly as iii and then oxidation of as iii to as v to be discussed in section 3 2 3 2 arsenite oxidation and arsenic removal the performances of h2o2 fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 on the oxidation of as iii to as v and the removal of arsenic as a function of time were studied fig 1 a shows that 10 9 of as iii is oxidized in the fe iii system due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in the solution that is similar to what were reported e g hug and leupin 2003 the as iii is oxidized by 33 9 and 36 4 in the presence of h2o2 and cao2 respectively the findings are due to the favorable homogeneous oxidation of as iii by h2o2 and are consistent with those in the literatures kim et al 2015 pettine et al 1999 notably as iii is almost completely oxidized by the fe iii cao2 within 240 min higher than that by fe iii h2o2 88 9 the figure indicates that a contact time of 240 min is sufficient to reach the equilibrium maximum removal this contact time was therefore used for the study on the effect of the presence of competing substances on as iii removal sections 3 5 in the engineering design the contact time may be reduced as the great efficiencies for both removal and oxidation are achieved within a shorter contact time such as 60 min approximate arsenic removal of 90 as shown in fig 1b the experiment data are well described by the pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation the k 1 min 1 values for as iii oxidation are 6 00 10 5 1 38 10 3 1 49 10 3 9 99 10 3 and 1 99 10 2 min 1 in the presence of fe iii h2o2 cao2 fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 respectively the oxidation rate of fe iii cao2 system is twice of fe iii h2o2 indicating more powerful oxidation capacity from cao2 and or the synergic effects from fe iii and cao2 fig 1c shows the arsenic removal efficiency follows the descending sequence fe iii cao2 95 8 fe iii h2o2 63 3 fe iii 51 7 cao2 12 1 among them fe iii cao2 system performs the best in the removal of arsenic when the fe iii cao2 technology is used the remaining total arsenic concentration is 0 3 mg l 1 and the oxidation rate of as iii in the fe iii cao2 system is almost 100 the arsenic after the treatment exists as as v less toxic and much easier to be removed than as iii and can be further treated by nano filtration or adsorption e g by granular ferric hydroxide to meet the governmental regulations it was experimentally found that the concentration of total iron in the fe iii cao2 system was less than 0 01 mg l 1 data not shown this is far below the drinking water standard of fe 0 3 mg l 1 thus the contamination by iron in the treated water is not the issue of concern moreover irons existed as the colloidal matters can be removed via separation technologies such as settling and or filtration the release of h2o2 from the cao2 and fe iii cao2 can be seen during the experiments fig 1d which is due to equation 1 of table 2 the h2o2 concentrations for both cases are stable at 0 17 to 0 2 mm at reaction time 20 min the h2o2 existence in the solution results from its generation from the cao2 and the consumption due to the oxidation of arsenite the constant concentration level of h2o2 is greatly beneficial to its full utilization in both oxidation and removal of as iii liquid solid reactions which distinguishes it from other liquid oxidants form such as h2o2 liquid liquid reactions and faster kinetics the comparison of figs 1a c shows that the removal of arsenic as iii as v is faster than the oxidation of as iii to as v the difference indicates that the arsenic treatment process first starts with the adsorption of as iii onto the nascent colloid and subsequently the adsorbed as iii is oxidized by the oxidants expressed in h2o2 slowly released from the cao2 an evidence is given in section 3 7 2 and figs 7b d 3 3 effect of initial ph generally solution ph is an important factor in water treatment processes such as precipitation aop and adsorption hence the effect of initial ph on the arsenic treatment was experimentally studied figs s5a b show the excellent performances in oxidation and removal of as iii in a wider ph range of 3 9 much better than the reported studies on the fe ii h2o2 process hug and leupin 2003 demonstrated that as iii was completely oxidized in the fe ii h2o2 process however the removal was less satisfactory the fe ii h2o2 process worked well in ph 4 to 7 dong et al 2011 fig s5c shows an increase in the solution ph at the end of process resulting from the buffering effect by fe iii cao2 process particularly in the acidic solution comparison of figs s5a c shows that both oxidation of arenite and adsorption of as v perform almost the same when the final ph is between 9 and 10 which is slightly better than those when the final ph is 7 7 the fe iii cao2 process outperforms the traditional fenton s reaction as the ph in the treatment does not have to be fixed at 3 which is required in the fenton s reaction in the event of treating acidic as iii containing wastewater the fe iii cao2 process can neutralize the solution to ph 7 8 which meets the regulations set by governments e g ph 6 to 9 from allowable limits for trade effluent discharge to watercourse or controlled watercourse set by national environment agency of singapore 3 4 effect of as iii concentration the effect of initial as iii concentration on the performance of fe iii cao2 process was studied with the results given in fig s6 almost complete oxidation for as iii and as v adsorption efficiency of above 90 are achieved at the initial concentrations of 0 05 and 0 1 mm however the as iii oxidation efficiency of 70 and as v adsorption of 64 are seen at 0 2 mm as iii as fe iii and cao2 are insufficient for the oxidation and or adsorption therefore higher dosage of fe iii cao2 is needed when the initial concentration of as iii is higher 3 5 effect of cationic heavy metals and anions generally cationic heavy metals cd ii pb ii cu ii and mn ii coexist in industrial wastewater such as coal processing wastewater asokbunyarat et al 2015 acid mine drainage wastewater xie et al 2018 it is of great academic interest and practical importance to study the effects of their presences on the oxidation and removal of as iii as shown in fig 2 a the coexistence of cationic heavy metals cd ii pb ii cu ii and mn ii enhances the removal of as iii there is a significant difference for the removal efficiency p 0 05 it is likely due to the mechanism that the cations may act as bridge for anchoring aso 4 3 on the ca fe colloid in addition the heavy metals may form metal hydroxides ph 7 in the study serving as additional adsorptive sites for the arsenic adsorption as fig 2b shown the fe iii cao2 process also has a high performance for the removal of the coexisting heavy metals almost all the heavy metals can completely be removed at the initial concentration of 0 1 mm this may be due to the adsorption of these heavy metals onto the ca fe colloid when the initial concentration of heavy metal e g mn ii is increased to 10 mm the removal efficiency remains 80 92 this result is due to 1 adsorption of cationic heavy metal onto the ca fe colloid is favorable at higher ph e g ph 7 in this study 2 metal precipitates can be formed at ph 7 and then removed together with the ca fe colloid the significant difference p 0 05 demonstrated that the initial concentration of heavy metal has a great influence on their removal efficiency as reported in the literatures different anions have varying effects on the adsorption of as by maghemite nanoparticles tuutijärvi et al 2012 and the effects of anions on the removal as iii and as v are different nemade et al 2007 moreover no as removal research has been carried in fe iii cao2 system to evaluate the feasibility of the technology in as iii contaminated water it is necessary to study the effect of different ions which commonly coexist with as iii on the removal of as iii by this system the anions cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 are commonly found in wastewater gao et al 2011 yu et al 2017 the mean concentrations of cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 reportedly were 8 24 10 08 and 2 14 mm in the high arsenic groundwater respectively gao et al 2011 therefore we chose 0 10 mm cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 to study their effects on the as iii removal figs 2c d in general the presence of anions causes the decrease in the oxidation and the removal of as iii by less than 10 which are no significant difference p 0 05 this is likely due to two reasons 1 these anions do not retard the oxidation of as iii 2 the concentrations of anions of up to 10 mm do not affect the adsorption of as iii nevertheless better oxidation and removal of above 90 can still be achieved in the presence of the anions up to 10 mm this suggests that the fe iii cao2 system has an excellent performance in the as iii removal and thus is suitable in treating both industrial wastewater and natural arsenite contaminated water phosphate po 4 3 shows a negative effect on the removal of anionic substances zhang et al 2008 huang et al 2017 yu et al 2017 hence the effect of po 4 3 on the arsenic treatment was studied as shown in the inset photo in fig 3 the production of nascent colloid decreases with an increase in po 4 3 concentration almost no colloid can be seen at 10 mm po 4 3 because a soluble fe iii phosphate complex was formed when the phosphate concentration is present in excess to the iron concentration hilton et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2007 fig 3 shows that the as iii removal gradually decreases with the increase of po 4 3 concentration from 0 to 0 5 mm it drops greatly from 0 5 to 10 mm only 5 of as iii is removed at 10 mm po 4 3 it confirms that the formation of soluble fe iii phosphate complex leads to less fe iii precipitants for as adsorption moreover there was a significant competing adsorption role of phosphate with arsenate on colloid due to their similar structure which was consistent with the findings of literature jain and loeppert 2000 pang et al 2020 it should be noted that the phosphate concentrations typically are below 2 mg l 1 in the as iii and or as v concentrations in the contaminated groundwater much lower than 0 3 mmol l 1 shown in fig 3 as such the presence of phosphate on the arsenic removal by the fe iii cao2 technology is not the matter of concern 3 6 effect of natural organic matters natural organic matters noms ubiquitously exist in surface water and groundwater rutlidge et al 2021 which may affect as iii oxidation through the consumption of ros mainly oh superoxide o2 and 1o2 the humic acid ha was widely selected as the representative of noms for investigation of effect of noms on the as iii oxidation and removal in the presence of ha 20 mg l 1 the adsorption of as iii and as v onto nzvi was reduced from 100 to 43 and 68 respectively giasuddin et al 2007 however the humic substances had no effect on the removal of arsenic on the fenton fe2 h2o2 treatment of industrial wastewater at ph 3 5 while the presence of humate even promote the removal of arsenic at ph 7 0 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 therefore the effect of ha on the removal behaves differently in the reported systems fig 4 shows a little impact on the oxidation and removal of as iii in the presence of ha when the concentration of ha is increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 the oxidation and removal efficiency slightly decrease from 99 96 to 98 45 and from 95 80 to 95 53 respectively the ros generated by the fe iii cao2 process is selective for the as iii oxidation in the presence of noms it indicates the application prospects of this technology for removing as iii from surface water and groundwater the negligible effect of ha on the removal of arsenite seen in this study is likely due to the higher contents of both calcium and iron which leaves sufficient binding sites for the uptake of arsenic in order to further explain the practical application of fe iii cao2 we expanded the reaction system from 100 ml to 1000 ml it found that the scale of the system had little effect on the removal effect indicating that the technology could be applied on a larger scale fig s7 as presented in fig s8 the oxidation efficiency of additional as iii in groundwater and pearl river water is 95 9 and 94 0 respectively table s1 the removal efficiency of as iii is 90 0 in groundwater and 87 3 in pearl river water it indicates that this technology has a practical application significance 3 7 mechanisms for as iii oxidation and removal 3 7 1 as iii oxidation 3 7 1 1 generation of fe iv it is documented that the change in the valency of iron plays a vital role in the fenton like reaction munoz et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the fe iv can reportedly be formed in the fenton like reaction hug and leupin 2003 ding et al 2018 the dmso can react with fe iv according to the 2nd order reaction kinetics with the constant k 2 of 1 26 0 06 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 bataineh et al 2012 meanwhile dmso can also react with oh with the constant of k 2 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 according to the literature veltwisch et al 1980 comparison of these two values indicates that the kinetics of dmso oh reaction is very faster than dmso fe iv thus it was used to find out whether fe iv was generated in the process and the effect on the as iii oxidation fig s9 shows the as iii oxidation efficiency in the presence absence of dmso the findings in 0 1 m and 1 0 m dmso experiments are virtually the same at 240 min the oxidation efficiency in the presence of 1 0 m dmso is less than that in the absence of dmso with a difference of 7 6 the small decrease might be attributed to the consumption of oxidants e g oh by reacting with the dmso in other word the generation of fe iv in the process is negligible to further rule out the contribution of fe iv on as iii oxidation in the fe iii cao2 system methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso is chosen as the chemical probe the pmso can be oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by fe iv and such products as formaldehyde are formed by the reactions between pmso and other ros sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the concentrations of pmso and pmso2 were determined by the hplc text s10 in si li et al 2021 fig s10 shows that the concentration of pmso decreases from 0 050 to 0 039 mm when the reaction proceeds for 240 min and no formation of pmso2 it suggests that pmso is oxidized by ros rather than fe iv in fe iii cao2 system this is consistent with the finding that fe iv has little contribution to as iii oxidation in fenton reaction pang et al 2011 3 7 1 2 oxidation state of iron and arsenic in nascent colloid the xps analysis was applied to analyze the chemical states of iron on the nascent colloid which hypothetically plays a key role in the removal of arsenic as shown in fig s11a the peaks of fe 2p3 2 located at 714 and 712 ev are ascribed to fe iii and the peak at 710 ev is assigned to fe ii chen et al 2019 the content of fe ii among the iron species on the nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 system 45 1 is higher than the fe iii h2o2 system 42 7 since the conversion of fe iii to fe ii is the control step of fenton reaction the higher content of fe ii in fe iii cao2 process indicates that the control step is more favorable as illustrated in fig s11b the binding energy peaks of as 3d on the nascent colloid in the fe iii h2o2 system appear at 44 3 and 45 4 ev which correspond to as iii and as v respectively sun et al 2017 notably only a peak of as v is observed on the nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 system it clearly demonstrates that the arsenic adsorbed onto the colloids is mainly in the form of less toxic as v 3 7 1 3 generation of reactive oxygen species the ros composed of mainly oh o2 and 1o2 are reportedly generated through the fenton fenton like reactions yi et al 2019 to identify the involvement of ros in the as iii oxidation a few experiments using the quenching agents were carried out the l histidine was selected as the scavenger of oh and 1o2 k 2 l histidine oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k 2 l histidine 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 yao et al 2015 nan3 were chosen as a scavenger for 1o2 and p bq for o2 respectively k 2 nan 3 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 k 2 p bq o 2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 dai et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the presence of l histidine scavenger for oh and 1o2 causes the as iii oxidation efficiencies decrease from 99 9 to 64 3 from 88 9 to 65 0 and from 92 6 to 54 3 in the fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems respectively table 1 the kinetics data for the experiments with 30 mm l histidine were fitted by the 1st order reaction kinetics equation with the constants given in the same table the constants are almost the same 0 00338 0 00325 and 0 00312 min 1 for the fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems respectively this implies that oh and 1o2 might be the major ros for the as iii oxidation the generation of oh in fe iii cao2 system is through 1 the self decomposition of cao2 reaction a in table 2 2 the cycle of fe iii fe ii reactions b to f in table 2 it should be noted that the l histidine cannot fully inhibit consume oh and 1o2 as they are generated through liquid solid reactions and not completely available in the liquid addition of 0 1 m nan3 scavenger for 1o2 shows no influence on the as iii oxidation in the fe iii h2o2 system from 88 9 to 88 5 table 1 however as iii oxidation efficiencies decrease from 99 9 to 91 2 in fe iii cao2 system and from 92 6 to 89 4 in ca ii fe iii h2o2 system the decrease follows by the descending sequence of fe iii cao2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 no change it indicates that the presence of calcium ion in the form of cao2 can promote the generation of 1o2 with a certain level namely from 99 9 to 91 2 which contributes to the better oxidation of as iii as shown in table 1 the decrease in oxidation due to the p bq follows by the descending sequence of fe iii h2o2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii cao2 no change the inhibition effect of 1 mm p bq suggests that o2 plays a certain role in the as iii oxidation by the fe iii h2o2 ca ii may participate in the production of 1o2 due to reactions between o2 and ca ii reactions g to h table 2 nardello et al 1998 li et al 2018 this would lead to the consumption of o2 thus one can conclude that o2 makes no contribution in the as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 process to further verify the formation of 1o2 and the promoting role of ca2 furfuryl alcohol ffa was used as the scavenger of 1o2 k 2 ffa 1 o 2 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 as illustrated by fig 5 a as iii oxidation efficiency decreases from 99 9 to 94 9 and 83 3 with the addition of 5 and 50 mm ffa in the fe iii cao2 system it suggests that 1o2 contributes to as iii oxidation the addition of 50 mm ffa has no influence on the as iii oxidation in fe iii h2o2 system while the as iii oxidation efficiency decreases from 92 9 to 82 3 with the addition of 50 mm ffa in ca ii fe iii h2o2 system indicating that the presence of ca ii is beneficial in the formation of 1o2 in addition it has been reported that 1o2 has a lifetime of 2 μs in h2o and 20 68 μs in d2o chen et al 2017 merkel and kearns 1972 therefore the solvent replacement experiment was conducted fig 5b shows that the oxidation rate of as iii is faster in the presence of d2o as solvent than that of h2o in fe iii cao2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems while the oxidation rate of as iii in fe iii h2o2 system is similar with h2o and d2o as solvent above results can confirm the generation of 1o2 in fe iii cao2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems and the promoting role of ca2 in 1o2 generation singlet oxygen and temp can react with each other as shown in fig 6 a characteristic 1 1 1 triplet signal of temp 1o2 appear in the three systems similar to the reported finding chen et al 2020 the intensity of temp 1o2 signal follows by the descending order fe iii cao2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 this clearly indicates that the presence of ca ii accelerates the generation of 1o2 especially in fe iii cao2 system therefore the ca ii plays a key role in generation of 1o2 leading to the as iii oxidation in the fe iii cao2 system the findings are consistent with the results obtained from the quenching experiments therefore a conclusion can be drawn that oh and 1o2 is the important ros for as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 system and fe iii h2o2 system the oh plays a more crucial role in the oxidation than the 1o2 3 7 2 ca fe nascent colloid for as iii removal the as iii removal by cao2 fe iii fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 was studied to find out the unique role of fe iii cao2 as shown in fig 7 a cao2 can cause the arsenic removal with the overall efficiency of 12 0 at 240 min in the adsorbed arsenic the as v and as iii content is 5 7 and 6 3 respectively indicating about half of as iii being oxidized by the oxidants released from the cao2 the removal of arsenic is due to the coagulation by ca oh 2 and the oxidants both of which result from the effect of cao2 the coagulation by ca oh 2 for the removal of as iii and as v may lead to the formation of ca aso2 2 ca oh 2 and ca3 aso4 2 ca oh 2 respectively according to eqs 2 and 3 nishimura and tozawa 1984 the oxidation effect by the cao2 can further enhance the coagulation of arsenic as as v is much easier to be adsorbed by the ca oh 2 than as iii 2 2 c a 2 2 aso 2 2 o h ca as o 2 2 ca oh 2 3 4 c a 2 2 aso 4 3 2 o h c a 3 as o 4 2 ca oh 2 fig 7b shows that as iii is removed by fe iii with an efficiency of 49 4 at 240 min due to the high coagulants affinity of fe iii to the arsenic species no as v was found indicating no oxidation of as iii caused by fe iii this is consistent with the finding that the coagulation of fe iii has the good removal 116 μg as iii mg fe meng et al 2000 due to the adsorption and the electrostatic interaction the fe iii leads to the higher as iii removal than the calcium fig 7a vs 7b the speciation of iron fe iii was modeled by mineql 5 0 schecher and mcavoy 2015 it was found that the hematite fe2o3 is the only precipitate in the system based on an assumption of ph 7 fe iii 1 0 mm and as iii 0 0 1 mm it is likely that the arsenite is adsorbed onto the hematite leading to the removal fig 7c shows that as iii is removed by 63 3 in the fe iii h2o2 process at time 240 min the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 may lead to the formation of the nascent colloid feooh2 according to eq 4 ahir et al 2015 resulting in the uptake of arsenic the adsorption of arsenic is in the form of as iii 25 9 and as v 37 4 at time 240 min 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 feoo h 2 h the equilibrium time for the uptake of arsenic is 120 and 180 min for fe iii and fe iii h2o2 process respectively figs 7b c the uptake in the fe iii process is faster than the fe iii h2o2 process this implies that the arsenic initially as as iii is first adsorbed onto the colloidal iron solid and subsequently oxidized to as v fig 7d demonstrates that the removal of arsenic is further improved in the fe iii cao2 process the excellent removal efficiency of about 80 can be seen at the beginning of sampling time of 1 min and gradually increases to a stable level of approximately 96 at 240 min the measurement of as iii and as v in the solid phase shows that the percentage of as v increases from 13 7 to 93 7 while that of as iii decreases from 67 1 to 2 1 as time goes this indicates that the as iii is firstly adsorbed onto the yellow ca fe nascent colloid and subsequently gradually oxidized to as v in fe iii cao2 process to further find out the role of the nascent colloid feooh2 the feooh was added into h2o2 and cao2 systems due to their similarity as shown in fig 8 a the oxidation in term of as iii t as iii 0 as iii t and as iii 0 being total as iii concentration in the system at time t and total as iii concentration defined in text s4 are 0 318 and 0 409 in feooh h2o2 and feooh cao2 system at t 240 min respectively about 18 of total arsenic is removed by adsorption in these two processes fig 8b moreover fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 systems perform much better in both oxidation and removal of as iii than feooh h2o2 and feooh cao2 processes which is consistent with the findings in figs 1a c it confirms the significant role of nascent colloid for the as iii removal furthermore fig s12 shows the decrease in the ca ii concentration namely dissolved calcium species in water in the fe iii cao2 process this decrease is nicely correlated with the increase in the uptake of arsenic this indicates that the ca ii is participated to form the ca fe nascent colloid which contributes to the as iii removal fig s13 compared with the nascent colloid in the fe iii h2o2 process the ca fe nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 process exhibits the smaller particle sizes 50 100 nm and better dispersion figs 9 a d it suggests that more active sites are available on the ca fe nascent colloid for the as iii removal as illustrated in the eds results of two nascent colloids fig 9e f the content of arsenic on the ca fe nascent colloids is higher the ca fe nascent colloid contains 14 96 of ca element it indicates that part of ca ii participates in the formation of ca fe nascent colloids 3 8 conceptual model for process the mechanism of as iii oxidation and removal in the fe iii cao2 process is illustrated in scheme 1 the arsenic ions are adsorbed on the ca fe nascent colloid via the surface complex formation and most of adsorbed arsenite ions are then oxidized by oh and 1o2 on the ca fe nascent colloids on the other hand as iii ions may also be oxidized to as v in the solution which is adsorbed onto the ca fe nascent colloid through the surface complex formation through the fe iii cao2 process the more toxic as iii ions are oxidized to less toxic as v ions most of which are adsorbed onto the nascent colloid 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that fe iii cao2 fenton like technology performed well in oxidizing and removing as iii from aqueous solutions in wide ph application range of 3 to 9 the as iii oxidation and removal efficiencies of fe iii cao2 process were 100 and 95 8 respectively higher than fe iii h2o2 system 88 9 and 63 3 the oxidation rate of fe iii cao2 process was twice of fe iii h2o2 process the performance was slightly affected in the presence of cationic heavy metals and commonly existing anions oh was the major ros for as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 process while the generation of 1o2 helped to oxidize some of arsenite the ca ii from cao2 played a vital role in the generation of 1o2 for as iii oxidation and participated in forming ca fe nascent colloid for as iii removal the fe iii cao2 technology is simple to operate and the chemicals needed are low cost

16861,arsenite contaminated water is one of severe global environmental problems it is challenging to treat as iii pollution by a one step technology in this study we developed a fe iii cao2 fenton like technology for the treatment of as iii the simultaneous oxidation of arsenite and removal of arsenic were achieved with efficiencies of nearly 100 and 95 8 respectively which outperforms conventional technologies it worked well in ph 3 to 9 and in the presence of cationic heavy metals anions and humic acid moreover the po 4 3 inhibited the removal of as iii oh and 1o2 played the important roles in the oxidation of as iii the ca ii derived from cao2 made a significant contribution to the oxidation and removal of as iii the sem and xps studies confirmed that the formation of ca fe nascent colloid caused the effective removal of arsenic our study demonstrates that the one step fe iii cao2 technology has a great potential for purification of the as iii contaminated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords as iii fe iii cao2 ca fe nascent colloid oxidation adsorption 1 introduction the arsenic in water possesses serious health risks to humans zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2013 han et al 2019 as a result the governmental agencies such as us environmental protection agency usepa and the world health organization who have set 10 µg l 1 as the drinking water standard on arsenic contaminant in certain locations such as western azerbaijan iran the concentration of as iii reaches as high as 43 mg l 1 in groundwater hosseini et al 2019 in the industrial wastewater the concentration of as iii is even as high as 4706 mg l 1 liao et al 2020 long term exposure and intake of as contaminated water cause skin lesions kidney failure and cancers luo et al 2012 he et al 2014 arsenic is commonly present in the form of arsenite as iii and arsenate as v in the environment vaiano et al 2018 in natural water system ph 6 5 8 5 as v mostly exists as oxyanions pk a1 2 23 pk a2 6 95 and pk a3 11 52 while as iii is in the form of nonionized molecules pk a1 9 30 pk a2 12 03 and pk a3 13 40 fig s2 modelled by the mineql 5 0 schecher and mcavoy 2015 at low ph as iii is prevalent at e h between 0 and 500 mv and as v is stable at e h above 500 mv smedley and kinniburgh 2002 several studies demonstrate that 50 90 of arsenic is in the form of as iii in groundwater due to the reductive environment si et al 2016 yu et al 2017 ahmad et al 2018 wei et al 2018 as iii has a higher toxicity than as v and its mobility is lower and treatment e g by adsorption coagulation and precipitation is less efficient than as v kim and kim 2014 watts et al 2014 jacukowicz sobala et al 2020 therefore the pre oxidation of as iii to as v has commonly been regarded as the necessary way to efficiently remove total as however the extra as v removal is needed which will increase the total cost therefore simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii is drawing more and more interest at present many functional materials are prepared such as iron manganese oxide zhang et al 2007 mno2 loaded polystyrene resin lenoble et al 2004 cuo zno photocatalyst samad et al 2016 and zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron li et al 2017 and the corresponding heterogeneous systems are designed for improving simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii however the additional material preparation and energy input will increase the processing cost in practical applications and most of these functional materials are still in the laboratory research stage and they have not been applied in practice the fenton fenton like process which has been widely used has good potentials to achieve simultaneous oxidation and removal of as iii without the need to prepare new materials it can generate such powerful reactive oxygen species ros as hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 for the as iii oxidation hug and leupin 2003 wang et al 2013 on the other hand the coagulation adsorption effects of fe iii contribute to as iii removal due to the high affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for the arsenic species qin et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 however there are several drawbacks limiting the practical applications of the process 1 the working ph range is narrow ph 2 0 3 0 2 in order to use the coagulation effect of iron ions to remove total arsenic it is necessary to increase the ph which greatly increases the cost 3 the utilization efficiency of hydrogen peroxide is low and a large amount of hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to produce oxygen and water 4 hydrogen peroxide is explosive and it needs to be stored in a specific container and place as an oxidant in solid form chemically similar to h2o2 in aqueous phase calcium peroxide cao2 is attracting more attentions because it is relatively easier to be stored and transported than h2o2 qian et al 2013 the release rate of oxidants e g h2o2 from cao2 can be regulated by controlling ph and temperature which overcomes the poor utilization of oxidants due to the rapid decomposition lu et al 2017 xue et al 2019 based on the stability of fe iii the fe iii cao2 fenton like process was developed for the degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol and trichloroethene zhang et al 2016 pan et al 2018 the fe iii cao2 system shows higher oxidation capacity than fe iii h2o2 system at ph 6 bogan et al 2003 northup and cassidy 2008 although fe iii cao2 fenton like system have been used for the removal of organic pollutants the physical and chemical properties of as iii is quite different with organic pollutants as far as we know no research about using fe iii cao2 fenton like system in the redox conversion and removal of inorganic species have been reported moreover the related research does not pay attention to the role of calcium in pollutants removal it is known that calcium ion can help to improve the coagulation efficiency in the wastewater treatment due to the formation of ca oh 2 the calcium ion can lead to the arsenic removal by the sweep precipitation the ca fe nascent colloids might be formed due to hydrolysis and complexation of the dissolved metals e g ca ii fe ii and fe iii these colloidal matters are composed of a group of nano scaled solids in nature and may adsorb arsenic species from aqueous solutions leading to the purification of contamination it is therefore of scientific interest and of practical importance to study the fe iii cao2 technology for the oxidation and adsorption processes on the as iii removal the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the fe iii cao2 technology for as iii removal ii to identify the mechanisms for the enhanced removal of as iii a series of oxidation and adsorption studies were conducted to obtain the optimized treatment conditions the experimental studies and instrumental analysis were performed to better understand the removal mechanisms 2 materials and

2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp purchased from the aladdin chemistry co ltd was used to identify the generation of singlet oxygen during as iii oxidation the stock solution of 10 mm as iii was prepared by using na3aso3 the stock solutions of 100 mm fe iii h2o2 and cao2 were prepared by using fe no3 3 9h2o h2o2 and cao2 respectively all stock solutions were stored under the ambient condition with an aluminum foil covered the ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm from the water purification system milli q gard 2 millipore corporation was used during the experimental studies 2 2 analytical methods a 5 ml sample was filtered through the 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane to remove the possible suspended solids another 2 ml sample solution was taken and then acidified by 2 hcl 0 75 ml to dissolve the suspended solids in order that the as iii and as v adsorbed in the ca fe nascent colloids were dissolved and the concentrations were measured the total arsenic concentration of the filtered samples and acidified samples were determined by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 3000dv perkin elmer the as v concentration of the filtered samples and acidified samples was measured by the molybdenum blue detection method described in text s1 of the supporting information si joyati and sarkar 2016 the concentration of as iii was determined by subtracting the value of as v concentration from that of the total arsenic concentration the concentration of h2o2 in the filtered sample was determined by a spectrophotometric method using titanium potassium oxalate as the chromogenic reagent at 410 nm sellers 1980 the measurement approach for h2o2 was described in text s2 of si the concentration of fe ii in the solution was determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method at 512 nm tamura et al 1974 this method was described in text s3 of si in the measurement of total iron concentration the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used to reduce all other iron species and the total iron concentration of the resulting solution was tested by the aforementioned approach this method for the total iron concentration measurement was also verified by the icp oes the performance of oxidation and removal of as iii was evaluated by three parameters 1 as iii t as iii 0 2 adsorption of as v formed and 3 removal efficiency where as iii t is concentration of as iii in system as iii in both supernatant solution phase and colloids colloidal phase at time t and as iii 0 is initial as iii concentration the detailed information was given in text s4 of si 2 3 as iii oxidation and removal in the as iii removal experiments the borate buffer prepared by h3bo3 nacl and na2b4o7 solution was used to control the solution ph 7 0 all the experiments were carried out in triple parallels and the error bars were determined and given the kinetics experiments of as iii oxidation and removal by fe iii cao2 system were first carried out the experimental details were as follows the 0 1 mm as iii solution ph 7 0 0 1 was prepared and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm at the room temperature the reactions for oxidation removal were immediately initiated after adding fe iii and cao2 solution step by step at the given time a sample solution was taken for further detection and analysis the as iii oxidation is described by the pseudo first order kinetics equation as 1 d c d t k 1 c where c is the concentration of as iii at time t k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant in order to find out the mechanisms on the oxidation and removal of as iii by fe iii cao2 system additional kinetics studies with cao2 h2o2 fe iii and fe iii h2o2 were conducted the experimental conditions and procedures were the same as the fe iii cao2 system the effect of the ratio of fe iii cao2 with 3 mm cao2 and the dosage of cao2 on as iii removal were also studied text s5 in si the details of experiments about effects of water chemistry factors were listed in si text s6 the significant difference analysis of the experimental data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences spss software version 20 the experimental statistical analysis was conducted with the results given in figure the error bars are given in the figures the experimental errors are all within the acceptable range 2 4 quantitative experiments for mechanism study fe iv may be generated in the process and affect the oxidation of arsenite in order to identify the possible generation of fe iv the dmso 0 1 and 1 m or pmso 5 and 50 mm was added initially to the solution before the addition of fe iii and cao2 the experiment was conducted with the aforementioned kinetics experimental procedures in order to find out the generation of rros and their effects on the oxidation a few kinetics experiments on the oxidation of arsenite were conducted l histidine nan3 p bq and ffa were first added to the solution the aforementioned experimental procedures were followed the data were fitted by the 1st order kinetics reaction equation the generation of 1o2 in the reaction solution were tested by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer the epr spectra were obtained on bruker a300 when the reaction takes 10 min under the following condition 3509 44 g of center magnetic field 100 g of sweep width 9 87 ghz of microwave frequency and 20 00 mw of microwave power the solvent replacement experiment with d2o was conducted to identify the formation of 1o2 2 5 characterization of nascent colloid the nascent colloids were collected by filtering washing with ultrapure water and freeze drying for 24 h the collected samples were used for the following characterization the chemical state of fe and as in the samples was determined by the x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps aes430s anelva with the monochromatic al kα radiation at voltage of 15 kv and current of 5 ma the scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin was used to determine the particle size and morphology of colloidal samples the existence of fe as and ca in the colloids was detected by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimized fe iii cao2 ratio the fe iii cao2 ratio from 1 6 to 1 3 was used to find out the best ratio for the as iii oxidation and the as v adsorption as shown in fig s3 the very similar behaviors in the as iii oxidation and removal are observed when the ratios of fe iii cao2 are 1 3 and 1 2 thus the ratio of 1 3 was used throughout the study another experiment was conducted at the fe iii cao2 ratio 1 3 and the cao2 concentration varied from 1 to 4 mm as demonstrated in fig s4 the as iii oxidation and as v adsorption are strongly dependent upon on the dosage of fe iii and cao2 at the given experimental conditions the 3 or 4 mm cao2 shows the best performance the treatment of arsenite is likely due to the fast adsorption of arsenic species mainly as iii and then oxidation of as iii to as v to be discussed in section 3 2 3 2 arsenite oxidation and arsenic removal the performances of h2o2 fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 on the oxidation of as iii to as v and the removal of arsenic as a function of time were studied fig 1 a shows that 10 9 of as iii is oxidized in the fe iii system due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in the solution that is similar to what were reported e g hug and leupin 2003 the as iii is oxidized by 33 9 and 36 4 in the presence of h2o2 and cao2 respectively the findings are due to the favorable homogeneous oxidation of as iii by h2o2 and are consistent with those in the literatures kim et al 2015 pettine et al 1999 notably as iii is almost completely oxidized by the fe iii cao2 within 240 min higher than that by fe iii h2o2 88 9 the figure indicates that a contact time of 240 min is sufficient to reach the equilibrium maximum removal this contact time was therefore used for the study on the effect of the presence of competing substances on as iii removal sections 3 5 in the engineering design the contact time may be reduced as the great efficiencies for both removal and oxidation are achieved within a shorter contact time such as 60 min approximate arsenic removal of 90 as shown in fig 1b the experiment data are well described by the pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation the k 1 min 1 values for as iii oxidation are 6 00 10 5 1 38 10 3 1 49 10 3 9 99 10 3 and 1 99 10 2 min 1 in the presence of fe iii h2o2 cao2 fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 respectively the oxidation rate of fe iii cao2 system is twice of fe iii h2o2 indicating more powerful oxidation capacity from cao2 and or the synergic effects from fe iii and cao2 fig 1c shows the arsenic removal efficiency follows the descending sequence fe iii cao2 95 8 fe iii h2o2 63 3 fe iii 51 7 cao2 12 1 among them fe iii cao2 system performs the best in the removal of arsenic when the fe iii cao2 technology is used the remaining total arsenic concentration is 0 3 mg l 1 and the oxidation rate of as iii in the fe iii cao2 system is almost 100 the arsenic after the treatment exists as as v less toxic and much easier to be removed than as iii and can be further treated by nano filtration or adsorption e g by granular ferric hydroxide to meet the governmental regulations it was experimentally found that the concentration of total iron in the fe iii cao2 system was less than 0 01 mg l 1 data not shown this is far below the drinking water standard of fe 0 3 mg l 1 thus the contamination by iron in the treated water is not the issue of concern moreover irons existed as the colloidal matters can be removed via separation technologies such as settling and or filtration the release of h2o2 from the cao2 and fe iii cao2 can be seen during the experiments fig 1d which is due to equation 1 of table 2 the h2o2 concentrations for both cases are stable at 0 17 to 0 2 mm at reaction time 20 min the h2o2 existence in the solution results from its generation from the cao2 and the consumption due to the oxidation of arsenite the constant concentration level of h2o2 is greatly beneficial to its full utilization in both oxidation and removal of as iii liquid solid reactions which distinguishes it from other liquid oxidants form such as h2o2 liquid liquid reactions and faster kinetics the comparison of figs 1a c shows that the removal of arsenic as iii as v is faster than the oxidation of as iii to as v the difference indicates that the arsenic treatment process first starts with the adsorption of as iii onto the nascent colloid and subsequently the adsorbed as iii is oxidized by the oxidants expressed in h2o2 slowly released from the cao2 an evidence is given in section 3 7 2 and figs 7b d 3 3 effect of initial ph generally solution ph is an important factor in water treatment processes such as precipitation aop and adsorption hence the effect of initial ph on the arsenic treatment was experimentally studied figs s5a b show the excellent performances in oxidation and removal of as iii in a wider ph range of 3 9 much better than the reported studies on the fe ii h2o2 process hug and leupin 2003 demonstrated that as iii was completely oxidized in the fe ii h2o2 process however the removal was less satisfactory the fe ii h2o2 process worked well in ph 4 to 7 dong et al 2011 fig s5c shows an increase in the solution ph at the end of process resulting from the buffering effect by fe iii cao2 process particularly in the acidic solution comparison of figs s5a c shows that both oxidation of arenite and adsorption of as v perform almost the same when the final ph is between 9 and 10 which is slightly better than those when the final ph is 7 7 the fe iii cao2 process outperforms the traditional fenton s reaction as the ph in the treatment does not have to be fixed at 3 which is required in the fenton s reaction in the event of treating acidic as iii containing wastewater the fe iii cao2 process can neutralize the solution to ph 7 8 which meets the regulations set by governments e g ph 6 to 9 from allowable limits for trade effluent discharge to watercourse or controlled watercourse set by national environment agency of singapore 3 4 effect of as iii concentration the effect of initial as iii concentration on the performance of fe iii cao2 process was studied with the results given in fig s6 almost complete oxidation for as iii and as v adsorption efficiency of above 90 are achieved at the initial concentrations of 0 05 and 0 1 mm however the as iii oxidation efficiency of 70 and as v adsorption of 64 are seen at 0 2 mm as iii as fe iii and cao2 are insufficient for the oxidation and or adsorption therefore higher dosage of fe iii cao2 is needed when the initial concentration of as iii is higher 3 5 effect of cationic heavy metals and anions generally cationic heavy metals cd ii pb ii cu ii and mn ii coexist in industrial wastewater such as coal processing wastewater asokbunyarat et al 2015 acid mine drainage wastewater xie et al 2018 it is of great academic interest and practical importance to study the effects of their presences on the oxidation and removal of as iii as shown in fig 2 a the coexistence of cationic heavy metals cd ii pb ii cu ii and mn ii enhances the removal of as iii there is a significant difference for the removal efficiency p 0 05 it is likely due to the mechanism that the cations may act as bridge for anchoring aso 4 3 on the ca fe colloid in addition the heavy metals may form metal hydroxides ph 7 in the study serving as additional adsorptive sites for the arsenic adsorption as fig 2b shown the fe iii cao2 process also has a high performance for the removal of the coexisting heavy metals almost all the heavy metals can completely be removed at the initial concentration of 0 1 mm this may be due to the adsorption of these heavy metals onto the ca fe colloid when the initial concentration of heavy metal e g mn ii is increased to 10 mm the removal efficiency remains 80 92 this result is due to 1 adsorption of cationic heavy metal onto the ca fe colloid is favorable at higher ph e g ph 7 in this study 2 metal precipitates can be formed at ph 7 and then removed together with the ca fe colloid the significant difference p 0 05 demonstrated that the initial concentration of heavy metal has a great influence on their removal efficiency as reported in the literatures different anions have varying effects on the adsorption of as by maghemite nanoparticles tuutijärvi et al 2012 and the effects of anions on the removal as iii and as v are different nemade et al 2007 moreover no as removal research has been carried in fe iii cao2 system to evaluate the feasibility of the technology in as iii contaminated water it is necessary to study the effect of different ions which commonly coexist with as iii on the removal of as iii by this system the anions cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 are commonly found in wastewater gao et al 2011 yu et al 2017 the mean concentrations of cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 reportedly were 8 24 10 08 and 2 14 mm in the high arsenic groundwater respectively gao et al 2011 therefore we chose 0 10 mm cl co 3 2 and so 4 2 to study their effects on the as iii removal figs 2c d in general the presence of anions causes the decrease in the oxidation and the removal of as iii by less than 10 which are no significant difference p 0 05 this is likely due to two reasons 1 these anions do not retard the oxidation of as iii 2 the concentrations of anions of up to 10 mm do not affect the adsorption of as iii nevertheless better oxidation and removal of above 90 can still be achieved in the presence of the anions up to 10 mm this suggests that the fe iii cao2 system has an excellent performance in the as iii removal and thus is suitable in treating both industrial wastewater and natural arsenite contaminated water phosphate po 4 3 shows a negative effect on the removal of anionic substances zhang et al 2008 huang et al 2017 yu et al 2017 hence the effect of po 4 3 on the arsenic treatment was studied as shown in the inset photo in fig 3 the production of nascent colloid decreases with an increase in po 4 3 concentration almost no colloid can be seen at 10 mm po 4 3 because a soluble fe iii phosphate complex was formed when the phosphate concentration is present in excess to the iron concentration hilton et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2007 fig 3 shows that the as iii removal gradually decreases with the increase of po 4 3 concentration from 0 to 0 5 mm it drops greatly from 0 5 to 10 mm only 5 of as iii is removed at 10 mm po 4 3 it confirms that the formation of soluble fe iii phosphate complex leads to less fe iii precipitants for as adsorption moreover there was a significant competing adsorption role of phosphate with arsenate on colloid due to their similar structure which was consistent with the findings of literature jain and loeppert 2000 pang et al 2020 it should be noted that the phosphate concentrations typically are below 2 mg l 1 in the as iii and or as v concentrations in the contaminated groundwater much lower than 0 3 mmol l 1 shown in fig 3 as such the presence of phosphate on the arsenic removal by the fe iii cao2 technology is not the matter of concern 3 6 effect of natural organic matters natural organic matters noms ubiquitously exist in surface water and groundwater rutlidge et al 2021 which may affect as iii oxidation through the consumption of ros mainly oh superoxide o2 and 1o2 the humic acid ha was widely selected as the representative of noms for investigation of effect of noms on the as iii oxidation and removal in the presence of ha 20 mg l 1 the adsorption of as iii and as v onto nzvi was reduced from 100 to 43 and 68 respectively giasuddin et al 2007 however the humic substances had no effect on the removal of arsenic on the fenton fe2 h2o2 treatment of industrial wastewater at ph 3 5 while the presence of humate even promote the removal of arsenic at ph 7 0 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 therefore the effect of ha on the removal behaves differently in the reported systems fig 4 shows a little impact on the oxidation and removal of as iii in the presence of ha when the concentration of ha is increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 the oxidation and removal efficiency slightly decrease from 99 96 to 98 45 and from 95 80 to 95 53 respectively the ros generated by the fe iii cao2 process is selective for the as iii oxidation in the presence of noms it indicates the application prospects of this technology for removing as iii from surface water and groundwater the negligible effect of ha on the removal of arsenite seen in this study is likely due to the higher contents of both calcium and iron which leaves sufficient binding sites for the uptake of arsenic in order to further explain the practical application of fe iii cao2 we expanded the reaction system from 100 ml to 1000 ml it found that the scale of the system had little effect on the removal effect indicating that the technology could be applied on a larger scale fig s7 as presented in fig s8 the oxidation efficiency of additional as iii in groundwater and pearl river water is 95 9 and 94 0 respectively table s1 the removal efficiency of as iii is 90 0 in groundwater and 87 3 in pearl river water it indicates that this technology has a practical application significance 3 7 mechanisms for as iii oxidation and removal 3 7 1 as iii oxidation 3 7 1 1 generation of fe iv it is documented that the change in the valency of iron plays a vital role in the fenton like reaction munoz et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the fe iv can reportedly be formed in the fenton like reaction hug and leupin 2003 ding et al 2018 the dmso can react with fe iv according to the 2nd order reaction kinetics with the constant k 2 of 1 26 0 06 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 bataineh et al 2012 meanwhile dmso can also react with oh with the constant of k 2 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 according to the literature veltwisch et al 1980 comparison of these two values indicates that the kinetics of dmso oh reaction is very faster than dmso fe iv thus it was used to find out whether fe iv was generated in the process and the effect on the as iii oxidation fig s9 shows the as iii oxidation efficiency in the presence absence of dmso the findings in 0 1 m and 1 0 m dmso experiments are virtually the same at 240 min the oxidation efficiency in the presence of 1 0 m dmso is less than that in the absence of dmso with a difference of 7 6 the small decrease might be attributed to the consumption of oxidants e g oh by reacting with the dmso in other word the generation of fe iv in the process is negligible to further rule out the contribution of fe iv on as iii oxidation in the fe iii cao2 system methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso is chosen as the chemical probe the pmso can be oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by fe iv and such products as formaldehyde are formed by the reactions between pmso and other ros sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the concentrations of pmso and pmso2 were determined by the hplc text s10 in si li et al 2021 fig s10 shows that the concentration of pmso decreases from 0 050 to 0 039 mm when the reaction proceeds for 240 min and no formation of pmso2 it suggests that pmso is oxidized by ros rather than fe iv in fe iii cao2 system this is consistent with the finding that fe iv has little contribution to as iii oxidation in fenton reaction pang et al 2011 3 7 1 2 oxidation state of iron and arsenic in nascent colloid the xps analysis was applied to analyze the chemical states of iron on the nascent colloid which hypothetically plays a key role in the removal of arsenic as shown in fig s11a the peaks of fe 2p3 2 located at 714 and 712 ev are ascribed to fe iii and the peak at 710 ev is assigned to fe ii chen et al 2019 the content of fe ii among the iron species on the nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 system 45 1 is higher than the fe iii h2o2 system 42 7 since the conversion of fe iii to fe ii is the control step of fenton reaction the higher content of fe ii in fe iii cao2 process indicates that the control step is more favorable as illustrated in fig s11b the binding energy peaks of as 3d on the nascent colloid in the fe iii h2o2 system appear at 44 3 and 45 4 ev which correspond to as iii and as v respectively sun et al 2017 notably only a peak of as v is observed on the nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 system it clearly demonstrates that the arsenic adsorbed onto the colloids is mainly in the form of less toxic as v 3 7 1 3 generation of reactive oxygen species the ros composed of mainly oh o2 and 1o2 are reportedly generated through the fenton fenton like reactions yi et al 2019 to identify the involvement of ros in the as iii oxidation a few experiments using the quenching agents were carried out the l histidine was selected as the scavenger of oh and 1o2 k 2 l histidine oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k 2 l histidine 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 yao et al 2015 nan3 were chosen as a scavenger for 1o2 and p bq for o2 respectively k 2 nan 3 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 k 2 p bq o 2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 dai et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the presence of l histidine scavenger for oh and 1o2 causes the as iii oxidation efficiencies decrease from 99 9 to 64 3 from 88 9 to 65 0 and from 92 6 to 54 3 in the fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems respectively table 1 the kinetics data for the experiments with 30 mm l histidine were fitted by the 1st order reaction kinetics equation with the constants given in the same table the constants are almost the same 0 00338 0 00325 and 0 00312 min 1 for the fe iii cao2 fe iii h2o2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems respectively this implies that oh and 1o2 might be the major ros for the as iii oxidation the generation of oh in fe iii cao2 system is through 1 the self decomposition of cao2 reaction a in table 2 2 the cycle of fe iii fe ii reactions b to f in table 2 it should be noted that the l histidine cannot fully inhibit consume oh and 1o2 as they are generated through liquid solid reactions and not completely available in the liquid addition of 0 1 m nan3 scavenger for 1o2 shows no influence on the as iii oxidation in the fe iii h2o2 system from 88 9 to 88 5 table 1 however as iii oxidation efficiencies decrease from 99 9 to 91 2 in fe iii cao2 system and from 92 6 to 89 4 in ca ii fe iii h2o2 system the decrease follows by the descending sequence of fe iii cao2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 no change it indicates that the presence of calcium ion in the form of cao2 can promote the generation of 1o2 with a certain level namely from 99 9 to 91 2 which contributes to the better oxidation of as iii as shown in table 1 the decrease in oxidation due to the p bq follows by the descending sequence of fe iii h2o2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii cao2 no change the inhibition effect of 1 mm p bq suggests that o2 plays a certain role in the as iii oxidation by the fe iii h2o2 ca ii may participate in the production of 1o2 due to reactions between o2 and ca ii reactions g to h table 2 nardello et al 1998 li et al 2018 this would lead to the consumption of o2 thus one can conclude that o2 makes no contribution in the as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 process to further verify the formation of 1o2 and the promoting role of ca2 furfuryl alcohol ffa was used as the scavenger of 1o2 k 2 ffa 1 o 2 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 as illustrated by fig 5 a as iii oxidation efficiency decreases from 99 9 to 94 9 and 83 3 with the addition of 5 and 50 mm ffa in the fe iii cao2 system it suggests that 1o2 contributes to as iii oxidation the addition of 50 mm ffa has no influence on the as iii oxidation in fe iii h2o2 system while the as iii oxidation efficiency decreases from 92 9 to 82 3 with the addition of 50 mm ffa in ca ii fe iii h2o2 system indicating that the presence of ca ii is beneficial in the formation of 1o2 in addition it has been reported that 1o2 has a lifetime of 2 μs in h2o and 20 68 μs in d2o chen et al 2017 merkel and kearns 1972 therefore the solvent replacement experiment was conducted fig 5b shows that the oxidation rate of as iii is faster in the presence of d2o as solvent than that of h2o in fe iii cao2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems while the oxidation rate of as iii in fe iii h2o2 system is similar with h2o and d2o as solvent above results can confirm the generation of 1o2 in fe iii cao2 and ca ii fe iii h2o2 systems and the promoting role of ca2 in 1o2 generation singlet oxygen and temp can react with each other as shown in fig 6 a characteristic 1 1 1 triplet signal of temp 1o2 appear in the three systems similar to the reported finding chen et al 2020 the intensity of temp 1o2 signal follows by the descending order fe iii cao2 ca ii fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 this clearly indicates that the presence of ca ii accelerates the generation of 1o2 especially in fe iii cao2 system therefore the ca ii plays a key role in generation of 1o2 leading to the as iii oxidation in the fe iii cao2 system the findings are consistent with the results obtained from the quenching experiments therefore a conclusion can be drawn that oh and 1o2 is the important ros for as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 system and fe iii h2o2 system the oh plays a more crucial role in the oxidation than the 1o2 3 7 2 ca fe nascent colloid for as iii removal the as iii removal by cao2 fe iii fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 was studied to find out the unique role of fe iii cao2 as shown in fig 7 a cao2 can cause the arsenic removal with the overall efficiency of 12 0 at 240 min in the adsorbed arsenic the as v and as iii content is 5 7 and 6 3 respectively indicating about half of as iii being oxidized by the oxidants released from the cao2 the removal of arsenic is due to the coagulation by ca oh 2 and the oxidants both of which result from the effect of cao2 the coagulation by ca oh 2 for the removal of as iii and as v may lead to the formation of ca aso2 2 ca oh 2 and ca3 aso4 2 ca oh 2 respectively according to eqs 2 and 3 nishimura and tozawa 1984 the oxidation effect by the cao2 can further enhance the coagulation of arsenic as as v is much easier to be adsorbed by the ca oh 2 than as iii 2 2 c a 2 2 aso 2 2 o h ca as o 2 2 ca oh 2 3 4 c a 2 2 aso 4 3 2 o h c a 3 as o 4 2 ca oh 2 fig 7b shows that as iii is removed by fe iii with an efficiency of 49 4 at 240 min due to the high coagulants affinity of fe iii to the arsenic species no as v was found indicating no oxidation of as iii caused by fe iii this is consistent with the finding that the coagulation of fe iii has the good removal 116 μg as iii mg fe meng et al 2000 due to the adsorption and the electrostatic interaction the fe iii leads to the higher as iii removal than the calcium fig 7a vs 7b the speciation of iron fe iii was modeled by mineql 5 0 schecher and mcavoy 2015 it was found that the hematite fe2o3 is the only precipitate in the system based on an assumption of ph 7 fe iii 1 0 mm and as iii 0 0 1 mm it is likely that the arsenite is adsorbed onto the hematite leading to the removal fig 7c shows that as iii is removed by 63 3 in the fe iii h2o2 process at time 240 min the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 may lead to the formation of the nascent colloid feooh2 according to eq 4 ahir et al 2015 resulting in the uptake of arsenic the adsorption of arsenic is in the form of as iii 25 9 and as v 37 4 at time 240 min 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 feoo h 2 h the equilibrium time for the uptake of arsenic is 120 and 180 min for fe iii and fe iii h2o2 process respectively figs 7b c the uptake in the fe iii process is faster than the fe iii h2o2 process this implies that the arsenic initially as as iii is first adsorbed onto the colloidal iron solid and subsequently oxidized to as v fig 7d demonstrates that the removal of arsenic is further improved in the fe iii cao2 process the excellent removal efficiency of about 80 can be seen at the beginning of sampling time of 1 min and gradually increases to a stable level of approximately 96 at 240 min the measurement of as iii and as v in the solid phase shows that the percentage of as v increases from 13 7 to 93 7 while that of as iii decreases from 67 1 to 2 1 as time goes this indicates that the as iii is firstly adsorbed onto the yellow ca fe nascent colloid and subsequently gradually oxidized to as v in fe iii cao2 process to further find out the role of the nascent colloid feooh2 the feooh was added into h2o2 and cao2 systems due to their similarity as shown in fig 8 a the oxidation in term of as iii t as iii 0 as iii t and as iii 0 being total as iii concentration in the system at time t and total as iii concentration defined in text s4 are 0 318 and 0 409 in feooh h2o2 and feooh cao2 system at t 240 min respectively about 18 of total arsenic is removed by adsorption in these two processes fig 8b moreover fe iii h2o2 and fe iii cao2 systems perform much better in both oxidation and removal of as iii than feooh h2o2 and feooh cao2 processes which is consistent with the findings in figs 1a c it confirms the significant role of nascent colloid for the as iii removal furthermore fig s12 shows the decrease in the ca ii concentration namely dissolved calcium species in water in the fe iii cao2 process this decrease is nicely correlated with the increase in the uptake of arsenic this indicates that the ca ii is participated to form the ca fe nascent colloid which contributes to the as iii removal fig s13 compared with the nascent colloid in the fe iii h2o2 process the ca fe nascent colloid in the fe iii cao2 process exhibits the smaller particle sizes 50 100 nm and better dispersion figs 9 a d it suggests that more active sites are available on the ca fe nascent colloid for the as iii removal as illustrated in the eds results of two nascent colloids fig 9e f the content of arsenic on the ca fe nascent colloids is higher the ca fe nascent colloid contains 14 96 of ca element it indicates that part of ca ii participates in the formation of ca fe nascent colloids 3 8 conceptual model for process the mechanism of as iii oxidation and removal in the fe iii cao2 process is illustrated in scheme 1 the arsenic ions are adsorbed on the ca fe nascent colloid via the surface complex formation and most of adsorbed arsenite ions are then oxidized by oh and 1o2 on the ca fe nascent colloids on the other hand as iii ions may also be oxidized to as v in the solution which is adsorbed onto the ca fe nascent colloid through the surface complex formation through the fe iii cao2 process the more toxic as iii ions are oxidized to less toxic as v ions most of which are adsorbed onto the nascent colloid 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that fe iii cao2 fenton like technology performed well in oxidizing and removing as iii from aqueous solutions in wide ph application range of 3 to 9 the as iii oxidation and removal efficiencies of fe iii cao2 process were 100 and 95 8 respectively higher than fe iii h2o2 system 88 9 and 63 3 the oxidation rate of fe iii cao2 process was twice of fe iii h2o2 process the performance was slightly affected in the presence of cationic heavy metals and commonly existing anions oh was the major ros for as iii oxidation in fe iii cao2 process while the generation of 1o2 helped to oxidize some of arsenite the ca ii from cao2 played a vital role in the generation of 1o2 for as iii oxidation and participated in forming ca fe nascent colloid for as iii removal the fe iii cao2 technology is simple to operate and the chemicals needed are low cost safe and easy to store it can be used to treat the arsenite containing industrial wastewater at lower operation cost declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16862,constructed wetland coupled with microbial fuel cells cw mfcs are a promising technology for sustainable wastewater treatment however the performance of cw mfcs has long been constrained by the limited size of its anode in this study we developed an alternative cw mfc configuration that uses inexpensive natural conductive pyrite as an anodic filling material pyano to extend the electroactive scope of the anode as a result the pyano configuration significantly facilitated the removal of chemical oxygen demand ammonium nitrogen total nitrogen and total phosphorus meanwhile the pyano increased the maximum power density by 52 7 as compared to that of the quartz sand control further a typical exoelectrogen geobacter was found enriched in the anodic zone of pyano indicating that the electroactive scope was extended by conductive pyrite in addition a substantial electron donating potential was observed for the anodic filling material of pyano which explained the higher electricity output meanwhile a higher dissimilatory iron reducing potential was observed for the anodic sediment of pyano demonstrating the integrity of an iron redox cycling in the system and its promotive effect for the wastewater treatment together these results implied that the pyano cw mfcs can be a competitive technology to enhance wastewater treatment and energy recovery simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland microbial fuel cell anode pyrite iron redox cycling 1 introduction in recent decades sustainable wastewater treatment has been received widespread attentions ardakani and badalians gholikandi 2020 recovering energy resources from the wastewater has been considered as a promising strategy wang et al 2017 therefore constructed wetlands coupled to microbial fuel cells cw mfcs have emerged as a potential wastewater treatment technology that can simultaneously achieve efficient pollutant removal and energy reclamation doherty et al 2015a ramírez vargas et al 2018 srivastava et al 2020a compared with conventional cws the intrinsic advantage of cw mfcs is that long distance electron transfer allows organics and ammonium to be oxidized efficiently in an anaerobic zone via extracellular electron transfer eet doherty et al 2015b srivastava et al 2020b for example a cw mfc microcosm established by fang et al 2013 showed a 12 65 higher efficiency in chemical oxygen demand cod removal compared with that of an open circuit control microcosm doherty et al 2015b estimated that the anode of their cw mfc microcosms contributed 22 to 33 of the cod removal to the whole system meanwhile as there is no need for aeration wu et al 2018 or tidal lu et al 2020 control operational cost can be saved corbella et al 2017 to date except for the municipal wastewater treatment cw mfcs have been proved to control antibiotics xu et al 2020 azo dyes fang et al 2013 and greenhouse gas emissions wang et al 2019 however enhancing the bioelectrochemical process remains a major challenge for cw mfcs ji et al 2021 as the functional exoelectrogens are confined in the anode area further treatment performance and electricity output improvements are limited by its electrode size which has a high construction cost itself logan et al 2006 doherty et al 2015a therefore an inexpensive substitute for the conventional anode material is required yang et al 2021b moreover despite the electricity production of cw mfcs their power density and coulombic efficiency are lower than that of milliliter scale mfcs wang et al 2017 this is because of the minor contribution of bare anode dependent exoelectrogens to organics removal doherty et al 2015a one strategy to address these problems is to extend the electroactive scope of anode by utilizing a conductive filling material in this context both carbonaceous materials and natural minerals are promising alternatives aguirre sierra et al 2016 li et al 2019b ge et al 2020 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2021b wherein the latter has economic advantages yang et al 2021b natural pyrite fes2 is an emerging cw filling material doherty et al 2015a because of its low cost and potential to promote autotrophic denitrification and phosphorus precipitation kong et al 2016 ge et al 2019 2020 liang et al 2020 however the reducibility of pyrite if not controlled may consume oxygen and cause adverse effects on the aerobic biological process ge et al 2019 this one way oxidation of pyrite is considered to make them unsustainable for long term wastewater treatment gil lozano et al 2017 to counterbalance this one way process and complete the iron redox cycle of pyrite the dissimilatory iron reduction dir may be a key factor most dir bacteria are electrochemically active kim et al 1999 and can be enriched in the anodic zone of cw mfcs xu et al 2020 currently there was only one study concerning pyrite based cw mfc from the literature ge et al 2020 but the authors focused on nutrient removal rather than iron redox cycling meanwhile in the existing cw and cw mfc studies pyrite was dispersedly mixed with limestone ge et al 2019 quartz sand ge et al 2020 or crushed oyster shells kong et al 2016 to avoid acidification in fact natural pyrite has been identified as a conductive mineral that enables the long distance transfer of bioelectric current in various environments nielsen et al 2010 taran 2017 norio et al 2019 however whether conterminous pyrite particles can enlarge the electroactive scope of an anode and thereby involve more exoelectrogens in the extracellular electron generation in cw mfcs remains unclear in addition the iron redox cycling process based on the bio electrochemical oxidation of pyrite and the dir process as well as its role on the performance of cw mfcs has yet to be determined therefore we propose an alternative configuration for cw mfcs to use inexpensive natural conductive pyrite in the anodic zone our hypothesis is that pyrite could extend the electroactive scope of the anode and involve a higher abundance of exoelectrogens in the bioelectrochemical process of cw mfcs meanwhile its iron redox cycling can further facilitate its treatment performance and electricity output to validate these hypotheses the treatment performance and electricity production of a pyrite anode cw mfc were monitored and compared with the control groups which were set up in the same size but with quartz sand or pyrite as the sole substrates to further clarify the underlying mechanisms the bioelectrochemical properties microbial community structure exoelectrogens potentials and filling material characterization were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of cw mfcs three identical cylindrical cw mfc rectors polyvinyl chloride inner diameter of 20 cm were established fig 1 under greenhouse condition 20 1 c light proof cloths were used to cover the side surfaces of the reactors each system was composed of a 5 cm supporting gravel layer limestone diameter of 5 8 mm at the bottom for the pyrite anode group pyano there was a 15 cm conterminous pyrite diameter of 3 5 mm anodic zone in the middle and a 10 cm quartz sand diameter of 3 5 mm cathodic zone at the top for the quartz sand control group qc a 25 cm quartz sand layer was substituted into both the anodic and cathodic zone to determine whether the conterminous pyrite could be extended to the cathodic zone an additional group was established wherein pyrite was used as the sole filling material for both anodic and cathodic zones ps both the anode and cathode were made of carbon fiber length width 13 cm 13 cm thickness of 3 mm inserted between two pieces of stainless steel mesh thickness of 0 7 mm 6 mesh the anode and cathode were placed at 10 cm and 30 cm

resistances were set to 1000 ω for every system throughout the batch experiment unless otherwise stated cyperus altrnlifolius was planted above the cathode the water level was controlled by an outlet pipe at a height of 30 cm from the bottom to ensure that the cathode was located at the water air interface the reactors were initiated on november 10 2019 following inoculation with mixed aerobic

the sediment mixture representing an aliquot of 1 6 ml of filling materials and 4 ml of deoxygenated culture solution with or without 0 1 mm fecl3 were added into an air tight silica tube in an anaerobic glove box to initiate the incubation for 24 h subsequently the generation of fe ii was used to evaluate the dir potential of anodic biofilms in different groups further details are provided

average voltages of the qc ps and pyano were 270 2 mv 71 3 mv 309 1 mv 130 0 mv and 416 0 mv 65 4 mv respectively compared with that of the qc the average voltage output was increased by 14 4 p 0 05 in the ps and by 54 0 p 0 005 in the pyano the polarization curves are presented in fig 3 the internal resistance rint was calculated from the linear slopes of voltage versus current fig 3a the results showed that the rint of the qc ps and pyano were approximately 417 3 ω 171 9 ω and 410 0 ω respectively in addition the maximum power density increased by 52 7 and 93 3 in the pyano approximately 22 0 mw m2 and ps approximately 27 8 mw m2 respectively as compared with that of the qc approximately 14 4 mw m2 fig 3b charge discharge tests were conducted in a stable batch the external circuits were initially disconnected to enable the anodic electric potential to plateau i e charging mode as the operational mode shifted from charging to discharging by reconnected the external circuits there was a sudden increase in the anodic electric potential fig s4 due to the esranode then the anodic resistance was evaluated by the esranode revealing that the pyano had a lower esranode approximately 10 mv than the ps approximately 30 mv and qc approximately 70 mv 3 3 microbial community analysis the microbial community compositions of biofilm on the anodic filling material are illustrated in fig 4 and table s2 the dominant classes included gammaproteobacteria desulfuromonadia and bacteroidia fig 4a these classes of microbes have been postulated to be possible exoelectrogens in various bioelectrochemical systems feng et al 2020b jawaharraj et al 2020 at the genus level it was found that geobacter which is a typical exoelectrogens shi et al 2009 zhuang et al 2020 was more enriched in the ps 10 5 3 1 and pyano 3 5 1 6 than the qc 0 5 0 3 fig 4b besides the network analysis revealed that a positive correlation spearman s correlation coefficient 0 6 existed significantly p value 0 005 between geobactereae and desulfosarcinaceae fig 4c desulfosarcinaceae is a sulfate reducing family lens 2009 and its co occurrence with the iron reducing family geobactereae indicated a ponderable interaction between iron and sulfur cycles of the systems barlett et al 2012 here it might also suggest that the enrichment of geobacter was a consequence of introducing iron sulfur ore into the anodic zone of cw mfcs 3 4 electron donating potential of biofilm on the anodic filling material the results of the bes experiment are illustrated in fig 5 during the 36 h operation the bioactive anodic pyrite showed an increasing voltage reaching 332 mv by the end of operation meanwhile the bioactive anodic quartz sand showed a lower electron donating potential wherein the voltage grew relatively slowly reaching only 45 mv nevertheless when autoclaved the anodic pyrite exhibited electron donating potential as the corresponding voltage remained relatively stable ranging from 19 mv to 25 mv whereas the autoclaved anodic quartz sand only achieved 4 mv 11 mv notably a potassium ferricyanide solution which has a standard potential fe cn 6 3 e fe cn 6 4 e0 361 mv vs nhe that is much lower than that of oxygen o2 4h 4e 2h2o e0 1229 mv vs nhe logan et al 2006 was used as catholyte in the bes experiment this suggests that the evaluated electron donating potential is conservative 3 5 dissimilatory iron reducing potential of anodic sediments the results of the dir potential are shown in fig 6 the bioactive sediment in the anodic zone of the pyano showed a substantial dir potential wherein 0 40 0 02 μmol fe ii ml pyrite was generated during a 1 d incubation this value was significantly higher than that of bioactive sediment in the anodic zone of qc 0 08 0 01 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand in the experiments without fe iii addition 0 27 0 03 μmol fe ii ml pyrite and 0 04 0 00 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand were generated this may be due to the indigenous fe iii content in the sediments furthermore scarce fe ii was generated by the abiotic sediments 0 05 0 00 μmol fe ii ml pyrite and 0 02 0 00 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand 3 6 pyrite oxidation proceeding in anodic and cathodic zone the high resolution spectra for the xps peaks of fe2p were shown in fig 7 in total there were seven peaks assigned to pyrite 706 85 ev and 707 23 ev partially oxidized pyrite 708 55 ev magnetite 710 40 ev hematite 711 30 ev and 712 35 ev and fe iii oxides 714 30 ev respectively de alwis et al 2019 dong et al 2020 droguett et al 2020 tabelin et al 2020 the original filling material presented the highest purity of pyrite with only a few partially oxidized components and minor magnetite at the surface fig 7a when pyrite was used in the anodic zone the original pyrite surface experienced corrosion producing various iron oxides i e magnetite hematite and other fe iii oxides minerals fig 7b meanwhile when pyrite was used in the cathodic zone even more surface corrosion occurred revealing the weakest original pyrite peaks and the strongest oxidized iron product peaks fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 enhancement of wastewater treatment in the current study natural pyrite was for the first time used as anodic filling material in a cw mfc microcosm i e pyano this novel strategy showed significant enhancement of wastewater treatment 4 1 1 cod removal the most interesting finding herein was that cod removal was significantly higher in the pyano and lower in the ps than that of the qc the cod mass removal efficiency of the pyano was comparable to that of previously reported intensified cws table s3 earlier studies exploited the potential of pyrite as a natural electron donating mineral to enhance nitrate removal in cws ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 and yield energy in fuel cells ju et al 2014 2015 2018 in line with these works followers have also been warned that the reducibility of pyrite will cause dissolved oxygen consumption and exert adverse effects on aerobic microbial cod removal ge et al 2019 therefore finding that the ps exhibited the poorest cod removal was expected as the pyrite in the cathode layer diminished dissolved oxygen that is crucial for the aerobic cod removal based on the large difference in cod removal efficiency between the pyano and ps it is reasonable to attribute the increased cod removal to the configuration of anodic rather than cathodic pyrite as illustrated in fig 8 under oxygen deficient conditions dissolved oxygen ranging from 0 1 mg l to 0 2 mg l table 1 the anodic pyrite was considered to enhance the cod removal in two ways firstly it facilitated the anode dependent eet process this was verified by the bes experiment which showed that the anodic pyrite with bioactivity had a substantial voltage output fig 5 anodic pyrite was able to extend the electroactive scope of anode to adjacent filling material nielsen et al 2010 taran 2017 norio et al 2019 this enlarged electroactive scope facilitated the formation of electroactive biofilms on the anodic filling material wu et al 2020 resulting in higher abundances of geobacter fig 4 in the anodic pyrite systems consequently the broader extracellular respiration of exoelectrogens promoted cod removal in the anaerobic environment doherty et al 2015b the second way is the dir process herein a higher dir potential was observed for the anodic sediment of the pyano than that of the qc fig 6 in the anodic environment favoring eet exoelectrogens may use organics to conduct extracellular electrons to either solid electrodes or metal oxides i e the dir process with limited distinction qu et al 2014 logan et al 2019 liu and li 2020 this is in consistent with our previous studies where a reduction of ferric mineral was found in anaerobic zone of cws chen et al 2016 although fe iii is not a major component of pyrite the fe ii content on the surface of pyrite is vulnerable to the dissolved oxygen feng et al 2020a and solid anode ju et al 2015 meanwhile the xps results revealed the bio electrochemically ju et al 2018 or chemically ge et al 2019 oxidized products e g magnetite and hematite on the surface of anodic pyrite fig 7 which can be used by dir bacteria to mineralize organics in the anodic environment lovley and phillips 1986 combined these processes contribute to the enhanced cod removal of the pyano system 4 1 2 nitrogen removal another potential benefit of using pyrite as an anodic filling material lies in its facilitation ability for nh4 n removal in cw mfcs under the oxygen deficient conditions herein table 1 anaerobic extracellular respiration may account for the nh4 n removal srivastava et al 2020b as anode dependent ammonium oxidation can be a significant process in bes systems chen et al 2014 qu et al 2014 jadhav and ghangrekar 2015 on top of that the increased nh4 n removal efficiency of the pyano compared with that of the qc may be ascribed to the anodic iron redox cycling yang et al 2018a 2018b wu et al 2019 in an anodic environment when fe iii is an accessible electron acceptor nh4 n can be oxidized to nox n and n2 via ammonium oxidation coupling with iron reduction known as feammox li et al 2019a previously shuai and jaffe 2019 demonstrated that by augmenting of ferrihydrite fe2o3 0 5h2o in a cw mesocosm ammonium oxidation was facilitated by feammox in this study the ferric oxide in the iron redox cycling was used by feammox bacteria to oxidize ammonium in an anodic environment although the definition of feammox microbes is currently controversial it has been postulated that geobacter may be involved in this process li et al 2019a thus the higher abundance of geobacter in the pyano and ps may suggest facilitated feammox in the anodic area for tn removal it was observed in a similar pattern with nh4 n removal no nitrate or nitrite accumulation was found in the effluents of all groups this suggests that a denitrification occurred concurrently with ammonium oxidation xu et al 2018 the ammonium oxidation rather than denitrification can be a rate limiting step because there was sufficient organics for a denitrification chu et al 2005 in addition reduced iron sulfur of pyrite can also be the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification in the ps and pyano kong et al 2016 this indicates the importance of nh4 n removal in such a high organics loading system it was previously indicated that the high organic loading may cause an unfavorable situation for aerobic autotrophic nitrifiers zhu et al 2014 therefore future studies are desirable to place more attentions at anaerobic electroanammox by the anode dependent eet and feammox by the iron redox cycling 4 1 3 phosphorus removal and residual iron tp removal was promoted in the pyrite based systems i e pyano and ps table 1 as the highest tp removal rate was achieved with the ps which has a large amount of pyrite the tp removal may be iron based phosphate precipitation ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 however the effluent iron of the ps was relatively high table 1 which may lead to secondary pollution thus the ps configuration may not be the recommended strategy in this regard the pyano was a better configuration as it achieved sufficient tp removal and produced minor effluent iron table 1 4 2 enhancement of energy yield using pyrite as an anodic and cathodic filling material can facilitate the energy yield in cw mfcs the maximum power densities of the pyano 22 0 mw m2 and ps 27 8 mw m2 found here exist at the upper level of those determined in previous studies table s4 meanwhile the ps showed substantially lower rint followed by the pyano while the qc had the highest rint fig 3 this electricity output increase may be due to the conterminous distribution of the conductive filling material li et al 2019b yang et al 2021b as mentioned in section 4 1 the conterminous distribution of pyrite can result in anode extension and the enrichment of exoelectrogen notably higher abundance of geobacter was found in the ps than in the pyano which is consistent with the higher maximum power density estimated for the ps however the maximum voltage of the ps was approximately 567 0 mv fig 3a which is lower than that of the pyano approximately 782 9 mv and the theoretical potential for typical acetate oxidizing anode and air cathode i e 805 0 mv see logan et al 2006 the conterminous pyrite in the ps probably acted as a conduit between anode and cathode resulting in internal current that divided the external voltage aguirre sierra et al 2016 this also explains the lower voltage of the ps than that of pyano during the batch experiments fig s3 in this context pyano rather than ps can be a reliable strategy to boost overall energy yield a lower esrano found for the pyano than the qc fig s4 indicated that conductive pyrite alleviates the barrier of electron transfer from electrogens to the anode i e ohmic resistance yu et al 2021 in addition a higher coulombic efficiency together with a higher cod removal of pyano compared to qc fig s5 validly indicates a higher conversion rate of cod to electricity generation logan et al 2006 wang and he 2020 furthermore a constant voltage output was observed for autoclaved pyrite in the bes experiment fig 5 demonstrating the electron donating potential by bare pyrite via electrochemical oxidation notably electrochemical oxidation of pyrite can be accelerated by iron oxidizing bacteria ju et al 2014 2015 2018 in this capacity the substantial voltage output in the bes experiment inoculated with bioactive pyrite fig 5 may have suggested the sacrificial role of anodic pyrite by iron oxidizing bacteria in the pyano system thus the use of pyrite as anodic filling material can be a promising strategy to increase the energy production in cw mfcs 5 engineering significance there has been a wide debate over various intensified cws partly due to their capital operational cost wu et al 2018 as for mfc integration since there is no energy consumption the major concern lies in the capital cost as previously analyzed by corbella et al 2017 the gravel graphite based cw mfcs showed 1 4 to 1 6 times more expensive than the conventional cws in this study we proposed a novel pyano configuration for cw mfcs on the premise of facilitating the wastewater treatment and electricity yield the pyano cw mfcs can save the filling material cost by 53 2 to 90 3 due to the lower price of pyrite than other conductive filling material such as granular graphite and granular activated carbon table s5 admittedly the operational condition in this study fell in the middle of existing cw technologies table s6 there are many optimizations yet to be carried forward in the future given its performance facilitation and low cost this novel pyano configuration shows potential to bring cw mfcs closer to achieving sustainable wastewater treatment and to recovering energy from wastewater 6 conclusions in this study we provided a pyano cw mfc configuration by filling natural conductive pyrite in the anodic zone consequently a significant enhancement in treatment performance namely the removal of cod nh4 n tn and tp was achieved simultaneously the electricity output was enhanced showing a 52 7 higher maximum power density than that of the quartz sand control herein the underlying mechanism was found to be the anode extension resulting from the conductivity of pyrite and the iron redox cycling that involves the bio electrochemical oxidation of pyrite and dir these results implied that a pyano cw mfcs is an ideal configuration for the sustainable wastewater treatment because of its efficiency in both treatment performance and energy reclamation as well as its economically reasonable construction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16862,constructed wetland coupled with microbial fuel cells cw mfcs are a promising technology for sustainable wastewater treatment however the performance of cw mfcs has long been constrained by the limited size of its anode in this study we developed an alternative cw mfc configuration that uses inexpensive natural conductive pyrite as an anodic filling material pyano to extend the electroactive scope of the anode as a result the pyano configuration significantly facilitated the removal of chemical oxygen demand ammonium nitrogen total nitrogen and total phosphorus meanwhile the pyano increased the maximum power density by 52 7 as compared to that of the quartz sand control further a typical exoelectrogen geobacter was found enriched in the anodic zone of pyano indicating that the electroactive scope was extended by conductive pyrite in addition a substantial electron donating potential was observed for the anodic filling material of pyano which explained the higher electricity output meanwhile a higher dissimilatory iron reducing potential was observed for the anodic sediment of pyano demonstrating the integrity of an iron redox cycling in the system and its promotive effect for the wastewater treatment together these results implied that the pyano cw mfcs can be a competitive technology to enhance wastewater treatment and energy recovery simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland microbial fuel cell anode pyrite iron redox cycling 1 introduction in recent decades sustainable wastewater treatment has been received widespread attentions ardakani and badalians gholikandi 2020 recovering energy resources from the wastewater has been considered as a promising strategy wang et al 2017 therefore constructed wetlands coupled to microbial fuel cells cw mfcs have emerged as a potential wastewater treatment technology that can simultaneously achieve efficient pollutant removal and energy reclamation doherty et al 2015a ramírez vargas et al 2018 srivastava et al 2020a compared with conventional cws the intrinsic advantage of cw mfcs is that long distance electron transfer allows organics and ammonium to be oxidized efficiently in an anaerobic zone via extracellular electron transfer eet doherty et al 2015b srivastava et al 2020b for example a cw mfc microcosm established by fang et al 2013 showed a 12 65 higher efficiency in chemical oxygen demand cod removal compared with that of an open circuit control microcosm doherty et al 2015b estimated that the anode of their cw mfc microcosms contributed 22 to 33 of the cod removal to the whole system meanwhile as there is no need for aeration wu et al 2018 or tidal lu et al 2020 control operational cost can be saved corbella et al 2017 to date except for the municipal wastewater treatment cw mfcs have been proved to control antibiotics xu et al 2020 azo dyes fang et al 2013 and greenhouse gas emissions wang et al 2019 however enhancing the bioelectrochemical process remains a major challenge for cw mfcs ji et al 2021 as the functional exoelectrogens are confined in the anode area further treatment performance and electricity output improvements are limited by its electrode size which has a high construction cost itself logan et al 2006 doherty et al 2015a therefore an inexpensive substitute for the conventional anode material is required yang et al 2021b moreover despite the electricity production of cw mfcs their power density and coulombic efficiency are lower than that of milliliter scale mfcs wang et al 2017 this is because of the minor contribution of bare anode dependent exoelectrogens to organics removal doherty et al 2015a one strategy to address these problems is to extend the electroactive scope of anode by utilizing a conductive filling material in this context both carbonaceous materials and natural minerals are promising alternatives aguirre sierra et al 2016 li et al 2019b ge et al 2020 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2021b wherein the latter has economic advantages yang et al 2021b natural pyrite fes2 is an emerging cw filling material doherty et al 2015a because of its low cost and potential to promote autotrophic denitrification and phosphorus precipitation kong et al 2016 ge et al 2019 2020 liang et al 2020 however the reducibility of pyrite if not controlled may consume oxygen and cause adverse effects on the aerobic biological process ge et al 2019 this one way oxidation of pyrite is considered to make them unsustainable for long term wastewater treatment gil lozano et al 2017 to counterbalance this one way process and complete the iron redox cycle of pyrite the dissimilatory iron reduction dir may be a key factor most dir bacteria are electrochemically active kim et al 1999 and can be enriched in the anodic zone of cw mfcs xu et al 2020 currently there was only one study concerning pyrite based cw mfc from the literature ge et al 2020 but the authors focused on nutrient removal rather than iron redox cycling meanwhile in the existing cw and cw mfc studies pyrite was dispersedly mixed with limestone ge et al 2019 quartz sand ge et al 2020 or crushed oyster shells kong et al 2016 to avoid acidification in fact natural pyrite has been identified as a conductive mineral that enables the long distance transfer of bioelectric current in various environments nielsen et al 2010 taran 2017 norio et al 2019 however whether conterminous pyrite particles can enlarge the electroactive scope of an anode and thereby involve more exoelectrogens in the extracellular electron generation in cw mfcs remains unclear in addition the iron redox cycling process based on the bio electrochemical oxidation of pyrite and the dir process as well as its role on the performance of cw mfcs has yet to be determined therefore we propose an alternative configuration for cw mfcs to use inexpensive natural conductive pyrite in the anodic zone our hypothesis is that pyrite could extend the electroactive scope of the anode and involve a higher abundance of exoelectrogens in the bioelectrochemical process of cw mfcs meanwhile its iron redox cycling can further facilitate its treatment performance and electricity output to validate these hypotheses the treatment performance and electricity production of a pyrite anode cw mfc were monitored and compared with the control groups which were set up in the same size but with quartz sand or pyrite as the sole substrates to further clarify the underlying mechanisms the bioelectrochemical properties microbial community structure exoelectrogens potentials and filling material characterization were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of cw mfcs three identical cylindrical cw mfc rectors polyvinyl chloride inner diameter of 20 cm were established fig 1 under greenhouse condition 20 1 c light proof cloths were used to cover the side surfaces of the reactors each system was composed of a 5 cm supporting gravel layer limestone diameter of 5 8 mm at the bottom for the pyrite anode group pyano there was a 15 cm conterminous pyrite diameter of 3 5 mm anodic zone in the middle and a 10 cm quartz sand diameter of 3 5 mm cathodic zone at the top for the quartz sand control group qc a 25 cm quartz sand layer was substituted into both the anodic and cathodic zone to determine whether the conterminous pyrite could be extended to the cathodic zone an additional group was established wherein pyrite was used as the sole filling material for both anodic and cathodic zones ps both the anode and cathode were made of carbon fiber length width 13 cm 13 cm thickness of 3 mm inserted between two pieces of stainless steel mesh thickness of 0 7 mm 6 mesh the anode and cathode were placed at 10 cm and 30 cm from the bottom respectively insulated copper wires were used as external circuits to connect both electrodes and epoxy resin glue was used to prevent the connection points from corrosion the external resistances were set to 1000 ω for every system throughout the batch experiment unless otherwise stated cyperus altrnlifolius was planted above the cathode the water level was controlled by an outlet pipe at a height of 30 cm from the bottom to ensure that the cathode was located at the water air interface the reactors were initiated on november 10 2019 following inoculation with mixed aerobic anaerobic activated sludge collected from the jingkou municipal wastewater treatment plant chongqing china the reactors were run in feed batch mode hydraulic retention time 3 d and hydraulic loading

influent parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 wastewater sampling and analyses over months of acclimation and stabilization the treatment performance remained stable therefore the formal sampling campaign began on september 10 2020 and lasted for 10 batches at the end of each batch the effluents were completely drained then to prevent damage to the internal environment the reactors were replenished with influent within 5 min for the next batch the influent and effluent samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and analyzed immediately cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen

electron donation a modified bioelectrochemical system bes experiment was conducted according to ju et al 2018 briefly 8 2 ml of pyrite and quartz sand were collected from the anodic zones of the pyano and qc respectively additionally the same amounts of autoclaved 120 c 1 h filling materials were used as abiotic controls the collected anodic filling materials were immediately transferred for cultivation in 28 ml bess fig s1 the electron donating potentials of the sediments were estimated by recording the voltage in 10 min intervals for 36 h further details are provided in the supplemental materials text s2 2 6 dissimilatory iron reduction potential test to compare the dir potential of the anodic sediments a modified suspended culturing experiment was conducted according to lovley and phillips 1986 briefly 16 4 ml of pyrite and quartz sand were collected from the anodic zones of pyano and qc respectively the autoclaved 120 c 1 h filling materials with equal amount were used as abiotic control the sediments were separated from the collected filling material by repeating for five times the procedures of shaking 200 rpm 10 min in 0 5 nacl buffer and centrifuging 8000 rpm 5 min the resultant supernatants were discarded and the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of deoxygenated culture solution 500 mg acetate cod l and 30 mg nh4 n l to obtain the sediment mixtures then 1 ml of the sediment mixture representing an aliquot of 1 6 ml of filling materials and 4 ml of deoxygenated culture solution with or without 0 1 mm fecl3 were added into an air tight silica tube in an anaerobic glove box to initiate the incubation for 24 h subsequently the generation of fe ii was used to evaluate the dir potential of anodic biofilms in different groups further details are provided in the supplemental materials text s3 and fig s2 2 7 x ray spectroscopic characterization of pyrite anodic and cathodic pyrite samples collected before and after the experiment were collected and stored in sterile glass bottles filled with ethanol after shaking via a thermostatic shaker at 225 rpm for 3 h to detach the biofilm the pyrite samples were dried via nitrogen flushing and stored in nitrogen for x ray spectroscopic xps analyses 2 8 statistical analyses herein we used spss version 20 0 for statistical analyses the results of replicated sample tests were reported as the mean standard deviation a one way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences between the two groups a threshold p value of 0 05 was selected to determine statistical significance to perform network analysis the r software version 3 6 3 with rstudio packages vegan igraph and hmisc was used ju et al 2017 only those strongly positive spearman s correlation coefficient 0 6 and significant p value 0 005 correlations were considered ju et al 2017 then the networks were visualized with gephi software version 0 9 2 3 results 3 1 overall treatment performance the wastewater parameters of the influent and effluents are summarized in table 1 the pyano had a significantly higher p 0 005 cod removal 86 7 7 2 than that of the qc 72 6 6 5 whereas the ps showed the poorest cod removal 59 9 7 4 fig 2 meanwhile the nh4 n removal rates by the qc ps and pyano were 20 1 2 7 25 7 2 1 and 32 5 2 7 respectively fig 2 both the pyano and ps significantly facilitated nh4 n removal p 0 005 as there was very little nox in the influent and effluents table 1 tn removal exhibited a similar pattern to nh4 n removal achieving removal rates of 30 7 3 4 30 2 3 4 and 36 7 3 6 by the qc ps and pyano respectively fig 2 moreover the tp removals of the qc ps and pyano were 7 0 5 1 46 6 5 8 and 20 1 6 3 respectively table 1 3 2 energy output internal resistance and anodic equivalent series resistance fig s3 shows the voltage changes during the experiment period the average voltage output was calculated by integrating the instantaneous voltages versus time within each batch overall the average voltages of the qc ps and pyano were 270 2 mv 71 3 mv 309 1 mv 130 0 mv and 416 0 mv 65 4 mv respectively compared with that of the qc the average voltage output was increased by 14 4 p 0 05 in the ps and by 54 0 p 0 005 in the pyano the polarization curves are presented in fig 3 the internal resistance rint was calculated from the linear slopes of voltage versus current fig 3a the results showed that the rint of the qc ps and pyano were approximately 417 3 ω 171 9 ω and 410 0 ω respectively in addition the maximum power density increased by 52 7 and 93 3 in the pyano approximately 22 0 mw m2 and ps approximately 27 8 mw m2 respectively as compared with that of the qc approximately 14 4 mw m2 fig 3b charge discharge tests were conducted in a stable batch the external circuits were initially disconnected to enable the anodic electric potential to plateau i e charging mode as the operational mode shifted from charging to discharging by reconnected the external circuits there was a sudden increase in the anodic electric potential fig s4 due to the esranode then the anodic resistance was evaluated by the esranode revealing that the pyano had a lower esranode approximately 10 mv than the ps approximately 30 mv and qc approximately 70 mv 3 3 microbial community analysis the microbial community compositions of biofilm on the anodic filling material are illustrated in fig 4 and table s2 the dominant classes included gammaproteobacteria desulfuromonadia and bacteroidia fig 4a these classes of microbes have been postulated to be possible exoelectrogens in various bioelectrochemical systems feng et al 2020b jawaharraj et al 2020 at the genus level it was found that geobacter which is a typical exoelectrogens shi et al 2009 zhuang et al 2020 was more enriched in the ps 10 5 3 1 and pyano 3 5 1 6 than the qc 0 5 0 3 fig 4b besides the network analysis revealed that a positive correlation spearman s correlation coefficient 0 6 existed significantly p value 0 005 between geobactereae and desulfosarcinaceae fig 4c desulfosarcinaceae is a sulfate reducing family lens 2009 and its co occurrence with the iron reducing family geobactereae indicated a ponderable interaction between iron and sulfur cycles of the systems barlett et al 2012 here it might also suggest that the enrichment of geobacter was a consequence of introducing iron sulfur ore into the anodic zone of cw mfcs 3 4 electron donating potential of biofilm on the anodic filling material the results of the bes experiment are illustrated in fig 5 during the 36 h operation the bioactive anodic pyrite showed an increasing voltage reaching 332 mv by the end of operation meanwhile the bioactive anodic quartz sand showed a lower electron donating potential wherein the voltage grew relatively slowly reaching only 45 mv nevertheless when autoclaved the anodic pyrite exhibited electron donating potential as the corresponding voltage remained relatively stable ranging from 19 mv to 25 mv whereas the autoclaved anodic quartz sand only achieved 4 mv 11 mv notably a potassium ferricyanide solution which has a standard potential fe cn 6 3 e fe cn 6 4 e0 361 mv vs nhe that is much lower than that of oxygen o2 4h 4e 2h2o e0 1229 mv vs nhe logan et al 2006 was used as catholyte in the bes experiment this suggests that the evaluated electron donating potential is conservative 3 5 dissimilatory iron reducing potential of anodic sediments the results of the dir potential are shown in fig 6 the bioactive sediment in the anodic zone of the pyano showed a substantial dir potential wherein 0 40 0 02 μmol fe ii ml pyrite was generated during a 1 d incubation this value was significantly higher than that of bioactive sediment in the anodic zone of qc 0 08 0 01 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand in the experiments without fe iii addition 0 27 0 03 μmol fe ii ml pyrite and 0 04 0 00 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand were generated this may be due to the indigenous fe iii content in the sediments furthermore scarce fe ii was generated by the abiotic sediments 0 05 0 00 μmol fe ii ml pyrite and 0 02 0 00 μmol fe ii ml quartz sand 3 6 pyrite oxidation proceeding in anodic and cathodic zone the high resolution spectra for the xps peaks of fe2p were shown in fig 7 in total there were seven peaks assigned to pyrite 706 85 ev and 707 23 ev partially oxidized pyrite 708 55 ev magnetite 710 40 ev hematite 711 30 ev and 712 35 ev and fe iii oxides 714 30 ev respectively de alwis et al 2019 dong et al 2020 droguett et al 2020 tabelin et al 2020 the original filling material presented the highest purity of pyrite with only a few partially oxidized components and minor magnetite at the surface fig 7a when pyrite was used in the anodic zone the original pyrite surface experienced corrosion producing various iron oxides i e magnetite hematite and other fe iii oxides minerals fig 7b meanwhile when pyrite was used in the cathodic zone even more surface corrosion occurred revealing the weakest original pyrite peaks and the strongest oxidized iron product peaks fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 enhancement of wastewater treatment in the current study natural pyrite was for the first time used as anodic filling material in a cw mfc microcosm i e pyano this novel strategy showed significant enhancement of wastewater treatment 4 1 1 cod removal the most interesting finding herein was that cod removal was significantly higher in the pyano and lower in the ps than that of the qc the cod mass removal efficiency of the pyano was comparable to that of previously reported intensified cws table s3 earlier studies exploited the potential of pyrite as a natural electron donating mineral to enhance nitrate removal in cws ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 and yield energy in fuel cells ju et al 2014 2015 2018 in line with these works followers have also been warned that the reducibility of pyrite will cause dissolved oxygen consumption and exert adverse effects on aerobic microbial cod removal ge et al 2019 therefore finding that the ps exhibited the poorest cod removal was expected as the pyrite in the cathode layer diminished dissolved oxygen that is crucial for the aerobic cod removal based on the large difference in cod removal efficiency between the pyano and ps it is reasonable to attribute the increased cod removal to the configuration of anodic rather than cathodic pyrite as illustrated in fig 8 under oxygen deficient conditions dissolved oxygen ranging from 0 1 mg l to 0 2 mg l table 1 the anodic pyrite was considered to enhance the cod removal in two ways firstly it facilitated the anode dependent eet process this was verified by the bes experiment which showed that the anodic pyrite with bioactivity had a substantial voltage output fig 5 anodic pyrite was able to extend the electroactive scope of anode to adjacent filling material nielsen et al 2010 taran 2017 norio et al 2019 this enlarged electroactive scope facilitated the formation of electroactive biofilms on the anodic filling material wu et al 2020 resulting in higher abundances of geobacter fig 4 in the anodic pyrite systems consequently the broader extracellular respiration of exoelectrogens promoted cod removal in the anaerobic environment doherty et al 2015b the second way is the dir process herein a higher dir potential was observed for the anodic sediment of the pyano than that of the qc fig 6 in the anodic environment favoring eet exoelectrogens may use organics to conduct extracellular electrons to either solid electrodes or metal oxides i e the dir process with limited distinction qu et al 2014 logan et al 2019 liu and li 2020 this is in consistent with our previous studies where a reduction of ferric mineral was found in anaerobic zone of cws chen et al 2016 although fe iii is not a major component of pyrite the fe ii content on the surface of pyrite is vulnerable to the dissolved oxygen feng et al 2020a and solid anode ju et al 2015 meanwhile the xps results revealed the bio electrochemically ju et al 2018 or chemically ge et al 2019 oxidized products e g magnetite and hematite on the surface of anodic pyrite fig 7 which can be used by dir bacteria to mineralize organics in the anodic environment lovley and phillips 1986 combined these processes contribute to the enhanced cod removal of the pyano system 4 1 2 nitrogen removal another potential benefit of using pyrite as an anodic filling material lies in its facilitation ability for nh4 n removal in cw mfcs under the oxygen deficient conditions herein table 1 anaerobic extracellular respiration may account for the nh4 n removal srivastava et al 2020b as anode dependent ammonium oxidation can be a significant process in bes systems chen et al 2014 qu et al 2014 jadhav and ghangrekar 2015 on top of that the increased nh4 n removal efficiency of the pyano compared with that of the qc may be ascribed to the anodic iron redox cycling yang et al 2018a 2018b wu et al 2019 in an anodic environment when fe iii is an accessible electron acceptor nh4 n can be oxidized to nox n and n2 via ammonium oxidation coupling with iron reduction known as feammox li et al 2019a previously shuai and jaffe 2019 demonstrated that by augmenting of ferrihydrite fe2o3 0 5h2o in a cw mesocosm ammonium oxidation was facilitated by feammox in this study the ferric oxide in the iron redox cycling was used by feammox bacteria to oxidize ammonium in an anodic environment although the definition of feammox microbes is currently controversial it has been postulated that geobacter may be involved in this process li et al 2019a thus the higher abundance of geobacter in the pyano and ps may suggest facilitated feammox in the anodic area for tn removal it was observed in a similar pattern with nh4 n removal no nitrate or nitrite accumulation was found in the effluents of all groups this suggests that a denitrification occurred concurrently with ammonium oxidation xu et al 2018 the ammonium oxidation rather than denitrification can be a rate limiting step because there was sufficient organics for a denitrification chu et al 2005 in addition reduced iron sulfur of pyrite can also be the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification in the ps and pyano kong et al 2016 this indicates the importance of nh4 n removal in such a high organics loading system it was previously indicated that the high organic loading may cause an unfavorable situation for aerobic autotrophic nitrifiers zhu et al 2014 therefore future studies are desirable to place more attentions at anaerobic electroanammox by the anode dependent eet and feammox by the iron redox cycling 4 1 3 phosphorus removal and residual iron tp removal was promoted in the pyrite based systems i e pyano and ps table 1 as the highest tp removal rate was achieved with the ps which has a large amount of pyrite the tp removal may be iron based phosphate precipitation ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 however the effluent iron of the ps was relatively high table 1 which may lead to secondary pollution thus the ps configuration may not be the recommended strategy in this regard the pyano was a better configuration as it achieved sufficient tp removal and produced minor effluent iron table 1 4 2 enhancement of energy yield using pyrite as an anodic and cathodic filling material can facilitate the energy yield in cw mfcs the maximum power densities of the pyano 22 0 mw m2 and ps 27 8 mw m2 found here exist at the upper level of those determined in previous studies table s4 meanwhile the ps showed substantially lower rint followed by the pyano while the qc had the highest rint fig 3 this electricity output increase may be due to the conterminous distribution of the conductive filling material li et al 2019b yang et al 2021b as mentioned in section 4 1 the conterminous distribution of pyrite can result in anode extension and the enrichment of exoelectrogen notably higher abundance of geobacter was found in the ps than in the pyano which is consistent with the higher maximum power density estimated for the ps however the maximum voltage of the ps was approximately 567 0 mv fig 3a which is lower than that of the pyano approximately 782 9 mv and the theoretical potential for typical acetate oxidizing anode and air cathode i e 805 0 mv see logan et al 2006 the conterminous pyrite in the ps probably acted as a conduit between anode and cathode resulting in internal current that divided the external voltage aguirre sierra et al 2016 this also explains the lower voltage of the ps than that of pyano during the batch experiments fig s3 in this context pyano rather than ps can be a reliable strategy to boost overall energy yield a lower esrano found for the pyano than the qc fig s4 indicated that conductive pyrite alleviates the barrier of electron transfer from electrogens to the anode i e ohmic resistance yu et al 2021 in addition a higher coulombic efficiency together with a higher cod removal of pyano compared to qc fig s5 validly indicates a higher conversion rate of cod to electricity generation logan et al 2006 wang and he 2020 furthermore a constant voltage output was observed for autoclaved pyrite in the bes experiment fig 5 demonstrating the electron donating potential by bare pyrite via electrochemical oxidation notably electrochemical oxidation of pyrite can be accelerated by iron oxidizing bacteria ju et al 2014 2015 2018 in this capacity the substantial voltage output in the bes experiment inoculated with bioactive pyrite fig 5 may have suggested the sacrificial role of anodic pyrite by iron oxidizing bacteria in the pyano system thus the use of pyrite as anodic filling material can be a promising strategy to increase the energy production in cw mfcs 5 engineering significance there has been a wide debate over various intensified cws partly due to their capital operational cost wu et al 2018 as for mfc integration since there is no energy consumption the major concern lies in the capital cost as previously analyzed by corbella et al 2017 the gravel graphite based cw mfcs showed 1 4 to 1 6 times more expensive than the conventional cws in this study we proposed a novel pyano configuration for cw mfcs on the premise of facilitating the wastewater treatment and electricity yield the pyano cw mfcs can save the filling material cost by 53 2 to 90 3 due to the lower price of pyrite than other conductive filling material such as granular graphite and granular activated carbon table s5 admittedly the operational condition in this study fell in the middle of existing cw technologies table s6 there are many optimizations yet to be carried forward in the future given its performance facilitation and low cost this novel pyano configuration shows potential to bring cw mfcs closer to achieving sustainable wastewater treatment and to recovering energy from wastewater 6 conclusions in this study we provided a pyano cw mfc configuration by filling natural conductive pyrite in the anodic zone consequently a significant enhancement in treatment performance namely the removal of cod nh4 n tn and tp was achieved simultaneously the electricity output was enhanced showing a 52 7 higher maximum power density than that of the quartz sand control herein the underlying mechanism was found to be the anode extension resulting from the conductivity of pyrite and the iron redox cycling that involves the bio electrochemical oxidation of pyrite and dir these results implied that a pyano cw mfcs is an ideal configuration for the sustainable wastewater treatment because of its efficiency in both treatment performance and energy reclamation as well as its economically reasonable construction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16863,microbial communities play crucial roles in mine drainage generation and remediation despite the wide distribution of archaea in the mine ecosystem their diversity and ecological roles remain less understood than bacteria here we retrieved 56 archaeal metagenome assembled genomes from a river impacted by rare earth element ree mining activities in south china genomic analysis showed that archaea represented four distinct lineages including phyla of thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata these archaea represented a considerable fraction up to 40 of the total prokaryote community which might contribute to nitrogen and sulfur cycling in the ree mine drainage reconstructed metabolic potential among diverse archaea taxa revealed that archaea were involved in the network of ammonia oxidation denitrification sulfate redox reaction and required substrates supplied by other community members as the dominant driver of ammonia oxidation thaumarchaeota might provide substrates to support the survival of two nano sized archaea belonging to micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota despite the absence of biosynthesis pathways for amino acids and nucleotides the potential capacity for nitrite reduction nird was observed in micrarchaeota indicating that these nano sized archaea encompassed diverse metabolisms moreover thermoplasmata as keystone taxa in community might be the main genetic donor for the other three archaeal phyla transferring many environmental resistance related genes e g v a type atpase and vitamin b12 transporting atpase the genetic interactions within archaeal community through horizontal gene transfer might be the key to the formation of archaeal resistance and functional partitioning this study provides putative

including the lanthanides scandium and yttrium have a range of applications in high technology electric devices and renewable energy which results in increasing demands for rees binnemans et al 2013 at present rees have caused widespread concerns because of their persistence in the environment liang et al 2005 bioaccumulation in biota macmillan et al 2019 and chronic toxicity to human health gonzalez et al 2014 mining and smelting activities are the major sources of ree contamination ion adsorption ree deposits are the main reservoirs of rees worldwide and are widely exploited in south china rare earth elements in these deposits mainly occur in their trivalent cationic state and are adsorbed onto clays and readily extracted via an ion exchange process the heap leaching technology was widely used to extract rees through leaching the ree rich ores i e the regolith layer underlying the topsoil by ammonium sulfate yang et al 2013 as a result large amounts of mine drainage containing rees ammonium and sulfate are generated causing severe contamination to surrounding environments liu et al 2019b zhao et al 2019 bioremediation using microbiota is a potential method for remediating the pollution caused by mine drainage das et al 2009 fan et al 2016 wang et al 2021 the observed microbial diversity at previously studied mine drainage sites includes organisms belonging primarily to the domains of bacteria archaea and to a lesser extent eukarya predominantly fungi and algae baker and banfield 2003 chen et al 2016 archaea typically constitute only a minor fraction of prokaryotic communities in non extreme and uncontaminated environments with moderate acidity pressure and temperature auguet et al 2010 which have been less studied however archaea have also been found dominant in specific mining environments lopez archilla et al 2001 baker et al 2006 ziegler et al 2013 chen et al 2015 previous metagenomic analyses documented the presence of novel acidophilic nanoarchaea arman group and thermoplasmatales lineage archaea in kinds of mine drainage habitats chen et al 2016 golyshina et al 2017 including tinto river sw spain lopez archilla et al 2001 the

might evolve with certain survival strategies and metabolic capacities to these extreme conditions with low ph and nutrient availability as well as high concentrations of heavy metal loid s and sulfates and their essential roles in mine ecosystem and mine drainage remediation must be considered to date studies on the ecological roles of archaea have focused on euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota formerly described as mesophilic crenarchaeota brochier armanet et al 2008 methanogenic archaea play crucial roles in global carbon cycles and influence methane emissions offre et al 2013 oxidation of ammonia to nitrite can be performed by thaumarchaeota pester et al 2011 in strongly acidic soils these archaea predominate among ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes zhang et al 2012 sulfur

diapherotrites parvarchaeota aenigmarchaeota nanoarchaeota and nanohaloarchaeota includes several phyla of archaea with small cells which mediate iron and sulfur cycling under harsh conditions baker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 despite these investigations described above we know little about archaeal diversity and ecological roles in mine ecosystem additionally different from other aquatic

processes i e carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling remain to be explored given the low abundance and diversity of archaea in most environments schleper et al 2005 auguet et al 2010 few studies have focused on the interaction of archaeal communities however in some extreme geochemical environments interactions among archaea may be widespread and play an important role in the adaptation of archaea baker et al 2010 golyshina et al 2017 wang et al 2019 archaea may also interact with one another or hosts in various ways for example metabolic cross feeding zelezniak et al 2015 extensive horizontal gene transfer hgt and so on caro quintero and konstantinidis 2014 kimura 2014 archaea with distinct phylogeny can coexist in the system through a complex set of metabolite exchanges therefore the metabolic network is the basis for the community to perform crucial ecosystem processes anantharaman et al 2016 long et al 2016 in marine sediment the widespread inter phylum hgt occurs among archaeal communities spanning the tack acronym of the names of the first included phyla thaumarchaeota aigarchaeota crenarchaeaota and korarchaeota and dpann superphyla and euryarchaeota the hgt event may be the primary method of genetic interaction that allows thaumarchaeota to obtain v type atpases for survival in the acidic and high pressure habitats wang et al 2019 in addition previous studies have shown that environmental disturbances such as the introduction of pollutants hemme et al 2010 and changes in nutrient conditions hammarlund et al 2019 sun et al 2020 will affect the interaction patterns among microbial communities however identifying archaea in natural environments to understand their interactions in the ecosystem is difficult because of obstacles in archaeal cultivation auguet et al 2010 adam et al 2017 thus functional capabilities and ecological interactions are often inferred by indirect evidence through genome resolved analysis at the community level through the use of the recent metagenome assembled genomes mags reconstruction anantharaman et al 2016 probst et al 2018 it is possible to track the potential interaction between the indigenous microbial community exploring the metabolism and evolution of archaea from the community interaction perspective will further promote the understanding of their survival strategy in ree mine drainage in addressing the above mentioned research gaps samples from a ree mine drainage contaminated river were conducted by metagenomic and genome resolved analysis the distinct geochemical characteristics rees ammonium and sulfate content and archaea enrichment of ree mine drainage make this site ideal for exploring community responses and the environmentally contextualized reconstruction of archaeal

previous study liu et al 2019a chen et al 2021 3 2 structure and functions of the microbial community the ree mine drainage affected the structure of the aquatic microbial community as shown in fig 1 archaea represented a considerable fraction up to 40 of the total prokaryote community at hp sites figs 1b and s2 which was higher than that in typical metallic mine drainage and various moderate environments including river groundwater and soil auguet et al 2010 bates et al 2011 liu et al 2018 micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata were identified as keystone species in the contaminated system implying that these archaea might play critical roles in maintaining the structure of the whole prokaryotic community figs 1c and s2 table s6 given the large amount of ammonium 54 0 26 0 mg l 1 and

total of 24 archaeal mags belonged to thaumarchaeota which is a long branch of tack superphylum containing aigarchaeota crenarchaeota and korarchaeota comparison of the habitat information of reference genomes showed that these archaea were widely found in a variety of environments including hot spring ocean freshwater soil and sediment indicating their considerable adaptive capacities and phylogenetic diversity fig 3b table s3 other archaea mags were located in micrarchaeota 28 mags and nanoarchaeota 1 mag branches and clustered with pacearchaeota woesearchaeota and the previously characterized nano sized archaeal lineages adam et al 2017 in the dpann superphylum these mags were closely related to rp sequences from extreme environment such as typically metallic mine drainage and hot spring based on the phylogenetic distance table s8 furthermore to explore the within phylum genomic diversity of mags the taxonomic information of theses mags was identified using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 based on 122 archaeal marker genes and ani the result showed thaumarchaeota mags 24 mags belonged to two different families nitrosopumilaceae 22 mags and uba141 2 mags and all mags of micrarchaeota 28 mags were affiliated within the same order micrrchaeales table s2 the remaining archaea were belonging to the thermoplasmata 3 mags order of the euryarchaeota phylum lineage and were distinct from other archaeal taxa yelton et al 2013 thermoplasmata are archaeal taxa widely detected in the mine drainage ecosystem however our reconstructed thermoplasmata mag clustered with genomes from freshwater and seawater samples in general the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal communities in the ree mine drainage contaminated habitats were higher than that in other typically metallic mine drainage e g those from pyrite mendez garcia et al 2014 copper mendez garcia et al 2015 arsenic sun et al 2017 lead zinc mines yang et al 2013 and moderate aquatic habitats and no evident differences were found in major taxa the abt analysis was used to evaluate the contributions of environmental parameters to the taxonomic composition of archaea taxa based on the abundance matrix fig 4 a the ph values ammonium and total carbon concentrations were ranked as the top three parameters influencing the abundance of thaumarchaeota however the rees content ph values and ammonium concentration were the major factor regulating the compositions of the other three archaeal taxonomic groups micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata the results of abt analysis indicated that environmental factors had discrepant effects on different archaea groups in addition the partial dependence plots derived from the abt model were used to reveal the effects of these environmental parameters on the archaeal alpha diversity fig 4b with the increase of ammonium 1 72 to 54 0 mg l 1 and sulfate content 3 45 to 234 mg l 1 the diversity index of archaea decreased and then increased however the ph values 4 75 to 8 76 were negatively correlated with the archaea diversity the higher values of the archaeal diversity index were observed at higher rees conditions 15 mg l 1 indicating that these archaea could adapt to the ree contaminated habitat 3 4 comparative genomic analysis based on kegg orthology to reveal the functional feature of different clades within one phylum a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on the occurrence of kegg orthology ko matrix in mags supplementary notes 7 table s9 as shown in figure s4 mags have the similar functional genes pattern with phylogeny cluster in addition for thaumarchaeota and micrarchaeota different clades within each phylum contain unique gene sets fig s5 table s10 indicating variations in metabolic potentials among different clades for micrarchaeota gluconate 5 dehydrogenase idno protoporphyrin ferrochelatase hemh were only identified in clade 1 alcohol dehydrogenase ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase prsa and nickel superoxide dismutase sodn only occurred in clade 2 hydroxypyruvate reductase ttud and pyruvate kinase were only found in clade 3 for thaumarchaeota ferric chelate reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase were exclusively detected in clade 1 and multiple nitrogen metabolism genes e g nitrous oxide reductase nosz nitrite reductase nirk ferredoxin nitrite reductase nira were detected in clade 2 collectively these identified metabolic features were specific to different clades and might have a role on archaeal niche differentiation in habitat galambos et al 2019 even if archaea shared a large amount of metabolic capacity within a taxonomic group 3 5 genome specific metabolic reconstructions the function genes of reconstructed archaeal mags were identified and showed in table s7 however the quality completeness and contamination of mags within each taxonomic group had a great influence on the characterization of archaeal function genes especially the contamination of mags would seriously hinder the inference of metabolic features thus we selected high quality mags in each group as representative mags for further metabolic reconstruction as shown in fig 5 and s6 10 the selection criteria were described in supplementary notes 7 many resistance genes e g superoxide dismutase sod thioredoxin trxab v a type atpase metallic cation and vitamin b12 transporters systems were detected in mags revealing that archaea processed multiple stress resistance potential mechanisms to survive and develop in extreme environments table s9 the results showed that na h antiporters and v a type atpase were detected in all archaea taxa which might play roles for acid stress tolerance several genes encoding metallic cation manganese zinc and iron iron siderophore and vitamin b12 transporters systems belonging to the atp binding cassette abc transporters were also commonly found in these mags furthermore the additional oxidative stress resistance gene sod and trxab found in archaeal mags might suggest an essential survival strategy for them to adapt to high level rees stress the general metabolic potentials of carbon nitrogen sulfur metabolism and energy metabolism electron donors and acceptors for the four distinct taxonomic groups were evaluated to reveal the ecological roles of these diverse archaea as shown below fig 5 table s9 thaumarchaeota 24 mags thaumarchaeota had nearly complete glycolysis gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle pathways fig 5 table s9 furthermore thaumarchaeota might use a modified version of the 3 hydroxypropionate 4 hydroxybutyrate hp hb pathway for autotrophic carbon fixation berg et al 2007 konneke et al 2014 however the genes encoding peptidase and glycosyl transferase were identified in the 21 out of 24 mags of thaumarchaeota table s9 suggesting that thaumarchaeota might switch between an autotrophic and a heterotrophic lifestyle as shown in fig 2 thaumarchaeota is the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the ree disturbed system among which all the 5 representative mags encode a complete ammonia monooxygenase amoabc for ammonia to hydroxylamine figs 5 and s7 table s9 the nirk gene encoding nitrite reductase was also found in 18 thaumarchaeota mags although thaumarchaeota mags lacked gene encoding the urease subunit alpha urec 23 of them contained three transporters of the ammonia channel transporter amt family loqué et al 2007 suggesting that thaumarchaeota could possess transporters for ammonia as substrates for its energy metabolism table s9 for sulfur metabolism thaumarchaeota encoded a nearly complete sulfate assimilation pathway figs 5 and s8 table s9 with sulfate adenylate transferase sat phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase paps reductase cysh thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and thiosulfate reductase phs presenting on the genome however the sulfur oxidation sox system gene which is responsible for the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate was absent fig s9 table s9 micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota 29 mags these nano sized archaea had small genome contents 0 86 mb in average table s2 and limited metabolism pattern table s9 although the lack of metabolic capacities might be caused by the incomplete genome these features were consistent with previous near complete 1mb genomes for these nano size archaea baker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 these two archaea contained no pathways for glycolysis gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate and genes encoding respiratory associated enzymes fig 5 table s9 none of the six known carbon fixation pathways cycles was identified in the mags suggesting that micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota were heterotrophic figs 5 and s6 table s9 however 24 out of 29 mags encoded multiple glycosyltransferases which were essential for the biosynthesis of saccharide molecules that mediated functions from structure and storage to signaling breton et al 2005 micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota mags lacked complete amino acid biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways figs 5 and s9 table s9 whereas the genes encoding a variety of peptidases and transporters e g amino acid permease were identified on the basis of the genomic data fig 5 these organisms might rely on external sources of amino acids coupled with salvage pathways to meet their nucleotide requirement chen et al 2018 the gene nrtcd encoding substrate binding proteins of the nitrate nitrite transport system was first detected in the 21 mags micrarchaeota figs 5 and s7 table s9 indicating that the recovered micrarchaeota could potentially utilize nitrate nitrite as substrate for energy metabolism remarkably 22 micrarchaeota genomes were found to harbor the genes of nitrite reductase nird which is a key function gene for nitrite reduction to ammonia and not mentioned in previous studies on micrarchaeota phylogenetic analyses of nird gene showed that most of nird genes of the recovered genome were clustered with the lineage of acidophilic euryarchaeota yelton et al 2013 fig s11 suggesting that micrarchaeota were evolutionarily related with euryarchaeota through a known symbiotic lifestyle golyshina et al 2017 micrarchaeota were identified to assimilate sulfur through the partial sulfate reduction pathway figs 5 and s8 table s9 micrarchaeota mags also encoded bifunctional enzyme cyscnd cysh and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase for the sulfate assimilation pathway thermoplasmata 3 mags thermoplasmata represented a rare component of ree mine drainage contaminated microbial communities relative abundance 0 6 figs 1b and s2 compared with conventional reductive tca rtca the gene encoding citrate synthase was identified across recovered genomes indicating that thermoplasmata might perform carbon fixation via the reversed oxidative tca rotca pathway table s7 genes encoding adp forming acetyl coa synthetase dissimilatory adenylyl sulfate reductase thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and sulfate importer were also found in all the mags of thermoplasmata the presence of a taurine transporter but no identifiable taurine dioxygenase indicated that thermoplasmata might have an unknown mechanism for degrading organosulfonate to sulfite table s9 in addition the genes related to biosynthesis of cofactors and amino acid precursors were identified in recovered genomes fig s9 table s9 which might allow thermoplasmata to coexist with other archaea taxa in an oligotrophic environment 3 6 hgt shaping the metabolism of archaea analysis using hgtector software indicated that putative hgt events played an important role in gene flow and acquisition which contributed to genome contents of archaea we showed that the ratio of putative hgt to total genes for the archaeal community was about 6 85 11 6 26 8 high value because of fragmentary genome and 12 1 for thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata respectively based on the annotation by kos and clusters of orthologous genes categories tables s11 12 the transferred genes were involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis inorganic ion transport and metabolism genes related to metabolism underwent more hgts than other gene families fig 6 a by contrast genes related to cellular processes and signaling functions were minimally transferred fig 6a the influence of genetic interaction on interphylum exchange was evaluated by generating networks that represented the cases of hgt figs 6 and s12 these networks were made by linking the donors and recipients with hgt statistic the potential donors of these hgts were identified in our studies which mostly originated from the same domain gene transfer among archaeal communities might facilitate environmental stress resistance for example k h antiporter nhap2 adaptive response sensory kinase sasa and dna repair protein nrea were identified as hgts with archaea serving as donor notably in thermoplasmata those key stone species were regarded as the main donors of hgt in community our study indicated that energy yielding v a type atpase and vitamin b12 transporting atpase were transferred from thermoplasmatales and these enzymes occurred widely in thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota fig 6b tables s11 12 bacteria also substantially contributed to generate genetic diversity of archaea through hgt several genes were transferred from firmicutes actinobacteria chloroflexi and proteobacteria archaea acquired some key metabolic functions and multiple resistance by hgt events tables s11 12 for micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata the nrtcd donor firmicutes nitrospirae and cysch donor nitrososphaeria genes were involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles being donated by bacteria 4 discussion 4 1 important survival strategies of archaeal taxa in south china ree mining activity caused severe ecological degradation and environmental pollution recently chao et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 in the present study we revealed that ree mine drainage shaped a distinct archaeal community figs 1 2 and s2 whereas the predominance of archaea was located in four distinct lineages thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata fig 3 in typical mine drainage contaminated habitats a wide set of uncultured archaea related to thermoplasmata and nano sized archaea were commonly detected and they existed in the form of symbionts golyshina et al 2017 chen et al 2018 these archaea were adaptable to metal rich low ph habitats possibly through evolving metal resistance mendez garcia et al 2015 chen et al 2016 in our study according to the abt model rees were identified as the key factors affecting the archaea taxa in this system fig 4 the rees were well known for their anti bacterial function significantly damaging and changing the outer microbial cell membrane responsible for cell permeability chen et al 2012 previous studies demonstrated that rees could inhibit the growth of microbes e g inhibiting the growth of soil fungi d aquino et al 2009 or decreasing nitrifying bacteria activity fujita et al 2015 by competitively replacing metals in several important enzymes of life therefore the abundant heavy metal resistant genes and peroxiredoxin detected in all archaeal mags might be an essential strategy to adapt to rees pollution in this region table s9 furthermore the extra encoded inorganic phosphate transport system in archaeal genomes might play a key role in coping with rees stress the uptake of inorganic phosphate could balance cellular osmotic pressure when archaea taxa were exposed to high concentration of metals moberly et al 2010 different from typical mine drainage ree mine drainage also introduced excessive ammonium and sulfate into the environment because of the heap leaching mining technique huang et al 2011 liu et al 2019b in the current study ammonium was also a critical environmental variable affecting archaea taxa particularly for thaumarchaeota fig 4 based on the percentage of contribution to amoabc genes thaumarchaeota 90 was more dominant than ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob during autotrophic ammonia oxidation in this system fig 2 inconsistent with the conclusions drawn from previous studies on open ocean sediments and other moderate environments the archaeal or crenarchaeotal amoa genes were retrieved in low ammonium containing environments wuchter et al 2006 lam et al 2007 herrmann et al 2008 because of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa s high affinity for ammonia prosser and nicol 2012 this difference between our study and other studies was probably due to the high concentration of ammonium 54 0 26 0 mg l 1 under acidic conditions which might have deleterious effects on most organisms rather than limited source of nitrogen furthermore in our system the reduction of abundant sulfate could produce sulfide which had an inhibitory effect on autotrophic ammonia oxidation the aoa had unique enzymes genes similar to their relatives sulfolobales hallam et al 2006 which facilitated them to thrive and oxidize ammonia under sulfide conditions erguder et al 2009 thaumarchaeota were identified as having energy efficient hp hb carbon fixation pathways figs 5 and s6 berg et al 2007 konneke et al 2014 which is conducive to their survival in organic carbon limited condition of the contaminated rivers in general these observations collectively offer a biochemical explanation for archaea dominating in an ammonium rich environment with low ph and high level of rees 4 2 metabolic network and ecological roles of archaea taxa 4 2 1 carbon cycle the availability of carbon resources is vital to the microbial communities populating in oligotrophic environments table s5 the abundance of thermoplasmata and thaumarchaeota could fix carbon using the rotca cycle mall et al 2018 and modified version of the hp hb pathway konneke et al 2014 respectively here the low toc content in hp sites likely promoted carbon fixation this result was consistent with previous observations on the mine drainage community revealing that carbon fixation was a prevalent carbon metabolism adapted by microorganisms inhabiting in contaminated environments chen et al 2015 mendez garcia et al 2015 however micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota detected as heterotrophs co occurring with these carbon fixers might drive carbon cycling by consuming organic carbons fig 5 metabolic reconstruction indicated that most of the core biosynthetic pathways were limited or missing in micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota figs 5 and s9 table s9 the rudimentary metabolic capability of these nano sized archaea showed their potential symbiotic lifestyles numerous systems such as surface proteins membrane channels and secretory pathways of these archaea provided an interface for the exchange of metabolites energy macromolecules and dna among nano sized archaea and other free living organisms i e thermoplasmata in this system fig 5 micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata had similar responses to environmental factors further indicating these taxa might coexist as a potential consortium in ree mine drainage fig 4 this assumption that taxa coexist as consortium was consistent with several pure culture experiments which confirmed the potential interaction consortium between nano sized archaea and their hosts in situ for example micrarchaeota mia14 and thermoplasmatales golyshina et al 2017 and nanoarchaeota nst1 and sulfolobales spp podar et al 2013 munson mcgee et al 2015 thus this potential distinct lifestyle and specific energy source supply mode might be a significant contributor to archaeal community assembly in this contaminated system which are similar to coexisting taxa in marine datta et al 2016 and underground water ecosystems anantharaman et al 2016 4 2 2 nitrogen cycle apart from rees disturbance this contaminated river water contained high concentration of ammonium 54 26 mg l 1 at hp sites table s5 and this general trend has been existed at this site for at least 20 years zhao et al 2019 based on metabolic potential analysis the most abundant archaeal taxa thaumarchaeota was the predominant aoa the ammonia oxidizing process of thaumarchaea could release intermediates no and or nh2oh with the participation of denitrifiers which were then reduced non enzymatically to n2o in anoxic microenvironments kozlowski et al 2016 thus these archaea might play crucial roles in the nitrogen cycles and influence nitrogen transportation in our contaminated environment you et al 2009 kozlowski et al 2016 our study for the first time shows a nitrite reduction pathway in micrarchaeota fig s11 table s9 these recovered micrarchaeota contained nird gene encoding nitrite reductase which could potentially use nitrite as terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions coupled with the oxidation of sulfide and or organic compounds zhu et al 2018 this finding indicated the potential metabolic capability of micrarchaeota under high level of nitrification conditions thus if nitrite was used as the nitrogen source in this system micrarchaeota could grow and reduce nitrite in hypoxic and aerobic conditions the occurrence of the nitrite reduction pathways in certain microbial genomes might be a strategy of metabolic versatility of these microbes adapt to environmental changes the finding might reveal the evolutionary history of these nano sized archaea thereby determining the taxa inhabiting hot spring and typically metallic mine drainage contaminated environments baker et al 2010 golyshina et al 2017 chen et al 2018 as previously discussed the ammonia oxidizing thaumarchaeota might utilize ammonium as substrate in a system however though both nitrite transporter and nitrite reductase were found in micrarchaeota no assimilatory nitrate reduction genes were identified suggesting the distinct nitrogen substrate preferences and ecological niches of archaea in this disturbed environment figs 5 and s10 table s9 in addition nitrite concentrations could limit microbial growth in environments ali et al 2016 on the one hand thaumarchaeota encoding nirk gene isrequired for nirk dependent tolerance to nitrite for constituting a defense mechanism that protects ammonia oxidizers against the toxic product of aerobic ammonia oxidation beaumont et al 2005 on the other hand the nitrite reductase nird of micrarchaeota is involved primarily in the detoxification of internal nitrite fig s11 table s9 lilja and johnson 2016 therefore the potential metabolic network between ammonia oxidization by thaumarchaea and the reduction of nitrite by micrarchaeota could enhance overall nitrogen metabolism in the ecosystem through the completion of a nitrite loop as proposed by speth et al speth et al 2016 fig 5 this interaction in nitrogen metabolism might be critical for supporting distinct archaea taxa coexistence and archaeal community stability in ree mine drainage contaminated environments figs 5 and s10 4 2 3 sulfur cycle archaea were revealed to possess sulfur metabolism with regard to sulfate reduction sulfur oxidation and thiosulfate reduction and assimilation figs 5 and s10 three of the four archaea taxa were identified to assimilate sulfur through sulfate reduction encoding partial or fragmented pathways suggesting that complete sulfate reduction occurs through the functions of multiple archaeal taxa that are potentially linked via metabolic handoffs figs 5 and s10 table s9 anantharaman et al 2016 among these archaeal mags thermoplasmata and thaumarchaea have sulfur metabolism with genes for sulfate thiosulfate importer thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and thiosulfate reductase phs however micrarchaeota only identify thiosulfate sulfurtransferase thiosulfate reduction in the sulfur metabolism is important for sulfur transformation in anoxic sediment environments jørgensen 1990 stoffels et al 2012 the presence of genes involved in elemental sulfur and thiosulfate reduction fig s8 table s9 indicates that these archaea may play key roles in reducing intermediate sulfur compounds iscs in the ree mine drainage contaminated environment therefore abundant iscs reduced by archaea constitute an energetically favorable substrate for other microorganisms to survive in this nutrient poor environment in addition iscs reduction would increase ph by consuming protons with precipitation of rees by sulfide zeng et al 2015 moreover iscs reduction can play key roles in ree mine drainage remediation apart from archaea a large fraction of key function genes involved in sulfur oxidation were derived from bacteria ayangbenro et al 2018 fig 2 thus bacteria might jointly mediate the sulfur cycle in ree disturbed river ecosystem with archaeal community this potential metabolic network needs to be further explored through the integration analysis of bacterial mags and or confirmed by microcosm experiment the genome resolved analysis provided a route to explore the ecological role of these previously uncharacterized microorganisms in various complex environments anantharaman et al 2016 campanaro et al 2018 chen et al 2018 woodcroft et al 2018 in the present study we successfully evaluated the metabolic potential of 56 mags these phylogenetically distinct archaea coexisted in a ree mine drainage contaminated environment interconnected metabolically and mediated the carbon nitrogen and sulfur biogeochemical cycles figs 5 and s10 table s9 however it should be noticed that the genome resolved analysis only showed evidences for metabolic potential and the expression of genes in mags was not examined we then analyzed the metabolic network among diverse archaea to mainly display a cross feeding interactions type zelezniak et al 2015 however the interactions among microbial communities are complex and varied including mutualism parasitism or predation competition and so on faust and raes 2012 the combined approaches including transcriptomic enzymatic techniques and synthetic communities would further facilitate the research on the interactions within archaeal community 4 3 genetic interaction among archaeal community through hgt the hgt had a key impact on prokaryotes specific ecological and functional evolution caro quintero and konstantinidis 2014 particularly for the adaptation of microbial communities to environmental stress in extreme habitats hemme et al 2010 in our system the relatively low hgt frequency 9 84 in average was identified compared with the level of congeneric archaea from other aquatic habitats deschamps et al 2014 this result was due to the fact that rees inhibit intensive microbe absorbing external dna and thereby decreasing the hgt efficiency wenhua et al 2003 although the relatively low frequency of hgt occurred in our system hgt events still substantially contributed to acquiring some metabolism related genes by certain archaea fig 6a the nrtcd and cysch genes obtained by hgt events could provide the key innovations for micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata facilitating their mediation in nitrogen and sulfur cycles tables s11 12 the hgt events promoted the formation of the ecological role among these archaea in the ree disturbed system in addition numerous studies have used network based scores to identify putative keystone taxa in various environments although thermoplasmatales only constituted a minor fraction of microbial communities in ree mine drainage it was identified as keystone species in the system thermoplasmatales might be the primary donor for the other three archaeal phyla transferring many genes that were important to environmental resistance fig 6b tables s11 12 this finding was consistent with the previous observation that thermoplasmatales exchanged several genes with archaeal partners in acidophilic environments golyshina et al 2017 herbold et al 2017 understanding the ecological role of keystone species is a central goal in microbial ecology in general keystone species might use a range of strategies to influence microbes for example they might act through intermediate or effector groups whose abundance can be selectively modulated to regulate community structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 our results further revealed that the keystone taxa might also have ecological functions in the genetic evolution of the community the result might broaden our understanding of the ecological concept of keystone taxa to a certain extent and provide insight into the ecological role and evolution of the archaeal community in mine ecosystems 5 conclusion our metagenomic and genome resolved analyses unambiguously pointed out that four distinct archaea belonging to thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata were enriched in ree mine drainage contaminated river according to abt analysis the structure of the archaeal community was primarily regulated by ph ammonium and rees content we obtained 56 archaeal mags and reconstructed the metabolic pathways of these less known but ubiquitous microorganisms in mine ecosystems our results revealed that the coexistence of archaeal taxa was partly due to the facts that functional partitioning and distinct archaea for example ammonia oxidizing thaumarchaeota nitrite reducing micrarchaeota and the nano sized archaea host thermoplasmata could play important ecological roles in the community these archaea might contribute to carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling in the system by interactive utilization of substrates in addition these four distinct archaea derived important functional components from the community through hgt the genetic interaction within the archaeal community could serve as a niche adaptive strategy of individual lineages enabling them to tolerate the low ph high heavy metal concentrations and energy generation in the contaminated environment our study revealed the ecological role and survival strategies of previously less known archaea in ree mine ecosystem at the community level and laid the foundation for future potential manipulation of archaea for in situ bioremediation furthermore bacteria might play a key role in the metabolic partnership with the archaeal consortia and co meditate the biogeochemical cycles therefore future complex studies would help to explore the cross kingdom e g bacteria fungi interactions for better ecology evolution and adaption of microbial communities to ree mine ecosystems

16863,microbial communities play crucial roles in mine drainage generation and remediation despite the wide distribution of archaea in the mine ecosystem their diversity and ecological roles remain less understood than bacteria here we retrieved 56 archaeal metagenome assembled genomes from a river impacted by rare earth element ree mining activities in south china genomic analysis showed that archaea represented four distinct lineages including phyla of thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata these archaea represented a considerable fraction up to 40 of the total prokaryote community which might contribute to nitrogen and sulfur cycling in the ree mine drainage reconstructed metabolic potential among diverse archaea taxa revealed that archaea were involved in the network of ammonia oxidation denitrification sulfate redox reaction and required substrates supplied by other community members as the dominant driver of ammonia oxidation thaumarchaeota might provide substrates to support the survival of two nano sized archaea belonging to micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota despite the absence of biosynthesis pathways for amino acids and nucleotides the potential capacity for nitrite reduction nird was observed in micrarchaeota indicating that these nano sized archaea encompassed diverse metabolisms moreover thermoplasmata as keystone taxa in community might be the main genetic donor for the other three archaeal phyla transferring many environmental resistance related genes e g v a type atpase and vitamin b12 transporting atpase the genetic interactions within archaeal community through horizontal gene transfer might be the key to the formation of archaeal resistance and functional partitioning this study provides putative metabolic and genetic insights into the diverse archaea taxa from community level perspectives and highlights the ecological roles of archaea in ree contaminated aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords archaea rare earth element mine drainage community level interaction element cycling horizontal gene transfer bioremediation 1 introduction rare earth elements rees including the lanthanides scandium and yttrium have a range of applications in high technology electric devices and renewable energy which results in increasing demands for rees binnemans et al 2013 at present rees have caused widespread concerns because of their persistence in the environment liang et al 2005 bioaccumulation in biota macmillan et al 2019 and chronic toxicity to human health gonzalez et al 2014 mining and smelting activities are the major sources of ree contamination ion adsorption ree deposits are the main reservoirs of rees worldwide and are widely exploited in south china rare earth elements in these deposits mainly occur in their trivalent cationic state and are adsorbed onto clays and readily extracted via an ion exchange process the heap leaching technology was widely used to extract rees through leaching the ree rich ores i e the regolith layer underlying the topsoil by ammonium sulfate yang et al 2013 as a result large amounts of mine drainage containing rees ammonium and sulfate are generated causing severe contamination to surrounding environments liu et al 2019b zhao et al 2019 bioremediation using microbiota is a potential method for remediating the pollution caused by mine drainage das et al 2009 fan et al 2016 wang et al 2021 the observed microbial diversity at previously studied mine drainage sites includes organisms belonging primarily to the domains of bacteria archaea and to a lesser extent eukarya predominantly fungi and algae baker and banfield 2003 chen et al 2016 archaea typically constitute only a minor fraction of prokaryotic communities in non extreme and uncontaminated environments with moderate acidity pressure and temperature auguet et al 2010 which have been less studied however archaea have also been found dominant in specific mining environments lopez archilla et al 2001 baker et al 2006 ziegler et al 2013 chen et al 2015 previous metagenomic analyses documented the presence of novel acidophilic nanoarchaea arman group and thermoplasmatales lineage archaea in kinds of mine drainage habitats chen et al 2016 golyshina et al 2017 including tinto river sw spain lopez archilla et al 2001 the richmond mine in iron mountain ca usa baker et al 2006 fankou lead zinc mine in china chen et al 2015 and the drei kronen und ehrt pyrite mine in germany ziegler et al 2013 these dominant archaea might evolve with certain survival strategies and metabolic capacities to these extreme conditions with low ph and nutrient availability as well as high concentrations of heavy metal loid s and sulfates and their essential roles in mine ecosystem and mine drainage remediation must be considered to date studies on the ecological roles of archaea have focused on euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota formerly described as mesophilic crenarchaeota brochier armanet et al 2008 methanogenic archaea play crucial roles in global carbon cycles and influence methane emissions offre et al 2013 oxidation of ammonia to nitrite can be performed by thaumarchaeota pester et al 2011 in strongly acidic soils these archaea predominate among ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes zhang et al 2012 sulfur dependent archaea mainly inhabit hydrothermal environment reysenbach et al 2006 liu et al 2012 and sulfate reduction by anaerobic mesophilic methane oxidizers have a potential impact on the environment milucka et al 2012 with the benefit of cultivation independent metagenomics approaches the recently delineated superphylum dpann an acronym of the names of the first included phyla diapherotrites parvarchaeota aenigmarchaeota nanoarchaeota and nanohaloarchaeota includes several phyla of archaea with small cells which mediate iron and sulfur cycling under harsh conditions baker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 despite these investigations described above we know little about archaeal diversity and ecological roles in mine ecosystem additionally different from other aquatic environments impacted by typical metallic mine drainages e g those from pyrite mendez garcia et al 2014 copper mendez garcia et al 2015 arsenic sun et al 2017 lead zinc mines yang et al 2013 ree mine drainage is regarded as ree rich environments with excessive input of nitrogen and sulfur liu et al 2019b the dominant archaea in this system and their potential roles in the crucial biogeochemical processes i e carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling remain to be explored given the low abundance and diversity of archaea in most environments schleper et al 2005 auguet et al 2010 few studies have focused on the interaction of archaeal communities however in some extreme geochemical environments interactions among archaea may be widespread and play an important role in the adaptation of archaea baker et al 2010 golyshina et al 2017 wang et al 2019 archaea may also interact with one another or hosts in various ways for example metabolic cross feeding zelezniak et al 2015 extensive horizontal gene transfer hgt and so on caro quintero and konstantinidis 2014 kimura 2014 archaea with distinct phylogeny can coexist in the system through a complex set of metabolite exchanges therefore the metabolic network is the basis for the community to perform crucial ecosystem processes anantharaman et al 2016 long et al 2016 in marine sediment the widespread inter phylum hgt occurs among archaeal communities spanning the tack acronym of the names of the first included phyla thaumarchaeota aigarchaeota crenarchaeaota and korarchaeota and dpann superphyla and euryarchaeota the hgt event may be the primary method of genetic interaction that allows thaumarchaeota to obtain v type atpases for survival in the acidic and high pressure habitats wang et al 2019 in addition previous studies have shown that environmental disturbances such as the introduction of pollutants hemme et al 2010 and changes in nutrient conditions hammarlund et al 2019 sun et al 2020 will affect the interaction patterns among microbial communities however identifying archaea in natural environments to understand their interactions in the ecosystem is difficult because of obstacles in archaeal cultivation auguet et al 2010 adam et al 2017 thus functional capabilities and ecological interactions are often inferred by indirect evidence through genome resolved analysis at the community level through the use of the recent metagenome assembled genomes mags reconstruction anantharaman et al 2016 probst et al 2018 it is possible to track the potential interaction between the indigenous microbial community exploring the metabolism and evolution of archaea from the community interaction perspective will further promote the understanding of their survival strategy in ree mine drainage in addressing the above mentioned research gaps samples from a ree mine drainage contaminated river were conducted by metagenomic and genome resolved analysis the distinct geochemical characteristics rees ammonium and sulfate content and archaea enrichment of ree mine drainage make this site ideal for exploring community responses and the environmentally contextualized reconstruction of archaeal genomes to the end this study aims to understand the 1 phylogeny and regulation factors of the predominance of archaea inhabiting the ree mine drainage 2 metabolic potential and network in the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles and 3 genetic interactions through hgt within archaeal community in this system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and physicochemical analyses the investigated sites were located in dingnan county ganzhou city jiangxi province fig 1 a the sites were within the world s largest ion adsorption ree mine areas which have been mined with heap leaching technology for more than 20 years and have left an area of more than 10 km2 mine tailings a total of 360 water and sediment samples for geochemical and molecular analyses were collected from yuezi river impacted by ree mine drainage and from a nearby river without mining activities ck during different seasons of the year the samples from contaminated river were then separated to high pollution sites hp medium

described in supplementary note 1 the 16s rrna genes were amplified using primer pair 515f 806r targeting the v4 hypervariable regions chao et al 2016 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform at novogene co ltd beijing china the raw sequences were quality screened and trimmed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline qiime package version 2019 4 bolyen et al 2019 twenty five samples from sediment and water spanning three geochemical conditions hp mp and ck during different seasons were selected for metagenomic analysis table s1 the pollution gradient and time series data were combined to improve the quality and quantity of reconstructed mags metagenomic sequence data was generated using illumina hiseq 4000 instruments at novogene co ltd beijing china which are capable of producing 150 bp paired reads with a targeted insert size of 300 bp the amount of raw sequence data was 10 and 20 gbp for water and sediment samples respectively table s1 2 3 de novo metagenomic assembly in order to remove the adaptor sequences and poor quality regions the raw illumina sequences were preprocessed by trimmomatic version 0 35 bolger et al 2014 the 25 individual samples were assembled de novo to obtain 25 separate assemblies for water samples triplicate datasets of each sampling site were co assembled assemblies were performed using idba ud with the following parameters mink 20 maxk 150 step 5 and min contig 500 peng et al 2012 the different assemblies were subsequently merged for further meta analysis and the duplicated and suboptimal contigs were removed through cd hit est version 4 8 1 li and godzik 2006 using a sequence identity threshold of 0 95 to obtain the final assembly for each sample resulting contigs were filtered by a minimal length cutoff of 500 bp finally 7423 481 high quality contigs were obtained with an average of 255 982 contigs per sample the detailed metagenomic assembly results with the number of raw reads clean reads and assembled contigs and the length of assembled contigs are summarized in table s1 2 4 genome resolved binning analysis contigs with length of 1000 bp in each assembly were removed with 46 7 gbp of contigs for binning analysis sequencing coverage was determined for each assembled contig by mapping reads from the sample to the assembly using bowtie2 version 2 3 5 langmead and salzberg 2012 all resulting contigs were clustered into mags using maxbin version 2 2 6 wu et al 2014 metabat version 2 12 1 kang et al 2015 and concoct version 1 0 0 alneberg et al 2014 algorithms which consider both tetranucleotide frequencies and the coverage of these contigs the mags drafts were further optimized to obtain high quality genomes by the steps as follows i removal of potential contaminations those contigs with distinct coverage and or gc content were deleted from mags by checkm version 1 0 12 parks et al 2015 ii re assembly of mags clean reads were mapped to all genomic contigs with burrows wheeler alignment tool version 0 7 15 default parameters li and durbin 2009 to identify assembly and scaffolding errors 3 mismatches then mags were reassembled by spades version 3 11 careful setting bankevich et al 2012 and short contigs 1000 bp were removed after genome optimization domain specific markers 120 bacterial or 122 archaeal single copy genes were retrieved to estimate genome completeness potential contamination taxonomic assignment and strain heterogeneity using checkm parks et al 2015 the mags with completeness greater than 70 and contamination smaller than 5 were selected for further analysis table s2 the subsequent gene calling functional annotation and quantification were conducted as described in

environment the one way anova and kruskal wallis were applied to statistically test the differences of physicochemical properties and relative abundances of function genes and p 0 05 was considered significant aggregated boosted tree abt analysis de ath 2007 was performed using the gbmplus package version 1 5 17 with 5000 trees used for boosting 10 fold cross validation and three way

the correlation based network analysis of the microbial community and the calculation of the relative abundance of mags are described in supplementary notes 5 and 6 the detailed method of genome comparison and representative mags selection are descripted in supplementary notes 7 2 7 data availability all 16s rrna and metagenomics data were deposited in the genome sequence archive http bigd big ac cn gsa under accession numbers prjca003844 16s rrna and prjca003851 metagenomics that are publicly accessible all newly constructed mags are available in ncbi bioproject database with accession code prjna675967 ncbi genome accession numbers for individual mags are listed in table s2 3 result 3 1 chemical properties of water and sediment samples the intrusion of ree mine drainage created a steep geochemical gradient along the river table s5 water samples of hp displayed the highest concentration of rees 12 9 6 16 mg l 1 mean s d for sediment the highest rees contents were recorded in middle stream mp 841 220 mg kg 1 the concentrations of rees in the polluted sites were much higher than those of samples from unpolluted sites in ck water 4 95 1 74 μg l 1 sediment 151 55 7 mg kg 1 in addition the heap leaching mining technique introduced high concentrations of ammonium 54 0 26 0 mg l 1 and sulfate 234 69 2 mg l 1 into the river water these samples formed a variation of geochemical gradient with ph values ranging from 4 75 to 8 76 and ec ranging from 28 9 to 851 μs cm 1 in water and sediment samples the detailed physicochemical conditions were described in table s5 and our previous study liu et al 2019a chen et al 2021 3 2 structure and functions of the microbial community the ree mine drainage affected the structure of the aquatic microbial community as shown in fig 1 archaea represented a considerable fraction up to 40 of the total prokaryote community at hp sites figs 1b and s2 which was higher than that in typical metallic mine drainage and various moderate environments including river groundwater and soil auguet et al 2010 bates et al 2011 liu et al 2018 micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata were identified as keystone species in the contaminated system implying that these archaea might play critical roles in maintaining the structure of the whole prokaryotic community figs 1c and s2 table s6 given the large amount of ammonium 54 0 26 0 mg l 1 and sulfate 234 69 2 mg l 1 input by ree mine drainage intrusion genes involved in nitrogen and sulfur cycling showed significant differences p 0 05 across sites at different pollution levels figs 2 and s3 table s7 for nitrogen metabolism related genes fig 2 a clear enrichment of ammonia monooxygenase amoabc was observed in the hp samples almost all of the amoabc genes were contributed by archaea over 90 0 in hp the nirk and nifh genes were also abundant in both the water and sediment samples and archaeal contribution increased significantly p 0 05 with the elevated pollution level similarly several abundant sulfur reduction genes e g cyscdhk and sat were primarily contributed by archaea fig 2 however the percentage of sulfur oxidation encoding genes contributed by archaea was 1 among all samples genes encoding a number of multiple stress resistance heavy metal oxidative stress and heat cold shock related enzymes were also identified fig s3 a number of resistance genes were positively correlated with rees concentration moreover the percentage of several anti oxidation enzymes sod and gene clusters for heavy metal stress arsr or transformation mera mnthr arsb and chrr contributed by archaea was 10 among hp samples fig s3 3 3 phylogeny and regulation factors of different archaea taxa based on the 25 metagenomic datasets at different pollution levels 56 high quality archaeal mags were obtained for downstream analyses table s2 we generated 16 ribosomal proteins rps trees from all mags to enable an accurate and comprehensive characterization of microbial phylogeny fig 3 a a total of 24 archaeal mags belonged to thaumarchaeota which is a long branch of tack superphylum containing aigarchaeota crenarchaeota and korarchaeota comparison of the habitat information of reference genomes showed that these archaea were widely found in a variety of environments including hot spring ocean freshwater soil and sediment indicating their considerable adaptive capacities and phylogenetic diversity fig 3b table s3 other archaea mags were located in micrarchaeota 28 mags and nanoarchaeota 1 mag branches and clustered with pacearchaeota woesearchaeota and the previously characterized nano sized archaeal lineages adam et al 2017 in the dpann superphylum these mags were closely related to rp sequences from extreme environment such as typically metallic mine drainage and hot spring based on the phylogenetic distance table s8 furthermore to explore the within phylum genomic diversity of mags the taxonomic information of theses mags was identified using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 based on 122 archaeal marker genes and ani the result showed thaumarchaeota mags 24 mags belonged to two different families nitrosopumilaceae 22 mags and uba141 2 mags and all mags of micrarchaeota 28 mags were affiliated within the same order micrrchaeales table s2 the remaining archaea were belonging to the thermoplasmata 3 mags order of the euryarchaeota phylum lineage and were distinct from other archaeal taxa yelton et al 2013 thermoplasmata are archaeal taxa widely detected in the mine drainage ecosystem however our reconstructed thermoplasmata mag clustered with genomes from freshwater and seawater samples in general the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal communities in the ree mine drainage contaminated habitats were higher than that in other typically metallic mine drainage e g those from pyrite mendez garcia et al 2014 copper mendez garcia et al 2015 arsenic sun et al 2017 lead zinc mines yang et al 2013 and moderate aquatic habitats and no evident differences were found in major taxa the abt analysis was used to evaluate the contributions of environmental parameters to the taxonomic composition of archaea taxa based on the abundance matrix fig 4 a the ph values ammonium and total carbon concentrations were ranked as the top three parameters influencing the abundance of thaumarchaeota however the rees content ph values and ammonium concentration were the major factor regulating the compositions of the other three archaeal taxonomic groups micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata the results of abt analysis indicated that environmental factors had discrepant effects on different archaea groups in addition the partial dependence plots derived from the abt model were used to reveal the effects of these environmental parameters on the archaeal alpha diversity fig 4b with the increase of ammonium 1 72 to 54 0 mg l 1 and sulfate content 3 45 to 234 mg l 1 the diversity index of archaea decreased and then increased however the ph values 4 75 to 8 76 were negatively correlated with the archaea diversity the higher values of the archaeal diversity index were observed at higher rees conditions 15 mg l 1 indicating that these archaea could adapt to the ree contaminated habitat 3 4 comparative genomic analysis based on kegg orthology to reveal the functional feature of different clades within one phylum a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on the occurrence of kegg orthology ko matrix in mags supplementary notes 7 table s9 as shown in figure s4 mags have the similar functional genes pattern with phylogeny cluster in addition for thaumarchaeota and micrarchaeota different clades within each phylum contain unique gene sets fig s5 table s10 indicating variations in metabolic potentials among different clades for micrarchaeota gluconate 5 dehydrogenase idno protoporphyrin ferrochelatase hemh were only identified in clade 1 alcohol dehydrogenase ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase prsa and nickel superoxide dismutase sodn only occurred in clade 2 hydroxypyruvate reductase ttud and pyruvate kinase were only found in clade 3 for thaumarchaeota ferric chelate reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase were exclusively detected in clade 1 and multiple nitrogen metabolism genes e g nitrous oxide reductase nosz nitrite reductase nirk ferredoxin nitrite reductase nira were detected in clade 2 collectively these identified metabolic features were specific to different clades and might have a role on archaeal niche differentiation in habitat galambos et al 2019 even if archaea shared a large amount of metabolic capacity within a taxonomic group 3 5 genome specific metabolic reconstructions the function genes of reconstructed archaeal mags were identified and showed in table s7 however the quality completeness and contamination of mags within each taxonomic group had a great influence on the characterization of archaeal function genes especially the contamination of mags would seriously hinder the inference of metabolic features thus we selected high quality mags in each group as representative mags for further metabolic reconstruction as shown in fig 5 and s6 10 the selection criteria were described in supplementary notes 7 many resistance genes e g superoxide dismutase sod thioredoxin trxab v a type atpase metallic cation and vitamin b12 transporters systems were detected in mags revealing that archaea processed multiple stress resistance potential mechanisms to survive and develop in extreme environments table s9 the results showed that na h antiporters and v a type atpase were detected in all archaea taxa which might play roles for acid stress tolerance several genes encoding metallic cation manganese zinc and iron iron siderophore and vitamin b12 transporters systems belonging to the atp binding cassette abc transporters were also commonly found in these mags furthermore the additional oxidative stress resistance gene sod and trxab found in archaeal mags might suggest an essential survival strategy for them to adapt to high level rees stress the general metabolic potentials of carbon nitrogen sulfur metabolism and energy metabolism electron donors and acceptors for the four distinct taxonomic groups were evaluated to reveal the ecological roles of these diverse archaea as shown below fig 5 table s9 thaumarchaeota 24 mags thaumarchaeota had nearly complete glycolysis gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle pathways fig 5 table s9 furthermore thaumarchaeota might use a modified version of the 3 hydroxypropionate 4 hydroxybutyrate hp hb pathway for autotrophic carbon fixation berg et al 2007 konneke et al 2014 however the genes encoding peptidase and glycosyl transferase were identified in the 21 out of 24 mags of thaumarchaeota table s9 suggesting that thaumarchaeota might switch between an autotrophic and a heterotrophic lifestyle as shown in fig 2 thaumarchaeota is the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the ree disturbed system among which all the 5 representative mags encode a complete ammonia monooxygenase amoabc for ammonia to hydroxylamine figs 5 and s7 table s9 the nirk gene encoding nitrite reductase was also found in 18 thaumarchaeota mags although thaumarchaeota mags lacked gene encoding the urease subunit alpha urec 23 of them contained three transporters of the ammonia channel transporter amt family loqué et al 2007 suggesting that thaumarchaeota could possess transporters for ammonia as substrates for its energy metabolism table s9 for sulfur metabolism thaumarchaeota encoded a nearly complete sulfate assimilation pathway figs 5 and s8 table s9 with sulfate adenylate transferase sat phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase paps reductase cysh thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and thiosulfate reductase phs presenting on the genome however the sulfur oxidation sox system gene which is responsible for the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate was absent fig s9 table s9 micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota 29 mags these nano sized archaea had small genome contents 0 86 mb in average table s2 and limited metabolism pattern table s9 although the lack of metabolic capacities might be caused by the incomplete genome these features were consistent with previous near complete 1mb genomes for these nano size archaea baker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 these two archaea contained no pathways for glycolysis gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate and genes encoding respiratory associated enzymes fig 5 table s9 none of the six known carbon fixation pathways cycles was identified in the mags suggesting that micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota were heterotrophic figs 5 and s6 table s9 however 24 out of 29 mags encoded multiple glycosyltransferases which were essential for the biosynthesis of saccharide molecules that mediated functions from structure and storage to signaling breton et al 2005 micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota mags lacked complete amino acid biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways figs 5 and s9 table s9 whereas the genes encoding a variety of peptidases and transporters e g amino acid permease were identified on the basis of the genomic data fig 5 these organisms might rely on external sources of amino acids coupled with salvage pathways to meet their nucleotide requirement chen et al 2018 the gene nrtcd encoding substrate binding proteins of the nitrate nitrite transport system was first detected in the 21 mags micrarchaeota figs 5 and s7 table s9 indicating that the recovered micrarchaeota could potentially utilize nitrate nitrite as substrate for energy metabolism remarkably 22 micrarchaeota genomes were found to harbor the genes of nitrite reductase nird which is a key function gene for nitrite reduction to ammonia and not mentioned in previous studies on micrarchaeota phylogenetic analyses of nird gene showed that most of nird genes of the recovered genome were clustered with the lineage of acidophilic euryarchaeota yelton et al 2013 fig s11 suggesting that micrarchaeota were evolutionarily related with euryarchaeota through a known symbiotic lifestyle golyshina et al 2017 micrarchaeota were identified to assimilate sulfur through the partial sulfate reduction pathway figs 5 and s8 table s9 micrarchaeota mags also encoded bifunctional enzyme cyscnd cysh and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase for the sulfate assimilation pathway thermoplasmata 3 mags thermoplasmata represented a rare component of ree mine drainage contaminated microbial communities relative abundance 0 6 figs 1b and s2 compared with conventional reductive tca rtca the gene encoding citrate synthase was identified across recovered genomes indicating that thermoplasmata might perform carbon fixation via the reversed oxidative tca rotca pathway table s7 genes encoding adp forming acetyl coa synthetase dissimilatory adenylyl sulfate reductase thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and sulfate importer were also found in all the mags of thermoplasmata the presence of a taurine transporter but no identifiable taurine dioxygenase indicated that thermoplasmata might have an unknown mechanism for degrading organosulfonate to sulfite table s9 in addition the genes related to biosynthesis of cofactors and amino acid precursors were identified in recovered genomes fig s9 table s9 which might allow thermoplasmata to coexist with other archaea taxa in an oligotrophic environment 3 6 hgt shaping the metabolism of archaea analysis using hgtector software indicated that putative hgt events played an important role in gene flow and acquisition which contributed to genome contents of archaea we showed that the ratio of putative hgt to total genes for the archaeal community was about 6 85 11 6 26 8 high value because of fragmentary genome and 12 1 for thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata respectively based on the annotation by kos and clusters of orthologous genes categories tables s11 12 the transferred genes were involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis inorganic ion transport and metabolism genes related to metabolism underwent more hgts than other gene families fig 6 a by contrast genes related to cellular processes and signaling functions were minimally transferred fig 6a the influence of genetic interaction on interphylum exchange was evaluated by generating networks that represented the cases of hgt figs 6 and s12 these networks were made by linking the donors and recipients with hgt statistic the potential donors of these hgts were identified in our studies which mostly originated from the same domain gene transfer among archaeal communities might facilitate environmental stress resistance for example k h antiporter nhap2 adaptive response sensory kinase sasa and dna repair protein nrea were identified as hgts with archaea serving as donor notably in thermoplasmata those key stone species were regarded as the main donors of hgt in community our study indicated that energy yielding v a type atpase and vitamin b12 transporting atpase were transferred from thermoplasmatales and these enzymes occurred widely in thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota fig 6b tables s11 12 bacteria also substantially contributed to generate genetic diversity of archaea through hgt several genes were transferred from firmicutes actinobacteria chloroflexi and proteobacteria archaea acquired some key metabolic functions and multiple resistance by hgt events tables s11 12 for micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata the nrtcd donor firmicutes nitrospirae and cysch donor nitrososphaeria genes were involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles being donated by bacteria 4 discussion 4 1 important survival strategies of archaeal taxa in south china ree mining activity caused severe ecological degradation and environmental pollution recently chao et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 in the present study we revealed that ree mine drainage shaped a distinct archaeal community figs 1 2 and s2 whereas the predominance of archaea was located in four distinct lineages thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata fig 3 in typical mine drainage contaminated habitats a wide set of uncultured archaea related to thermoplasmata and nano sized archaea were commonly detected and they existed in the form of symbionts golyshina et al 2017 chen et al 2018 these archaea were adaptable to metal rich low ph habitats possibly through evolving metal resistance mendez garcia et al 2015 chen et al 2016 in our study according to the abt model rees were identified as the key factors affecting the archaea taxa in this system fig 4 the rees were well known for their anti bacterial function significantly damaging and changing the outer microbial cell membrane responsible for cell permeability chen et al 2012 previous studies demonstrated that rees could inhibit the growth of microbes e g inhibiting the growth of soil fungi d aquino et al 2009 or decreasing nitrifying bacteria activity fujita et al 2015 by competitively replacing metals in several important enzymes of life therefore the abundant heavy metal resistant genes and peroxiredoxin detected in all archaeal mags might be an essential strategy to adapt to rees pollution in this region table s9 furthermore the extra encoded inorganic phosphate transport system in archaeal genomes might play a key role in coping with rees stress the uptake of inorganic phosphate could balance cellular osmotic pressure when archaea taxa were exposed to high concentration of metals moberly et al 2010 different from typical mine drainage ree mine drainage also introduced excessive ammonium and sulfate into the environment because of the heap leaching mining technique huang et al 2011 liu et al 2019b in the current study ammonium was also a critical environmental variable affecting archaea taxa particularly for thaumarchaeota fig 4 based on the percentage of contribution to amoabc genes thaumarchaeota 90 was more dominant than ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob during autotrophic ammonia oxidation in this system fig 2 inconsistent with the conclusions drawn from previous studies on open ocean sediments and other moderate environments the archaeal or crenarchaeotal amoa genes were retrieved in low ammonium containing environments wuchter et al 2006 lam et al 2007 herrmann et al 2008 because of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa s high affinity for ammonia prosser and nicol 2012 this difference between our study and other studies was probably due to the high concentration of ammonium 54 0 26 0 mg l 1 under acidic conditions which might have deleterious effects on most organisms rather than limited source of nitrogen furthermore in our system the reduction of abundant sulfate could produce sulfide which had an inhibitory effect on autotrophic ammonia oxidation the aoa had unique enzymes genes similar to their relatives sulfolobales hallam et al 2006 which facilitated them to thrive and oxidize ammonia under sulfide conditions erguder et al 2009 thaumarchaeota were identified as having energy efficient hp hb carbon fixation pathways figs 5 and s6 berg et al 2007 konneke et al 2014 which is conducive to their survival in organic carbon limited condition of the contaminated rivers in general these observations collectively offer a biochemical explanation for archaea dominating in an ammonium rich environment with low ph and high level of rees 4 2 metabolic network and ecological roles of archaea taxa 4 2 1 carbon cycle the availability of carbon resources is vital to the microbial communities populating in oligotrophic environments table s5 the abundance of thermoplasmata and thaumarchaeota could fix carbon using the rotca cycle mall et al 2018 and modified version of the hp hb pathway konneke et al 2014 respectively here the low toc content in hp sites likely promoted carbon fixation this result was consistent with previous observations on the mine drainage community revealing that carbon fixation was a prevalent carbon metabolism adapted by microorganisms inhabiting in contaminated environments chen et al 2015 mendez garcia et al 2015 however micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota detected as heterotrophs co occurring with these carbon fixers might drive carbon cycling by consuming organic carbons fig 5 metabolic reconstruction indicated that most of the core biosynthetic pathways were limited or missing in micrarchaeota and nanoarchaeota figs 5 and s9 table s9 the rudimentary metabolic capability of these nano sized archaea showed their potential symbiotic lifestyles numerous systems such as surface proteins membrane channels and secretory pathways of these archaea provided an interface for the exchange of metabolites energy macromolecules and dna among nano sized archaea and other free living organisms i e thermoplasmata in this system fig 5 micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata had similar responses to environmental factors further indicating these taxa might coexist as a potential consortium in ree mine drainage fig 4 this assumption that taxa coexist as consortium was consistent with several pure culture experiments which confirmed the potential interaction consortium between nano sized archaea and their hosts in situ for example micrarchaeota mia14 and thermoplasmatales golyshina et al 2017 and nanoarchaeota nst1 and sulfolobales spp podar et al 2013 munson mcgee et al 2015 thus this potential distinct lifestyle and specific energy source supply mode might be a significant contributor to archaeal community assembly in this contaminated system which are similar to coexisting taxa in marine datta et al 2016 and underground water ecosystems anantharaman et al 2016 4 2 2 nitrogen cycle apart from rees disturbance this contaminated river water contained high concentration of ammonium 54 26 mg l 1 at hp sites table s5 and this general trend has been existed at this site for at least 20 years zhao et al 2019 based on metabolic potential analysis the most abundant archaeal taxa thaumarchaeota was the predominant aoa the ammonia oxidizing process of thaumarchaea could release intermediates no and or nh2oh with the participation of denitrifiers which were then reduced non enzymatically to n2o in anoxic microenvironments kozlowski et al 2016 thus these archaea might play crucial roles in the nitrogen cycles and influence nitrogen transportation in our contaminated environment you et al 2009 kozlowski et al 2016 our study for the first time shows a nitrite reduction pathway in micrarchaeota fig s11 table s9 these recovered micrarchaeota contained nird gene encoding nitrite reductase which could potentially use nitrite as terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions coupled with the oxidation of sulfide and or organic compounds zhu et al 2018 this finding indicated the potential metabolic capability of micrarchaeota under high level of nitrification conditions thus if nitrite was used as the nitrogen source in this system micrarchaeota could grow and reduce nitrite in hypoxic and aerobic conditions the occurrence of the nitrite reduction pathways in certain microbial genomes might be a strategy of metabolic versatility of these microbes adapt to environmental changes the finding might reveal the evolutionary history of these nano sized archaea thereby determining the taxa inhabiting hot spring and typically metallic mine drainage contaminated environments baker et al 2010 golyshina et al 2017 chen et al 2018 as previously discussed the ammonia oxidizing thaumarchaeota might utilize ammonium as substrate in a system however though both nitrite transporter and nitrite reductase were found in micrarchaeota no assimilatory nitrate reduction genes were identified suggesting the distinct nitrogen substrate preferences and ecological niches of archaea in this disturbed environment figs 5 and s10 table s9 in addition nitrite concentrations could limit microbial growth in environments ali et al 2016 on the one hand thaumarchaeota encoding nirk gene isrequired for nirk dependent tolerance to nitrite for constituting a defense mechanism that protects ammonia oxidizers against the toxic product of aerobic ammonia oxidation beaumont et al 2005 on the other hand the nitrite reductase nird of micrarchaeota is involved primarily in the detoxification of internal nitrite fig s11 table s9 lilja and johnson 2016 therefore the potential metabolic network between ammonia oxidization by thaumarchaea and the reduction of nitrite by micrarchaeota could enhance overall nitrogen metabolism in the ecosystem through the completion of a nitrite loop as proposed by speth et al speth et al 2016 fig 5 this interaction in nitrogen metabolism might be critical for supporting distinct archaea taxa coexistence and archaeal community stability in ree mine drainage contaminated environments figs 5 and s10 4 2 3 sulfur cycle archaea were revealed to possess sulfur metabolism with regard to sulfate reduction sulfur oxidation and thiosulfate reduction and assimilation figs 5 and s10 three of the four archaea taxa were identified to assimilate sulfur through sulfate reduction encoding partial or fragmented pathways suggesting that complete sulfate reduction occurs through the functions of multiple archaeal taxa that are potentially linked via metabolic handoffs figs 5 and s10 table s9 anantharaman et al 2016 among these archaeal mags thermoplasmata and thaumarchaea have sulfur metabolism with genes for sulfate thiosulfate importer thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and thiosulfate reductase phs however micrarchaeota only identify thiosulfate sulfurtransferase thiosulfate reduction in the sulfur metabolism is important for sulfur transformation in anoxic sediment environments jørgensen 1990 stoffels et al 2012 the presence of genes involved in elemental sulfur and thiosulfate reduction fig s8 table s9 indicates that these archaea may play key roles in reducing intermediate sulfur compounds iscs in the ree mine drainage contaminated environment therefore abundant iscs reduced by archaea constitute an energetically favorable substrate for other microorganisms to survive in this nutrient poor environment in addition iscs reduction would increase ph by consuming protons with precipitation of rees by sulfide zeng et al 2015 moreover iscs reduction can play key roles in ree mine drainage remediation apart from archaea a large fraction of key function genes involved in sulfur oxidation were derived from bacteria ayangbenro et al 2018 fig 2 thus bacteria might jointly mediate the sulfur cycle in ree disturbed river ecosystem with archaeal community this potential metabolic network needs to be further explored through the integration analysis of bacterial mags and or confirmed by microcosm experiment the genome resolved analysis provided a route to explore the ecological role of these previously uncharacterized microorganisms in various complex environments anantharaman et al 2016 campanaro et al 2018 chen et al 2018 woodcroft et al 2018 in the present study we successfully evaluated the metabolic potential of 56 mags these phylogenetically distinct archaea coexisted in a ree mine drainage contaminated environment interconnected metabolically and mediated the carbon nitrogen and sulfur biogeochemical cycles figs 5 and s10 table s9 however it should be noticed that the genome resolved analysis only showed evidences for metabolic potential and the expression of genes in mags was not examined we then analyzed the metabolic network among diverse archaea to mainly display a cross feeding interactions type zelezniak et al 2015 however the interactions among microbial communities are complex and varied including mutualism parasitism or predation competition and so on faust and raes 2012 the combined approaches including transcriptomic enzymatic techniques and synthetic communities would further facilitate the research on the interactions within archaeal community 4 3 genetic interaction among archaeal community through hgt the hgt had a key impact on prokaryotes specific ecological and functional evolution caro quintero and konstantinidis 2014 particularly for the adaptation of microbial communities to environmental stress in extreme habitats hemme et al 2010 in our system the relatively low hgt frequency 9 84 in average was identified compared with the level of congeneric archaea from other aquatic habitats deschamps et al 2014 this result was due to the fact that rees inhibit intensive microbe absorbing external dna and thereby decreasing the hgt efficiency wenhua et al 2003 although the relatively low frequency of hgt occurred in our system hgt events still substantially contributed to acquiring some metabolism related genes by certain archaea fig 6a the nrtcd and cysch genes obtained by hgt events could provide the key innovations for micrarchaeota and thermoplasmata facilitating their mediation in nitrogen and sulfur cycles tables s11 12 the hgt events promoted the formation of the ecological role among these archaea in the ree disturbed system in addition numerous studies have used network based scores to identify putative keystone taxa in various environments although thermoplasmatales only constituted a minor fraction of microbial communities in ree mine drainage it was identified as keystone species in the system thermoplasmatales might be the primary donor for the other three archaeal phyla transferring many genes that were important to environmental resistance fig 6b tables s11 12 this finding was consistent with the previous observation that thermoplasmatales exchanged several genes with archaeal partners in acidophilic environments golyshina et al 2017 herbold et al 2017 understanding the ecological role of keystone species is a central goal in microbial ecology in general keystone species might use a range of strategies to influence microbes for example they might act through intermediate or effector groups whose abundance can be selectively modulated to regulate community structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 our results further revealed that the keystone taxa might also have ecological functions in the genetic evolution of the community the result might broaden our understanding of the ecological concept of keystone taxa to a certain extent and provide insight into the ecological role and evolution of the archaeal community in mine ecosystems 5 conclusion our metagenomic and genome resolved analyses unambiguously pointed out that four distinct archaea belonging to thaumarchaeota micrarchaeota nanoarchaeota and thermoplasmata were enriched in ree mine drainage contaminated river according to abt analysis the structure of the archaeal community was primarily regulated by ph ammonium and rees content we obtained 56 archaeal mags and reconstructed the metabolic pathways of these less known but ubiquitous microorganisms in mine ecosystems our results revealed that the coexistence of archaeal taxa was partly due to the facts that functional partitioning and distinct archaea for example ammonia oxidizing thaumarchaeota nitrite reducing micrarchaeota and the nano sized archaea host thermoplasmata could play important ecological roles in the community these archaea might contribute to carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling in the system by interactive utilization of substrates in addition these four distinct archaea derived important functional components from the community through hgt the genetic interaction within the archaeal community could serve as a niche adaptive strategy of individual lineages enabling them to tolerate the low ph high heavy metal concentrations and energy generation in the contaminated environment our study revealed the ecological role and survival strategies of previously less known archaea in ree mine ecosystem at the community level and laid the foundation for future potential manipulation of archaea for in situ bioremediation furthermore bacteria might play a key role in the metabolic partnership with the archaeal consortia and co meditate the biogeochemical cycles therefore future complex studies would help to explore the cross kingdom e g bacteria fungi interactions for better ecology evolution and adaption of microbial communities to ree mine ecosystems

16864,anaerobic sewage treatment is a proven technology in warm climate regions and sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs are an important post treatment technology to remove residual organic carbon and nitrogen even though sbtfs can achieve a reasonably good effluent quality further process optimization is hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of the factors influencing nitrogen removal notably when it comes to mainstream anaerobically treated sewage in this study the factors that control the performance of sbtfs following anaerobic i e uasb reactors for sewage treatment were investigated a demo scale sbtf fed with anaerobically pre treated sewage was monitored for 300 days showing a median nitrification efficiency of 79 and a median total nitrogen removal efficiency of 26 heterotrophic denitrification was limited by the low organic carbon content of the anaerobic effluent it was demonstrated that nitrification was impaired by a lack of inorganic carbon rather than by alkalinity limitation to properly describe inorganic carbon limitation in models bicarbonate was added as a state variable and sigmoidal kinetics were applied the resulting model was able to capture the overall long term experimental behaviour there was no nitrite accumulation which indicated that nitrite oxidizing bacteria were little or less affected by the inorganic carbon limitation overall this study indicated the vital role of influent characteristics and operating conditions concerning nitrogen conversions in sbtfs treating anaerobic effluent thus facilitating further process optimization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic sewage treatment biological nitrogen removal biofilm model dynamic simulation sigmoidal kinetics 1 introduction anaerobic sewage treatment using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors has been widely implemented in warm climate regions chernicharo et al 2015 for instance such technology comprises approximately 40 out of the 2 300 sewage treatment plants currently in operation in brazil ana 2020 this refers to mainstream anaerobic treatment i e directly applied to the main flow of sewage rather than more common applications of anaerobic digestion for sidestream process i e sludge digestion uasb reactors remove organic components from sewage and turns them into biogas a renewable energy source the amount of excess sludge produced is low compared to aerobic processes while anaerobic treatment converts organic carbon it does not remove nitrogen which leaves the uasb reactor mainly in the form of ammonium additional aerobic treatment is thus required to remove nitrogen from the anaerobic effluent sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs have been successfully applied for this purpose mostly at pilot and demo scales bressani ribeiro et al 2017 onodera et al 2013 but also at full scale okubo et al 2016 sbtfs can be regarded as trickling filters packed with polyurethane sponge as a support media for biomass growth and were first proposed in the late 90 s agrawal et al 1997 such reactors can achieve a very good effluent quality in terms of residual organic carbon and ammonium removal with little or very low energy consumption and involving simple equipment operation and maintenance tandukar et al 2007 still there is a lack of knowledge regarding the influence of influent characteristics and operating conditions on nitrogen removal in sbtfs treating anaerobic effluent which hampers further process optimization mathematical modelling could help to unravel the governing factors driving the nitrogen removal pathways in sbtfs modelling and simulation have proven to be powerful tools to assess the most important parameters influencing autotrophic nitrogen removal in biofilm reactors picioreanu et al 1997 hubaux et al 2015 volcke et al 2010 however the latter simulation studies deal with sidestream conditions associated with high strength nitrogenous wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 only few studies relate to mainstream autotrophic nitrogen removal considering the interaction among ordinary heterotrophs oho ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria al omari et al 2015 trojanowicz et al 2019 other studies dealing with biofilm reactors for mainstream sewage treatment are mostly connected with aerobic processes such as high rate activated sludge roots et al 2020 sequencing batch reactors sbr drewnowski et al 2021 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr laureni et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge no models have been applied so far to describe nitrogen conversions from mainstream anaerobically treated effluents inorganic carbon is an important factor influencing nitrogen removal in sewage treatment plants it is directly associated with alkalinity as most of the total inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate given the typical neutral ph conditions in anaerobically treated effluents the dynamics of aob have been reported to change significantly under inorganic carbon limitation while nob activity remains stable guisasola et al 2007 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 biesterfeld et al 2003 showed that nitrification rates are affected by an inorganic carbon shortage below 45 mg caco3 l 1 independently from ph alkalinity expressed as bicarbonate is typically introduced in models to predict possible ph changes and to close charge balances rieger et al 2012 this is also the case for the activated sludge models from asm1 to asm3 henze et al 2006 in which alkalinity limitation on single step nitrification is described by monod kinetics it is important to note that the alkalinity limitation considered in these models refers to unfavourable ph conditions rather than to inorganic carbon limitation modelling approaches considering inorganic carbon limitation effects on autotrophs have also been proposed described with monod or sigmoidal kinetics wett and rauch 2003 guisasola et al 2007 seuntjens et al 2018 however the different behaviour of aob and nob under inorganic carbon depleted conditions is typically neglected in models moreover mainstream process models typically assume that influent inorganic carbon content is sufficiently high meaning hardly any limitation sin et al 2008 this contribution deals with mainstream nitrogen conversions in sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs following uasb reactors treating sewage long term experimental data of a demo scale uasb sbtf system were gathered indicating inorganic carbon limitation for ammonium removal based on these insights and on the available literature information a mechanistic model for mainstream nitrogen removal of anaerobically treated sewage was developed the model was subsequently calibrated and validated to dynamic data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup system under study a sponge bed trickling filter sbtf was operated as a post treatment step of a uasb reactor v 14 1 m3 hydraulic retention time hrt 8 5 h receiving part of the anaerobic effluent the uasb sbtf system fig 1 was fed continuously with real sewage from a full scale treatment plant about 2 million population equivalent in belo horizonte city 19 54 s 43 56 w brazil after preliminary treatment removal of coarse solids and grit the main sbtf design characteristics are summarized in table 1 no inoculation was performed for the reactor start up and the support material consisted of polyurethane sponge the surface area of the polyurethane sponge available for biofilm growth was determined using the method proposed by moon et al 2010 which relies on the number and diameter of sponge fibres assessed through scanning electron microscopy fei quanta 200 feg supplementary information a 2 the sbtf operation resembled a classical operation of a low to intermediate rate trickling filter following a uasb reactor in which the effluent was distributed on top of the unit by rotary arms and trickled down to the bottom nevertheless the uasb sbtf system under study operated without a secondary settler resulting in a compact system as proposed previously almeida et al 2009 onodera et al 2016 for oxygen supply the bottom ventilating access port of the sbtf see fig 1 was kept fully open the vent area was equivalent to the total required area for natural draft trickling filters metcalf eddy inc 2013 additionally five different sewage treatment plants stps with full scale uasb reactors population equivalent from 10 000 up to 1 000 000 inhabitants in the state of minas gerais brazil were intensively monitored between july and september 2018 composite samples were collected twice weekly and bicarbonate alkalinity as caco3 and nh4 n concentrations were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 2 2 influent characteristics the uasb sbtf system was monitored for 300 days weekly grab samples were collected and the following parameters were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 codtotal codfiltered 0 45 µm tss vss bicarbonate alkalinity as caco3 nh4 n no2 n and no3 n total nitrogen tn was determined using a toc tn analyser shimadzu toc vcph tnm 1 field analysis of dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were carried out using a multiparametric sensor hach hq 40d a spreadsheet is provided concerning the dynamic effluent dataset of the monitored uasb sbtf system supplementary information a 8 2 3 model development 2 3 1 biological conversions a mechanistic one dimensional biofilm model was developed to describe the behaviour of a sbtf following a uasb reactor treating real sewage biological conversion reactions were based on the model of mozumder et al 2014 supplementary information a 1 given the indication for inorganic carbon limitation in this study bicarbonate was included as a limitation term in the kinetic expressions for the growth of autotrophs therefore bicarbonate accounted for neutralize protons generated during the nitritation process as well as a source of inorganic carbon for cell synthesis and growth see further ammonification was added to the model accounting for the conversion of organic nitrogen present in the anaerobic effluent fed to the sbtf biomass decay was modelled to lead directly to soluble ammonium instead of soluble organic nitrogen which is a reasonable assumption given that hydrolysis is not the rate limiting step henze et al 2006 the key catabolic processes implemented in the model are depicted in fig 2 the stoichiometric matrix kinetic expressions and model parameter values are detailed in tables s1 s4 supplementary information ph was not included as a state variable in the model indeed for the system under study ph stayed relatively constant between 7 1 and 7 4 10 90th percentile see results section 3 1 in this range the effect of ph on nitrification rates can be neglected the latter was confirmed by biesterfeld et al 2003 who showed that ph between 7 0 and 7 5 did not correlate with nitrification rates in different full scale nitrifying trickling filters similar ammonia removal rates in biofilms were reported by zhang and bishop 1996 despite a ph ranging from 6 6 to 7 2 in case significant ph changes occur ph would need to be included as a state variable in the model and could be calculated at every time instant from the charge balance in the reactor involving all components involved in chemical equilibria the latter include total inorganic carbon with equilibrium forms co2 hco3 and co3 2 the concentration of which would then be calculated from a carbon balance this ph calculation approach has been described in detail by volcke 2006 particulate organic carbon present in the anaerobically treated sewage fed to the sbtf was assumed non biodegradable in addition decayed biomass was assumed to be directly converted into ss rather than particulate organic substrate xs this assumption is supported by practical observations indicating that the hydrolysis of xs to ss is not a rate limiting step in sbtfs tandukar et al 2006a as solids retention time is considerably large in the system in mathematical terms xs was not taken up as a state variable in the model 2 3 2 modelling inorganic carbon limitation different saturation models monod sigmoidal tessier and haldane kinetics table 2 have been applied in the literature to describe inorganic carbon limitation on aob nob and anammox bacteria with various parameter values table 3 the alkalinity limitation term considered in the asm models henze et al 2006 was included in the overview for reasons of completeness even though it serves as a placeholder to indicate a threat of dropping ph rather than to describe inorganic carbon limitation in this study the description of inorganic carbon limitation in the model has been scrutinized following its experimental observation see further 2 3 3 biofilm reactor modelling the sbtf reactor was described using the biofilm compartment of the aquasim software reichert 1995 in which the biological conversions were implemented as biofilm was considered to be rigid particulate components were displaced only due to the expansion or shrinking of the biofilm solid matrix in all simulations a planar biofilm was grown from an initial thickness of 1 µm to a predefined steady state thickness of 60 µm as nitrifying biofilms are reported to be relatively thin 20 to 250 µm thick boller et al 1994 siegrist and gujer 1987 the biofilm porosity was considered constant εw 0 80 and in all simulations the initial fractions of particulate components were set at εini xaob 0 10 εini xnob 0 05 and εini xi 0 as in mozumder et al 2014 the initial anammox fraction εini xan was assumed as 0 005 this low initial active biomass fractioning for anammox 2 5 of the total particulate components was set as no inoculum was used in the start up of the monitored sbtf consequently the initial fraction of heterotrophs εini xh was set at 0 045 the density of autotrophic biomass and particulate inert material in the biofilm was set to 60 000 g vss m 3 van benthum et al 1995 for heterotrophic biomass the density was defined as 20 000 g vss m 3 van benthum et al 1995 a typical conversion factor of 0 75 g vss g 1 cod henze et al 2006 was considered for all particulate material the biofilm model was defined as confined which means that the reactor volume stays constant independent of biofilm growth the sbtf reactor under study had a plug flow hydrodynamic behaviour as demonstrated by preliminary tracer tests in the sbtf with fluorescent dyes data not shown the plug flow behaviour is supported by substrate concentration gradients which are usually observed along the sbtf height mac conell et al 2015 to mimic plug flow hydraulic conditions the reactor was modelled as a sequence of four completely mixed biofilm reactor compartments 0 25 m3 each oxygen supply was introduced in the model as a dynamic process from the bulk liquid phase as follows d s o 2 d t k l a s o 2 s a t s o 2 in which so2 sat and so2 represent the oxygen saturation level and the bulk liquid dissolved oxygen respectively the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla was estimated during model calibration a mass transfer boundary layer thickness ll of 1500 µm was adopted in all simulations as a typical value for low rate trickling filters henze et al 2008 as diffusion is assumed to occur over the entire biofilm compartment diffusion coefficients were corrected by a factor of 0 8 this accounts for additional mass transport limitations caused by the presence of the solid phase eberl et al 2006 concerning possible model limitations the simplified hydrodynamic modelling approach allows for a focus on the biokinetics of sbtfs following uasb reactors the visually observed heterogeneity in effluent percolation and the possible existence of dead zones in the porous media are assumed to be simply lumped in other parameters 2 4 simulation set up dynamic simulations were performed with the experimental data of the uasb reactor effluent over the considered 300 day period supplementary information a 8 as model input the soluble biodegradable cod fraction of the anaerobic effluent was assumed as 50 of the measured filtered cod this is supported from results of extensive measurements in uasb reactors effluents in which 40 60 of the soluble cod was biodegradable aquino et al 2009 2 5 model calibration and validation model calibration was performed through extensive simulations considering the dynamic effluent dataset most model parameters were adopted from literature see tables s1 s3 supplementary information several parameters were adjusted to match the simulation results with the dynamic experimental data i e do inorganic carbon nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the sbtf gathered in this study two independent calibration procedures were assessed first the simulated residual ammonium concentration was matched to the observed one by adjusting parameters related to aob growth as they are known to significantly influence nitrogen profiles de kreuk et al 2007 vannecke and volcke 2015 more specifically the maximum growth rate μ m a x a o b and the half saturation coefficient for ammonium knh were selected given that the observed dissolved oxygen and ammonium concentrations were non limiting for nitrification see results section 3 2 inorganic carbon limitation was not considered in the rate expressions secondly the calibration considered the simulated bulk effluent concentrations i e do inorganic carbon nh4 n and no3 n fitted to the experimental results by assessing the impact of inorganic carbon limitation in the two step nitrification process this was performed iteratively with proper kla values set to reproduce the measured bulk effluent do concentration in the sbtf as do cannot be calibrated independently from ammonium conversion rates for the simulations considering the monod approach for inorganic carbon limitation of aob the affinity constant k i c a o b was stepwise tested from 10 to 25 mg caco3 l 1 for sigmoidal kinetics approach for aob simulations with an incremental variation of the parameters k and a were performed considering a range between 15 and 35 mg caco3 l 1 and 3 and 5 respectively these ranges of values for both approaches monod and sigmoidal kinetics are anchored in the reported coefficients in the literature see table 3 for all the simulations performed kla values were varied according to previously reported values 106 and 373 d 1 watari et al 2020 to adjust bioconversion rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and thus effluent concentrations to observed experimental data the goodness of fit between model predictions and bulk liquid concentrations was assessed by applying the nash sutcliffe criterion based on the calculated model efficiency e according to eq 5 nash and sutcliffe 1970 a similar approach can be found in the literature vannecke and volcke 2015 5 e 1 i 1 n y i m y i 2 i 1 n y i m y m 2 where y i m denotes the experimentally observed value of the ith output variable yi is the corresponding simulated value and y m is the mean value of the observations in this case e should be preferably larger than 0 and close to the maximum of 1 the higher model efficiency the better the fit between simulations and measured values when no good representation of data by modelling was achieved i e e 0 the difference between medians from experimental data and modelling outputs was statistically assessed non parametric statistical tests were applied wilcoxon matched pairs test as data distribution typically followed a non normal behaviour in all cases statistical significance was defined by 95 confidence limits i e p 0 05 analysis were performed in spss statistics software ibm corp v27 retaining the null hypothesis from statistical tests i e no difference between experimental and simulated medians was set as a final criterion for required accuracy after calibration following calibration model validation was performed based on two independent datasets the first one was a dynamic dataset from a different sbtf following a uasb reactor this sbtf was operated under a similar hlr 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 almeida et al 2013 compared to the currently monitored sbtf although also based on polyurethane sponge the specific surface area of the packing media was not reported it was therefore assumed equal to the determined value in the present study supplementary information a 2 the second independent experimental dataset applied for model validation concerned a sbtf operated in parallel with the experimental set up under study which was first subject to a prolonged period 300 days of limited oxygen supply and then operated under similar oxygen supply conditions as the sbtf considered for model calibration this reactor was also fed with real anaerobically treated sewage and subjected to similar operating conditions hlr of 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr of 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 the goodness of fit between model predictions and bulk liquid concentrations during validation was also assessed by applying the nash sutcliffe criterion 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the combined uasb sbtf system the uasb sbtf system performance over the 300 days monitoring period is summarized in table 4 the median cod removal efficiency of the anaerobic reactor was 68 which is typical from well operated uasb reactors treating sewage under mesophilic temperatures chernicharo et al 2015 the remaining median total cod 153 mg l 1 was removed in the sbtf with an efficiency of 60 overall the cod removal efficiency of the uasb sbtf system was 89 resulting in a median effluent cod concentration of 62 mg l 1 note that filtered cod removal in the sbtf was limited to approximately 40 most probably the remaining filtered cod content in the final effluent 43 mg l 1 was non biodegradable which is supported by previous reports on the low biodegradability 40 60 of the total effluent soluble cod from uasb reactors treating sewage aquino et al 2009 a remarkably high overall tss removal efficiency 94 was obtained even though operating without a secondary settler after the sbtf the excess sludge production of the sbtf amounted to 0 12 kg tss kg codremoved 1 which is considerably lower than typical ranges reported for aerobic processes following uasb reactors 0 25 0 88 kg tss kg codremoved 1 gonçalves et al 1998 tandukar et al 2007 longer sludge retention time srt due to the interstitial biomass retention has been indicated to be a key mechanism contributing to low effluent tss concentrations from sbtfs in contrast to conventional trickling filters filled with rock based support media onodera et al 2013 tandukar et al 2006b as expected no nitrogen conversion took place in the uasb reactor supporting the need for a subsequent post treatment step the overall ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies in the sbtf amounted to 79 and 26 respectively 3 2 dynamic nitrogen conversions in the sbtf the ammonium concentrations and ammonium removal efficiency of the sbtf over the 300 day experimental period are displayed in fig 3 the influent ammonium concentration to the sbtf ranged between 23 and 44 mg l 1 10 90th percentile median nitrogen loading rate nlr 0 33 kg n m 3 sponge d 1 nitrification was observed soon after the start up of the sbtf the ammonium removal efficiency steadily increased ranging between 73 and 84 10 90th percentile during the first 100 days of operation and increased further up from day 175 to reach over 90 ammonium removal efficiency on days 220 255 from day 255 to 300 the median ammonium removal efficiency dropped to 79 a noticeable increase in the influent ammonium concentration was recorded from day 182 onwards the median olr applied to the monitored sbtf was 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 ammonium removal efficiencies in sbtfs post uasb reactors typically reach values of 70 or higher for olr up to 2 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 bressani ribeiro et al 2018 the observed median nh4 n removal rate throughout the monitoring period amounted to 168 g nh4 n m 3 sponge d 1 which is comparable to previously reported values of pilot scale sbtfs operating under similar olr onodera et al 2013 tawfik et al 2006 uemura et al 2012 over the whole monitoring period effluent ammonium concentrations remained stable below 10 mg l 1 regardless of the dynamic behaviour of the influent ammonium concentration median effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were 0 2 mg l 1 and 27 mg l 1 respectively see table 4 this clearly indicates nob activity in the reactor in contrast to the relatively high ammonium removal efficiency the nitrogen removal efficiency was limited to 26 median nitrogen removal rate nrr 0 09 kg n m 3 sponge d 1 this is in line with previously reported values for nitrogen removal efficiency in fully ventilated sbtfs without effluent recirculation namely 25 and 35 onodera et al 2014 tandukar et al 2006a due to the long srt retained solids inside the sponge pores can be hydrolysed releasing soluble products that can be eventually available as organic substrate almeida et al 2013 endogenous respiration as a source of additional organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrification was first pointed out by araki et al 1999 this can be also related with the little excess sludge production in the monitored sbtf the remaining ammonium concentration in the effluent median value 6 mg l 1 reflects that aob could not convert all the influent ammonium despite the do concentrations in the effluent being close to the local saturation level approximately 8 mg l 1 see fig 6b nitrite was hardly detected 0 2 mg l 1 and definitely below inhibiting levels the observed incomplete ammonium conversion could only be reproduced by simulation when increasing the affinity constant of aob for nitrogen knh to over 45 g n m 3 fig s3 supplementary information which is unrealistically high compared with typical literature values 1 67 18 76 g n m 3 i e the interquartile ranges reported by vannecke and volcke 2015 furthermore the maximum growth rate of aob μ m a x a o b had to be adjusted to unlikely values μ m a x a o b μ m a x n o b as long as aob tend to have a higher μ m a x than nob at temperatures close to the observed ones 24 3 c 2 3 c table 4 3 3 inorganic carbon limitation experimental indications bicarbonate was systematically depleted within the sbtf from a median influent value of 237 mg caco3 l 1 to values lower than 45 mg caco3 l 1 see fig 6c which is regarded as the threshold for impairing nitrification rates in biofilms biesterfeld et al 2003 inorganic carbon seemed to play a key role as a limiting substrate for aob in the sbtf conversely nob activity was unaffected by the inorganic carbon limitation as nitrite accumulation was negligible nob capability to adapt to limiting inorganic carbon concentrations has been reported in the literature as previously addressed it is interesting to note that the ph remained quite constant around 7 4 see table 4 over the monitored period despite the inorganic carbon drop this supports that lack of inorganic carbon for cell synthesis is the rate limiting step for nitritation instead of ph inhibition as similarly observed by biesterfeld et al 2003 considering a ph ranging from 6 9 to 8 0 to unravel inorganic carbon limitation in post treatment systems of anaerobic effluents an overview was made on the effluent bicarbonate and ammonium concentrations of five full scale uasb reactors fig 4 the median bicarbonate ranged between 300 and 350 mg caco3 l 1 except for the stp 5 which showed a much higher concentration 600 mg caco3 l 1 because of its location in a city whose water supply is drawn from carbonate sedimentary rock underground areas the ammonium concentrations in the uasb reactor effluents ranged between 50 and 70 mg l 1 overall a typical bicarbonate ammonium ratio in the order of 5 to 6 mg caco3 mg nh4 n was noticed which is below the stoichiometric requirement for the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate 7 14 mg caco3 consumed mg nh4 n oxidized rittmann and mccarty 2001 therefore full nitrification in post treatment systems following uasb reactors tends to be generally bicarbonate limited in conventional aerobic processes e g activated sludge the degradation of organic matter by heterotrophic microorganisms supplies enough co2 as inorganic carbon source for the autotrophs guisasola et al 2007 conversely systems comprised by uasb reactors followed by aerobic post treatment units e g trickling filters experience a decoupling of organic matter degradation and further co2 supply for autotrophic growth indeed organic carbon is mostly converted to biogas mainly ch4 in the anaerobic stage decreasing available readily biodegradable organic carbon and associated co2 production in the post treatment step besides depending on turbulent conditions during influent distribution dissolved co2 in the anaerobic effluent is stripped as mass transfer is liquid phase controlled due to the low value of its henry constant kh co2 25 c 0 0338 mol l 1 atm 1 perry and chilton 1973 this support the hypothesis that nitrification in post treatment systems following uasb reactors notably trickling filters tends to be limited by the influent inorganic carbon 3 4 model structure selection and calibration a detailed analysis of the different saturation models for inorganic carbon was performed for aob nob and anammox fig 5 the monod eq 1 and sigmoidal approach eq 2 to describe inorganic carbon limitation for aob were compared considering the range of coefficients from table 3 see section 2 3 2 tessier kinetics for aob proposed by guisasola et al 2007 was not included as it renders a steep transition to a zero order behaviour for inorganic carbon values less than 1 0 mg caco3 l 1 likewise process inhibition haldane kinetics approach due to high levels of inorganic carbon is unrealistic for mainstream sewage treatment furthermore the values reported by boltz et al 2011 regarding aob kinetics were not considered separately since they were based on henze et al 2006 care should be taken when adopting same inorganic carbon limitation kinetics and associated parameter values from literature especially when modelling nitrification as a two step process wett and rauch 2003 assumed the same sigmoidal inorganic carbon limitation function for both aob and nob leading to an unrealistic nitrite build up in the sbtf effluent under limited inorganic carbon supply fig s2 supplementary information guisasola et al 2007 only reported sigmoidal inorganic carbon limitation of aob and no inorganic carbon limitation of nob however the sigmoidal expression eq 2 is characterized by a non zero value 1 e k a 1 at a null substrate concentration sic 0 mg caco3 l 1 for the parameter values of guisasola et al 2007 this lead to a relatively high offset and associated positive growth rate of aob 1 e k a 1 0 12 and µmax 0 for sic 0 mg caco3 l 1 which was found to cause numerical instabilities during simulation in order to remedy this a switching function could be applied to impose zero growth in the absence of inorganic carbon this either comes down to implement an if function implying the introduction of discontinuous dynamics which may again lead to numerical instabilities or choosing a different saturation model eq 1 eq 3 or eq 4 alternatively the sigmoidal model structure could be applied with parameters values resulting in almost zero value at sic 0 few examples are found on modelling nitrogen removal considering the significance of inorganic carbon as an assimilative carbon source al omari et al 2015 seuntjens et al 2018 even less references deal with the impact of inorganic carbon steering microbial competition among different autotrophic guilds from a respirometric titrimetric experiment guisasola et al 2007 showed the inhibition of aob activity at inorganic carbon concentrations lower than 36 mg l 1 while no limitation for nob was reported similar microbial dynamics were observed by zhang et al 2016 in a pilot scale membrane bioreactor treating synthetic wastewater where nob prevailed and aob was supressed under inorganic carbon n ratio less than 1 5 from a fundamental standpoint it is supported that nob are likely less limited than aob regarding inorganic carbon as nob can up regulate its anabolism mixotrophically from traces of organic matter bock 1976 ren et al 2014 some nob nitrospira genus could use simple organic substrates e g pyruvate for carbon assimilation and likely simultaneously as energy sources in addition to co2 and nitrite daims et al 2001 gruber dorninger et al 2015 furthermore aob use bicarbonate preferably instead of gaseous co2 as a source of inorganic carbon jiang et al 2015 lücker et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 low levels of inorganic carbon were also stated to be limiting for anammox growth as experimentally demonstrated by ma et al 2015 however only one study reporting the affinity constant value k i c a n was found in the literature kimura et al 2011 given that dissolved oxygen and ammonium were non limiting for aob activity in the monitored sbtf the observed residual ammonium concentration in this reactor could only be simulated when inorganic carbon limitation was included in the model the nitritation process was a sink of inorganic carbon which was primarily consumed for buffering fig s5 supplementary information the best fit was obtained with sigmoidal kinetics for aob calibrated values k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 see fig 5 coupled with a kla of 330 d 1 the corresponding concentration dynamics of nh4 n do inorganic carbon and no3 n are displayed in fig 6 the kinetics of inorganic carbon limitation for nob and anammox bacteria were described by a monod type saturation considering relatively low half saturation constant values 1 2 mg caco3 l 1 as in al omari et al 2015 table 3 this kinetic term thus serves as a mathematical switch to prevent bacterial growth in the absence of substrate as recommended by hauduc et al 2010 rather than as an inorganic carbon limitation term this is supported by the less pronounced effects of inorganic carbon limitation on nob and anammox bacteria growth the overall trends for the sbtf performance could be captured i e a residual ammonium concentration in the bulk liquid associated with the lack of influent inorganic carbon and the production of nitrate without nitrite accumulation the model fit may have been influenced by the dynamic variations in the influent total nitrogen concentration fig 6a yet the sigmoidal kinetics with calibrated parameters for inorganic carbon limitation of aob did not lead to statistical differences p 0 05 between the median observed effluent ammonium concentration 6 mg l 1 and the median simulated value 5 mg l 1 table s5 supplementary information such observation of residual ammonium concentrations is only possible when considering inorganic carbon limitation unless unrealistic kinetic parameter values knh over 45 g n m 3 and μ m a x a o b μ m a x n o b are assumed as previously discussed fig s3 supplementary information besides the model was able to describe the overall behaviour of effluent do inorganic carbon and nitrate concentrations fig s4 supplementary information a satisfactory goodness of fit for effluent ammonium concentrations could also be achieved considering the monod approach for inorganic carbon kinetics of aob table s5 supplementary information however a poorer representation of the inorganic carbon dynamics was revealed compared to the sigmoidal approach for all tested conditions the monod approach rendered remarkable differences between the median observed effluent inorganic carbon concentration 19 mg l 1 and the median simulated value 5 mg l 1 the best fit obtained with sigmoidal kinetics is in line with literature guisasola et al 2007 seuntjens et al 2018 wett and rauch 2003 the width of the transient range associated with data acquisition i e approximately 7 days between monitoring campaigns is likely influencing the modelling outputs corroborating for the low dynamic model efficiency e 0 table s5 supplementary information moreover the observed sensitivity of nitrification to the dynamic loading conditions is typical for the cases with low effluent bicarbonate alkalinity 50 mg caco3 l 1 fig 6c henze et al 2008 finally pronounced peaks on the simulated effluents predictions could also be related to the less developed biofilm as steady state biofilm thickness and biomass profiles were not reached under the simulated time 300 days overall considering parameter uncertainty the model was found to satisfactorily describe the experimental data capturing important trends for process understanding and further optimization 3 5 model validation the calibrated model was validated on two independent datasets the first one was a dynamic dataset from a different sbtf following a uasb reactor operated under a similar hlr 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 compared to the currently monitored sbtf the second dataset concerned a sbtf operated in parallel with the experimental set up under study which was first subject to a prolonged period 300 days of limited oxygen supply and then operated under similar conditions as the sbtf considered for model calibration concerning the first validation dataset the model was able to capture the overall effluent behaviour in terms of ammonium dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations figure s6 supplementary information despite less accurate dynamic outputs e 0 fig s7 supplementary information nevertheless the simulation results present peaks of effluent inorganic carbon concentration which did not correspond with the experimental observations fig s7 c supplementary information and were related to less nitrate consumption via heterotrophic denitrification the simulated behaviour could be explained by the lack of soluble biodegradable cod which was assumed in the model as a fraction 50 of the anaerobic effluent filtered cod as measured experimentally see section 2 4 however in reality an additional source of organic carbon could be present in the form of entrapped solids in the sponge carrier which was not accounted for in the model the characterization of solids entrapment and further cod release could be included in a more detailed model however this would also lead to the need to assess flow paths in porous media requiring a more detailed at least 2 dimensional as proposed by bottero et al 2013 biofilm model and consequently increase the computational burden another aspect that may have affected a better fitting is that the specific surface area of the sponge based support material was not reported by almeida et al 2013 this is an important model parameter which directly affects the amount of biomass retained in the reactor and as such impacts biological conversion rates as for the validation on the sbtf following a prolonged period of oxygen limitation again the model was able to capture the overall effluent behaviour in terms of ammonium dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations fig s8 supplementary information the presented operational data was recorded straight after ceasing oxygen limitation and a lag period approximately first 30 days seemed to took place before the reactor regained its full oxygenation capacity it is worth mentioning that oxygen transfer dynamics in trickling filters is not yet entirely clear logan 1996 during this period less ammonium was converted due to the decreased dissolved oxygen availability which reflected in reduced inorganic carbon consumption and less nitrate formation fig s9 supplementary information such dynamics could not be captured quantitively through simulation likely due to the modelling approach with a constant oxygen mass transfer coefficient to present further evidence of the need to include inorganic carbon limitation when modelling sbtfs treating anaerobic effluents complementary simulations were performed on both validation datasets without inorganic carbon in the kinetic rate expression of aob model outputs were remarkably impacted as null effluent ammonium concentrations were predicted fig s10 supplementary information this highlights the validity of the model structure with sigmoidal kinetics for inorganic carbon limitation of aob considering calibrated parameters k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 see table 3 4 conclusions the start up and stable operation of a demo scale sponge bed trickling filter sbtf for the removal of nitrogen and residual organic carbon from anaerobically pre treated sewage was monitored for 300 days a mathematical model was developed calibrated and validated for the first time to describe mainstream nitrogen removal from anaerobically treated effluents nitrification was observed soon after the start up of the sbtf from the 20th day after the start up onwards the effluent ammonium concentrations remained stable below 10 mg n l 1 despite variations in the influent ammonium concentration 23 44 mg l 1 10 90th percentile the median ammonium removal efficiency amounted to 79 total nitrogen removal efficiency was limited to 26 a low value which is typical for fully ventilated sbtfs without effluent recirculation heterotrophic denitrification was limited by the low organic carbon content of the anaerobic effluent the limited ammonium conversion was ascribed to a lack of influent inorganic carbon as the incoming concentration median 237 mg caco3 l 1 was systematically depleted to values below the required minimum 45 mg caco3 l 1 to sustain nitrification in biofilms limitation was attributed to inorganic carbon rather than alkalinity as the ph remained constant ammonium and oxygen limitation were excluded as was inhibition by nitrite to properly describe inorganic carbon limitation in models bicarbonate as a state variable should be used to quantify inorganic carbon limitation rather than to merely indicate ph changes the need to include this state variable was confirmed through simulation demonstrating the crucial role of inorganic carbon for both buffering and as an inorganic carbon source in calibrating nitrogen conversions nitrite accumulation was not observed during the monitored period which indicates that nob activity was little affected by the inorganic carbon limitation or at least less than aob activity considering a higher inorganic carbon limitation for aob than nob is essential for modelling nitrogen conversions in sbtfs following uasb reactors for sewage treatment inorganic carbon limitation of aob was best described using sigmoidal kinetics with calibrated values k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16864,anaerobic sewage treatment is a proven technology in warm climate regions and sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs are an important post treatment technology to remove residual organic carbon and nitrogen even though sbtfs can achieve a reasonably good effluent quality further process optimization is hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of the factors influencing nitrogen removal notably when it comes to mainstream anaerobically treated sewage in this study the factors that control the performance of sbtfs following anaerobic i e uasb reactors for sewage treatment were investigated a demo scale sbtf fed with anaerobically pre treated sewage was monitored for 300 days showing a median nitrification efficiency of 79 and a median total nitrogen removal efficiency of 26 heterotrophic denitrification was limited by the low organic carbon content of the anaerobic effluent it was demonstrated that nitrification was impaired by a lack of inorganic carbon rather than by alkalinity limitation to properly describe inorganic carbon limitation in models bicarbonate was added as a state variable and sigmoidal kinetics were applied the resulting model was able to capture the overall long term experimental behaviour there was no nitrite accumulation which indicated that nitrite oxidizing bacteria were little or less affected by the inorganic carbon limitation overall this study indicated the vital role of influent characteristics and operating conditions concerning nitrogen conversions in sbtfs treating anaerobic effluent thus facilitating further process optimization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic sewage treatment biological nitrogen removal biofilm model dynamic simulation sigmoidal kinetics 1 introduction anaerobic sewage treatment using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors has been widely implemented in warm climate regions chernicharo et al 2015 for instance such technology comprises approximately 40 out of the 2 300 sewage treatment plants currently in operation in brazil ana 2020 this refers to mainstream anaerobic treatment i e directly applied to the main flow of sewage rather than more common applications of anaerobic digestion for sidestream process i e sludge digestion uasb reactors remove organic components from sewage and turns them into biogas a renewable energy source the amount of excess sludge produced is low compared to aerobic processes while anaerobic treatment converts organic carbon it does not remove nitrogen which leaves the uasb reactor mainly in the form of ammonium additional aerobic treatment is thus required to remove nitrogen from the anaerobic effluent sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs have been successfully applied for this purpose mostly at pilot and demo scales bressani ribeiro et al 2017 onodera et al 2013 but also at full scale okubo et al 2016 sbtfs can be regarded as trickling filters packed with polyurethane sponge as a support media for biomass growth and were first proposed in the late 90 s agrawal et al 1997 such reactors can achieve a very good effluent quality in terms of residual organic carbon and ammonium removal with little or very low energy consumption and involving simple equipment operation and maintenance tandukar et al 2007 still there is a lack of knowledge regarding the influence of influent characteristics and operating conditions on nitrogen removal in sbtfs treating anaerobic effluent which hampers further process optimization mathematical modelling could help to unravel the governing factors driving the nitrogen removal pathways in sbtfs modelling and simulation have proven to be powerful tools to assess the most important parameters influencing autotrophic nitrogen removal in biofilm reactors picioreanu et al 1997 hubaux et al 2015 volcke et al 2010 however the latter simulation studies deal with sidestream conditions associated with high strength nitrogenous wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 only few studies relate to mainstream autotrophic nitrogen removal considering the interaction among ordinary heterotrophs oho ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria al omari et al 2015 trojanowicz et al 2019 other studies dealing with biofilm reactors for mainstream sewage treatment are mostly connected with aerobic processes such as high rate activated sludge roots et al 2020 sequencing batch reactors sbr drewnowski et al 2021 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr laureni et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge no models have been applied so far to describe nitrogen conversions from mainstream anaerobically treated effluents inorganic carbon is an important factor influencing nitrogen removal in sewage treatment plants it is directly associated with alkalinity as most of the total inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate given the typical neutral ph conditions in anaerobically treated effluents the dynamics of aob have been reported to change significantly under inorganic carbon limitation while nob activity remains stable guisasola et al 2007 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 biesterfeld et al 2003 showed that nitrification rates are affected by an inorganic carbon shortage below 45 mg caco3 l 1 independently from ph alkalinity expressed as bicarbonate is typically introduced in models to predict possible ph changes and to close charge balances rieger et al 2012 this is also the case for the activated sludge models from asm1 to asm3 henze et al 2006 in which alkalinity limitation on single step nitrification is described by monod kinetics it is important to note that the alkalinity limitation considered in these models refers to unfavourable ph conditions rather than to inorganic carbon limitation modelling approaches considering inorganic carbon limitation effects on autotrophs have also been proposed described with monod or sigmoidal kinetics wett and rauch 2003 guisasola et al 2007 seuntjens et al 2018 however the different behaviour of aob and nob under inorganic carbon depleted conditions is typically neglected in models moreover mainstream process models typically assume that influent inorganic carbon content is sufficiently high meaning hardly any limitation sin et al 2008 this contribution deals with mainstream nitrogen conversions in sponge bed trickling filters sbtfs following uasb reactors treating sewage long term experimental data of a demo scale uasb sbtf system were gathered indicating inorganic carbon limitation for ammonium removal based on these insights and on the available literature information a mechanistic model for mainstream nitrogen removal of anaerobically treated sewage was developed the model was subsequently calibrated and validated to dynamic data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup system under study a sponge bed trickling filter sbtf was operated as a post treatment step of a uasb reactor v 14 1 m3 hydraulic retention time hrt 8 5 h receiving part of the anaerobic effluent the uasb sbtf system fig 1 was fed continuously with real sewage from a full scale treatment plant about 2 million population equivalent in belo horizonte city 19 54 s 43 56 w brazil after preliminary treatment removal of coarse solids and grit the main sbtf design characteristics are summarized in table 1 no inoculation was performed for the reactor start up and the support material consisted of polyurethane sponge the surface area of the polyurethane sponge available for biofilm growth was determined using the method proposed by moon et al 2010 which relies on the number and diameter of sponge fibres assessed through scanning electron microscopy fei quanta 200 feg supplementary information a 2 the sbtf operation resembled a classical operation of a low to intermediate rate trickling filter following a uasb reactor in which the effluent was distributed on top of the unit by rotary arms and trickled down to the bottom nevertheless the uasb sbtf system under study operated without a secondary settler resulting in a compact system as proposed previously almeida et al 2009 onodera et al 2016 for oxygen supply the bottom ventilating access port of the sbtf see fig 1 was kept fully open the vent area was equivalent to the total required area for natural draft trickling filters metcalf eddy inc 2013 additionally five different sewage treatment plants stps with full scale uasb reactors population equivalent from 10 000 up to 1 000 000 inhabitants in the state of minas gerais brazil were intensively monitored between july and september 2018 composite samples were collected twice weekly and bicarbonate alkalinity as caco3 and nh4 n concentrations were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 2 2 influent characteristics the uasb sbtf system was monitored for 300 days weekly grab samples were collected and the following parameters were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 codtotal codfiltered 0 45 µm tss vss bicarbonate alkalinity as caco3 nh4 n no2 n and no3 n total nitrogen tn was

provided concerning the dynamic effluent dataset of the monitored uasb sbtf system supplementary information a 8 2 3 model development 2 3 1 biological conversions a mechanistic one dimensional biofilm model was developed to describe the behaviour of a sbtf following a uasb reactor treating real sewage biological conversion reactions were based on the model of mozumder et al 2014 supplementary information a 1 given the indication for inorganic carbon limitation in this study bicarbonate was included as a limitation term in the kinetic expressions for the growth of autotrophs therefore bicarbonate accounted for neutralize protons generated during the nitritation process as well as a source of inorganic carbon for cell synthesis and growth see further ammonification was added to the model accounting for the conversion of organic nitrogen present in the anaerobic effluent fed to the sbtf biomass decay was modelled to lead directly to soluble ammonium instead of soluble organic nitrogen which is a reasonable assumption given that hydrolysis is not the rate limiting step henze et al 2006 the key catabolic processes implemented in the model are depicted in fig 2 the stoichiometric matrix kinetic expressions and model parameter values are detailed in tables s1 s4 supplementary information ph was not included as a state variable in the model indeed for the system under study ph stayed relatively constant between 7 1 and 7 4 10 90th percentile see results section 3 1 in this range the effect of ph on nitrification rates can be neglected the latter was confirmed by biesterfeld et al 2003 who showed that ph between 7 0 and 7 5 did not correlate with nitrification rates in different full scale nitrifying trickling filters similar ammonia removal rates in biofilms were reported by zhang and bishop 1996 despite a ph ranging from 6 6 to 7 2 in case significant ph changes occur ph would need to be included as a state variable in the model and could be calculated at every time instant from the charge balance in the reactor involving all components involved in chemical equilibria the latter include total inorganic carbon with equilibrium forms co2 hco3 and co3 2 the concentration of which would then be calculated from a carbon balance this ph calculation approach has been described in detail by volcke 2006 particulate organic carbon present in the anaerobically treated sewage fed to the sbtf was assumed non biodegradable in addition decayed biomass was assumed to be directly converted into ss rather than particulate organic substrate xs this assumption is supported by practical observations indicating that the hydrolysis of xs to ss is not a rate limiting step in sbtfs tandukar et al 2006a as solids retention time is considerably large in the system in mathematical terms xs was not taken up as a state variable in the model 2 3 2 modelling inorganic carbon limitation different saturation models monod sigmoidal tessier and haldane kinetics table 2 have been applied in the literature to describe inorganic carbon limitation on aob nob and anammox bacteria with various parameter values table 3 the alkalinity limitation term considered in the asm models henze et al 2006 was included in the overview for reasons of completeness even though it serves as a placeholder to indicate a threat of dropping ph rather than to describe inorganic carbon limitation in this study the description of inorganic carbon limitation in the model has been scrutinized following its experimental observation see further 2 3 3 biofilm reactor modelling the sbtf reactor was described using the biofilm compartment of the aquasim software reichert 1995 in which the biological conversions were implemented as biofilm was considered to be rigid particulate components were displaced only due to the expansion or shrinking of the biofilm solid matrix in all simulations a planar biofilm was grown from an initial thickness of 1 µm to a predefined steady state thickness of 60 µm as nitrifying biofilms are reported to be relatively thin 20 to 250 µm thick boller et al 1994 siegrist and gujer 1987 the biofilm porosity was considered constant εw 0 80 and in all simulations the initial fractions of particulate components were set at εini xaob 0 10 εini xnob 0 05 and εini xi 0 as in mozumder et al 2014 the initial anammox fraction εini xan was assumed as 0 005 this low initial active biomass fractioning for anammox 2 5 of the total particulate components was set as no inoculum was used in the start up of the monitored sbtf consequently the initial fraction of heterotrophs εini xh was set at 0 045 the density of autotrophic biomass and particulate inert material in the biofilm was set to 60 000 g vss m 3 van benthum et al 1995 for heterotrophic biomass the density was defined as 20 000 g vss m 3 van benthum et al 1995 a typical conversion factor of 0 75 g vss g 1 cod henze et al 2006 was considered for all particulate material the biofilm model was defined as confined which means that the reactor volume stays constant independent of biofilm growth the sbtf reactor under study had a plug flow hydrodynamic behaviour as demonstrated by preliminary tracer tests in the sbtf with fluorescent dyes data not shown the plug flow behaviour is supported by substrate concentration gradients which are usually observed along the sbtf height mac conell et al 2015 to mimic plug flow hydraulic conditions the reactor was modelled as a sequence of four completely mixed biofilm reactor compartments 0 25 m3 each oxygen supply was introduced in the model as a dynamic process from the bulk liquid phase as follows d s o 2 d t k l a s o 2 s a t s o 2 in which so2 sat and so2 represent the oxygen saturation level and the bulk liquid dissolved oxygen respectively the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla was estimated during model calibration a mass transfer boundary layer thickness ll of 1500 µm was adopted in all simulations as a typical value for low rate trickling filters henze et al 2008 as diffusion is assumed to occur over the entire biofilm compartment diffusion coefficients were corrected by a factor of 0 8 this accounts for additional mass transport limitations caused by the presence of the solid phase eberl et al 2006 concerning possible model limitations the simplified hydrodynamic modelling approach allows for a focus on the biokinetics of sbtfs following uasb reactors the visually observed heterogeneity in effluent percolation and the possible existence of dead zones in the porous media are assumed to be simply lumped in other parameters 2 4 simulation set up dynamic simulations were performed with the experimental data of the uasb reactor effluent over the considered 300 day period supplementary information a 8 as model input the soluble biodegradable cod fraction of the anaerobic effluent was assumed as 50 of the measured filtered cod this is supported from results of extensive measurements in uasb reactors effluents in which 40 60 of the soluble cod was biodegradable aquino et al 2009 2 5 model calibration and validation model calibration was performed through extensive simulations considering the dynamic effluent dataset most model parameters were adopted from literature see tables s1 s3 supplementary information several parameters were adjusted to match the simulation results with the dynamic experimental data i e do inorganic carbon nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the sbtf gathered in this study two independent calibration procedures were assessed first the simulated residual ammonium concentration was matched to the observed one by adjusting parameters related to aob growth as they are known to significantly influence nitrogen profiles de kreuk et al 2007 vannecke and volcke 2015 more specifically the maximum growth rate μ m a x a o b and the half saturation coefficient for ammonium knh were selected given that the observed dissolved oxygen and ammonium concentrations were non limiting for nitrification see results section 3 2 inorganic carbon limitation was not considered in the rate expressions secondly the calibration considered the simulated bulk effluent concentrations i e do inorganic carbon nh4 n and no3 n fitted to the experimental results by assessing the impact of inorganic carbon limitation in the two step nitrification process this was performed iteratively with proper kla values set to reproduce the measured bulk effluent do concentration in the sbtf as do cannot be calibrated independently from ammonium conversion rates for the simulations considering the monod approach for inorganic carbon limitation of aob the affinity constant k i c a o b was stepwise tested from 10 to 25 mg caco3 l 1 for sigmoidal kinetics approach for aob simulations with an incremental variation of the parameters k and a were performed considering a range between 15 and 35 mg caco3 l 1 and 3 and 5 respectively these ranges of values for both approaches monod and sigmoidal kinetics are anchored in the reported coefficients in the literature see table 3 for all the simulations performed kla values were varied according to previously reported values 106 and 373 d 1 watari et al 2020 to adjust bioconversion rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and thus effluent concentrations to observed experimental data the goodness of fit between model predictions and bulk liquid concentrations was assessed by applying the nash sutcliffe criterion based on the calculated model efficiency e according to eq 5 nash and sutcliffe 1970 a similar approach can be found in the literature vannecke and volcke 2015 5 e 1 i 1 n y i m y i 2 i 1 n y i m y m 2 where y i m denotes the experimentally observed value of the ith output variable yi is the corresponding simulated value and y m is the mean value of the observations in this case e should be preferably larger than 0 and close to the maximum of 1 the higher model efficiency the better the fit between simulations and measured values when no good representation of data by modelling was achieved i e e 0 the difference between medians from experimental data and modelling outputs was statistically assessed non parametric statistical tests were applied wilcoxon matched pairs test as data distribution typically followed a non normal behaviour in all cases statistical significance was defined by 95 confidence limits i e p 0 05 analysis were performed in spss statistics software ibm corp v27 retaining the null hypothesis from statistical tests i e no difference between experimental and simulated medians was set as a final criterion for required accuracy after calibration following calibration model validation was performed based on two independent datasets the first one was a dynamic dataset from a different sbtf following a uasb reactor this sbtf was operated under a similar hlr 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 almeida et al 2013 compared to the currently monitored sbtf although also based on polyurethane sponge the specific surface area of the packing media was not reported it was therefore assumed equal to the determined value in the present study supplementary information a 2 the second independent experimental dataset applied for model validation concerned a sbtf operated in parallel with the experimental set up under study which was first subject to a prolonged period 300 days of limited oxygen supply and then operated under similar oxygen supply conditions as the sbtf considered for model calibration this reactor was also fed with real anaerobically treated sewage and subjected to similar operating conditions hlr of 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr of 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 the goodness of fit between model predictions and bulk liquid concentrations during validation was also assessed by applying the nash sutcliffe criterion 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the combined uasb sbtf system the uasb sbtf system performance over the 300 days monitoring period is summarized in table 4 the median cod removal efficiency of the anaerobic reactor was 68 which is typical from well operated uasb reactors treating sewage under mesophilic temperatures chernicharo et al 2015 the remaining median total cod 153 mg l 1 was removed in the sbtf with an efficiency of 60 overall the cod removal efficiency of the uasb sbtf system was 89 resulting in a median effluent cod concentration of 62 mg l 1 note that filtered cod removal in the sbtf was limited to approximately 40 most probably the remaining filtered cod content in the final effluent 43 mg l 1 was non biodegradable which is supported by previous reports on the low biodegradability 40 60 of the total effluent soluble cod from uasb reactors treating sewage aquino et al 2009 a remarkably high overall tss removal efficiency 94 was obtained even though operating without a secondary settler after the sbtf the excess sludge production of the sbtf amounted to 0 12 kg tss kg codremoved 1 which is considerably lower than typical ranges reported for aerobic processes following uasb reactors 0 25 0 88 kg tss kg codremoved 1 gonçalves et al 1998 tandukar et al 2007 longer sludge retention time srt due to the interstitial biomass retention has been indicated to be a key mechanism contributing to low effluent tss concentrations from sbtfs in contrast to conventional trickling filters filled with rock based support media onodera et al 2013 tandukar et al 2006b as expected no nitrogen conversion took place in the uasb reactor supporting the need for a subsequent post treatment step the overall ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies in the sbtf amounted to 79 and 26 respectively 3 2 dynamic nitrogen conversions in the sbtf the ammonium concentrations and ammonium removal efficiency of the sbtf over the 300 day experimental period are displayed in fig 3 the influent ammonium concentration to the sbtf ranged between 23 and 44 mg l 1 10 90th percentile median nitrogen loading rate nlr 0 33 kg n m 3 sponge d 1 nitrification was observed soon after the start up of the sbtf the ammonium removal efficiency steadily increased ranging between 73 and 84 10 90th percentile during the first 100 days of operation and increased further up from day 175 to reach over 90 ammonium removal efficiency on days 220 255 from day 255 to 300 the median ammonium removal efficiency dropped to 79 a noticeable increase in the influent ammonium concentration was recorded from day 182 onwards the median olr applied to the monitored sbtf was 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 ammonium removal efficiencies in sbtfs post uasb reactors typically reach values of 70 or higher for olr up to 2 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 bressani ribeiro et al 2018 the observed median nh4 n removal rate throughout the monitoring period amounted to 168 g nh4 n m 3 sponge d 1 which is comparable to previously reported values of pilot scale sbtfs operating under similar olr onodera et al 2013 tawfik et al 2006 uemura et al 2012 over the whole monitoring period effluent ammonium concentrations remained stable below 10 mg l 1 regardless of the dynamic behaviour of the influent ammonium concentration median effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were 0 2 mg l 1 and 27 mg l 1 respectively see table 4 this clearly indicates nob activity in the reactor in contrast to the relatively high ammonium removal efficiency the nitrogen removal efficiency was limited to 26 median nitrogen removal rate nrr 0 09 kg n m 3 sponge d 1 this is in line with previously reported values for nitrogen removal efficiency in fully ventilated sbtfs without effluent recirculation namely 25 and 35 onodera et al 2014 tandukar et al 2006a due to the long srt retained solids inside the sponge pores can be hydrolysed releasing soluble products that can be eventually available as organic substrate almeida et al 2013 endogenous respiration as a source of additional organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrification was first pointed out by araki et al 1999 this can be also related with the little excess sludge production in the monitored sbtf the remaining ammonium concentration in the effluent median value 6 mg l 1 reflects that aob could not convert all the influent ammonium despite the do concentrations in the effluent being close to the local saturation level approximately 8 mg l 1 see fig 6b nitrite was hardly detected 0 2 mg l 1 and definitely below inhibiting levels the observed incomplete ammonium conversion could only be reproduced by simulation when increasing the affinity constant of aob for nitrogen knh to over 45 g n m 3 fig s3 supplementary information which is unrealistically high compared with typical literature values 1 67 18 76 g n m 3 i e the interquartile ranges reported by vannecke and volcke 2015 furthermore the maximum growth rate of aob μ m a x a o b had to be adjusted to unlikely values μ m a x a o b μ m a x n o b as long as aob tend to have a higher μ m a x than nob at temperatures close to the observed ones 24 3 c 2 3 c table 4 3 3 inorganic carbon limitation experimental indications bicarbonate was systematically depleted within the sbtf from a median influent value of 237 mg caco3 l 1 to values lower than 45 mg caco3 l 1 see fig 6c which is regarded as the threshold for impairing nitrification rates in biofilms biesterfeld et al 2003 inorganic carbon seemed to play a key role as a limiting substrate for aob in the sbtf conversely nob activity was unaffected by the inorganic carbon limitation as nitrite accumulation was negligible nob capability to adapt to limiting inorganic carbon concentrations has been reported in the literature as previously addressed it is interesting to note that the ph remained quite constant around 7 4 see table 4 over the monitored period despite the inorganic carbon drop this supports that lack of inorganic carbon for cell synthesis is the rate limiting step for nitritation instead of ph inhibition as similarly observed by biesterfeld et al 2003 considering a ph ranging from 6 9 to 8 0 to unravel inorganic carbon limitation in post treatment systems of anaerobic effluents an overview was made on the effluent bicarbonate and ammonium concentrations of five full scale uasb reactors fig 4 the median bicarbonate ranged between 300 and 350 mg caco3 l 1 except for the stp 5 which showed a much higher concentration 600 mg caco3 l 1 because of its location in a city whose water supply is drawn from carbonate sedimentary rock underground areas the ammonium concentrations in the uasb reactor effluents ranged between 50 and 70 mg l 1 overall a typical bicarbonate ammonium ratio in the order of 5 to 6 mg caco3 mg nh4 n was noticed which is below the stoichiometric requirement for the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate 7 14 mg caco3 consumed mg nh4 n oxidized rittmann and mccarty 2001 therefore full nitrification in post treatment systems following uasb reactors tends to be generally bicarbonate limited in conventional aerobic processes e g activated sludge the degradation of organic matter by heterotrophic microorganisms supplies enough co2 as inorganic carbon source for the autotrophs guisasola et al 2007 conversely systems comprised by uasb reactors followed by aerobic post treatment units e g trickling filters experience a decoupling of organic matter degradation and further co2 supply for autotrophic growth indeed organic carbon is mostly converted to biogas mainly ch4 in the anaerobic stage decreasing available readily biodegradable organic carbon and associated co2 production in the post treatment step besides depending on turbulent conditions during influent distribution dissolved co2 in the anaerobic effluent is stripped as mass transfer is liquid phase controlled due to the low value of its henry constant kh co2 25 c 0 0338 mol l 1 atm 1 perry and chilton 1973 this support the hypothesis that nitrification in post treatment systems following uasb reactors notably trickling filters tends to be limited by the influent inorganic carbon 3 4 model structure selection and calibration a detailed analysis of the different saturation models for inorganic carbon was performed for aob nob and anammox fig 5 the monod eq 1 and sigmoidal approach eq 2 to describe inorganic carbon limitation for aob were compared considering the range of coefficients from table 3 see section 2 3 2 tessier kinetics for aob proposed by guisasola et al 2007 was not included as it renders a steep transition to a zero order behaviour for inorganic carbon values less than 1 0 mg caco3 l 1 likewise process inhibition haldane kinetics approach due to high levels of inorganic carbon is unrealistic for mainstream sewage treatment furthermore the values reported by boltz et al 2011 regarding aob kinetics were not considered separately since they were based on henze et al 2006 care should be taken when adopting same inorganic carbon limitation kinetics and associated parameter values from literature especially when modelling nitrification as a two step process wett and rauch 2003 assumed the same sigmoidal inorganic carbon limitation function for both aob and nob leading to an unrealistic nitrite build up in the sbtf effluent under limited inorganic carbon supply fig s2 supplementary information guisasola et al 2007 only reported sigmoidal inorganic carbon limitation of aob and no inorganic carbon limitation of nob however the sigmoidal expression eq 2 is characterized by a non zero value 1 e k a 1 at a null substrate concentration sic 0 mg caco3 l 1 for the parameter values of guisasola et al 2007 this lead to a relatively high offset and associated positive growth rate of aob 1 e k a 1 0 12 and µmax 0 for sic 0 mg caco3 l 1 which was found to cause numerical instabilities during simulation in order to remedy this a switching function could be applied to impose zero growth in the absence of inorganic carbon this either comes down to implement an if function implying the introduction of discontinuous dynamics which may again lead to numerical instabilities or choosing a different saturation model eq 1 eq 3 or eq 4 alternatively the sigmoidal model structure could be applied with parameters values resulting in almost zero value at sic 0 few examples are found on modelling nitrogen removal considering the significance of inorganic carbon as an assimilative carbon source al omari et al 2015 seuntjens et al 2018 even less references deal with the impact of inorganic carbon steering microbial competition among different autotrophic guilds from a respirometric titrimetric experiment guisasola et al 2007 showed the inhibition of aob activity at inorganic carbon concentrations lower than 36 mg l 1 while no limitation for nob was reported similar microbial dynamics were observed by zhang et al 2016 in a pilot scale membrane bioreactor treating synthetic wastewater where nob prevailed and aob was supressed under inorganic carbon n ratio less than 1 5 from a fundamental standpoint it is supported that nob are likely less limited than aob regarding inorganic carbon as nob can up regulate its anabolism mixotrophically from traces of organic matter bock 1976 ren et al 2014 some nob nitrospira genus could use simple organic substrates e g pyruvate for carbon assimilation and likely simultaneously as energy sources in addition to co2 and nitrite daims et al 2001 gruber dorninger et al 2015 furthermore aob use bicarbonate preferably instead of gaseous co2 as a source of inorganic carbon jiang et al 2015 lücker et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 low levels of inorganic carbon were also stated to be limiting for anammox growth as experimentally demonstrated by ma et al 2015 however only one study reporting the affinity constant value k i c a n was found in the literature kimura et al 2011 given that dissolved oxygen and ammonium were non limiting for aob activity in the monitored sbtf the observed residual ammonium concentration in this reactor could only be simulated when inorganic carbon limitation was included in the model the nitritation process was a sink of inorganic carbon which was primarily consumed for buffering fig s5 supplementary information the best fit was obtained with sigmoidal kinetics for aob calibrated values k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 see fig 5 coupled with a kla of 330 d 1 the corresponding concentration dynamics of nh4 n do inorganic carbon and no3 n are displayed in fig 6 the kinetics of inorganic carbon limitation for nob and anammox bacteria were described by a monod type saturation considering relatively low half saturation constant values 1 2 mg caco3 l 1 as in al omari et al 2015 table 3 this kinetic term thus serves as a mathematical switch to prevent bacterial growth in the absence of substrate as recommended by hauduc et al 2010 rather than as an inorganic carbon limitation term this is supported by the less pronounced effects of inorganic carbon limitation on nob and anammox bacteria growth the overall trends for the sbtf performance could be captured i e a residual ammonium concentration in the bulk liquid associated with the lack of influent inorganic carbon and the production of nitrate without nitrite accumulation the model fit may have been influenced by the dynamic variations in the influent total nitrogen concentration fig 6a yet the sigmoidal kinetics with calibrated parameters for inorganic carbon limitation of aob did not lead to statistical differences p 0 05 between the median observed effluent ammonium concentration 6 mg l 1 and the median simulated value 5 mg l 1 table s5 supplementary information such observation of residual ammonium concentrations is only possible when considering inorganic carbon limitation unless unrealistic kinetic parameter values knh over 45 g n m 3 and μ m a x a o b μ m a x n o b are assumed as previously discussed fig s3 supplementary information besides the model was able to describe the overall behaviour of effluent do inorganic carbon and nitrate concentrations fig s4 supplementary information a satisfactory goodness of fit for effluent ammonium concentrations could also be achieved considering the monod approach for inorganic carbon kinetics of aob table s5 supplementary information however a poorer representation of the inorganic carbon dynamics was revealed compared to the sigmoidal approach for all tested conditions the monod approach rendered remarkable differences between the median observed effluent inorganic carbon concentration 19 mg l 1 and the median simulated value 5 mg l 1 the best fit obtained with sigmoidal kinetics is in line with literature guisasola et al 2007 seuntjens et al 2018 wett and rauch 2003 the width of the transient range associated with data acquisition i e approximately 7 days between monitoring campaigns is likely influencing the modelling outputs corroborating for the low dynamic model efficiency e 0 table s5 supplementary information moreover the observed sensitivity of nitrification to the dynamic loading conditions is typical for the cases with low effluent bicarbonate alkalinity 50 mg caco3 l 1 fig 6c henze et al 2008 finally pronounced peaks on the simulated effluents predictions could also be related to the less developed biofilm as steady state biofilm thickness and biomass profiles were not reached under the simulated time 300 days overall considering parameter uncertainty the model was found to satisfactorily describe the experimental data capturing important trends for process understanding and further optimization 3 5 model validation the calibrated model was validated on two independent datasets the first one was a dynamic dataset from a different sbtf following a uasb reactor operated under a similar hlr 10 m3 m 2 d 1 and median olr 1 0 kg cod m 3 sponge d 1 compared to the currently monitored sbtf the second dataset concerned a sbtf operated in parallel with the experimental set up under study which was first subject to a prolonged period 300 days of limited oxygen supply and then operated under similar conditions as the sbtf considered for model calibration concerning the first validation dataset the model was able to capture the overall effluent behaviour in terms of ammonium dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations figure s6 supplementary information despite less accurate dynamic outputs e 0 fig s7 supplementary information nevertheless the simulation results present peaks of effluent inorganic carbon concentration which did not correspond with the experimental observations fig s7 c supplementary information and were related to less nitrate consumption via heterotrophic denitrification the simulated behaviour could be explained by the lack of soluble biodegradable cod which was assumed in the model as a fraction 50 of the anaerobic effluent filtered cod as measured experimentally see section 2 4 however in reality an additional source of organic carbon could be present in the form of entrapped solids in the sponge carrier which was not accounted for in the model the characterization of solids entrapment and further cod release could be included in a more detailed model however this would also lead to the need to assess flow paths in porous media requiring a more detailed at least 2 dimensional as proposed by bottero et al 2013 biofilm model and consequently increase the computational burden another aspect that may have affected a better fitting is that the specific surface area of the sponge based support material was not reported by almeida et al 2013 this is an important model parameter which directly affects the amount of biomass retained in the reactor and as such impacts biological conversion rates as for the validation on the sbtf following a prolonged period of oxygen limitation again the model was able to capture the overall effluent behaviour in terms of ammonium dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations fig s8 supplementary information the presented operational data was recorded straight after ceasing oxygen limitation and a lag period approximately first 30 days seemed to took place before the reactor regained its full oxygenation capacity it is worth mentioning that oxygen transfer dynamics in trickling filters is not yet entirely clear logan 1996 during this period less ammonium was converted due to the decreased dissolved oxygen availability which reflected in reduced inorganic carbon consumption and less nitrate formation fig s9 supplementary information such dynamics could not be captured quantitively through simulation likely due to the modelling approach with a constant oxygen mass transfer coefficient to present further evidence of the need to include inorganic carbon limitation when modelling sbtfs treating anaerobic effluents complementary simulations were performed on both validation datasets without inorganic carbon in the kinetic rate expression of aob model outputs were remarkably impacted as null effluent ammonium concentrations were predicted fig s10 supplementary information this highlights the validity of the model structure with sigmoidal kinetics for inorganic carbon limitation of aob considering calibrated parameters k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 see table 3 4 conclusions the start up and stable operation of a demo scale sponge bed trickling filter sbtf for the removal of nitrogen and residual organic carbon from anaerobically pre treated sewage was monitored for 300 days a mathematical model was developed calibrated and validated for the first time to describe mainstream nitrogen removal from anaerobically treated effluents nitrification was observed soon after the start up of the sbtf from the 20th day after the start up onwards the effluent ammonium concentrations remained stable below 10 mg n l 1 despite variations in the influent ammonium concentration 23 44 mg l 1 10 90th percentile the median ammonium removal efficiency amounted to 79 total nitrogen removal efficiency was limited to 26 a low value which is typical for fully ventilated sbtfs without effluent recirculation heterotrophic denitrification was limited by the low organic carbon content of the anaerobic effluent the limited ammonium conversion was ascribed to a lack of influent inorganic carbon as the incoming concentration median 237 mg caco3 l 1 was systematically depleted to values below the required minimum 45 mg caco3 l 1 to sustain nitrification in biofilms limitation was attributed to inorganic carbon rather than alkalinity as the ph remained constant ammonium and oxygen limitation were excluded as was inhibition by nitrite to properly describe inorganic carbon limitation in models bicarbonate as a state variable should be used to quantify inorganic carbon limitation rather than to merely indicate ph changes the need to include this state variable was confirmed through simulation demonstrating the crucial role of inorganic carbon for both buffering and as an inorganic carbon source in calibrating nitrogen conversions nitrite accumulation was not observed during the monitored period which indicates that nob activity was little affected by the inorganic carbon limitation or at least less than aob activity considering a higher inorganic carbon limitation for aob than nob is essential for modelling nitrogen conversions in sbtfs following uasb reactors for sewage treatment inorganic carbon limitation of aob was best described using sigmoidal kinetics with calibrated values k 31 mg caco3 l 1 a 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare
