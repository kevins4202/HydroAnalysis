7340,quantifying flow in rivers is fundamental to assessments of water supply water quality ecological conditions hydrological responses to storm events and geomorphological processes image based surface velocity measurements have shown promise in extending the range of discharge conditions that can be measured in the field the use of unmanned aerial systems uas in image based measurements of surface velocities has the potential to expand applications of this method thus far few investigations have assessed this potential by evaluating the accuracy and repeatability of discharge measurements using surface velocities obtained from uas this study uses large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv derived from videos captured by cameras on a uas and a fixed tripod to obtain discharge measurements at ten different stream locations in illinois usa discharge values are compared to reference values measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler a propeller meter and established stream gauges the results demonstrate the effects of uas flight height camera steadiness and leveling accuracy video sampling frequency and lspiv interrogation area size on surface velocities and show that the mean difference between fixed and uas cameras is less than 10 differences between lspiv derived and reference discharge values are generally less than 20 not systematically low or high and not related to site parameters like channel width or depth indicating that results are relatively insensitive to camera setup and image processing parameters typically required of lspiv the results also show that standard velocity indices between 0 85 and 0 9 recommended for converting surface velocities to depth averaged velocities yield reasonable discharge estimates but are best calibrated at specific sites the study recommends a basic methodology for lspiv discharge measurements using uas that is rapid cost efficient and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location pre and post processing of imagery or extensive background in image analysis and piv keywords lspiv stream gauging uas river discharge 1 introduction the monitoring of river flow is a vital component of scientific and management efforts aimed at assessment of water supply water quality ecological conditions hydrological response and channel stability together with bathymetry velocity measurements provide the basis for computations of discharge the primary metric by which river flow is quantified velocity has traditionally been measured with mechanical current meters deployed within the flow turnipseed and sauer 2010 the development and refinement of hydroacoustic instruments such as acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and acoustic doppler velocimeters which can generate data both on velocity and bathymetry have greatly enhanced measurements of discharge by decreasing the time investment of each measurement and allowing measurements in deep and fast flows yorke and oberg 2002 although the use of traditional and hydroacoustic sensors to measure velocity works well in most environments these instruments do have limitations including a considerable investment in instrumentation and the cost of labor to deploy this instrumentation the relative difficulty obtaining accurate data in rapidly changing flow environments and a minimum depth requirement for sensor deployment within the flow the development of an inexpensive method to rapidly measure discharge during challenging conditions including flash floods shallow flow in small streams or over floodplains and dangerous high velocity or contaminated flows is needed to accurately characterize water quantity over the full spectrum of hydrologic conditions one way to address these problems is with non contact image based velocity measurements techniques tauro 2016 a common non contact method is large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv particle image velocimetry was first developed for laboratory studies of fluid motion and yields accurate quantitative measurement of velocity vectors at many points in a sampling plane or volume simultaneously adrian 2005 velocity is measured by tracking the movement of particles within the fluid or in the case of lspiv on the fluid surface across sequential images e g individual video frames and velocity is derived from the displacement of particle positions between images adrian 1991 in the case of lspiv piv based measurements of surface velocity measurements are related to the depth averaged velocity using a correction factor known as the velocity index rantz 1982 when combined with information on flow geometry the velocity index relation facilitates estimates of discharge based on measurements of surface velocity lspiv has been utilized previously as a low cost method to measure discharge in rivers muste et al 2008 le coz et al 2010 dramais et al 2011 but thorough assessments of accuracy and consistency over multiple flow conditions are lacking creutin et al 2003 and dramais et al 2011 note that repeated discharge measurements with lspiv require considerably less time than measurements with hydroacoustic instruments an advantage during floods characterized by rapid changes in discharge potential limitations of lspiv velocity measurements include dependence on lighting conditions and tracer particle properties creutin et al 2003 tauro et al 2016a additionally the value of the velocity index has not been thoroughly analyzed in many field environments yet must be chosen or computed carefully because it can be a major source of error in discharge calculations le coz et al 2010 dramais et al 2011 although the potential benefits of lspiv are evident rigorous testing and continued refinement are needed before the method can be widely adopted by the scientific community in concert with the maturation of lspiv methodology the commercial availability of unmanned aerial systems uas and the use of these systems in scientific research has dramatically increased over the last several years detert and weitbrecht 2015 hugenholtz et al 2012 tauro et al 2016b detert et al 2017 lewis and park 2017 recently uas have been used to map large scale infrastructure siebert and teizer 2014 acquire surface topography data carrivick et al 2013 westoby et al 2012 detert et al 2017 survey biodiversity koh and wich 2012 and guide precision agriculture zhang and kovacs 2012 uas are well suited for use in hostile or dangerous fluvial environments mcgonigle et al 2008 and can extend applications of lspiv through greater freedom of movement and more flexible positioning of the imaging device above the surface of the water compared to fixed camera systems moreover video capture can be acquired orthogonal to the river surface eliminating the need to correct for geometric distortion in oblique images tauro et al 2014 as uas continue to increase in reliability technical capabilities and ease of use while simultaneously decreasing in price their potential use as a low cost supplement to scientific research is clear thus far the extent to which lspiv integrated with uas can be used as an accurate reliable method for measuring discharge without the need for extensive image processing and analysis has yet to be determined although all methods used to measure discharge require basic knowledge of the methodology and operating principles of the instrument turnipseed and sauer 2010 few studies have produced explicit guidelines and principles on lspiv discharge measurements obtained from uas the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of lspiv discharge measurements derived from imagery of the water surface obtained from a fixed tripod and uas achieved through a detailed comparison among lspiv hydroacoustic current meter and gauged discharge measurements at multiple field sites uas lspiv datasets are compared to tripod mounted camera lspiv datasets to assess the differences between fixed and mobile camera platforms the potential complicating effects of important setup parameters including 1 uas flight height 2 camera unsteadiness and 3 tripod and camera leveling are analyzed next the potential complicating effects of important processing parameters including 1 image sampling length and frequency and 2 piv interrogation area ia size are also investigated an additional focus of the study is the computation and comparison of velocity index coefficients for obtaining depth averaged velocity among multiple field sites the study introduces a basic methodology for lspiv discharge measurements using uas that is rapid cost efficient and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location pre and post processing of imagery or extensive background in image analysis and piv 2 methods 2 1 study sites and experimental setup thirteen paired lspiv and in channel measurements of discharge q were obtained at ten different road bridges over streams and small rivers in east central illinois usa table 1 fig 1 these sites were chosen from basic inspection of aerial imagery in google earth to ensure the bridges were safe to work on dense tree cover would not impede uas flights and the stream was not too wide or complex e g anabraching or containing in stream wood to measure with a small field team stream gauging stations operated by the united states geological survey usgs were located at two of the sites measurement campaigns were mounted on an impromptu basis in response to rainfall events both to document different flow conditions and to evaluate the rapid response potential of the method supplementary lspiv measurements were performed on 2017 06 22 and 2017 08 14 s1 and s2 to study the effects of camera setup and lspiv processing on resultant velocity and discharge channel widths ranged from 4 to 30 m during time of measurement and average flow depths ranged from a few centimeters to about two meters pine shavings manufactured for use as horse bedding served as seeding material for the lspiv surface velocity measurements this inexpensive ecologically inert and biodegradable wood material provides sufficient contrast against the dark water surface and closely tracks the flow of surface water a fixed tripod mounted camera and a uas mounted camera were used to record videos of the water surface and track the movement of particles the fixed camera was a gopro hero4 mounted on a heavy duty steel tripod placed on the bridge the uas camera an unmodified component of an off the shelf dji phantom 3 professional quadcopter was mounted on a stabilizing gimbal and operated by the remote pilot flying the uas the gopro camera was contained in waterproof housing and was operated remotely via a real time smartphone app both cameras recorded in 4 k resolution 3840 2160 pixels at 30 frames per second to allow for calibration of pixel distance to actual distance during analysis of the footage two points a known distance apart must be visible within the field of view of the camera a wooden stake topped with brightly colored duct tape was installed on each bank and the distance between two stakes was measured to the nearest centimeter the transect delineated by these endpoints was oriented roughly perpendicular to the flow direction based on visual alignment by the field crew the alignment of the fixed and mobile cameras was adjusted either manually or automatically to ensure a perpendicular or nearly perpendicular orientation of the optical axes of these instruments in relation to the water surface the motorized gimbal on the uas ensures that the camera is nearly orthogonal to the ground surface once the gimbal has been calibrated in reference to a flat surface during rapid uas movement or high winds the camera may briefly tilt to a minor degree but within fractions of a second the gimbal returns the camera to an orthogonal perspective the steel tripod was leveled on the bridge using a bubble level and the gopro camera was attached to the top of the mount and leveled visually when collecting lspiv data cameras on the tripod and uas were positioned so that both endpoints were visible after initiating recording of both cameras the field team began casting the seeding particles evenly across the water surface on the upstream side of the bridge the exact sample length varied based on evaluations of the particle density on the water surface but ensured at least 30 s of relatively high quality particle seeding was captured for velocity analysis a mean vector field is produced by computing the average of the vector fields of all individual frame comparisons therefore the lspiv velocity is a mean velocity over the entire 30 s subsample except when otherwise noted a sontek m9 river surveyor was used to collect adcp data during flows deeper than about one meter the adcp was deployed on a sontek hydroboard ii a float designed to house the equipment with one operator standing on each bank ropes were used to pull the adcp back and forth across the channel along the transect defined by the endpoints used for lspiv cross section delineation a minimum of four transits along the cross section were completed and averaged to ensure convergence to an accurate mean discharge turnipseed and sauer 2010 adcps compute water velocity in individual bins of a given height and width by measuring the frequency shift of sound emitted from the unit compared to sound returned to the unit after reflecting off small particles carried by the flow velocity and cross sectional area is computed in each measured bin and summed to compute discharge because of acoustic noise near boundaries transducer draft and beam spreading requirements the adcp cannot measure near the channel bed banks and surface in these locations standard interpolations of velocity were used to populate these locations with estimated velocity and discharge data mueller et al 2009 for further comparison during flows shallow enough to safely wade discharges were computed based on depth velocity measurements using a swoffer mechanical flow meter and wading rod with velocity measurements collected at 0 6 flow depth at defined increments typically every 0 5 m across the channel along the same cross section defined by the endpoints used for lspiv and adcp measurements buchanan and somers 1976 information on flow area was obtained either from adcp measurements of flow depth and width or from measurements of flow depth and width using the wading rod and a survey tape stretched across the transect because the identical flow area was used both for lspiv and measured discharge estimates any differences in discharge among methods is due completely to differences in the measured or estimated mean velocity for the cross section 2 2 data processing several steps were followed to produce a discharge measurement using lspiv first the fish eye effect was removed from the gopro footage with the free software package gopro studio the uas camera is rectilinear and therefore does not have fish eye distortion no additional treatment of image distortion effects was implemented for either recording device to assess the accuracy of lspiv results without extensive site preparation or image pre processing next the video was visually inspected to select a 30 s section of the video with relatively uniform dense seeding and the video was trimmed to isolate this section finally individual video frames were extracted piv processing was accomplished with pivlab a free and open source matlab based piv processing platform thielicke and stamhuis 2014 after loading frames into pivlab a frame comparison sequence must be selected after multiple tests it was determined that selecting every fifth frame rather than every frame saved significant computational time without introducing detectable error in velocity estimates in most cases once a region of interest encompassing both endpoints was selected piv analysis was performed with a first pass ia of 64 64 px with 50 overlap and a second pass with an ia of 32 x 32 px with 50 overlap these ia values are the default for pivlab and only in cases where these default values were clearly too large or too small were these parameters altered for final discharge calculation thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the lspiv analysis yields surface velocity vectors along the same transects as those for the adcp and swoffer measurements fig 2 lspiv surface velocities obtained from the tripod and uas were multiplied by an index coefficient of α 0 85 to estimate the depth averaged velocity along the transect this index value has been shown to closely approximate the depth averaged velocity for most river flows rantz 1982 costa et al 2000 discharge was computed by multiplying the indexed velocity by the flow cross sectional area obtained from adcp or swoffer measurements these discharge values were then compared with discharges obtained from adcp measurements of velocities throughout the transect and swoffer measurements of velocities at 0 6 depth besides using a standard index coefficient the uncorrected lspiv data were used to calculate an index coefficient for each site that matches the discharge computed from velocities measured with the adcp or swoffer current meter the mean and standard deviation of all calculated index coefficients were calculated these values provide a basis for comparison of site specific index values in relation to the standard index value of 0 85 3 results 3 1 setup parameters uas flight height camera movement and tripod leveling 3 1 1 uas flight height and camera movement to assess the effect of uas flight height on camera movement five videos were captured at heights of 9 4 13 7 19 8 27 4 and 35 0 m above the water surface during experiment s2 table 2 for consistency the ia was set to 64 and 32 px2 for the first and second pass respectively and the same image pre processing was done for each set of images mean velocities for the cross section derived from 30 s samples differed by a few centimeters per second depending on uas flight height table 2 the difference between the cross stream pattern of mean velocities for the set of flights and the cross stream pattern of mean velocities for individual flights was most notable for the three highest uas flights fig 3 the moderate flight height at 19 8 m above the water surface had slightly higher velocities than average between 0 and 3 m along the cross section this flight was near the mean for the set of flights between 3 and 6 2 m fig 3 the second highest flight had velocities consistently less than the mean for the set of flights analysis of the raw video shows poor particle density during this flight especially in the region between 3 and 5 m fig 3 the highest flight was 35 m above the water surface and overestimated velocities compared to mean values for the set of flights between 1 and 5 m along the cross section as height above the water surface increases the image resolution in px m decreases table 2 which means that more particles are in a single ia and the influence of any one particle on the velocity estimate decreases relative to the influence of all other particles an increase in flight height smooths the resultant velocity compared to low flight heights and has the same effect as increasing the ia size but keeping the fight height constant fig 3 because of this decrease in spatial resolution highly spatially variable locations along the cross section become smoothed and rapid changes in velocity with distance cannot be measured as accurately fig 3 at the two highest flights particle seeding was the largest source of error because error was only substantial in small lateral subsections rather than systematically throughout the cross section the decrease in spatial resolution with an increase in uas flight height also increases the effect of camera movement fig 4 table 3 camera movement δ in px frame and m s was calculated by obtaining piv velocity for a static section of the riverbank along the left side of the channel intensity patterns on the bank do not change so if the camera is perfectly still the resultant piv velocity for ias in this region should be 0 if the camera is moving the ia will shift and the resultant piv velocity in that ia represents camera movement velocity the five measurements at different heights were recorded within minutes of each other so wind conditions can be considered identical the average wind speed during the measurement period was 2 4 m s the lowest two uas flights 9 4 and 13 7 m were most strongly affected by wind and have the largest standard deviations δ in px frame σp fig 4 table 3 the uas operated under gps lock during all flights so the greater σp at lower elevations most likely resulted from enhanced wind turbulence generated by the tree canopy flanking the channel the highest three uas locations were sufficiently above the canopy to avoid its effect on gustiness and therefore were more stable fig 4 although the uas moved less with increasing altitude the effect of instability on velocities was enhanced fig 4 table 3 the σp at the highest location was 0 8 px frame compared to 4 2 px frame at the lowest location however the smaller image resolution at greater heights meant that the standard deviations of δ in m s σl were 0 089 and 0 073 m s for the lowest and highest locations respectively the increase in stability from flying above the tree canopy was offset by the decrease in image resolution at the greatest height the lowest σl was at the intermediate height and was about half 0 041 m s of the average of the other four vertical positions 0 084 m s at this field site the best altitude for obtaining lspiv velocities was an intermediate one that was above local turbulence enhancing roughness elements but also low enough to maintain a relatively high spatial resolution 3 1 2 tripod leveling potential effects of small misalignments of the camera on the tripod when attempting to orient this camera orthogonal to the water surface by eye were explored by setting up five independent repeat measurements of surface velocities during experiment s2 in each measurement the tripod was set up anew so that the camera position and orientation above the water surface was not necessarily identical between different measurements the five independent estimates of mean surface velocity were compared to estimates of surface velocity obtained from nine separate subsamples of a long data record from a sixth tripod lspiv measurement obtained during the same experiment to avoid effects of differences in particle seeding density that occur over long time periods mean velocities for each of the nine subsamples and the five independent measurements were calculated over 10 s intervals with good seeding conditions the mean surface velocities across the channel for the five independent samples closely match the mean velocities of the nine subsamples obtained from the single sample with a long record of data fig 5 the standard deviation of the mean velocities for the 5 independent measurements 0 026 m s is larger than that of the nine 10 s subsamples 0 015 m s though the total additional deviation is only 0 01 m s fig 5 the effects of differences in tripod setup on estimates of mean surface velocity are thus small in an absolute sense but might be important when overall error is already high although tripod leveling accounts for an increase in overall error it appears to be less important than other factors that could account for minor differences in surface velocity estimates among the repeated measurements and the nine subsamples these factors include changes in particle seeding density image illumination or minor changes in surface flow velocity between measurements 3 2 processing parameters sampling length and frequency and ia size 3 2 1 sampling length to assess the effects of sample length on surface velocity estimates mean velocities were computed for 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 s subsamples both for the uas and tripod measurements in experiment e1 fig 6 the velocity magnitude and pattern are similar for all subsamples for both camera setups but velocity estimates for short uas samples deviate somewhat from the 60 s velocity estimates the lower stability of the uas compared to the tripod probably is responsible for the decreased precision at short sample lengths nevertheless the short subsamples are still within 0 02 m s of the full 60 s mean throughout the entire cross section the uas and tripod measurements were obtained during the same 60 s period which was estimated to within 1 s by visually comparing events on the videos while the uas and tripod 60 s velocities are similar certain regions along the cross section differ slightly between the two methods fig 7 the mean velocity for the uas method was 0 24 m s and 0 23 m s for the tripod the average difference between the methods was 0 02 m s and the maximum difference at any location along the transect was 0 05 m s because the methods deployed cameras at slightly different heights the interrogation area set to 80 and 40 px2 for the first and second passes respectively for both methods is not the same size when processing each video the ia size effect together with potential image quality differences such as different shadow or sunlight reflection based on slightly different camera angles and locations is responsible for the slight difference in the pattern of mean surface velocities between the methods to assess the interaction between sample duration and particle seeding seven 30 s subsamples were selected from a 210 s video captured using the tripod during experiment s2 the same process was also performed for a 120 s tripod video during experiment a1 which resulted in four 30 s subsamples in both cases the long sample was chosen during a period when particle seeding density was deemed high as determined by visual inspection of seeding coverage throughout the video image flow during experiment a1 had a mean velocity of 0 12 m s was similar in magnitude to experiment s2 0 16 m s but had considerably more transverse variation in velocities than experiment s2 because of the presence of large rocks in the center of the channel despite the more complicated pattern of transverse velocities in experiment a1 surface velocities derived from different 30 s subsamples were more consistent across the channel than surface velocities for the s2 experiment fig 8 during experiment a1 mean surface velocities for all four 30 s subsamples were within 0 03 m s of the 120 s mean surface velocity at all points along the cross section in experiment s2 all seven 30 s subsamples exhibit similar patterns of mean velocities along the cross section but differ from the 210 s mean by as much as 0 08 m s at some locations fig 8 in addition local mean velocity estimates among the subsamples differ by as much as 0 1 m s such as the second and fifth subsamples at 3 m along the cross section in both cases the camera did not move appreciably during the measurement most likely variation among 30 s subsamples reflects changes in seeding density as changes in image illumination were not noticeable and variability in mean velocity of the flow was probably minor 3 2 2 sampling frequency initial experiments and previously published research lewis and rhoads 2015 indicate that long intervals between images can influence values of velocity derived from piv adrian 2005 kantoush et al 2011 as the time between image frames increases i e sampling frequency decreases it becomes more difficult to accurately calculate displacement between particle patterns because particles travel a greater distance for a longer time between two frames the intensity pattern that is interrogated in the first image may change as particles within the pattern move with slightly different velocities the result is an increase in the percentage of spurious and inaccurate vectors and a decrease in the quality of velocity estimates with decreasing sampling frequency an additional effect of frame sampling frequency is the interaction between sampling frequency and any unintended frequency characteristics of the camera e g movement in response to wind or the flow itself e g surface waves during experiment s1 lspiv measurements were conducted when mean wind velocities ranged from 3 3 m s to 5 4 m s with gusts to nearly 10 m s both the tripod mount and uas appeared to be stable despite this high wind and measurements proceeded as normal no obvious adverse impacts of high wind on lspiv quality were noticed by the field crew during the measurement yet in the data processing stage it became evident that the high winds had formed small surface waves that propagated upstream while particles moved downstream fig 9 pivlab could not successfully track the particles because of the influence of these waves no image pre processing available in the program could overcome the problem and the resultant velocities recorded the upstream movement of the waves rather than the downstream particle movement this problem affected all data in experiment s1 so the entire field campaign for that day was unusable additional analysis revealed that resultant velocity vectors were strongly affected by the image sampling frequency when every frame and every fourth frame were extracted the upstream movement of the waves was captured by the piv algorithm the resultant vectors pointed upstream and the poor quality of velocities was obvious fig 10 however when every eighth frame was used the surface wave movement resulted in an apparent downstream velocity that appeared to be a realistic measurement in the absence of the waves fig 10 the downstream velocity however was produced not by the downstream flow of water but by the propagation of waves moving upstream into the downstream portion of each ia thus if a sampling frequency of every eighth frame initially had been chosen the resultant velocities might have been assumed to be valid even though these values are an artifact of the interaction between wave frequency and sampling frequency 3 2 3 ia size initial tests revealed that discharge calculations were not adversely affected by increasing the size of the ia above the default value of 64 px2 but decreased in accuracy compared to reference values when the ia size was decreased below the default value by decreasing the size of the ia and gridding the surface more densely a larger number of areas with insufficient seeding is produced this effect results in poor correlation between frames and velocity vectors that are not representative of surface flow and the effect is amplified when particle seeding is inconsistent or sparse in experiment s2 ia sizes varied from 84 and 42 px2 120 and 60 px2 and 180 and 90 px2 for the first and second passes respectively particle widths at this camera height were between 5 and 10 px this field campaign resulted in some inconsistency of velocity estimates for 30 s subsamples of the 210 s sample fig 7 even though the setup was constant throughout the sample at the lowest ia size velocity estimates for 30 s subsamples scatter around means for the 210 s sample fig 11 as the ia increases the transverse distribution of velocities becomes smoother and the pattern collapses towards the long term mean velocities indicating that much of the variation in the velocity pattern during the low ia extraction is caused by local areas of sparse seeding fig 11 analysis of the videos reveals that the lowest density seeding occurred during the second 30 s subsample which still shows low biased velocities when processed at the largest ia setting 3 3 lspiv and reference measurement comparison comparison among methods shows the accuracy of tripod and uas lspiv estimates of discharge using a standard velocity index of 0 85 compared to measured discharges from the adcp propeller current meter or stream gauge tables 4 and 5 missing data represent an instance where a method was unsuitable for use the propeller meter cannot be used in extremely low flows 10 cm or in flows that are too deep to safely wade 1 3 m the adcp can only be used in flows deeper than about 1 m uas data are missing at locations where use of the uas was prohibited such when the field site lies within restricted airspace e g site f lspiv discharge measurements using the uas and tripod are similar with a mean difference of 10 between the two techniques the difference is only 7 excluding experiment i1 in which a large region of the water surface was covered by intense sunlight reflection and severely degraded the tripod measurement of surface velocities this small difference between uas and tripod measurements suggests that the fixed platform of the tripod offers little or no systematic advantage in quality over the use of uas though the small number of samples preclude the use of statistical tests to determine significance in only one experiment experiment i1 the sunspot compromised measurement did uas based and tripod based estimates of discharge differ by 12 the adcp appears to provide the most reliable estimates for comparison with the lspiv approach table 5 the mean absolute value error percentage of all lspiv estimates i e both tripod and uas measurements of discharge when compared to the adcp was 10 the disparity between all lspiv discharge estimates and propeller meter measurements was 19 in only two cases c1 and e2 did the discharge estimated from the lspiv differ from the measurement provided by the adcp by 15 or greater table 5 for comparison the average difference between the adcp and propeller meter measurements was 20 however in only five experiments were both measurement techniques used and experiment a1 had almost 50 error between the adcp and propeller meter measurements of discharge large rocks about ½ flow depth in diameter upstream of the cross section in experiment a1 likely caused deviation from a log linear velocity profile and resulted in the poor propeller meter result excluding this experiment the adcp and propeller meter measurements had an average difference of 11 a 20 difference between discharge measurements is large but not atypical of comparisons between and even within measurements with other methodologies di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and is similar to errors expected in post flood indirect discharge measurement techniques benson and dalrymple 1967 turnipseed and sauer 2010 in experiments at a gauged site discharge measurements were also compared directly to the usgs stream gauge the mean lspiv error in comparison to usgs gauges at these sites was 23 while gauged measurements are typically reliable lspiv measurements differ the most from gauged estimates of discharge table 4 table 5 the good agreement between the lspiv value and other estimates of discharge for measurements at the salt fork river despite the 20 error in comparison to the gauge data experiments b1 b3 b5 and b6 suggests that the rating curve for this site may be less accurate at certain stages similarly the 58 difference in discharge between the lspiv and gauge in experiment f1 suggests that this gauge might not be accurate for very low flows other than the outlier low flow in experiment f1 no strong relationship is evident between total discharge and accuracy table 5 to assess the variation of velocity indices with respect to flow conditions and field sites calibrated velocity indices were determined that equate lspiv discharge exactly with measured values of discharge table 6 the average calibrated velocity index not including experiments a1 for both techniques or i1 for the tripod for all measurements was 0 93 with a standard deviation of 0 23 the average indices for just uas and just tripod measurements were 0 90 and 1 00 with standard deviations of 0 13 and 0 35 respectively excluding the gauged estimates of discharge which are least reliable because these estimates are not measured directly but are determined from a rating curve the average velocity index for the lspiv methods is 0 88 with a standard deviation of 0 11 table 6 calibrated velocity indices do not appear to be correlated with the site specific hydraulic parameters of mean depth mean velocity or channel width fig 12 in addition calibrated indices are not related to total discharge there appears to be no discernable systematic relationships between calibrated velocity indices and lspiv method uas or tripod or between calibrated velocity indices and each reference discharge measurement method thus no systematic error based on measurement technique or field conditions are likely and the error between lspiv and reference methods appears to be random and local 4 discussion the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of basic lspiv methods using inexpensive unmodified consumer grade uas for estimating discharge in rivers although using uas to obtain river surface velocity and discharge has been documented and is maturing detert and weitbrecht 2015 tauro et al 2016a b detert et al 2017 relatively few studies have examined potential sources of setup and processing error and the effects of these errors on estimated discharges particle seeding density effects melling 1997 kim 2006 camera movement lewis and rhoads 2015 lens effects and image rectification hauet et al 2009 tauro et al 2014 lighting and other environmental conditions kantoush et al 2011 and the efficacy of a simple velocity index to transform surface velocity to depth averaged velocity muste et al 2011 are all issues that have received significant attention in the literature and have only begun to be addressed in specific cases while the accuracy and repeatability of discharge estimates in rivers are clearly affected by these problems the results of this study indicate that many intricate steps typically taken to improve lspiv data quality might not be needed to obtain reasonable and consistent discharge estimates errors between uas and fixed lspiv in comparison to reference methods in this study appear to be dominated by random and local effects rather than systematic factors this relatively low sensitivity to setup and processing parameters implies that simple rapid field mobilizations of lspiv even by those inexperienced in its methodology can be used to obtain reasonable estimates of discharge in situations where the use of traditional measurement methods is difficult muste et al 2008 if basic tenants of lspiv analysis are followed estimates of discharge are accurate compared to reference measurement techniques repeat tests of the simple lspiv setup resulted in only a small intra measurement variability this intra measurement variability is within a similar range reported for other measurement techniques di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and is less important to overall accuracy than the quality of particle seeding kim 2006 experiment s2 exemplifies the importance of particle seeding quality the videos visually appeared to have consistent particle seeding flow was slow and subcritical and the channel bed was made up of sand and gravel without large roughness elements such as boulders however the 30 s subsamples of a 210 s long sample were variable and only improved by increasing the size of the ia i e decreasing the spatial resolution of the measurements particle seeding density will be especially problematic when the flow is not intentionally seeded in these cases large scale particle tracking velocimetry lsptv could outperform lspiv and should be considered tauro 2016 differences in mean velocities along a cross section with uas flight height demonstrate the importance of the interplay among camera stability image resolution and particle seeding each of these factors is not consistent among flights at different times and at different heights and each can influence discharge estimates among these factors flight stability is less important because the running mean of camera movement consistently decreases to an average of only 0 007 m s during the five flight heights in experiment s2 this error is insignificant compared to the measured mean velocities along the cross section but could become important when camera movement is very high or when measured velocity is very low under 0 1 m s image resolution will always decrease with uas height so it is controlled in part by the operator although discharge estimates in this study were obtained with un rectified imagery camera locations and heights above the water surface that were not predefined and at reaches that had not been previously surveyed the velocity index values were close to the typically assumed value of 0 85 rantz 1982 most of the study reaches were generally straight at and upstream of the measurement cross section and had simple trapezoidal morphologies and near uniform sediment characteristics these factors should result in nearly uniform flow and likely explain why the velocity index values did not vary greatly from 0 85 gauging stations are usually installed or measured in simple reaches to minimize complex 3d flow within the measurement cross section although lspiv can be used in complex reaches where hydroacoustic methods may be challenging to deploy the variability of index velocity in complex flows has not been thoroughly documented muste et al 2008 the results of this study also suggest that rare flow events might be better measured with uas and lspiv than with existing gauges or indirect methods which could improve understanding of extreme flood and low flow events and add to the range of flows for which the gauge is calibrated although any discharge measurement method is complicated during an extreme flood due to lack of site access and safety concerns the use of uas and lspiv substantially reduces these complications more research is needed to assess how velocity index values might systematically change in different flow conditions reach morphologies and channel or floodplain types and if adjustments can be made to the index value based on external measurements that do not require in stream velocity measurements one of the major drawbacks of current lspiv technology is the inability to assess velocity and resultant discharge values in the field in real time hydroacoustic and mechanical flow measurement devices typically yield estimates of discharge immediately following a measurement permitting assessment of accuracy at the time of measurement the need for processing of imagery in lspiv hampers real time assessment of discharges but recent research is beginning to investigate and address this challenge thumser et al 2017 in the meantime some experience in measuring discharge using lspiv methods is needed to evaluate when severe sunlight reflection high winds or poor seeding quality might affect data quality finally although this study relied on reference measurements to obtain channel bathymetry significant advances in methods to obtain channel bathymetry remotely have emerged including methods using uas marcus and fonstad 2008 tamminga et al 2015 detert et al 2017 much of this research is focused on lidar mckean et al 2009 legleiter 2012 or photogrammetric lejot et al 2007 detert et al 2017 methods which require clear water conditions that are unlikely to occur in many sediment laden river flows however laboratory based research relating surface turbulence characteristics to local depth appears to be a promising way to obtain bathymetry in flows that obscure the channel bed johnson and cowen 2016 2017 although it is unknown how these methods perform under less controllable field conditions future studies should continue to focus on improving the ability to extract channel bed and bank characteristics remotely 5 conclusions this study has shown that if important minimum requirements are met lspiv based measurements of surface velocities using uas can produce accurate estimates of discharge in rivers basic lspiv setups using either fixed platforms or uas can be deployed rapidly by a small research team and by those who are not experts in photographic or lspiv principles the accuracy repeatability and low cost of this methodology indicates that lspiv methods should appeal to a wide variety of scientists and practitioners working on a multitude of studies that require or benefit from discharge information the recommended minimum steps to produce accurate lspiv velocity include 1 define a measurement cross section perpendicular to the mean flow and measure the distance between the endpoints 2 obtain bathymetry along the cross section and if desired and possible a reference discharge using a standard discharge measurement procedure 3 ensure the camera is recording while nearly orthogonal to the water surface by leveling a tripod or using a uas with a gimbal 4 obtain at least 30 s of video with relatively high quality particle seeding density and if possible obtain longer or multiple videos 5 use default open source piv processing parameters e g pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 on a subset of video frames which can be downsampled to lower sampling frequencies to save time 6 assess the influence of sampling frequency and interrogation area size and particle seeding as these variables are most likely to affect the resultant velocity if necessary vary these parameters and analyze subsets of videos to assess intra measurement variability 7 extract velocities along the measured cross section and multiply by a standard or calibrated index velocity multiply the cross sectional area of the flow measured during or after the event by the mean velocity in the cross section to obtain discharge results of this study support conclusions from previous work that lspiv serves as a cost effective method of measuring discharge discharges estimated from surface velocities obtained from a fixed tripod and uas differed little indicating that the use of uas does not limit the reliability or accuracy of measurements and can significantly enhance existing lspiv methods this study also showed that uas based lspiv is suitable for a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions issues that limit the use of uas are primarily related to weather conditions such as excessive winds or situations in which operation of uas would be illegal or a disturbance the width of a river may also be a limiting factor in that flight heights great enough to see the entire width of a large river may lead to substantial loss of resolution perhaps to the extent that seeding materials may no longer be identifiable in the image a piecemeal approach to estimating velocities across large rivers using low flying uas may be possible but was not evaluated in this study future studies should be concerned with an empirical determination of the velocity index given its importance in computing discharge from surface velocity measurements an index of α 0 7 to α 0 95 serves as a suitable baseline and the average value among experiments in this study derived from direct measurements of discharge was α 0 88 more work is required to determine how particle seeding density different automatic or manual particle casting methods flow characteristics and lspiv parameters such as time series length and ia size affect the accuracy and consistency of extracted velocities and discharges future development of easy to use programs that can apply both piv and ptv is recommended to help bring image based gauging to a wider audience and increase its potential accuracy these dual capabilities should be developed together with image based gauging equipment and techniques that allow the researcher to view velocity and

7340,quantifying flow in rivers is fundamental to assessments of water supply water quality ecological conditions hydrological responses to storm events and geomorphological processes image based surface velocity measurements have shown promise in extending the range of discharge conditions that can be measured in the field the use of unmanned aerial systems uas in image based measurements of surface velocities has the potential to expand applications of this method thus far few investigations have assessed this potential by evaluating the accuracy and repeatability of discharge measurements using surface velocities obtained from uas this study uses large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv derived from videos captured by cameras on a uas and a fixed tripod to obtain discharge measurements at ten different stream locations in illinois usa discharge values are compared to reference values measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler a propeller meter and established stream gauges the results demonstrate the effects of uas flight height camera steadiness and leveling accuracy video sampling frequency and lspiv interrogation area size on surface velocities and show that the mean difference between fixed and uas cameras is less than 10 differences between lspiv derived and reference discharge values are generally less than 20 not systematically low or high and not related to site parameters like channel width or depth indicating that results are relatively insensitive to camera setup and image processing parameters typically required of lspiv the results also show that standard velocity indices between 0 85 and 0 9 recommended for converting surface velocities to depth averaged velocities yield reasonable discharge estimates but are best calibrated at specific sites the study recommends a basic methodology for lspiv discharge measurements using uas that is rapid cost efficient and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location pre and post processing of imagery or extensive background in image analysis and piv keywords lspiv stream gauging uas river discharge 1 introduction the monitoring of river flow is a vital component of scientific and management efforts aimed at assessment of water supply water quality ecological conditions hydrological response and channel stability together with bathymetry velocity measurements provide the basis for computations of discharge the primary metric by which river flow is quantified velocity has traditionally been measured with mechanical current meters deployed within the flow turnipseed and sauer 2010 the development and refinement of hydroacoustic instruments such as acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and acoustic doppler velocimeters which can generate data both on velocity and bathymetry have greatly enhanced measurements of discharge by decreasing the time investment of each measurement and allowing measurements in deep and fast flows yorke and oberg 2002 although the use of traditional and hydroacoustic sensors to measure velocity works well in most environments these instruments do have limitations including a considerable investment in instrumentation and the cost of labor to deploy this instrumentation the relative difficulty obtaining accurate data in rapidly changing flow environments and a minimum depth requirement for sensor deployment within the flow the development of an inexpensive method to rapidly measure discharge during challenging conditions including flash floods shallow flow in small streams or over floodplains and dangerous high velocity or contaminated flows is needed to accurately characterize water quantity over the full spectrum of hydrologic conditions one way to address these problems is with non contact image based velocity measurements techniques tauro 2016 a common non contact method is large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv particle image velocimetry was first developed for laboratory studies of fluid motion and yields accurate quantitative measurement of velocity vectors at many points in a sampling plane or volume simultaneously adrian 2005 velocity is measured by tracking the movement of particles within the fluid or in the case of lspiv on the fluid surface across sequential images e g individual video frames and velocity is derived from the displacement of particle positions between images adrian 1991 in the case of lspiv piv based measurements of surface velocity measurements are related to the depth averaged velocity using a correction factor known as the velocity index rantz 1982 when combined with information on flow geometry the velocity index relation facilitates estimates of discharge based on measurements of surface velocity lspiv has been utilized previously as a low cost method to measure discharge in rivers muste et al 2008 le coz et al 2010 dramais et al 2011 but thorough assessments of accuracy and consistency over multiple flow conditions are lacking creutin et al 2003 and dramais et al 2011 note that repeated discharge measurements with lspiv require considerably less time than measurements with hydroacoustic instruments an advantage during floods characterized by rapid changes in discharge potential limitations of lspiv velocity measurements include dependence on lighting conditions and tracer particle properties creutin et al 2003 tauro et al 2016a additionally the value of the velocity index has not been thoroughly analyzed in many field environments yet must be chosen or computed carefully because it can be a major source of error in discharge calculations le coz et al 2010 dramais et al 2011 although the potential benefits of lspiv are evident rigorous testing and continued refinement are needed before the method can be widely adopted by the scientific community in concert with the maturation of lspiv methodology the commercial availability of unmanned aerial systems uas and the use of these systems in scientific research has dramatically increased over the last several years detert and weitbrecht 2015 hugenholtz et al 2012 tauro et al 2016b detert et al 2017 lewis and park 2017 recently uas have been used to map large scale infrastructure siebert and teizer 2014 acquire surface topography data carrivick et al 2013 westoby et al 2012 detert et al 2017 survey biodiversity koh and wich 2012 and guide precision agriculture zhang and kovacs 2012 uas are well suited for use in hostile or dangerous fluvial environments mcgonigle et al 2008 and can extend applications of lspiv through greater freedom of movement and more flexible positioning of the imaging device above the surface of the water compared to fixed camera systems moreover video capture can be acquired orthogonal to the river surface eliminating the need to correct for geometric distortion in oblique images tauro et al 2014 as uas continue to increase in reliability technical capabilities and ease of use while simultaneously decreasing in price their potential use as a low cost supplement to scientific research is clear thus far the extent to which lspiv integrated with uas can be used as an accurate reliable method for measuring discharge without the need for extensive image processing and analysis has yet to be determined although all methods used to measure discharge require basic knowledge of the methodology and operating principles of the instrument turnipseed and sauer 2010 few studies have produced explicit guidelines and principles on lspiv discharge measurements obtained from uas the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of lspiv discharge measurements derived from imagery of the water surface obtained from a fixed tripod and uas achieved through a detailed comparison among lspiv hydroacoustic current meter and gauged discharge measurements at multiple field sites uas lspiv datasets are compared to tripod mounted camera lspiv datasets to assess the differences between fixed and mobile camera platforms the potential complicating effects of important setup parameters including 1 uas flight height 2 camera unsteadiness and 3 tripod and camera leveling are analyzed next the potential complicating effects of important processing parameters including 1 image sampling length and frequency and 2 piv interrogation area ia size are also investigated an additional focus of the study is the computation and comparison of velocity index coefficients for obtaining depth averaged velocity among multiple field sites the study introduces a basic methodology for lspiv discharge measurements using uas that is rapid cost efficient and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location pre and post processing of imagery or extensive background in image analysis and piv 2 methods 2 1 study sites and experimental setup thirteen paired lspiv and in channel measurements of discharge q were obtained at ten different road bridges over streams and small rivers in east central illinois usa table 1 fig 1 these sites were chosen from basic inspection of aerial imagery in google earth to ensure the bridges were safe to work on dense tree cover would not impede uas flights and the stream was not too wide or complex e g anabraching or containing in stream wood to measure with a small field team stream gauging stations operated by the united states geological survey usgs were located at two of the sites measurement campaigns were mounted on an impromptu basis in response to rainfall events both to document different flow conditions and to evaluate the rapid response potential of the method supplementary lspiv measurements were performed on 2017 06 22 and 2017 08 14 s1 and s2 to study the effects of camera setup and lspiv processing on resultant velocity and discharge channel widths ranged from 4 to 30 m during time of measurement and average flow depths ranged from a few centimeters to about two meters pine shavings manufactured for use as horse bedding served as seeding material for the lspiv surface velocity measurements this inexpensive ecologically inert and biodegradable wood material provides sufficient contrast against the dark water surface and closely tracks the flow of surface water a fixed tripod mounted camera and a uas mounted camera were used to record videos of the water surface and track the movement of particles the fixed camera was a gopro hero4 mounted on a heavy duty steel tripod placed on the bridge the uas camera an unmodified component of an off the shelf dji phantom 3 professional quadcopter was mounted on a stabilizing gimbal and operated by the remote pilot flying the uas the gopro camera was contained in waterproof housing and was operated remotely via a real time smartphone app both cameras recorded in 4 k resolution 3840 2160 pixels at 30 frames per second to allow for calibration of pixel distance to actual distance during analysis of the footage two points a known distance apart must be visible within the field of view of the camera a wooden stake topped with brightly colored duct tape was installed on each bank and the distance between two stakes was measured to the nearest centimeter the transect delineated by these endpoints was oriented roughly perpendicular to the flow direction based on visual alignment by the field crew the alignment of the fixed and mobile cameras was adjusted either manually or automatically to ensure a perpendicular or nearly perpendicular orientation of the optical axes of these instruments in relation to the water surface the motorized gimbal on the uas ensures that the camera is nearly orthogonal to the ground surface once the gimbal has been calibrated in reference to a flat surface during rapid uas movement or high winds the camera may briefly tilt to a minor degree but within fractions of a second the gimbal returns the camera to an orthogonal perspective the steel tripod was leveled on the bridge using a bubble level and the gopro camera was attached to the top of the mount and leveled visually when collecting lspiv data cameras on the tripod and uas were positioned so that both endpoints were visible after initiating recording of both cameras the field team began casting the seeding particles evenly across the water surface on the upstream side of the bridge the exact sample length varied based on evaluations of the particle density on the water surface but ensured at least 30 s of relatively high quality particle seeding was captured for velocity analysis a mean vector field is produced by computing the average of the vector fields of all individual frame comparisons therefore the lspiv velocity is a mean velocity over the entire 30 s subsample except when otherwise noted a sontek m9 river surveyor was used to collect adcp data during flows deeper than about one meter the adcp was deployed on a sontek hydroboard ii a float designed to house the equipment with one operator standing on each bank ropes were used to pull the adcp back and forth across the channel along the transect defined by the endpoints used for lspiv cross section delineation a minimum of four transits along the cross section were completed and averaged to ensure convergence to an accurate mean discharge turnipseed and sauer 2010 adcps compute water velocity in individual bins of a given height and width by measuring the frequency shift of sound emitted from the unit compared to sound returned to the unit after reflecting off small particles carried by the flow velocity and cross sectional area is computed in each measured bin and summed to compute discharge because of acoustic noise near boundaries transducer draft and beam spreading requirements the adcp cannot measure near the channel bed banks and surface in these locations standard interpolations of velocity were used to populate these locations with estimated velocity and discharge data mueller et al 2009 for further comparison during flows shallow enough to safely wade discharges were computed based on depth velocity measurements using a swoffer mechanical flow meter and wading rod with velocity measurements collected at 0 6 flow depth at defined increments typically every 0 5 m across the channel along the same cross section defined by the endpoints used for lspiv and adcp measurements buchanan and somers 1976 information on flow area was obtained either from adcp measurements of flow depth and width or from measurements of flow depth and width using the wading rod and a survey tape stretched across the transect because the identical flow area was used both for lspiv and measured discharge estimates any differences in discharge among methods is due completely to differences in the measured or estimated mean velocity for the cross section 2 2 data processing several steps were followed to produce a discharge measurement using lspiv first the fish eye effect was removed from the gopro footage with the free software package gopro studio the uas camera is rectilinear and therefore does not have fish eye distortion no additional treatment of image distortion effects was implemented for either recording device to assess the accuracy of lspiv results without extensive site preparation or image pre processing next the video was visually inspected to select a 30 s section of the video with relatively uniform dense seeding and the video was trimmed to isolate this section finally individual video frames were extracted piv processing was accomplished with pivlab a free and open source matlab based piv processing platform thielicke and stamhuis 2014 after loading frames into pivlab a frame comparison sequence must be selected after multiple tests it was determined that selecting every fifth frame rather than every frame saved significant computational time without introducing detectable error in velocity estimates in most cases once a region of interest encompassing both endpoints was selected piv analysis was performed with a first pass ia of 64 64 px with 50 overlap and a second pass with an ia of 32 x 32 px with 50 overlap these ia values are the default for pivlab and only in cases where these default values were clearly too large or too small were these parameters altered for final discharge calculation thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the lspiv analysis yields surface velocity vectors along the same transects as those for the adcp and swoffer measurements fig 2 lspiv surface velocities obtained from the tripod and uas were multiplied by an index coefficient of α 0 85 to estimate the depth averaged velocity along the transect this index value has been shown to closely approximate the depth averaged velocity for most river flows rantz 1982 costa et al 2000 discharge was computed by multiplying the indexed velocity by the flow cross sectional area obtained from adcp or swoffer measurements these discharge values were then compared with discharges obtained from adcp measurements of velocities throughout the transect and swoffer measurements of velocities at 0 6 depth besides using a standard index coefficient the uncorrected lspiv data were used to calculate an index coefficient for each site that matches the discharge computed from velocities measured with the adcp or swoffer current meter the mean and standard deviation of all calculated index coefficients were calculated these values provide a basis for comparison of site specific index values in relation to the standard index value of 0 85 3 results 3 1 setup parameters uas flight height camera movement and tripod leveling 3 1 1 uas flight height and camera movement to assess the effect of uas flight height on camera movement five videos were captured at heights of 9 4 13 7 19 8 27 4 and 35 0 m above the water surface during experiment s2 table 2 for consistency the ia was set to 64 and 32 px2 for the first and second pass respectively and the same image pre processing was done for each set of images mean velocities for the cross section derived from 30 s samples differed by a few centimeters per second depending on uas flight height table 2 the difference between the cross stream pattern of mean velocities for the set of flights and the cross stream pattern of mean velocities for individual flights was most notable for the three highest uas flights fig 3 the moderate flight height at 19 8 m above the water surface had slightly higher velocities than average between 0 and 3 m along the cross section this flight was near the mean for the set of flights between 3 and 6 2 m fig 3 the second highest flight had velocities consistently less than the mean for the set of flights analysis of the raw video shows poor particle density during this flight especially in the region between 3 and 5 m fig 3 the highest flight was 35 m above the water surface and overestimated velocities compared to mean values for the set of flights between 1 and 5 m along the cross section as height above the water surface increases the image resolution in px m decreases table 2 which means that more particles are in a single ia and the influence of any one particle on the velocity estimate decreases relative to the influence of all other particles an increase in flight height smooths the resultant velocity compared to low flight heights and has the same effect as increasing the ia size but keeping the fight height constant fig 3 because of this decrease in spatial resolution highly spatially variable locations along the cross section become smoothed and rapid changes in velocity with distance cannot be measured as accurately fig 3 at the two highest flights particle seeding was the largest source of error because error was only substantial in small lateral subsections rather than systematically throughout the cross section the decrease in spatial resolution with an increase in uas flight height also increases the effect of camera movement fig 4 table 3 camera movement δ in px frame and m s was calculated by obtaining piv velocity for a static section of the riverbank along the left side of the channel intensity patterns on the bank do not change so if the camera is perfectly still the resultant piv velocity for ias in this region should be 0 if the camera is moving the ia will shift and the resultant piv velocity in that ia represents camera movement velocity the five measurements at different heights were recorded within minutes of each other so wind conditions can be considered identical the average wind speed during the measurement period was 2 4 m s the lowest two uas flights 9 4 and 13 7 m were most strongly affected by wind and have the largest standard deviations δ in px frame σp fig 4 table 3 the uas operated under gps lock during all flights so the greater σp at lower elevations most likely resulted from enhanced wind turbulence generated by the tree canopy flanking the channel the highest three uas locations were sufficiently above the canopy to avoid its effect on gustiness and therefore were more stable fig 4 although the uas moved less with increasing altitude the effect of instability on velocities was enhanced fig 4 table 3 the σp at the highest location was 0 8 px frame compared to 4 2 px frame at the lowest location however the smaller image resolution at greater heights meant that the standard deviations of δ in m s σl were 0 089 and 0 073 m s for the lowest and highest locations respectively the increase in stability from flying above the tree canopy was offset by the decrease in image resolution at the greatest height the lowest σl was at the intermediate height and was about half 0 041 m s of the average of the other four vertical positions 0 084 m s at this field site the best altitude for obtaining lspiv velocities was an intermediate one that was above local turbulence enhancing roughness elements but also low enough to maintain a relatively high spatial resolution 3 1 2 tripod leveling potential effects of small misalignments of the camera on the tripod when attempting to orient this camera orthogonal to the water surface by eye were explored by setting up five independent repeat measurements of surface velocities during experiment s2 in each measurement the tripod was set up anew so that the camera position and orientation above the water surface was not necessarily identical between different measurements the five independent estimates of mean surface velocity were compared to estimates of surface velocity obtained from nine separate subsamples of a long data record from a sixth tripod lspiv measurement obtained during the same experiment to avoid effects of differences in particle seeding density that occur over long time periods mean velocities for each of the nine subsamples and the five independent measurements were calculated over 10 s intervals with good seeding conditions the mean surface velocities across the channel for the five independent samples closely match the mean velocities of the nine subsamples obtained from the single sample with a long record of data fig 5 the standard deviation of the mean velocities for the 5 independent measurements 0 026 m s is larger than that of the nine 10 s subsamples 0 015 m s though the total additional deviation is only 0 01 m s fig 5 the effects of differences in tripod setup on estimates of mean surface velocity are thus small in an absolute sense but might be important when overall error is already high although tripod leveling accounts for an increase in overall error it appears to be less important than other factors that could account for minor differences in surface velocity estimates among the repeated measurements and the nine subsamples these factors include changes in particle seeding density image illumination or minor changes in surface flow velocity between measurements 3 2 processing parameters sampling length and frequency and ia size 3 2 1 sampling length to assess the effects of sample length on surface velocity estimates mean velocities were computed for 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 s subsamples both for the uas and tripod measurements in experiment e1 fig 6 the velocity magnitude and pattern are similar for all subsamples for both camera setups but velocity estimates for short uas samples deviate somewhat from the 60 s velocity estimates the lower stability of the uas compared to the tripod probably is responsible for the decreased precision at short sample lengths nevertheless the short subsamples are still within 0 02 m s of the full 60 s mean throughout the entire cross section the uas and tripod measurements were obtained during the same 60 s period which was estimated to within 1 s by visually comparing events on the videos while the uas and tripod 60 s velocities are similar certain regions along the cross section differ slightly between the two methods fig 7 the mean velocity for the uas method was 0 24 m s and 0 23 m s for the tripod the average difference between the methods was 0 02 m s and the maximum difference at any location along the transect was 0 05 m s because the methods deployed cameras at slightly different heights the interrogation area set to 80 and 40 px2 for the first and second passes respectively for both methods is not the same size when processing each video the ia size effect together with potential image quality differences such as different shadow or sunlight reflection based on slightly different camera angles and locations is responsible for the slight difference in the pattern of mean surface velocities between the methods to assess the interaction between sample duration and particle seeding seven 30 s subsamples were selected from a 210 s video captured using the tripod during experiment s2 the same process was also performed for a 120 s tripod video during experiment a1 which resulted in four 30 s subsamples in both cases the long sample was chosen during a period when particle seeding density was deemed high as determined by visual inspection of seeding coverage throughout the video image flow during experiment a1 had a mean velocity of 0 12 m s was similar in magnitude to experiment s2 0 16 m s but had considerably more transverse variation in velocities than experiment s2 because of the presence of large rocks in the center of the channel despite the more complicated pattern of transverse velocities in experiment a1 surface velocities derived from different 30 s subsamples were more consistent across the channel than surface velocities for the s2 experiment fig 8 during experiment a1 mean surface velocities for all four 30 s subsamples were within 0 03 m s of the 120 s mean surface velocity at all points along the cross section in experiment s2 all seven 30 s subsamples exhibit similar patterns of mean velocities along the cross section but differ from the 210 s mean by as much as 0 08 m s at some locations fig 8 in addition local mean velocity estimates among the subsamples differ by as much as 0 1 m s such as the second and fifth subsamples at 3 m along the cross section in both cases the camera did not move appreciably during the measurement most likely variation among 30 s subsamples reflects changes in seeding density as changes in image illumination were not noticeable and variability in mean velocity of the flow was probably minor 3 2 2 sampling frequency initial experiments and previously published research lewis and rhoads 2015 indicate that long intervals between images can influence values of velocity derived from piv adrian 2005 kantoush et al 2011 as the time between image frames increases i e sampling frequency decreases it becomes more difficult to accurately calculate displacement between particle patterns because particles travel a greater distance for a longer time between two frames the intensity pattern that is interrogated in the first image may change as particles within the pattern move with slightly different velocities the result is an increase in the percentage of spurious and inaccurate vectors and a decrease in the quality of velocity estimates with decreasing sampling frequency an additional effect of frame sampling frequency is the interaction between sampling frequency and any unintended frequency characteristics of the camera e g movement in response to wind or the flow itself e g surface waves during experiment s1 lspiv measurements were conducted when mean wind velocities ranged from 3 3 m s to 5 4 m s with gusts to nearly 10 m s both the tripod mount and uas appeared to be stable despite this high wind and measurements proceeded as normal no obvious adverse impacts of high wind on lspiv quality were noticed by the field crew during the measurement yet in the data processing stage it became evident that the high winds had formed small surface waves that propagated upstream while particles moved downstream fig 9 pivlab could not successfully track the particles because of the influence of these waves no image pre processing available in the program could overcome the problem and the resultant velocities recorded the upstream movement of the waves rather than the downstream particle movement this problem affected all data in experiment s1 so the entire field campaign for that day was unusable additional analysis revealed that resultant velocity vectors were strongly affected by the image sampling frequency when every frame and every fourth frame were extracted the upstream movement of the waves was captured by the piv algorithm the resultant vectors pointed upstream and the poor quality of velocities was obvious fig 10 however when every eighth frame was used the surface wave movement resulted in an apparent downstream velocity that appeared to be a realistic measurement in the absence of the waves fig 10 the downstream velocity however was produced not by the downstream flow of water but by the propagation of waves moving upstream into the downstream portion of each ia thus if a sampling frequency of every eighth frame initially had been chosen the resultant velocities might have been assumed to be valid even though these values are an artifact of the interaction between wave frequency and sampling frequency 3 2 3 ia size initial tests revealed that discharge calculations were not adversely affected by increasing the size of the ia above the default value of 64 px2 but decreased in accuracy compared to reference values when the ia size was decreased below the default value by decreasing the size of the ia and gridding the surface more densely a larger number of areas with insufficient seeding is produced this effect results in poor correlation between frames and velocity vectors that are not representative of surface flow and the effect is amplified when particle seeding is inconsistent or sparse in experiment s2 ia sizes varied from 84 and 42 px2 120 and 60 px2 and 180 and 90 px2 for the first and second passes respectively particle widths at this camera height were between 5 and 10 px this field campaign resulted in some inconsistency of velocity estimates for 30 s subsamples of the 210 s sample fig 7 even though the setup was constant throughout the sample at the lowest ia size velocity estimates for 30 s subsamples scatter around means for the 210 s sample fig 11 as the ia increases the transverse distribution of velocities becomes smoother and the pattern collapses towards the long term mean velocities indicating that much of the variation in the velocity pattern during the low ia extraction is caused by local areas of sparse seeding fig 11 analysis of the videos reveals that the lowest density seeding occurred during the second 30 s subsample which still shows low biased velocities when processed at the largest ia setting 3 3 lspiv and reference measurement comparison comparison among methods shows the accuracy of tripod and uas lspiv estimates of discharge using a standard velocity index of 0 85 compared to measured discharges from the adcp propeller current meter or stream gauge tables 4 and 5 missing data represent an instance where a method was unsuitable for use the propeller meter cannot be used in extremely low flows 10 cm or in flows that are too deep to safely wade 1 3 m the adcp can only be used in flows deeper than about 1 m uas data are missing at locations where use of the uas was prohibited such when the field site lies within restricted airspace e g site f lspiv discharge measurements using the uas and tripod are similar with a mean difference of 10 between the two techniques the difference is only 7 excluding experiment i1 in which a large region of the water surface was covered by intense sunlight reflection and severely degraded the tripod measurement of surface velocities this small difference between uas and tripod measurements suggests that the fixed platform of the tripod offers little or no systematic advantage in quality over the use of uas though the small number of samples preclude the use of statistical tests to determine significance in only one experiment experiment i1 the sunspot compromised measurement did uas based and tripod based estimates of discharge differ by 12 the adcp appears to provide the most reliable estimates for comparison with the lspiv approach table 5 the mean absolute value error percentage of all lspiv estimates i e both tripod and uas measurements of discharge when compared to the adcp was 10 the disparity between all lspiv discharge estimates and propeller meter measurements was 19 in only two cases c1 and e2 did the discharge estimated from the lspiv differ from the measurement provided by the adcp by 15 or greater table 5 for comparison the average difference between the adcp and propeller meter measurements was 20 however in only five experiments were both measurement techniques used and experiment a1 had almost 50 error between the adcp and propeller meter measurements of discharge large rocks about ½ flow depth in diameter upstream of the cross section in experiment a1 likely caused deviation from a log linear velocity profile and resulted in the poor propeller meter result excluding this experiment the adcp and propeller meter measurements had an average difference of 11 a 20 difference between discharge measurements is large but not atypical of comparisons between and even within measurements with other methodologies di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and is similar to errors expected in post flood indirect discharge measurement techniques benson and dalrymple 1967 turnipseed and sauer 2010 in experiments at a gauged site discharge measurements were also compared directly to the usgs stream gauge the mean lspiv error in comparison to usgs gauges at these sites was 23 while gauged measurements are typically reliable lspiv measurements differ the most from gauged estimates of discharge table 4 table 5 the good agreement between the lspiv value and other estimates of discharge for measurements at the salt fork river despite the 20 error in comparison to the gauge data experiments b1 b3 b5 and b6 suggests that the rating curve for this site may be less accurate at certain stages similarly the 58 difference in discharge between the lspiv and gauge in experiment f1 suggests that this gauge might not be accurate for very low flows other than the outlier low flow in experiment f1 no strong relationship is evident between total discharge and accuracy table 5 to assess the variation of velocity indices with respect to flow conditions and field sites calibrated velocity indices were determined that equate lspiv discharge exactly with measured values of discharge table 6 the average calibrated velocity index not including experiments a1 for both techniques or i1 for the tripod for all measurements was 0 93 with a standard deviation of 0 23 the average indices for just uas and just tripod measurements were 0 90 and 1 00 with standard deviations of 0 13 and 0 35 respectively excluding the gauged estimates of discharge which are least reliable because these estimates are not measured directly but are determined from a rating curve the average velocity index for the lspiv methods is 0 88 with a standard deviation of 0 11 table 6 calibrated velocity indices do not appear to be correlated with the site specific hydraulic parameters of mean depth mean velocity or channel width fig 12 in addition calibrated indices are not related to total discharge there appears to be no discernable systematic relationships between calibrated velocity indices and lspiv method uas or tripod or between calibrated velocity indices and each reference discharge measurement method thus no systematic error based on measurement technique or field conditions are likely and the error between lspiv and reference methods appears to be random and local 4 discussion the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of basic lspiv methods using inexpensive unmodified consumer grade uas for estimating discharge in rivers although using uas to obtain river surface velocity and discharge has been documented and is maturing detert and weitbrecht 2015 tauro et al 2016a b detert et al 2017 relatively few studies have examined potential sources of setup and processing error and the effects of these errors on estimated discharges particle seeding density effects melling 1997 kim 2006 camera movement lewis and rhoads 2015 lens effects and image rectification hauet et al 2009 tauro et al 2014 lighting and other environmental conditions kantoush et al 2011 and the efficacy of a simple velocity index to transform surface velocity to depth averaged velocity muste et al 2011 are all issues that have received significant attention in the literature and have only begun to be addressed in specific cases while the accuracy and repeatability of discharge estimates in rivers are clearly affected by these problems the results of this study indicate that many intricate steps typically taken to improve lspiv data quality might not be needed to obtain reasonable and consistent discharge estimates errors between uas and fixed lspiv in comparison to reference methods in this study appear to be dominated by random and local effects rather than systematic factors this relatively low sensitivity to setup and processing parameters implies that simple rapid field mobilizations of lspiv even by those inexperienced in its methodology can be used to obtain reasonable estimates of discharge in situations where the use of traditional measurement methods is difficult muste et al 2008 if basic tenants of lspiv analysis are followed estimates of discharge are accurate compared to reference measurement techniques repeat tests of the simple lspiv setup resulted in only a small intra measurement variability this intra measurement variability is within a similar range reported for other measurement techniques di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and is less important to overall accuracy than the quality of particle seeding kim 2006 experiment s2 exemplifies the importance of particle seeding quality the videos visually appeared to have consistent particle seeding flow was slow and subcritical and the channel bed was made up of sand and gravel without large roughness elements such as boulders however the 30 s subsamples of a 210 s long sample were variable and only improved by increasing the size of the ia i e decreasing the spatial resolution of the measurements particle seeding density will be especially problematic when the flow is not intentionally seeded in these cases large scale particle tracking velocimetry lsptv could outperform lspiv and should be considered tauro 2016 differences in mean velocities along a cross section with uas flight height demonstrate the importance of the interplay among camera stability image resolution and particle seeding each of these factors is not consistent among flights at different times and at different heights and each can influence discharge estimates among these factors flight stability is less important because the running mean of camera movement consistently decreases to an average of only 0 007 m s during the five flight heights in experiment s2 this error is insignificant compared to the measured mean velocities along the cross section but could become important when camera movement is very high or when measured velocity is very low under 0 1 m s image resolution will always decrease with uas height so it is controlled in part by the operator although discharge estimates in this study were obtained with un rectified imagery camera locations and heights above the water surface that were not predefined and at reaches that had not been previously surveyed the velocity index values were close to the typically assumed value of 0 85 rantz 1982 most of the study reaches were generally straight at and upstream of the measurement cross section and had simple trapezoidal morphologies and near uniform sediment characteristics these factors should result in nearly uniform flow and likely explain why the velocity index values did not vary greatly from 0 85 gauging stations are usually installed or measured in simple reaches to minimize complex 3d flow within the measurement cross section although lspiv can be used in complex reaches where hydroacoustic methods may be challenging to deploy the variability of index velocity in complex flows has not been thoroughly documented muste et al 2008 the results of this study also suggest that rare flow events might be better measured with uas and lspiv than with existing gauges or indirect methods which could improve understanding of extreme flood and low flow events and add to the range of flows for which the gauge is calibrated although any discharge measurement method is complicated during an extreme flood due to lack of site access and safety concerns the use of uas and lspiv substantially reduces these complications more research is needed to assess how velocity index values might systematically change in different flow conditions reach morphologies and channel or floodplain types and if adjustments can be made to the index value based on external measurements that do not require in stream velocity measurements one of the major drawbacks of current lspiv technology is the inability to assess velocity and resultant discharge values in the field in real time hydroacoustic and mechanical flow measurement devices typically yield estimates of discharge immediately following a measurement permitting assessment of accuracy at the time of measurement the need for processing of imagery in lspiv hampers real time assessment of discharges but recent research is beginning to investigate and address this challenge thumser et al 2017 in the meantime some experience in measuring discharge using lspiv methods is needed to evaluate when severe sunlight reflection high winds or poor seeding quality might affect data quality finally although this study relied on reference measurements to obtain channel bathymetry significant advances in methods to obtain channel bathymetry remotely have emerged including methods using uas marcus and fonstad 2008 tamminga et al 2015 detert et al 2017 much of this research is focused on lidar mckean et al 2009 legleiter 2012 or photogrammetric lejot et al 2007 detert et al 2017 methods which require clear water conditions that are unlikely to occur in many sediment laden river flows however laboratory based research relating surface turbulence characteristics to local depth appears to be a promising way to obtain bathymetry in flows that obscure the channel bed johnson and cowen 2016 2017 although it is unknown how these methods perform under less controllable field conditions future studies should continue to focus on improving the ability to extract channel bed and bank characteristics remotely 5 conclusions this study has shown that if important minimum requirements are met lspiv based measurements of surface velocities using uas can produce accurate estimates of discharge in rivers basic lspiv setups using either fixed platforms or uas can be deployed rapidly by a small research team and by those who are not experts in photographic or lspiv principles the accuracy repeatability and low cost of this methodology indicates that lspiv methods should appeal to a wide variety of scientists and practitioners working on a multitude of studies that require or benefit from discharge information the recommended minimum steps to produce accurate lspiv velocity include 1 define a measurement cross section perpendicular to the mean flow and measure the distance between the endpoints 2 obtain bathymetry along the cross section and if desired and possible a reference discharge using a standard discharge measurement procedure 3 ensure the camera is recording while nearly orthogonal to the water surface by leveling a tripod or using a uas with a gimbal 4 obtain at least 30 s of video with relatively high quality particle seeding density and if possible obtain longer or multiple videos 5 use default open source piv processing parameters e g pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 on a subset of video frames which can be downsampled to lower sampling frequencies to save time 6 assess the influence of sampling frequency and interrogation area size and particle seeding as these variables are most likely to affect the resultant velocity if necessary vary these parameters and analyze subsets of videos to assess intra measurement variability 7 extract velocities along the measured cross section and multiply by a standard or calibrated index velocity multiply the cross sectional area of the flow measured during or after the event by the mean velocity in the cross section to obtain discharge results of this study support conclusions from previous work that lspiv serves as a cost effective method of measuring discharge discharges estimated from surface velocities obtained from a fixed tripod and uas differed little indicating that the use of uas does not limit the reliability or accuracy of measurements and can significantly enhance existing lspiv methods this study also showed that uas based lspiv is suitable for a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions issues that limit the use of uas are primarily related to weather conditions such as excessive winds or situations in which operation of uas would be illegal or a disturbance the width of a river may also be a limiting factor in that flight heights great enough to see the entire width of a large river may lead to substantial loss of resolution perhaps to the extent that seeding materials may no longer be identifiable in the image a piecemeal approach to estimating velocities across large rivers using low flying uas may be possible but was not evaluated in this study future studies should be concerned with an empirical determination of the velocity index given its importance in computing discharge from surface velocity measurements an index of α 0 7 to α 0 95 serves as a suitable baseline and the average value among experiments in this study derived from direct measurements of discharge was α 0 88 more work is required to determine how particle seeding density different automatic or manual particle casting methods flow characteristics and lspiv parameters such as time series length and ia size affect the accuracy and consistency of extracted velocities and discharges future development of easy to use programs that can apply both piv and ptv is recommended to help bring image based gauging to a wider audience and increase its potential accuracy these dual capabilities should be developed together with image based gauging equipment and techniques that allow the researcher to view velocity and

7341,urbanization induced landuse changes alter runoff regimes in complex ways in this study a detailed investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes is provided by using multiple runoff metrics and with consideration of landuse dynamics a catchment hydrological model is modified by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics to improve long term urban runoff simulations moreover multivariate statistical approach is adopted to mine the spatial variations of runoff metrics so as to further identify critical impact factors of landuse changes the qing river catchment as a peri urban catchment in the beijing metropolitan area is selected as our study region results show that 1 the dryland agriculture is decreased from 13 9 to 1 5 of the total catchment area in the years 2000 2015 while the percentages of impervious surface forest and grass are increased from 63 5 to 72 4 13 5 to 16 6 and 5 1 to 6 5 respectively the most dramatic landuse changes occur in the middle and downstream regions 2 the combined landuse changes do not alter the average flow metrics obviously at the catchment outlet but slightly increase the high flow metrics particularly the extreme high flows 3 the impacts on runoff metrics in the sub catchments are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet for the average flow metrics the most impacted metric is the runoff depth in the dry season october may with a relative change from 10 9 to 11 6 and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and grass for the high flow metrics the extreme high flow depth is increased most significantly with a relative change from 0 6 to 10 5 and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and dryland agriculture 4 the runoff depth metrics in the sub catchments are increased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface but are decreased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture or impervious surface to grass or forest the results of this study provide useful information for urban planning such as sponge city design keywords urbanization runoff metrics catchment hydrological model multivariate statistical approach beijing city 1 introduction urbanization is the inevitable outcome along with the rapid development of human society in the world it has first spread across the western countries and then started in the developing countries since the 1950s in the early 1900s the percentage of urban population in total was just 15 in the world by the end of 2007 the global urbanization rate was over 50 for the first time in human history united nations 2014 it is predicted that about 64 of the developing countries and 86 of the developed countries will be urbanized by 2050 united nations 2014 china as one of the largest developing countries has also been experiencing rapid urbanization since the late 1970s the urbanization rate in china is expected to hit 76 by 2050 although urbanization can improve the living conditions of residents and further stimulate economic growth it also introduces a variety of urban environmental issues such as waterlogging water shortage and pollution and urban heat island xia et al 2017 in particular hydrological alteration by urbanization has become a growing concern over years intensive expansion of impervious surface obstructs natural infiltration and storage of precipitation enhances evaporation prior to precipitation events braud et al 2013b ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 and thus results in more surface runoff yield and fast routing through land surface and drainage systems hollis 1975 arnold and gibbons 1996 smith et al 2005 suriya and mudgal 2012 more surface runoff is generated and urban waterlogging is increased due to the change of urban micro topography and insufficient flood control capability of urban drainage systems for example waterlogging occurred in 62 of 351 investigated cities in china and more than three severe waterlogging events happened annually in 137 cities from 2008 to 2010 according to the statistical data from the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters of china therefore urban waterlogging is one of the most severe water issues in most cities in china due to rapid urbanization it is seriously disastrous for the urban residents and has restricted the cities sustainable development in china the sponge city framework has been put forward to mitigate this urban environmental issue mhurd 2014 the impact mechanism of urbanization on the hydrological cycle and its impact magnitude are overarching scientific questions that need to be addressed in the literature the majority of studies assess the urbanization impacts on runoff saghafian et al 2008 olang and fürst 2011 du et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 zope et al 2016 the general consensuses regarding impact mechanisms are that 1 urbanization alters climate processes and thus climate variables such as precipitation magnitude due to enhanced convergence shepherd 2005 kaufmann et al 2007 surface temperature and evapotranspiration due to decreased albedo and increased thermal storage ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 bounoua et al 2015 2 urbanization induces landuse or land cover changes by converting previous land covers e g dryland agriculture grass or forest to impervious lands e g roads buildings and houses meija and moglen 2010 braud et al 2013b 3 more artificial micro topography and urban drainage systems disturb runoff routing saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 different approaches are adopted in these studies including statistical analysis e g correlation analysis causality relationship analysis for climate variable changes kaufmann et al 2007 analogical comparisons between urban and rural regions oke 1973 miller et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 field experiments and or monitoring for different underlying surfaces boggs and sun 2011 braud et al 2013a as well as hydrological simulations with consideration of different urbanization scenarios lin et al 2007 olang and fürst 2011 du et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 zope et al 2016 however the statistical analysis and analogical comparisons focus on the relationships between urbanization and hydrological variables and are insufficient to quantify the urbanization impacts field experiments and monitoring are restricted by costs scale issues and uncontrollable conditions zhang et al 2016b the hydrological modelling approach is widely accepted for the assessment of urbanization impacts and most urban hydrological models are able to simulate precipitation runoff processes at city sub domain scale with detailed mathematical descriptions of the flow routing in the urban drainage system however the runoff yield is usually estimated based on empirical relationships between precipitation and infiltration or runoff or curve number method proposed by soil conservation service scs cn and the underlying surfaces are usually divided into simple impervious surface and permeable surface which are insufficient to characterize the detailed discrepancies among different landuse or land covers suriya and mudgal 2012 the evapotranspiration process is also usually simplified during the simulation ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 additionally most existing catchment models e g dwsm dynamic watershed simulation model hec hms hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system and dtvgm distributed time variant gain model have strong advantages in runoff yield estimation with consideration of detailed landuse information however these models do not consider flow routing in the urban drainage system and land surface conditions are static as a model input rather than dynamic du et al 2012 isik et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zope et al 2016 therefore the applicability of hydrological model for the urbanization impact assessment is still a challenge furthermore hydrographic discrepancies are usually adopted to assess the impact of different factors on runoff by changing the impact factors and then driving the hydrological model this approach mainly focuses on the runoff variations at river s cross sections and is not able to directly deduce the impacts on spatial variability of hydrological processes du et al 2012 isik et al 2013 zope et al 2016 as the abundant spatial information are not fully leveraged including hydrometeorological observations and terrain datasets with high spatial resolutions and outputs of distributed hydrological models multivariate statistical approach has competitive the advantages of being able to deeply mine multiple data sources and quantify the entire impacts of potential factors in a comprehensive manner zhang et al 2016b the representative methods are redundancy analysis rda canonical correspondence analysis cca cluster analysis and principal component analysis pca all of which have been widely adopted to analyze the experiment data or field observations in the ecological sciences medicine and finance van den wollenberg 1977 anderson and willis 2003 lepx and smilauer 2003 therefore multivariate statistical analysis based on the outputs of distributed hydrological models will be a more efficient approach to comprehensively assess the impact of urban landuse changes on hydrological variables our study investigates the urbanization impacts on runoff metrics with consideration of landuse changes by the integration of a distributed catchment model and multivariate statistical approach the qing river catchment as one of the four major catchments in the beijing metropolitan area is selected as the study area the specific objectives are to 1 identify the underlying surface changes and the main transition characteristics among all the landuse types 2 develop the urban hydrological model with consideration of the landuse dynamic changes and the complicated urban flow routing processes in order to accurately capture both the inflow and outflow hydrographs at river s cross sections and the spatial distributions of runoff metrics average low and high flows and runoff coefficient 3 quantify the impact of urbanization on runoff metrics at the average and high states by multivariate statistical approach and identify the critical impact factors of landuse changes this study is expected to promote the further application of catchment hydrological model in urbanization impact assessment and provide the decision making support for urban development and planning especially related to sponge city 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area the qing river catchment 39 58 40 05 n 116 12 116 29 e is situated in the northern part of beijing metropolitan area fig 1 its total drainage area is about 169 km2 which accounts for nearly 30 of the beijing central area the catchment belongs to the semi humid monsoon climate region with dry winter and hot summer the annual average precipitation from 1975 to 2015 is around 519 mm over 80 of which falls in the wet season from june to september the annual average frequency of torrential precipitation daily precipitation intensity 50 mm day is 1 43 days year in the wet season while there is no torrential precipitation in the dry season from october to may the qing river serves as one of the four major channels which are qing river ba river tonghui river and liangshui river for flooding drainage in beijing central area the qing river flows through haidian chaoyang and changping districts and finally discharges into wenyu river in shunyi district the total river length is 23 7 km the qing river catchment is a typical peri urban catchment with a high heterogeneity of landscape including agricultural forest grass and built up lands in the year 2000 the agricultural land was only about 23 km2 and the built up land covered over 50 of the total catchment area the urban landscape has experienced drastic changes since the late 1980s the zhongguancun science and technology park often referred to as the china s silicon valley was built with many industrial buildings along central and crowded streets because of the successful application of the olympic games in 2008 the beijing olympic park was built in this catchment with 11 59 km2 of built up area covering major sports halls conference halls hotels and forest park in our study the upstream region is primarily forest covered mountainous area in the head stream region and the zhongguancun science and technology park old summer palace and shangdi science park are distributed in the south and north of qing river respectively the middle and downstream regions are divided by yangfang station the olympic park is located in the middle stream region and the beiyuan residence community qingheying country park and nanqijia science park are also distributed in the south and north parts of the downstream stream region respectively 2 2 data sources

runoff observation in the whole qing river catchment the outlet hydrograph of qing river catchment is calculated based on the calibrated results for wenyu catchment zhang et al 2011 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 transition matrix for landuse change assessment the transition area matrix of landuse is a classical markov chain model which is widely used to assess landuse dynamics waggoner and stephens 1970 fu et al 2010 hurtt et al 2011 this approach is advantageous to characterize the moving directions of landuse types and their magnitudes which clearly reflects the changes of landuse types at a certain period the transition area matrix of landuse is implemented using arcgis software version 10 0 for all the stormwater drainage sub catchments the related functions of the arcgis software are

integrated water system model proposed by zhang et al 2016a is applied for the simulation of urban hydrological processes the model focuses on rainfall runoff biogeochemical processes at multiple

oqm water quality module of water bodies wqm and dam regulation module drm and a parameter analysis tool pat in this study hcm is adopted to simulate urban hydrological processes including runoff yield and routing and is briefed below 2 3 2 1 hydrological processes simulation the surface runoff yield is calculated using the mathematics based tvgm time variant gain model proposed by xia 1991 and further extended by wang et al 2009 and ye et al 2015 the equation is given as 1 rs i g 1 i sw u w sat g 2 i p in i where rsi is the surface runoff yield of the i th landuse type mm swu and wsat are the soil moisture of the upper layer and saturation moisture respectively mm p is the precipitation amount mm g1 i and g2 i are the basic coefficient of surface runoff and soil moisture for the i

the soil moistures mm of the upper and lower layers respectively kss i and kbs i are the yield coefficients of interflow and baseflow for the i th landuse type respectively the total runoff yield of a

and c is the runoff yield coefficient evapotranspiration is also one of the critical hydrological processes particularly for the long term hydrological simulation the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 and the actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration leaf area index and surface soil residues ritchie 1972 2 3 2 2 model improvements for landuse dynamics and urban runoff routing 2 3 2 2 1 landuse dynamics the main hydrological process controlled by landuse is the surface runoff yield the areas of different landuse types in all sub catchments are the input to heqm in individual periods the surface runoff yield for a long term period is calculated as 4 rs i 1 n a t i rs i a t 1 t t 2 i 1 n a t i rs i a t

stormwater gutters and pipes channels and rivers braud et al 2013b therefore urban runoff routing is much more complicated than that of a typical rural catchment it includes flow routings in not only the land surface and rivers but also the complex urban drainage system fig 2 the basic flow routing equation for a certain river segment is given as 5 q r in q r out q overl q interf q basef q p q st if rs qc p q r out q interf q basef q p q st if rs qc p where qr in is the inflow of river segment m3 s q r out is the outflow of upper river segment m3 s which is calculated using muskingum method or kinetic wave equation in heqm qoverl qinterf and qbasef are the routings m3 s of overland flow interflow and baseflow whose calculations are adopted from neitsch et al 2011 in heqm qst is the discharge from sewage treatment plants m3 s qp and qcp are the flow routing m3 s and drainage capacity mm in the urban drainage system which are not able to be calculated in heqm it is usually not possible to calculate the flow routing of the drainage system using the hydrodynamic equations because the urban drainage network data is difficult to obtain in china however the drainage network is always designed according to the national industry design standards and specifications of water supply and drainage design bmedi 2004 the drainage capacity of pipeline network could then be deduced according to the related design equations the design precipitation intensity equation is given as 6 pi 8 64 167 a 1 1 a 2 lg pr t pcp b n t pcp t overl m t p 1 m 1 t overl where pi and pr are the design precipitation intensity mm day and return period year respectively a1 mm and a2 are the parameters of precipitation intensity tpcp and b are the design precipitation duration min and its adjusted parameter min respectively n is the precipitation decay parameter toverl and tp are the flow routing durations min in the land surface and drainage network respectively m and m1 are the adjusted parameters of flow routing duration in the drainage network in this equation toverl is determined by the overland slope and length of sub catchment in heqm a1 a2 b n and pr are the related parameters of design precipitation intensity all of which can be obtained according to the design handbook bmedi 2004 in beijing city a1 11 82 mm a2 0 811 b 8 min n 0 711 and pr 2 years the drainage capacity qcp and flow routing qp of pipeline network are estimated as 7 qc p pi c q p k qc p a 86 4 where c is the runoff coefficient which is calculated in eq 3 a is the sub catchment area km2 and k is the coverage factor of drainage network in the sub catchment the above estimation is based on the assumptions that the qp is discharged into nearby river in the same sub catchment rather than other sub catchments and the river s backwater effect on the qcp is also ignored in this simplified flow routing module therefore heqm coupled with eqs 4 7 is able to solve the urban hydrological simulation in the catchments with no drainage system data all the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 in which two related parameters are involved in the simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system i e the adjusted parameter of flow routing duration in the drainage network m1 and the coverage factor of drainage network in the sub catchment k 2 3 2 3 model setup and calibration sixteen sub catchments are delineated for the qing river catchment pan et al 2015 and the six major landuse types mentioned above are considered for each sub catchment as the minimum spatial calculation units the daily observations of precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures are interpolated into all the sub catchments by the inverse distance weighting method the sewage treatment plants and sewage outfalls are also considered according to their geographical positions by directly adding the corresponding sewage discharge amounts into the model based on field investigation one sewage treatment plant was built in the no 1 sub catchment in 2003 discharging 0 2 million m3 day i e 2 31 m3 s of recycled water into the upper qing river the hydrograph at the outlet of the qing river catchment is used for the calibration of the improved heqm the calibration and validation periods are from 2009 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015 respectively and 2008 is the warming period sce ua in the pat module of heqm is adopted to automatically optimize the model parameters in the calibration period with the root mean square error rmse m3 s being the optimization objective function the parameter aggregation approach is adopted for calibration to make full use of spatial variation information without changing the numbers of parameters yang et al 2008 the g1 i and g2 i are calibrated by adjusting the relative amplitudes of the initial parameter values while the other parameters are calibrated by directly replacing the initial parameter values moreover the bias correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency are adopted to further evaluate the simulation performance of heqm the description of evaluation criteria can refer to zhang et al 2016b and the equations are

is the series length 2 3 3 runoff impact assessments 2 3 3 1 runoff metrics and their variation assessment runoffs at both average and high states are considered at the catchment outlet and in sub catchments for the urbanization impact assessment in term of water resource utilization and flooding control at the outlet the runoff metrics include annual average flow magnitude mfav m3 s annual average flow magnitudes in the wet season mffs m3 s and dry season mfnf m3 s for the average state high flows with the 1st 5th and 10th percentiles mf01 mf05 and mf10 m3 s for the high state at the sub catchment scale the selected metrics include annual average runoff depth rd mm annual average runoff depths in the wet season and dry season rdfs and rdnf mm for the average state annual average runoff depths with the 1th 5th and 10th percentiles rd01 rd05 and rd10 mm for the high state the discrepancies of runoff metrics among different landuse scenarios are adopted to assess the impacts of landuse changes the runoff metrics of each sub catchment are simulated by inputting the landuse maps of 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 scenarios 1 4 individually to drive the calibrated heqm scenario 1 landuse 2000 is set as the baseline and the runoff impact assessment is conducted by comparing the runoff metrics of the other three scenarios with those of scenario 1 2 3 3 2 multivariate statistical approach for impact factor identification rank analysis is a robust approach in multivariate statistics to infer the correlation between two variable sets and identify the critical impact factors and their contributions this approach is commonly used to effectively gain insight into complex data in ecological science social science psychological statistics and so on anderson and willis 2003 shaw 2003 there are two alternative methods for the rank analysis i e non symmetric redundancy analysis rda van den wollenberg 1977 and symmetric canonical correlation analysis cca braak 1986 the suitable method is selected according to the gradient length calculated by the detrended correspondence analysis dca which indicates that if the length is smaller than 3 0 rda is preferred while if the length is between 3 0 and 4 0 both rda and cca are suitable otherwise cca is preferred hill and gauch 1980 lepx and smilauer 2003 the statistical value p for the impact factor detection is set as 0 10 to determine the statistical significance if p 0 10 the impact factor is statistically significant the impact factor is considered to be more important if its determination coefficient r2 with runoff metric changes is larger moreover the corresponding constrained proportion is the contribution to runoff metric changes 3 results 3 1 assessment of landuse change in the qing river catchment the dominating landuse type is the impervious surface which is mainly distributed in the upper and middle stream regions with the area accounting for over 60 of total catchment area and increasing steadily from 2000 to 2015 fig 3 by the end of 2015 the impervious surface reaches 72 4 of total area and increases by 8 9 compared with that of 2000 the most dramatically decreased landuse type is dryland agriculture which is located primarily around the mountainous region the olympic park in the middle stream region and the downstream region the decreasing trend is consistent with a reduction of 12 4 in coverage throughout the whole period and the total coverage is only 2 51 km2 by the end of 2015 the most dramatic decrease is from 2000 to 2005 with a reduction of 9 8 due to the construction of the olympic park in the middle stream region forest and grass occupy 13 5 to 18 3 and 5 1 to 12 0 of total catchment area respectively both of which are primarily located in the mountainous region around the old summer palace and the olympic park these two landuse types slightly increase by 3 0 and 1 4 by the end of 2015 respectively and the most dramatic changing region is in the northern part of the olympic park from 2000 to 2005 water whose area accounts for 2 8 to 3 9 of the total catchment area decreases throughout the whole period particularly in the downstream regions unused land does not change obviously throughout the whole period due to the tiny size of area i e only 0 1 to 0 8 of the total catchment area therefore the main transition of landuse is the changes of dryland agriculture primarily to impervious surface and secondarily to forest and grass for the landuse changes among different sub catchments fig 4 the impervious surface and dryland agriculture decrease while the forest and grass increase in most sub catchments in the upper and middle stream regions from 2000 to 2005 including the zhongguancun science and technology park and the olympic park the zhongguancun science and technology park is a highly developed region with a large building areas and impervious roads as the local government adopts a more citywide outlook more trees and grass are planted moreover the olympic park used to be rural area with primarily dryland agriculture which has changed to forest and grass gradually since the construction of the olympic park the landuse change rates in the olympic park are most dramatic among all the sub catchments with decreasing rates of 24 1 and 46 2 for the impervious surface and dryland agriculture respectively and increasing rates of 26 1 and 23 6 for forest and grass respectively in the northern or downstream sub catchments the dryland agriculture decreases obviously while the impervious surface forest and grass increase among which the change of impervious surface is the most obvious the explanation is that these regions were rural villages in the early 2000s and were gradually built up due to real estate development auxiliary commercial and transport facilities and the constructions of information industrial base and the science park e g shangdi nanqijia the landuse changes are consistent throughout the whole period from 2000 to 2010 the most dramatic changing sub catchments are in the downstream region with an increase rate of 27 2 for impervious surface and a decrease rate of 34 1 for dryland agriculture the grass area also increase obviously particularly in the middle and downstream regions with the rates from 5 4 to 26 3 from 2000 to 2015 the most dramatic changing regions are also in the downstream region with a decrease rate of 34 1 for dryland agriculture and an increase rate of 29 6 for impervious surface the forest and grass areas increase slightly particularly in the middle and downstream regions with the rates from 0 7 to 26 1 for forest and from 5 5 to 14 2 for grass 3 2 performance of catchment hydrological simulation in the calibration period the simulated hydrograph at the catchment outlet matches well with the observations with the bias r and ns being equal to 0 17 0 76 and 0 55 respectively fig 5 a and table 2 in the validation period although the runoff is slightly overestimated bias 0 28 the simulated runoff fits well with the observed runoff with the r and ns of over 0 75 and 0 50 respectively thus the simulation performance is satisfactory moreover compared with the observed annual values of high flow metrics mf01 mf05 and mf10 fig 5b the simulated metrics are also simulated very well with the bias r and ns being equal to 0 22 0 95 and 0 88 respectively therefore the improved heqm captures the runoff variations satisfactorily for both the calibration and validation periods particularly for the high flow events 3 3 impact assessments of urbanization compared with the baseline landuse 2000 all the average flow metrics mfav mffs and mfnf at the catchment outlet do not change obviously with the range from only 2 2 to 0 3 during the whole period fig 6 however the high flow metrics mf01 mf05 and mf10 slightly increase among which the most obvious changing metric is the extreme high flow mf01 with the changes ranging from 1 6 to 1 1 in scenario 2 landuse 2005 from 2 1 to 0 2 in scenario 3 landuse 2010 and from 1 7 to 8 1 in scenario 4 landuse 2015 respectively therefore the combined landuse changes seem not to alter the average flow metrics at the catchment outlet while the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface slightly increase the high flow metrics the changes of runoff metrics at the sub catchment scale are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet fig 7 compared with the baseline the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf in scenario 2 are from 4 2 to 5 0 from 2 7 to 2 7 and from 7 7 to 11 6 respectively the sub catchments having decreasing values are in most regions particularly in the middle stream region e g the olympic park while the sub catchments having increasing values are in the middle stream region the landuse changes from 2000 to 2005 explain 46 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the important impact factor is the impervious surface r 2 0 89 p 0 10 followed by grass r 2 0 58 p 0 10 forest r 2 0 51 p 0 10 and dryland agriculture r 2 0 33 p 0 10 table 3 in scenario 3 the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf are from 4 9 to 3 3 from 2 6 to 2 3 and from 10 9 to 7 6 respectively the number of sub catchments having decreasing values for all the three metrics is less than that of scenario 2 and most of them are also in the upstream regions the sub catchments having increasing values are mostly in the sub catchments of the middle and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2010 only explain 32 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the impervious surface is the only statistically significant impact factor r 2 0 57 p 0 10 in scenario 4 the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf are from 3 8 to 3 3 from 1 6 to 1 9 and from 9 3 to 7 4 respectively the sub catchments having decreasing values change to the middle stream regions except rdnf while the sub catchments having increasing values are in the upper and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2015 explain 65 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the important impact factor is the impervious surface r 2 0 80 p 0 10 followed by dryland agriculture r 2 0 45 p 0 10 and grass r 2 0 43 p 0 10 therefore the most impacted metric is rdnf and the critical impact factor is the impervious surface followed by grass dryland agriculture and forest the average runoff metrics are gradually increased from 2000 to 2015 in the upper and downstream regions which is probably caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and forest to the impervious surface however these metrics are gradually decreased in the middle stream regions which is probably caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and impervious surface to the grass and forest the changes of high flow metrics at the sub catchment scale are also little greater than those of average runoff metrics compared with the baseline the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 2 are from 0 4 to 2 8 from 1 9 to 1 3 and from 2 2 to 2 8 respectively fig 8 the spatial changes of rd01 are quite different from those of rd05 and rd10 rd01 increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and the olympic park while rd05 and rd10 increase in the upper and middle stream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2005 explain 59 of the spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the important impact factor is water r 2 0 56 p 0 10 followed by grass r 2 0 45 p 0 10 dryland agriculture r 2 0 41 p 0 10 and forest r 2 0 35 p 0 10 the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 3 are from 0 6 to 10 5 from 2 2 to 1 1 and from 2 2 to 3 1 respectively rd01 increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and southern sub catchments in the middle stream region while the regions with increasing rd05 and rd10 are in the middle and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2010 explain 60 of spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the impervious surface is the only statistically significant impact factor r 2 0 55 p 0 10 the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 4 are from 0 5 to 4 6 from 4 0 to 1 1 and from 1 4 to 2 9 respectively rd01 also increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and the olympic park while rd05 and rd10 decrease in most sub catchment except the zhongguancun park and olympic park the landuse changes from 2000 to 2015 explain 57 of spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the important impact factor is also the impervious surface r 2 0 59 p 0 10 followed by dryland agriculture r 2 0 37 p 0 10 therefore the extreme high flow rd01 for most sub catchments from 2000 to 2015 increases consistently while the changes of rd05 and rd10 are not obvious the critical impact factor is the impervious surface followed by dryland agriculture water grass and forest the probable explanations are that the decrease of high flow metrics are also caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and impervious surface to the grass and forest while the increase of high flow metrics is caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture to the impervious surface 4 discussion and conclusions with the rapid urbanization the main feature of underlying surface changes in peri urban regions is that the agricultural land is shifted to impervious surface e g buildings paved roads arnold and gibbons 1996 meija and moglen 2010 braud et al 2013b in our study catchment the landuse transition is consistent with the results of these studies the total area of impervious surface increases from 63 5 to 72 4 while the dryland agriculture decreases from 13 9 to 1 5 from 2000 to 2015 the main causes are that the construction of the information industry bases and science parks e g zhongguancun science and technology park and shangdi science park in the upper stream region and nanqijia science park in the downstream region the highly intensive real estate development e g beiyuan residence community in the downstream region and the construction of the olympic venues and facilities in the middle stream region moreover due to the increasing attention of green urban development the green olympics theme for 2008 beijing olympic game and the sponge city several parks are renovated and built by the beijing gardening and greening bureau beijing gardening and greening bureau 2007 beijing gardening and greening bureau 2011 such as the old summer palace the olympic forest park in 2008 and the qingheying country park in 2009 thus the total areas of grass and forest increase slightly whose area percentages increase from 5 1 to 6 5 and from 13 5 to 16 6 respectively a comprehensive assessment of the urbanization impact on runoff metrics is rather complicated due to the diverse types and functions of landuse for example on the one hand the expansion from dryland agriculture to impervious surface clearly increases the runoff yield by reducing precipitation infiltration and shortening flow routing time saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 on the other hand the expansion from dryland agriculture to grass or forest enhances the water retention capacity which likely decreases the runoff yield shang and wilson 2009 additionally the water area is able to generate more runoff because of the high runoff coefficient of water surface and also enhances the storage capacity of water bodies in our study although the impervious surface area increases consistently the constructions of green infrastructures e g grasses trees parks also replace dryland agriculture therefore the combined landuse changes in the whole catchment do not drastically change the average flow metrics at the catchment outlet but increase the high flow metrics marginally such as the extreme high flow with the ranges from 2 1 to 8 1 the other explanation is that as the catchment is located in the northern semi humid region the initial rainfall loss is usually so great that the runoff yield is quite small particularly in the dry season igcas 1980 moreover although the runoff depth metrics tend to have different spatial variations in various scenarios due to the combined runoff responses to the complicated landuse changes these metrics increase at most sub catchments which are mainly in the highly developed regions such as zhongguancun park shangdi science park and beiyuan residence community the most dramatic changing metrics are the runoff depths in the dry season with the ranges from 10 9 to 11 6 and the extreme high flow depths with the ranges from 0 6 to 10 5 our findings about average and high flow assessments are similar with those studies in the qinghuai river basin of china with much greater relative changes of impervious surface 30 du et al 2012 the yzeron catchment france braud et al 2013a and the oshiwara river basin of india in the flooding changes zope et al 2016 therefore urbanization does not change the water resource shortage dramatically but probably increases urban waterlogging and flooding to a certain extent the extreme precipitation event is still the critical trigger of urban waterlogging and flooding such as the event on july 21th 2012 in our study catchment our investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes finds that the catchment hydrological model is improved and applied in the peri urban catchment by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics the modified module provides a simple and feasible solution for the catchment as our study case where no sufficient information about the drainage network available and the model performance is satisfactory by auto optimization technique the assessment results of urbanization impacts on runoff regimes are also reasonable the findings are helpful to clarify the urbanization impacts on hydrological processes in the semi humid cities and can provide scientific support for the sponge city planning and related decision making although the average annual runoff magnitude is not changed obviously more sponge city measures e g grassed swales rain gardens trees should be implemented for water conservation in the sub catchments other sponge city measures e g permeable pavements and green roofs should be gradually spread to replace the traditional impervious surfaces for source control of extreme flooding events moreover the simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system should be extended in order to further distinguish the probable inconsistencies of flow routing paths between pipeline network and river network as well as their interactions the capacities of urban real time monitoring hydrological forecasting and emergency response programs should be strengthened to aid in the management of future extreme weather events acknowledgments this study was

7341,urbanization induced landuse changes alter runoff regimes in complex ways in this study a detailed investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes is provided by using multiple runoff metrics and with consideration of landuse dynamics a catchment hydrological model is modified by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics to improve long term urban runoff simulations moreover multivariate statistical approach is adopted to mine the spatial variations of runoff metrics so as to further identify critical impact factors of landuse changes the qing river catchment as a peri urban catchment in the beijing metropolitan area is selected as our study region results show that 1 the dryland agriculture is decreased from 13 9 to 1 5 of the total catchment area in the years 2000 2015 while the percentages of impervious surface forest and grass are increased from 63 5 to 72 4 13 5 to 16 6 and 5 1 to 6 5 respectively the most dramatic landuse changes occur in the middle and downstream regions 2 the combined landuse changes do not alter the average flow metrics obviously at the catchment outlet but slightly increase the high flow metrics particularly the extreme high flows 3 the impacts on runoff metrics in the sub catchments are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet for the average flow metrics the most impacted metric is the runoff depth in the dry season october may with a relative change from 10 9 to 11 6 and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and grass for the high flow metrics the extreme high flow depth is increased most significantly with a relative change from 0 6 to 10 5 and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and dryland agriculture 4 the runoff depth metrics in the sub catchments are increased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface but are decreased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture or impervious surface to grass or forest the results of this study provide useful information for urban planning such as sponge city design keywords urbanization runoff metrics catchment hydrological model multivariate statistical approach beijing city 1 introduction urbanization is the inevitable outcome along with the rapid development of human society in the world it has first spread across the western countries and then started in the developing countries since the 1950s in the early 1900s the percentage of urban population in total was just 15 in the world by the end of 2007 the global urbanization rate was over 50 for the first time in human history united nations 2014 it is predicted that about 64 of the developing countries and 86 of the developed countries will be urbanized by 2050 united nations 2014 china as one of the largest developing countries has also been experiencing rapid urbanization since the late 1970s the urbanization rate in china is expected to hit 76 by 2050 although urbanization can improve the living conditions of residents and further stimulate economic growth it also introduces a variety of urban environmental issues such as waterlogging water shortage and pollution and urban heat island xia et al 2017 in particular hydrological alteration by urbanization has become a growing concern over years intensive expansion of impervious surface obstructs natural infiltration and storage of precipitation enhances evaporation prior to precipitation events braud et al 2013b ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 and thus results in more surface runoff yield and fast routing through land surface and drainage systems hollis 1975 arnold and gibbons 1996 smith et al 2005 suriya and mudgal 2012 more surface runoff is generated and urban waterlogging is increased due to the change of urban micro topography and insufficient flood control capability of urban drainage systems for example waterlogging occurred in 62 of 351 investigated cities in china and more than three severe waterlogging events happened annually in 137 cities from 2008 to 2010 according to the statistical data from the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters of china therefore urban waterlogging is one of the most severe water issues in most cities in china due to rapid urbanization it is seriously disastrous for the urban residents and has restricted the cities sustainable development in china the sponge city framework has been put forward to mitigate this urban environmental issue mhurd 2014 the impact mechanism of urbanization on the hydrological cycle and its impact magnitude are overarching scientific questions that need to be addressed in the literature the majority of studies assess the urbanization impacts on runoff saghafian et al 2008 olang and fürst 2011 du et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 zope et al 2016 the general consensuses regarding impact mechanisms are that 1 urbanization alters climate processes and thus climate variables such as precipitation magnitude due to enhanced convergence shepherd 2005 kaufmann et al 2007 surface temperature and evapotranspiration due to decreased albedo and increased thermal storage ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 bounoua et al 2015 2 urbanization induces landuse or land cover changes by converting previous land covers e g dryland agriculture grass or forest to impervious lands e g roads buildings and houses meija and moglen 2010 braud et al 2013b 3 more artificial micro topography and urban drainage systems disturb runoff routing saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 different approaches are adopted in these studies including statistical analysis e g correlation analysis causality relationship analysis for climate variable changes kaufmann et al 2007 analogical comparisons between urban and rural regions oke 1973 miller et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 field experiments and or monitoring for different underlying surfaces boggs and sun 2011 braud et al 2013a as well as hydrological simulations with consideration of different urbanization scenarios lin et al 2007 olang and fürst 2011 du et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 zope et al 2016 however the statistical analysis and analogical comparisons focus on the relationships between urbanization and hydrological variables and are insufficient to quantify the urbanization impacts field experiments and monitoring are restricted by costs scale issues and uncontrollable conditions zhang et al 2016b the hydrological modelling approach is widely accepted for the assessment of urbanization impacts and most urban hydrological models are able to simulate precipitation runoff processes at city sub domain scale with detailed mathematical descriptions of the flow routing in the urban drainage system however the runoff yield is usually estimated based on empirical relationships between precipitation and infiltration or runoff or curve number method proposed by soil conservation service scs cn and the underlying surfaces are usually divided into simple impervious surface and permeable surface which are insufficient to characterize the detailed discrepancies among different landuse or land covers suriya and mudgal 2012 the evapotranspiration process is also usually simplified during the simulation ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 additionally most existing catchment models e g dwsm dynamic watershed simulation model hec hms hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system and dtvgm distributed time variant gain model have strong advantages in runoff yield estimation with consideration of detailed landuse information however these models do not consider flow routing in the urban drainage system and land surface conditions are static as a model input rather than dynamic du et al 2012 isik et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zope et al 2016 therefore the applicability of hydrological model for the urbanization impact assessment is still a challenge furthermore hydrographic discrepancies are usually adopted to assess the impact of different factors on runoff by changing the impact factors and then driving the hydrological model this approach mainly focuses on the runoff variations at river s cross sections and is not able to directly deduce the impacts on spatial variability of hydrological processes du et al 2012 isik et al 2013 zope et al 2016 as the abundant spatial information are not fully leveraged including hydrometeorological observations and terrain datasets with high spatial resolutions and outputs of distributed hydrological models multivariate statistical approach has competitive the advantages of being able to deeply mine multiple data sources and quantify the entire impacts of potential factors in a comprehensive manner zhang et al 2016b the representative methods are redundancy analysis rda canonical correspondence analysis cca cluster analysis and principal component analysis pca all of which have been widely adopted to analyze the experiment data or field observations in the ecological sciences medicine and finance van den wollenberg 1977 anderson and willis 2003 lepx and smilauer 2003 therefore multivariate statistical analysis based on the outputs of distributed hydrological models will be a more efficient approach to comprehensively assess the impact of urban landuse changes on hydrological variables our study investigates the urbanization impacts on runoff metrics with consideration of landuse changes by the integration of a distributed catchment model and multivariate statistical approach the qing river catchment as one of the four major catchments in the beijing metropolitan area is selected as the study area the specific objectives are to 1 identify the underlying surface changes and the main transition characteristics among all the landuse types 2 develop the urban hydrological model with consideration of the landuse dynamic changes and the complicated urban flow routing processes in order to accurately capture both the inflow and outflow hydrographs at river s cross sections and the spatial distributions of runoff metrics average low and high flows and runoff coefficient 3 quantify the impact of urbanization on runoff metrics at the average and high states by multivariate statistical approach and identify the critical impact factors of landuse changes this study is expected to promote the further application of catchment hydrological model in urbanization impact assessment and provide the decision making support for urban development and planning especially related to sponge city 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area the qing river catchment 39 58 40 05 n 116 12 116 29 e is situated in the northern part of beijing metropolitan area fig 1 its total drainage area is about 169 km2 which accounts for nearly 30 of the beijing central area the catchment belongs to the semi humid monsoon climate region with dry winter and hot summer the annual average precipitation from 1975 to 2015 is around 519 mm over 80 of which falls in the wet season from june to september the annual average frequency of torrential precipitation daily precipitation intensity 50 mm day is 1 43 days year in the wet season while there is no torrential precipitation in the dry season from october to may the qing river serves as one of the four major channels which are qing river ba river tonghui river and liangshui river for flooding drainage in beijing central area the qing river flows through haidian chaoyang and changping districts and finally discharges into wenyu river in shunyi district the total river length is 23 7 km the qing river catchment is a typical peri urban catchment with a high heterogeneity of landscape including agricultural forest grass and built up lands in the year 2000 the agricultural land was only about 23 km2 and the built up land covered over 50 of the total catchment area the urban landscape has experienced drastic changes since the late 1980s the zhongguancun science and technology park often referred to as the china s silicon valley was built with many industrial buildings along central and crowded streets because of the successful application of the olympic games in 2008 the beijing olympic park was built in this catchment with 11 59 km2 of built up area covering major sports halls conference halls hotels and forest

th landuse type respectively ini is the vegetation interception of the i th landuse type mm the interflow and baseflow are considered to have linear relationships with the soil moistures in the upper and lower layers respectively the equation is given as 2 rss i k ss i sw u rbs i k bs i sw l where rssi and rbsi are the interflow and baseflow of the i th landuse type respectively mm swu and swl are the soil moistures mm of the upper and lower layers respectively kss i and kbs i are the yield coefficients of interflow and baseflow for the i th landuse type respectively the total runoff yield of a certain sub catchment is estimated by 3 rt i 1 n rs i rss i rbs i a i a c rt p where rt is the total runoff yield mm ai and a are the areas km2 of the i th landuse type and sub catchment respectively and c is the runoff yield coefficient evapotranspiration is also one of the critical hydrological processes particularly for the long term hydrological simulation the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 and the actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration leaf area index and surface soil residues ritchie 1972 2 3 2 2 model improvements for landuse dynamics and urban runoff routing 2 3 2 2 1 landuse dynamics the main hydrological process controlled by landuse is the surface runoff yield the areas of different landuse types in all sub catchments are the input to heqm in individual periods the surface runoff yield for a long term period is calculated as 4 rs i 1 n a t i rs i a t 1 t t 2 i 1 n a t i rs i a t

number of time periods in our study n 7 m 4 t1 2000 t2 2005 t3 2010 and t4 2015 2 3 2 2 2 urban runoff routing urbanization significantly modifies the water pathways through roads drainage systems stormwater gutters and pipes channels and rivers braud et al 2013b therefore urban runoff routing is much more complicated than that of a typical rural catchment it includes flow routings in not only the land surface and rivers but also the complex urban drainage system fig 2 the basic flow routing equation for a certain river segment is given as 5 q r in q r out q overl q interf q basef q p q st if rs qc p q r out q interf q basef q p q st if rs qc p where qr in is the inflow of river segment m3 s q r out is the outflow of upper river segment m3 s which is calculated using muskingum method or kinetic wave equation in heqm qoverl qinterf and qbasef are the routings m3 s of overland flow interflow and baseflow whose calculations are adopted from neitsch et al 2011 in heqm qst is the discharge from sewage treatment plants m3 s qp and qcp are the flow routing m3 s and drainage capacity mm in the urban drainage system which are not able to be calculated in heqm it is usually not possible to calculate the flow routing of the drainage system using the hydrodynamic equations because the urban drainage network data is difficult to obtain in china however the drainage network is always designed according to the national industry design standards and specifications of water supply and drainage design bmedi 2004 the drainage capacity of pipeline network could then be deduced according to the related design equations the design precipitation intensity equation is given as 6 pi 8 64 167 a 1 1 a 2 lg pr t pcp b n t pcp t overl m t p 1 m 1 t overl where pi and pr are the design precipitation intensity mm day and return period year respectively a1 mm and a2 are the parameters of precipitation intensity tpcp and b are the design precipitation duration min and its adjusted parameter min respectively n is the precipitation decay parameter toverl and tp are the flow routing durations min in the land surface and drainage network respectively m and m1 are the adjusted parameters of flow routing duration in the drainage network in this equation toverl is determined by the overland slope and length of sub catchment in heqm a1 a2 b n and pr are the related parameters of design precipitation intensity all of which can be obtained according to the design handbook bmedi 2004 in beijing city a1 11 82 mm a2 0 811 b 8 min n 0 711 and pr 2 years the drainage capacity qcp and flow routing qp of pipeline network are estimated as 7 qc p pi c q p k qc p a 86 4 where c is the runoff coefficient which is calculated in eq 3 a is the sub catchment area km2 and k is the coverage factor of drainage network in the sub catchment the above estimation is based on the assumptions that the qp is discharged into nearby river in the same sub catchment rather than other sub catchments and the river s backwater effect on the qcp is also ignored in this simplified flow routing module therefore heqm coupled with eqs 4 7 is able to solve the urban hydrological simulation in the catchments with no drainage system data all the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 in which two related parameters are involved in the simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system i e the adjusted parameter of flow routing duration in the drainage network m1 and the coverage factor of drainage network in the sub catchment k 2 3 2 3 model setup and calibration sixteen sub catchments are delineated for the qing river catchment pan et al 2015 and the six major landuse types mentioned above are considered for each sub catchment as the minimum spatial calculation units the daily observations of precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures are interpolated into all the sub catchments by the inverse distance weighting method the sewage treatment plants and sewage outfalls are also considered according to their geographical positions by directly adding the corresponding sewage discharge amounts into the model based on field investigation one sewage treatment plant was built in the no 1 sub catchment in 2003 discharging 0 2 million m3 day i e 2 31 m3 s of recycled water into the upper qing river the hydrograph at the outlet of the qing river catchment is used for the calibration of the improved heqm the calibration and validation periods are from 2009 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015 respectively and 2008 is the warming period sce ua in the pat module of heqm is adopted to automatically optimize the model parameters in the calibration period with the root mean square error rmse m3 s being the optimization objective function the parameter aggregation approach is adopted for calibration to make full use of spatial variation information without changing the numbers of parameters yang et al 2008 the g1 i and g2 i are calibrated by adjusting the relative amplitudes of the initial parameter values while the other parameters are calibrated by directly replacing the initial parameter values moreover the bias correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency are adopted to further evaluate the simulation performance of heqm the description of evaluation criteria can refer to zhang et al 2016b and the equations are given as 8 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n 9 bias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 10 r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 s i s 2 11 ns 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where bias r and ns are the bias correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively oi and si are the i th observed and simulated runoff m3 s respectively o and s are the average observed and simulated runoff m3 s respectively n is the series length 2 3 3 runoff impact assessments 2 3 3 1 runoff metrics and their variation assessment runoffs at both average and high states are considered at the catchment outlet and in sub catchments for the urbanization impact assessment in term of water resource utilization and flooding control at the outlet the runoff metrics include annual average flow magnitude mfav m3 s annual average flow magnitudes in the wet season mffs m3 s and dry season mfnf m3 s for the average state high flows with the 1st 5th and 10th percentiles mf01 mf05 and mf10 m3 s for the high state at the sub catchment scale the selected metrics include annual average runoff depth rd mm annual average runoff depths in the wet season and dry season rdfs and rdnf mm for the average state annual average runoff depths with the 1th 5th and 10th percentiles rd01 rd05 and rd10 mm for the high state the discrepancies of runoff metrics among different landuse scenarios are adopted to assess the impacts of landuse changes the runoff metrics of each sub catchment are simulated by inputting the landuse maps of 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 scenarios 1 4 individually to drive the calibrated heqm scenario 1 landuse 2000 is set as the baseline and the runoff impact assessment is conducted by comparing the runoff metrics of the other three scenarios with those of scenario 1 2 3 3 2 multivariate statistical approach for impact factor identification rank analysis is a robust approach in multivariate statistics to infer the correlation between two variable sets and identify the critical impact factors and their contributions this approach is commonly used to effectively gain insight into complex data in ecological science social science psychological statistics and so on anderson and willis 2003 shaw 2003 there are two alternative methods for the rank analysis i e non symmetric redundancy analysis rda van den wollenberg 1977 and symmetric canonical correlation analysis cca braak 1986 the suitable method is selected according to the gradient length calculated by the detrended correspondence analysis dca which indicates that if the length is smaller than 3 0 rda is preferred while if the length is between 3 0 and 4 0 both rda and cca are suitable otherwise cca is preferred hill and gauch 1980 lepx and smilauer 2003 the statistical value p for the impact factor detection is set as 0 10 to determine the statistical significance if p 0 10 the impact factor is statistically significant the impact factor is considered to be more important if its determination coefficient r2 with runoff metric changes is larger moreover the corresponding constrained proportion is the contribution to runoff metric changes 3 results 3 1 assessment of landuse change in the qing river catchment the dominating landuse type is the impervious surface which is mainly distributed in the upper and middle stream regions with the area accounting for over 60 of total catchment area and increasing steadily from 2000 to 2015 fig 3 by the end of 2015 the impervious surface reaches 72 4 of total area and increases by 8 9 compared with that of 2000 the most dramatically decreased landuse type is dryland agriculture which is located primarily around the mountainous region the olympic park in the middle stream region and the downstream region the decreasing trend is consistent with a reduction of 12 4 in coverage throughout the whole period and the total coverage is only 2 51 km2 by the end of 2015 the most dramatic decrease is from 2000 to 2005 with a reduction of 9 8 due to the construction of the olympic park in the middle stream region forest and grass occupy 13 5 to 18 3 and 5 1 to 12 0 of total catchment area respectively both of which are primarily located in the mountainous region around the old summer palace and the olympic park these two landuse types slightly increase by 3 0 and 1 4 by the end of 2015 respectively and the most dramatic changing region is in the northern part of the olympic park from 2000 to 2005 water whose area accounts for 2 8 to 3 9 of the total catchment area decreases throughout the whole period particularly in the downstream regions unused land does not change obviously throughout the whole period due to the tiny size of area i e only 0 1 to 0 8 of the total catchment area therefore the main transition of landuse is the changes of dryland agriculture primarily to impervious surface and secondarily to forest and grass for the landuse changes among different sub catchments fig 4 the impervious surface and dryland agriculture decrease while the forest and grass increase in most sub catchments in the upper and middle stream regions from 2000 to 2005 including the zhongguancun science and technology park and the olympic park the zhongguancun science and technology park is a highly developed region with a large building areas and impervious roads as the local government adopts a more citywide outlook more trees and grass are planted moreover the olympic park used to be rural area with primarily dryland agriculture which has changed to forest and grass gradually since the construction of the olympic park the landuse change rates in the olympic park are most dramatic among all the sub catchments with decreasing rates of 24 1 and 46 2 for the impervious surface and dryland agriculture respectively and increasing rates of 26 1 and 23 6 for forest and grass respectively in the northern or downstream sub catchments the dryland agriculture decreases obviously while the impervious surface forest and grass increase among which the change of impervious surface is the most obvious the explanation is that these regions were rural villages in the early 2000s and were gradually built up due to real estate development auxiliary commercial and transport facilities and the constructions of information industrial base and the science park e g shangdi nanqijia the landuse changes are consistent throughout the whole period from 2000 to 2010 the most dramatic changing sub catchments are in the downstream region with an increase rate of 27 2 for impervious surface and a decrease rate of 34 1 for dryland agriculture the grass area also increase obviously particularly in the middle and downstream regions with the rates from 5 4 to 26 3 from 2000 to 2015 the most dramatic changing regions are also in the downstream region with a decrease rate of 34 1 for dryland agriculture and an increase rate of 29 6 for impervious surface the forest and grass areas increase slightly particularly in the middle and downstream regions with the rates from 0 7 to 26 1 for forest and from 5 5 to 14 2 for grass 3 2 performance of catchment hydrological simulation in the calibration period the simulated hydrograph at the catchment outlet matches well with the observations with the bias r and ns being equal to 0 17 0 76 and 0 55 respectively fig 5 a and table 2 in the validation period although the runoff is slightly overestimated bias 0 28 the simulated runoff fits well with the observed runoff with the r and ns of over 0 75 and 0 50 respectively thus the simulation performance is satisfactory moreover compared with the observed annual values of high flow metrics mf01 mf05 and mf10 fig 5b the simulated metrics are also simulated very well with the bias r and ns being equal to 0 22 0 95 and 0 88 respectively therefore the improved heqm captures the runoff variations satisfactorily for both the calibration and validation periods particularly for the high flow events 3 3 impact assessments of urbanization compared with the baseline landuse 2000 all the average flow metrics mfav mffs and mfnf at the catchment outlet do not change obviously with the range from only 2 2 to 0 3 during the whole period fig 6 however the high flow metrics mf01 mf05 and mf10 slightly increase among which the most obvious changing metric is the extreme high flow mf01 with the changes ranging from 1 6 to 1 1 in scenario 2 landuse 2005 from 2 1 to 0 2 in scenario 3 landuse 2010 and from 1 7 to 8 1 in scenario 4 landuse 2015 respectively therefore the combined landuse changes seem not to alter the average flow metrics at the catchment outlet while the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface slightly increase the high flow metrics the changes of runoff metrics at the sub catchment scale are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet fig 7 compared with the baseline the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf in scenario 2 are from 4 2 to 5 0 from 2 7 to 2 7 and from 7 7 to 11 6 respectively the sub catchments having decreasing values are in most regions particularly in the middle stream region e g the olympic park while the sub catchments having increasing values are in the middle stream region the landuse changes from 2000 to 2005 explain 46 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the important impact factor is the impervious surface r 2 0 89 p 0 10 followed by grass r 2 0 58 p 0 10 forest r 2 0 51 p 0 10 and dryland agriculture r 2 0 33 p 0 10 table 3 in scenario 3 the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf are from 4 9 to 3 3 from 2 6 to 2 3 and from 10 9 to 7 6 respectively the number of sub catchments having decreasing values for all the three metrics is less than that of scenario 2 and most of them are also in the upstream regions the sub catchments having increasing values are mostly in the sub catchments of the middle and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2010 only explain 32 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the impervious surface is the only statistically significant impact factor r 2 0 57 p 0 10 in scenario 4 the relative changes of rd rdfs and rdnf are from 3 8 to 3 3 from 1 6 to 1 9 and from 9 3 to 7 4 respectively the sub catchments having decreasing values change to the middle stream regions except rdnf while the sub catchments having increasing values are in the upper and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2015 explain 65 of spatial differences of all the average runoff metrics and the important impact factor is the impervious surface r 2 0 80 p 0 10 followed by dryland agriculture r 2 0 45 p 0 10 and grass r 2 0 43 p 0 10 therefore the most impacted metric is rdnf and the critical impact factor is the impervious surface followed by grass dryland agriculture and forest the average runoff metrics are gradually increased from 2000 to 2015 in the upper and downstream regions which is probably caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and forest to the impervious surface however these metrics are gradually decreased in the middle stream regions which is probably caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and impervious surface to the grass and forest the changes of high flow metrics at the sub catchment scale are also little greater than those of average runoff metrics compared with the baseline the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 2 are from 0 4 to 2 8 from 1 9 to 1 3 and from 2 2 to 2 8 respectively fig 8 the spatial changes of rd01 are quite different from those of rd05 and rd10 rd01 increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and the olympic park while rd05 and rd10 increase in the upper and middle stream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2005 explain 59 of the spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the important impact factor is water r 2 0 56 p 0 10 followed by grass r 2 0 45 p 0 10 dryland agriculture r 2 0 41 p 0 10 and forest r 2 0 35 p 0 10 the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 3 are from 0 6 to 10 5 from 2 2 to 1 1 and from 2 2 to 3 1 respectively rd01 increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and southern sub catchments in the middle stream region while the regions with increasing rd05 and rd10 are in the middle and downstream regions the landuse changes from 2000 to 2010 explain 60 of spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the impervious surface is the only statistically significant impact factor r 2 0 55 p 0 10 the relative changes of rd01 rd05 and rd10 in scenario 4 are from 0 5 to 4 6 from 4 0 to 1 1 and from 1 4 to 2 9 respectively rd01 also increases in most sub catchments except the upper stream region and the olympic park while rd05 and rd10 decrease in most sub catchment except the zhongguancun park and olympic park the landuse changes from 2000 to 2015 explain 57 of spatial differences of all the high flow metrics and the important impact factor is also the impervious surface r 2 0 59 p 0 10 followed by dryland agriculture r 2 0 37 p 0 10 therefore the extreme high flow rd01 for most sub catchments from 2000 to 2015 increases consistently while the changes of rd05 and rd10 are not obvious the critical impact factor is the impervious surface followed by dryland agriculture water grass and forest the probable explanations are that the decrease of high flow metrics are also caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture and impervious surface to the grass and forest while the increase of high flow metrics is caused by the landuse changes from the dryland agriculture to the impervious surface 4 discussion and conclusions with the rapid urbanization the main feature of underlying surface changes in peri urban regions is that the agricultural land is shifted to impervious surface e g buildings paved roads arnold and gibbons 1996 meija and moglen 2010 braud et al 2013b in our study catchment the landuse transition is consistent with the results of these studies the total area of impervious surface increases from 63 5 to 72 4 while the dryland agriculture decreases from 13 9 to 1 5 from 2000 to 2015 the main causes are that the construction of the information industry bases and science parks e g zhongguancun science and technology park and shangdi science park in the upper stream region and nanqijia science park in the downstream region the highly intensive real estate development e g beiyuan residence community in the downstream region and the construction of the olympic venues and facilities in the middle stream region moreover due to the increasing attention of green urban development the green olympics theme for 2008 beijing olympic game and the sponge city several parks are renovated and built by the beijing gardening and greening bureau beijing gardening and greening bureau 2007 beijing gardening and greening bureau 2011 such as the old summer palace the olympic forest park in 2008 and the qingheying country park in 2009 thus the total areas of grass and forest increase slightly whose area percentages increase from 5 1 to 6 5 and from 13 5 to 16 6 respectively a comprehensive assessment of the urbanization impact on runoff metrics is rather complicated due to the diverse types and functions of landuse for example on the one hand the expansion from dryland agriculture to impervious surface clearly increases the runoff yield by reducing precipitation infiltration and shortening flow routing time saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 on the other hand the expansion from dryland agriculture to grass or forest enhances the water retention capacity which likely decreases the runoff yield shang and wilson 2009 additionally the water area is able to generate more runoff because of the high runoff coefficient of water surface and also enhances the storage capacity of water bodies in our study although the impervious surface area increases consistently the constructions of green infrastructures e g grasses trees parks also replace dryland agriculture therefore the combined landuse changes in the whole catchment do not drastically change the average flow metrics at the catchment outlet but increase the high flow metrics marginally such as the extreme high flow with the ranges from 2 1 to 8 1 the other explanation is that as the catchment is located in the northern semi humid region the initial rainfall loss is usually so great that the runoff yield is quite small particularly in the dry season igcas 1980 moreover although the runoff depth metrics tend to have different spatial variations in various scenarios due to the combined runoff responses to the complicated landuse changes these metrics increase at most sub catchments which are mainly in the highly developed regions such as zhongguancun park shangdi science park and beiyuan residence community the most dramatic changing metrics are the runoff depths in the dry season with the ranges from 10 9 to 11 6 and the extreme high flow depths with the ranges from 0 6 to 10 5 our findings about average and high flow assessments are similar with those studies in the qinghuai river basin of china with much greater relative changes of impervious surface 30 du et al 2012 the yzeron catchment france braud et al 2013a and the oshiwara river basin of india in the flooding changes zope et al 2016 therefore urbanization does not change the water resource shortage dramatically but probably increases urban waterlogging and flooding to a certain extent the extreme precipitation event is still the critical trigger of urban waterlogging and flooding such as the event on july 21th 2012 in our study catchment our investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes finds that the catchment hydrological model is improved and applied in the peri urban catchment by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics the modified module provides a simple and feasible solution for the catchment as our study case where no sufficient information about the drainage network available and the model performance is satisfactory by auto optimization technique the assessment results of urbanization impacts on runoff regimes are also reasonable the findings are helpful to clarify the urbanization impacts on hydrological processes in the semi humid cities and can provide scientific support for the sponge city planning and related decision making although the average annual runoff magnitude is not changed obviously more sponge city measures e g grassed swales rain gardens trees should be implemented for water conservation in the sub catchments other sponge city measures e g permeable pavements and green roofs should be gradually spread to replace the traditional impervious surfaces for source control of extreme flooding events moreover the simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system should be extended in order to further distinguish the probable inconsistencies of flow routing paths between pipeline network and river network as well as their interactions the capacities of urban real time monitoring hydrological forecasting and emergency response programs should be strengthened to aid in the management of future extreme weather events acknowledgments this study was

7342,streamflow and sediment loads undergo remarkable changes in worldwide rivers in response to climatic changes and human interferences understanding their variability and the causes is of vital importance regarding river management with respect to the changjiang river cjr one of the largest river systems on earth we provide a comprehensive overview of its hydrological regime changes by analyzing long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of three gorges dam tgd we find profound river discharge reduction during flood peaks and in the wet to dry transition period and slightly increased discharges in the dry season sediment loads have reduced progressively since 1980s owing to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin with notably accelerated reduction since the start of tgd operation in 2003 channel degradation occurs in downstream river leading to considerable river stage drop lowered river stages have caused a draining effect on lakes by fostering lake outflows following tgd impoundments the altered river lake interplay hastens low water occurrence inside the lakes which can worsen the drought given shrinking lake sizes in long term moreover lake sedimentation has decreased since 2002 with less sediment trapped in and more sediment flushed out of the lakes these hydrological changes have broad impacts on river flood and drought occurrences water security fluvial ecosystem and delta safety keywords river discharge streamflow sediment loads changjiang three gorges dam 1 introduction river and sediment discharges in worldwide large rivers are subject to significant changes dominantly reduction because of climate changes and increasing human activities walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 global climate changes induce accelerated hydrosphere circulation resulting in increased frequency of extreme events e g droughts and floods and possibly evoking hydrological and ecological influences at a broader scale xu and singh 2004 ipcc 2013 wmo 2016 arnell and gosling 2013 had modeled and projected that climate changes will cause significant changes in hydrological behavior by 2050 e g streamflow increase for nearly half of the global land surface and decrease over the other 36 of the land surface regional variability is still high because of the uncertainties in the climate models and the non linear regional responses to global changes arnell and gosling 2013 nakaegawa et al 2013 regional case studies can provide perspectives for interpretation of hydrological and climatic changes at global scale human activities in terms of dam constructions water consumption and land use changes exert increasing influences on basin scale hydrological regimes nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 dams are built worldwide to control river floods and store water for irrigation and power generation on the other hand dams can significantly alter hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes in fluvial systems milliman 1997 brandt 2000 walling and fang 2003 graf 2006 for instance at basin scales dam operation regulates river discharge hydrograph by changing the timing magnitude and frequency of low and high flows and disrupts sediment delivery e g the aswan dam in the nile river woodward et al 2007 and the hoover dam in the colorado river graf 2006 at continent scales large artificial reservoirs are able to alter regional climate regarding changes in precipitation and surface evaporation etc particularly in the semi arid regions degu et al 2011 moreover increasing global water storage by man made reservoirs has reduced water volume reaching oceans potentially slowing down global sea level rise by 30 mm in the past half century chao et al 2008 river flow regulation and irrigation at global scales also increase evapotranspiration and water consumption jaramillo and destouni 2015 these evidences demonstrate remarkable regional to global effects of water usage and hydrological regime changes which merit specific examinations the changjiang river cjr also called yangtze river basin in china is such a system undergoing significant hydrological changes under the influences of both climatic changes and human interferences regional climatic changes include changing intensity and behavior of the asian monsoon xu et al 2011a while human activities include increasing water consumption by a booming population more hydropower dams and water transfers etc a number of reports have been devoted to examining changes of precipitation temperature river and sediment discharges in the cjr basin yang et al 2004 2006 gao et al 2013 wei et al 2013 and chen et al 2001b 2016 etc had examined river discharge changes and reported no significant decrease or increase changes at the half century time scale yang et al 2004 2006 2011 2018 wang et al 2007b 2008 hu et al 2009 and xu et al 2009 etc had documented radical sediment load reductions due to the tgd li et al 2013a 2016 dai and lu 2013 xu et al 2013a and zheng 2016 discussed comprehensive impacts of the tgd on the river and sediment discharges and associated ecological environmental and socio economic influences these studies provide useful insights on the hydrological regime changes on the other hand we find that there is inconsistency remained to the author s knowledge for instance yang et al 2006 hu et al 2009 and zhao et al 2017 documented no apparent decrease or increase trend of the annual streamflow at yichang and datong data range 1953 2013 whereas jiang et al 2007 detected a weak decrease trend at yichang and a weak increase trend at datong data range 1961 2005 the different interpretations maybe caused by inconsistent data range and or different analysis methods at different significance levels in addition most previous studies interpreted inter annual changes of streamflow and sediment loads while the seasonal changes were insufficiently examined therefore there is still a demand to clarify hydrological changes by rigorous trend analysis of datasets at annual and seasonal time scales additionally low water conditions low river discharges and low river stages frequently occurred in the middle lower cjr basin downstream of tgd in the recent decade for instance nearly the lowest or the second lowest river stages at a 50 150 year time scale were recorded downstream of cuntan fig 1 in the summer of 2006 dai et al 2011 regional low water occurred successively in 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 in the dongting and poyang lakes fig 1 li et al 2012 this is controversial to that the tgd discharges more water in the dry seasons which is expected to relieve low water occurrence big floods still occurred in the downstream basin after the tgd was constructed rising doubt on the effectiveness of the tgd in mitigating flooding risk there are increasing debates on tgd s negative influences on the downstream basin regarding water resources security and drought and flood hazard and fluvial ecosystems the tgd has been put into operation for 14 years since 2003 and a rigorous assessment of its impacts on the river discharge and sediment delivery processes is needed for integrated river management in this work we review a wide range of publications collect a long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of the tgd and examine them rigorously by trend analysis methods we will clarify the tgd s role in the hydrological changes and elaborate consequent impacts in the river system in the end we identify knowledge gaps in our present understandings the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the cjr basin data source and methods section 3 presents the operation of the tgd section 4 addresses changes with respect to hydro meteorology river and sediment discharges at both seasonal and annual time scales and section 5 discusses causes and implications of the changes with a focus on the river lake interactions the last section formulates conclusions and briefs knowledge gaps 2 setting data and method 2 1 the changjiang river basin the cjr stretching west eastward in the middle china is one of the world longest rivers of great ecological and socio economic importance it has a mainstem length of 6 300 000 m a basin area of 1900 billion m2 19 5 of china s land area an annual streamflow of 903 4 billion m3 37 of china s total streamflow and an annual sediment load of 414 million tons between 1950 and 2005 at datong yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007b the cjr is home to 480 million people indicating its critical role on socio economic development chen et al 2001b xu et al 2008 the cjr basin is geographically divided into the upper middle and lower sub basins and the delta regions with divisions at yichang jiujiang and datong respectively based on landscape fig 1 the upper basin has a high relief and is mountainous and the main sediment source region while the middle lower basin consists of vast fluvial flood plains and its mainstream channel is a conduit conveying sediment to the sea the tgd is about 40 km upstream of yichang upstream of the tgd cuntan is the main gauge station where the tgd inflows are monitored another new dam the xiangjiaba dam which has a flood control capacity of 0 9 billion m3 and is 408 km upstream of cuntan was constructed and put into operation since 2012 downstream of the tgd yichang shashi jianli luoshan hankou jiujiang and datong are the major gauge stations along the mainstream in the downward direction fig 1 the annually mean river discharges are 10 870 13 620 28 400 m3 s at cuntan yichang and datong respectively a number of big tributaries scatter in the cjr basin such as the wu river the han river and the dongting lake and poyang lake systems fig 1 the dongting lake receives flows from four secondary tributaries and conjuncts the cjr mainstream at chenglingji in addition there are three inlets diverting mainstream water and sediment into the dongting lake in the wet seasons fig 1 the poyang lake has five secondary tributaries and conjuncts the cjr mainstream at hukou reverse flows i e flows from the cjr mainstream to the poyang lake can happen at hukou occasionally in the wet seasons the water and sediment exchanges between the lakes and mainstream play a profound role in buffering hydrological changes the cjr basin has a basin wide mean annual precipitation of 1100 mm and the precipitation exhibits strong spatiotemporal variations owing to asian monsoon wang et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation is 270 500 mm in the upper basin and 1 600 1900 mm in the middle lower basin gemmer et al 2008 temporally rainfall concentrates in the wet seasons between may and september and as a result a major portion of streamflow 75 and sediment loads 85 are discharged in the wet seasons chen et al 2001b spatially the prime rainy season is between may and october in the upper cjr basin one to two month lagging the rainy season in the middle lower basin i e between march and august jiang et al 2007 guo et al 2011 extreme floods or droughts are likely to happen if wet or dry climate occurs occasionally in the same season between the upper and middle lower basins such as the big river floods in the summer of 1954 and 1998 zong and chen 2000 and the severe droughts in the autumn of 2006 dai et al 2011 the highest flood peak discharges ever recorded are 105 000 m3 s at yichang in 1870 and 92 600 m3 s at datong in 1954 catastrophic floods impose huge risks on the densely populated flood plains downstream of yichang and there was an idea of constructing the tgd to control big floods many decades ago 2 2 data we collect hydro meteorological data including air temperature precipitation daily river discharges and water levels monthly and yearly streamflow and sediment loads at multiple stations along the mainstream downward cuntan and at the mouths of the tributaries and lakes fig 1 air temperature and precipitation data are collected from publications ncc 2011 sang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 daily river discharges and water levels http xxfb hydroinfo gov cn and the inflow and outflow of the tgd http www ctgpc com cn are obtained from official websites the monthly and yearly streamflow and sediment loads are from government bulletins e g cwrm 2006 2016 the annual streamflow and sediment loads data date back to 1950s and the daily river discharges and water levels date back to 1980s annually mean river discharges annually minimum and maximum monthly river discharges are also collected at yichang 1878 1986 hankou 1865 1986 and datong 1948 1986 from a global river discharge data base http www compositerunoff sr unh edu fekete et al 2002 preliminary analysis suggest that the data from the global data base are consistent with the officially published data in the overlap period 1950 1986 with a mean deviation 1 note that the annually minimum monthly discharge is not the same as the minimum 30 day averaged discharge the river discharge and sediment loads differences between the inflow that at cuntan plus wulong and outflow that at yichang of the tgd are used to indicate its regulation effects the streamflow differences between the inflow and outflow during tgd s impounding periods are taken as the amount of water stored by the reservoir when assuming limited water loss to evaporation and groundwater etc only surface flow is taken into account while groundwater and its exchange with surface water and evaporation are not analyzed in this work as a first approximate sediment loads are represented by suspended sediment transport while bed load is excluded in this study it is because bed load transport accounts for a small proportion 5 of the total load transport at cuntan for instance the annual bed load is 0 1 0 6 million tons prior 2000 and is 0 1 million tons afterward fang and dong 2011 the bed load transport flux is much smaller compared to suspended load downstream of yichang chen et al 2010 it is technically difficult to monitor bed load transport accurately in fluvial sandy environments and data in that sense is scarce 2 3 trend analysis methods we first apply change point analysis taylor 2000 to the normalized discharge anomaly to test non linear trend e g monotonic non linear plateau through peak rapid changes the cumulative function s whose values si are defined as s i s i 1 x x i while xi i 1 2 n is the time series of normalized anomaly and x is the mean value a potential change point is detected when a change in the direction of the s function occurs whose interval of occurrence is defined by the parameter sdiff max s min s statistical significance of the identified change points is verified by using a bootstrapping technique at a 5 significance level castino et al 2016 it is achieved by randomly resampling to remove any potential change point m times m 103 in this analysis 104 and the statistics for the parameter sdiff is generated the level of significance is given by the percentage of bootstrap cycles for which the synthetic sdiff parameter is greater than the observed one once a primary statistically significant change point is obtained the same procedure is applied to the sub time series of the x variable before and after the change point to search for secondary change points this iterative procedure is applied as long as statistically significant change points are detected castino et al 2016 preliminary tests show that the change point timing is independent of the normalization reference period thus the mean value in the interval of 1950 1985 considering that the mid 1980s is a visual changing point of annual streamflow and sediment load at most stations see section 4 for details is used in this study if not specified in particular note that the detected change points may not locate at an exact year but around some year when the changes are not sharp we then apply linear regression analysis to the normalized anomaly of streamflow and sediment loads to detect linear trends and change rates on both sides of the change points student s t test and mann kendall mk test at 5 significance level are used to determine the statistical significance of the linear trend mann 1945 kendall 1975 details of the linear trend analysis methods can be found in literatures thus are not repeated here 3 tgd operation in this section we provide a brief overview of tgd operation and its effects on river discharge hydrograph the tgd was constructed from 1993 to 2009 with a dam height of 185 m above mean sea level and a dam length of 2335 m the tgd forms a reservoir stretching about 600 000 m between the dam site and cuntan fig 1 and with a surface area of 1084 million m2 which was 452 million m2 under no tgd situation a total storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 15 billion m3 at a high pool level of 175 m the flood control capacity is 5 of the annual streamflow at yichang i e annually 451 0 billion m3 between 1950 and 2005 the tgd has generated a hydropower output of averagely 88 2 billion kilowatt hours per year in the past 14 years flood control power generation and promoting irrigation and navigation are its essential functions the tgd operation follows a scheme by storing and flushing water seasonally rising water level ahead the dam wlad suggests larger inflow than outflow and tgd impoundments while falling wlad indicates larger outflow than inflow and water release figs 2 and s1 specifically the wlad maintains at a low level of 145 m between june and september the wet season sustaining the flood control volume available for occasional river floods forming in the upper basin with a peak discharge 55 000 m3 s zheng 2016 since early october when the wet season ends the tgd will reduce outflow and store water for hydropower generation until the wlad reaches 175 m the wlad will stay at 175 m until january after which the wlad drops gradually until june when the wet season begins overall the tgd operation reflects a flood control scheme which is designed to control river floods and to store water for hydropower generation zheng 2016 regarding reservoir sedimentation management the tgd operation reflects a strategy of storing clear water in the dry season with a high pool level and releasing muddy water in the wet seasons with a low pool level even though reservoir sedimentation is still huge in its early stage of lifespan because of a large reservoir size see section 5 3 the realistic tgd operations follow the abovementioned scheme other than that the starting time of its impoundments is 1 2 months earlier than october fig 2 specifically the tgd started to store water the first time in may of 2003 and the wlad was raised from 67 to 135 m in the second phase of its pilot operation the wlad was raised from 135 to 156 m in october of 2006 in the third phase the wlad was raised from 145 to 172 m in 2008 given concerns of the safety of the dam and the influences on the downstream basin the wlad did not reach 175 m until 2010 the first time fig 2 since then the tgd is put into normal operation with a seasonally and regularly raised and dropped pool level so far we see that tgd impoundments in autumn last for a period of 37 90 days table 1 we compare tgd s inflow and outflow hydrographs to quantify its impacts on river discharges it shows that the peak river discharges of the outflow are up to 20 000 m3 s smaller in a short period of days to weeks reflecting tgd s capability in mitigating big floods see fig s2 in the appendix the outflow during the impounding periods in autumn is averagely reduced by 2790 5880 m3 s table 1 by adding the stored water to the actually measured streamflow at yichang and datong during the impounding periods we estimate that the mean streamflow is reduced by 11 32 and 7 20 respectively by contrast the outflow is averagely 2000 m3 s larger than the inflow in the dry months between january and may see fig s2 overall the tgd modulates river discharge hydrograph by reducing flood peak discharges and river discharges during the impounding periods and slightly increasing river discharges in the dry seasons 4 results 4 1 hydro meteorological changes this section describes hydro meteorological changes in terms of air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the nation wide daily maximum temperature is increasing in china since 1980s owing to changes in the asian monsoon indicating a warm trend kuang et al 2014 in the cjr basin the basin wide mean air temperature decreases slightly between 1950 and 1985 followed by a fast increase trend indicating climatic warming as well figs 3 a and s3a chen et al 2001a sang et al 2012 linear trend analysis reveals an increase rate of 0 45 c per decade between 1985 and 2010 for the cjr basin as a whole figs 3a and s3a the precipitation exhibits large spatial and temporal variations in the cjr basin wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the basin averaged precipitation shows a significant decrease trend between 1950 and 2015 p 0 02 i e a decrease rate of 13 mm per decade figs 3b and s3b similar decrease at decadal time scales occurs in the upper cjr basin particularly in the interval of 1950 1970 while the afterward decrease trend is non significant seasonally summer precipitation displays an increase trend while autumn precipitation decreases significantly particularly since the mid 1980s becker et al 2006 in contrast a significant decrease of summer precipitation occurs in the upper cjr basin jiang et al 2007 gemmer et al 2008 deng et al 2013 the basin wide precipitation becomes more concentrated in time i e increased precipitation intensity in short durations becker et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 regarding evaporation both annual reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation show a significant decrease trend between 1960 and 2007 which is ascribed to decreasing net total radiation and wind speed xu et al 2006 wang et al 2011 the decrease in evapotranspiration is more significant in summer and in the middle lower basin wang et al 2007a 2011 in the middle lower cjr basin the annual reference evapotranspiration also decreases significantly between 1960 and early 1990s mainly due to declined net radiation followed by an afterward slight increase which is ascribed to reduced relative humidity in the air xing et al 2016 as an evaporation source the large reservoir formed by tgd potentially has impacts on regional climate considering its surface cooling effects and reduced radiative heating the impacts diminish fast with distance away from the reservoir and so far measurable but non significant air temperature decrease is detected in the regions surrounding the reservoir miller et al 2005 wu et al 2012 data and modeling results suggest that the reservoir s impact on basin scale climate is overall limited ncc 2011 wu et al 2012 further monitor and in depth examination is needed to clarify the degree to which the large reservoirs formed by tgd and other new big dams in the upper cjr basin can affect regional and sub basin climate when looking forward into the future sun et al 2013 modeled that the temperature will increase and the annual rainfall will decrease in the upper cjr basin in the 21st century as a result of climatic warming nakaegawa et al 2013 predicted that the streamflow of the cjr basin may increase in the wet seasons between may and august if considering climate change impacts only considering the uncertainties in the model projections birkinshaw et al 2017 and the land use changes in the future it remains an open question how the basin scale hydro meteorology will change in response to climate changes and human activities 4 2 river discharge changes 4 2 1 annual streamflow changes the annual streamflow exhibits only slight decrease trends along the mainstream downward tgd at cuntan a non significant change point p 0 11 is detected in 1968 based on data between 1940 and 2015 figs 4 a and s4a the change points detected in 1954 and 1968 however are significant p 0 02 at yichang figs 4b and s4a there are no significant directional changes prior 1954 but an afterward decrease trend by a rate of 4 8 billion m3 per decade between 1955 and 2015 over century the annual streamflow decreases from averagely 455 8 billion m3 in 1878 1954 to 402 6 billion m3 in 2003 2015 at yichang indicating a reduction by 11 7 at hankou the annual streamflow decreases from averagely 750 2 billion m3 in 1865 1954 to 696 7 billion m3 in 1955 2015 but the change point detected in 1954 is non significant p 0 21 figs 4c and s4b similarly the change point in 1954 is non significant at datong though the data length is shorter figs 4d and s4c the change point in the early 2000s is non significant at both yichang and datong p 0 18 suggesting limited impacts of the tgd on the annual streamflow in the interval of 1955 2015 the decrease trends of the annual streamflow are significant at cuntan p 0 01 and yichang p 0 02 whereas it is non significant at hankou p 0 08 0 6 billion m3 per decade and datong p 0 14 6 9 billion m3 per decade more temporal streamflow changes are detected in the tributaries based on data between 1950 and 2015 in the dongting lake system the total streamflow of the three inlets exhibits significant decrease change points in the late 1960s p 0 01 and early 2000s p 0 05 figs 5 a and s5a specifically it decreases from 134 2 billion m3 in 1956 1968 to 48 6 billion m3 in 2001 2015 a reduction by 64 with no directional changes of the total streamflow of the four tributaries the streamflow at chenglingji has decreased significantly between 1950 and 1970 p 0 003 followed by a non significant decrease trend until 2015 i e from 338 3 billion m3 in 1951 1968 to 241 3 billion m3 in 2001 2015 no significant change points are detected on the time series of annual streamflow at huangzhuang hukou and poyang lake tributaries fig 5b and c the total streamflow of the poyang lake tributaries and that at hukou exhibits consistent temporal variations figs 5b and s5b linear trend analyses suggest significant streamflow decrease trends at chenglingji p 0 0001 three inlets p 0 0001 and huangzhuang p 0 03 in 1950 2015 while the decrease trends for dongting lake tributaries p 0 81 and the increasing trends at hukou p 0 60 and poyang lake tributaries p 0 66 are non significant in all the total streamflow of the dongting lake the han river and poyang lake represented by the summed streamflow at chenglingji huangzhuang and hukou minus that at three inlets exhibits a non significant increase trend p 0 27 figs 5c and s5c 4 2 2 seasonal river discharge changes river discharge may change remarkably at intra annual time scales when the annual streamflow remains unchanged the annually minimum monthly discharges not necessarily in the same month in different years increase substantially in the recent decades the minimum monthly discharges are slightly smaller in 1940 2000 compared to 1880 1940 at yichang figs 6 a and s6a a significant change point is present at both cuntan and yichang in 1999 the abrupt increase at yichang since 2007 is ascribed to tgd operation while the abrupt increase at cuntan since 2012 is caused by xiangjiaba dam specifically the annually minimum monthly discharges have increased by up to 3000 m3 s at yichang while the differences between cuntan and yichang increase sharply from averagely 800 m3 s 1940 1999 to 1900 m3 s 2007 2015 it suggests that the tgd flushes nearly 2000 m3 s more water downstream in the driest months the annually minimum monthly discharge starts to increase since 1900s at hankou and the afterward increase rate becomes larger with a significant change point in 1954 p 0 001 fig s6b similar increase is observed at datong since the late 1950s figs 6a and s6c i e an increase from averagely 9260 m3 s 1960 1980 to 12 000 m3 s 2007 2015 the changes since 2007 are less noticeable at both hankou and datong compared to yichang suggesting downward dissipated changes the annually maximum monthly discharge exhibits more spatial and temporal changes it changes limitedly at cuntan since 1960 whereas a stepwise reduction in late 1950s and a linear reduction trend since 1980s are detected at yichang figs 6b and s7a the maximum monthly discharges are averagely 3400 m3 s smaller at yichang in 2001 2015 compared to 1955 2000 they are slightly smaller in the decades since 2000 compared to the prior decades at hankou and datong figs s7b and s7c higher streamflow in the 1990s affects the trend detection at hankou and datong and it is too early to conclude whether the decrease trend since 2000 is significant the mean river discharges in october exhibit decrease trends the october river discharges decrease slightly since 1980 at cuntan figs 6c and s8a the decrease trend is at a faster rate at yichang than cuntan in the decades since 1980 and the october river discharges become smaller at yichang since 2006 implying the impacts of tgd impoundments in autumn specifically it declines from 19 800 m3 s in 1890 1954 to 11 000 m3 s in 2006 2015 at yichang similarly the october river discharges reduce significantly since 1960s at both hankou and datong figs s8b and s8c e g from 33 600 m3 s in 1960 1980 to 23 800 m3 s in 2006 2015 at datong we further estimate the probability distributions of daily river discharges at cuntan yichang and datong to infer seasonal changes notably we find that the probability of both extremely low and high river discharges has decreased while that of medium river discharges e g river discharges in the range of 10 000 25 000 m3 s at datong has increased at all three stations fig 7 a the river discharge at the 50th percentile reduces accordingly fig 7b the mean river discharge hydrographs show that the low river discharges in the dry seasons slightly increase while the high river discharges in the wet seasons decrease profoundly see fig s9 the river discharge reduction is much more significant at yichang and datong than cuntan between august and october again demonstrating the impacts of tgd impoundments overall these results suggest that the river discharge hydrograph of tgd inflow is ever changing and the tgd operation modulates it at a seasonal time scale 4 3 changes of sediment loads 4 3 1 sediment loads changes along the mainstream the sediment loads in the cjr basin exhibit radical decreases at the decadal time scales particularly since 1980s significant change points are detected in the early 1990s p 0 004 and early 2000s p 0 012 at both cuntan plus wulong to represent sediment influx of tgd and yichang figs 8 a and s10 the sediment loads variations display consistent behavior between cuntan and yichang in the decades prior 2002 though it is slightly larger at yichang since 2003 the sediment loads become smaller at yichang and the differences between cuntan and yichang become larger reflecting sediment trapping effects of the tgd specifically the summed sediment loads at cuntan and wulong have not changed very much between 1950 and mid 1980s annually 487 6 231 9 million tons but decreased to 164 4 131 3 million tons in 2003 2015 indicating a reduction by 66 immediately downstream of the tgd the sediment loads are 527 2 221 4 and 40 4 69 6 million tons in 1950 1985 and 2003 2015 respectively at yichang indicating a reduction by 92 the dramatic reduction reflects combined effects of a source reduction upstream of cuntan and tgd sedimentation in all these changes suggest that the sediment loads have reduced progressively since the mid 1980s and the tgd accelerates the reduction since 2003 at a remarkable rate the sediment loads downstream of yichang follow the reduction trend but at a smaller rate at hankou not shown the sediment loads have decreased from 431 3 167 8 1953 1985 to 105 9 68 1 million tons 2003 2015 suggesting a reduction by 75 further downstream at datong it decreases from annually 470 4 207 6 million tons in 1951 1985 to 138 7 77 3 million tons in 2003 2015 suggesting a reduction by 70 over time four statistically significant change points are detected in the late 1960s p 0 04 mid 1980s p 0 05 early 1990s p 0 02 and early 2000s p 0 001 at datong more variability at datong than yichang is ascribed to superimposed changes occurred in the upper and middle lower cjr basins see section 5 3 in the near future decades the annual sediment loads at yichang are highly likely to remain at a low level 10 million tons considering ongoing dam constructions in the upper basin fig s10 with sediment compensation from tributaries and bed erosion see section 5 3 the sediment loads at hankou and datong seem to have reached a decadal stable state i e annually averaged 88 2 and 126 1 million tons respectively in 2006 2016 it is reasonably expected that the sediment loads will not restore to a mean value larger than that in future at hankou and datong and further reduction may occur considering diminished river erosion downstream of tgd 4 3 2 sediment loads changes in the main tributaries the sediment loads of the main tributaries in the middle cjr basin have reduced profoundly as well the total sediment loads of the four tributaries of the dongting lake system exhibit non significant changes between 1950 and the mid 1980s except the extreme peak in 1954 but decrease abruptly in the mid 1980s followed by a slow decrease trend until nowadays figs 8b and s11a the annual sediment loads are 35 2 23 5 17 8 11 4 and 8 0 4 5 million tons in the interval of 1953 1984 1985 2005 and 2006 2015 respectively at the three inlets the sediment loads display three significant change points in the late 1960s mid 1980s and early 2000s it decreases from averagely 200 2 59 4 million tons in 1956 1968 to 118 2 59 5 64 7 87 6 and 6 5 6 8 million tons in 1969 1984 1985 2005 and 2006 2015 respectively accordingly significant change points of sediment loads reduction are detected in the early 1970s p 0 001 early 1980 p 0 008 and mid 2000 s p 0 001 at chenglingji figs 8b and s11a the sediment loads have decreased from averagely 62 5 22 5 million tons in 1951 1970 to 22 1 7 5 million tons in 2008 2015 note that slightly more sediment is flushed out of the dongting lake at chenglingji in 2008 2015 compared to the previous decade fig s11a the sediment balance between the mainstream and the dongting lake is reversed around 2006 the cjr mainstream diverted more sediment to the lake via the three inlets than its gain from the lake via chenglingji prior 2006 fig s11a the imbalance diminished over time due to more dramatic sediment loads reduction at the three inlets specifically the cjr mainstream annually lost a net of 136 3 56 1 and 48 1 72 1 million tons of sediment to the dongting lake in 1956 1966 and 1990 2000 respectively in the recent decade since 2006 the cjr mainstream has an annual sediment surplus of 16 1 7 7 million tons regarding its exchange with the lake fig s11b with respect to the dongting lake lake sedimentation and sediment surplus occurs prior 2006 because of more sediment sources from lake tributaries and three inlets than loss at chenglingji but it shifts to afterward lake erosion because of more sediment loss than the total sediment supply similar changes are observed in the poyang lake system the total sediment loads from five tributaries of the poyang lake show no directional changes between the mid 1950s and mid 1980s but a significant decrease trend p 0 001 between the late 1970s and late 2000s fig s11c it is averagely 16 2 12 4 million tons in 1956 1984 and 6 0 6 9 millions in 2001 2015 the sediment loads at hukou have decreased gradually between 1970 and 2000 and displayed an abrupt increase in 2001 p 0 007 figs 8c and s11c the mean sediment loads are 14 1 8 3 6 2 5 6 and 12 2 6 6 million tons in the decades of 1952 1962 1990 2000 and 2001 2015 respectively as a result the poyang lake receives less sediment supply from its tributaries comparing to its loss to the mainstream at hukou since 2000 suggesting a shift from lake sedimentation to erosion as well the sediment loads of the han river show two significant change points i e in the late 1960s p 0 04 and late 1980s p 0 02 figs 8c and s11d the mean sediment loads are 119 4 112 6 million tons in 1951 1964 but reduce sharply after the closure of the danjiangkou dam in the upper han river in 1965 and decline further to a relatively small quantity in the recent decade i e averagely 5 8 11 3 million tons in 2001 2015 the total sediment loads of the three main tributaries undergo dramatic decreases and exhibit strong temporal changes from a sediment budget point of view the cjr mainstream loses more sediment to the dongting lake than its total gain from the two lakes and the han river prior 2001 other than the extreme years fig s11d the late 1960s is featured by maximal net loss due to dramatically reduced sediment loads from the han river the cjr mainstream attains a net sediment surplus in the recent decade since 2002 which is mainly because of reduced sediment loss via the three inlets and increased sediment loads at both lake mouths i e chenglingji and hukou the net sediment surplus is 30 5 million tons per year in the interval of 2003 2015 4 3 3 seasonal changes of sediment loads sediment loads also change profoundly at seasonal time scales basically 85 of annual sediment loads are discharged between may and october in the middle lower cjr river because of higher precipitation and associated higher river discharge and higher sediment yield in the wet seasons fig 9 the sediment loads in the wet seasons however have decreased enormously in the recent decade since 2003 while the reduction in the dry seasons is less measurable specifically the sediment loads in the wet season are 456 5 425 3 96 of annual total and 364 7 361 7 millions tons 87 of annual total at yichang and datong respectively in the interval of 1950 2002 they decrease to 43 2 113 7 98 of annual total and 111 1 112 6 million tons 80 of annual total in 2003 2015 respectively fig 9 tgd sedimentation is the main reason of the dramatic reduction in the wet seasons see discussion in section 5 3 4 3 4 sediment rating curves the sediment rating curves imply changes out of phase between the streamflow and sediment loads we see that the lower crj mainstream i e at datong is overall much less sediment loaded compared to yichang and cuntan fig 10 a over time it becomes increasingly less sediment loaded at all three stations in the mainstream due to strikingly reduced sediment loads in the tributaries the han river and the three inlets are characterized by a higher sediment loading rate while the outflows of the dongting and poyang lakes are much less sediment loaded the annual sediment loads of the han river and at the three inlets have decreased significantly considering streamflow reduction at a smaller rate while the changes at chenglingji and hukou are comparatively less apparent because sedimentation and or erosion inside the lakes have buffering impacts on sediment flux at the lake mouths in all these changes suggest that the cjr downstream of the tgd becomes much less sediment loaded in the decades since the mid 1980s due to more remarkable reduction of sediment loads compared to streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity to data range in inferring long term changes the length of a data series has considerable impacts on interpretation of hydrological changes for instance the significant change point of the annual streamflow at yichang and hankou in 1954 is detected based on data in 1865 2015 which is however not revealed by datasets in 1950 2015 see fig 4b linear trend analysis of the streamflow at datong shows a slight but non significant decrease trend based on data in 1950 2015 whereas it exhibits a non significant increase trend in 1955 2015 the later is more reasonable given a significant change point in 1954 the extreme values e g much higher streamflow in 1954 and the late 1990s influence the trend analysis results too the sediment loads changes at datong provide another example of the sensitivity to data range the time series of annual sediment loads at datong do not show an apparent decrease or increase trend between 1950 and 1970 but a decrease trend is detected between the early 1960s and late 1990s as well as a much faster decrease trend between 1980 and 2015 see figs 8a and s10 these evidences explain why inconsistent interpretation was obtained by using data of different length in previous studies 5 2 river lake interplay and its hydrological impacts the interactions between the cjr mainstream and the two lakes in terms of water and sediment exchanges play an essential role on the hydrological regime downstream of the tgd hu et al 2007 guo et al 2011 ou et al 2012 diversion of water and sediment from the mainstream to the dongting lake via the three inlets is only observed in the wet seasons when river stages in mainstream are higher than the bed level at the inlets the diverted amount of water and sediment has reduced significantly because of lowered river stage in the mainstream and sedimentation in the inlet channels the former is partly caused by bed erosion due to sediment starvation at the year to decade time scale and by decreased river discharges at the seasonal time scale with non significant change of total streamflow from the lake tributaries the streamflow reduction at three inlets explains 89 of streamflow reduction at chenglingji in 2002 2015 compared to 1951 1968 see section 4 2 interactions between mainstream and poyang lake have changed considerably as well the poyang lake discharges water and sediment towards the mainstream and the mainstream has a backwater effect on the lake outflows most of the time in a year course guo et al 2011 reverse flow happens in the wet seasons between july and september when the cjr is at a river stage higher than that in the poyang lake river stage differences occur because of earlier start and ending of the rainy season in the middle lower basin than that in the upper cjr basin as mentioned in section 2 1 the magnitude and frequency of the reverse flow at hukou however have decreased profoundly even vanished in the recent decade guo et al 2011 zhang et al 2012b c in the mean time the annual streamflow at hukou has changed little between 1950 and 2015 see fig s5b it is because the reverse flow is overall limited compared to the total streamflow of the lake tributaries while the later exhibits no directional changes the river lake interactions are inherently controlled by river stages in the vicinity of river lake conjunctions there are highly linear correlationships between the river stages in the mainstream and at the lake mouth such as that between luoshan and chenglingji and that between jiujiang and hukou see fig s12 it implies that water level falling in the mainstream will induce synchronized water level drops at the lake mouth thus lowering the backwater effect guo et al 2011 mei et al 2016 river stages along the mainstream fall because of seasonal river discharge decreases and channel degradation xu et al 2011b dai and liu 2013 channel degradation is evidenced by river bank erosion and bed scour xia et al 2016 and by changed river discharge river stage rating curves river stages are falling under the same river discharge at yichang and shashi particularly under low and medium river discharges see fig s13 for instance the river stage under a river discharge of 10 000 m3 s drops from 43 8 m in 1960 to 42 7 m in 1990 42 1 in 2005 and 41 3 m in 2015 at yichang falling river stages in the mainstream cause consequent water level drop at the lake mouths enlarging the water level gradients in the river lake vicinity dai et al 2015 the enlarged water level gradients foster faster lake outflow which is in particular significant in the wet to dry transition season following tgd impoundments see fig s14 it creates a draining effect on the lake outflow resulting in decreased water storage inside the lakes and lowered lake stage the slightly increased river discharges along the mainstream in the dry seasons by the tgd may reinforce the backwater effects on the lake outflow but it is not able to restore water storage inside the lakes as a consequence low water occurrence is advanced in time e g by 20 days in the dongting lake fig 11 moreover there are non significant decreasing trends of precipitation zhang et al 2011 and reference evapotranspiration ye et al 2014 in autumn in the poyang lake basin these changes augment the low water regime and can cause severe droughts in the dry seasons lake size shrinkage in long term further endangers water resources security in the lakes the annually mean water levels at chenglingji have increased between 1960s and 1990s but underwent a switch to decline since 2000s duan et al 2012 similarly the mean water levels at hukou and xingzi a stage station 38 km more inside the poyang lake compared to hukou have increased between 1960 and 2000 and switched to an afterward decline mei et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 it is estimated that one meter water level drop will induce a surface area reduction and water storage volume shrinking by approximately 200 440 million m2 and 1 3 1 9 billion m3 respectively in the dongting lake according to the water level lake area and water level storage volume curves ding and li 2011 the yearly averaged surface area of the dongting lake has decreased from 4350 km2 in 1949 to 2518 km2 in 1998 and 1837 km2 in 2006 chen et al 2001a feng et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the surface area of the poyang lake has decreased from 5160 km2 in 1954 to 3860 km2 in 1992 at a water level of 22 m at hukou min 2000 in fact the water level at hukou rarely exceeds 22 m in the recent decade when the yearly averaged lake area is only 1740 520 km2 feng et al 2012 lake sedimentation and extensive reclamation of the low lying lands are the main causes of the lake shrinkage on the other hand extensive sand mining inside the lakes lai et al 2014 and a sediment balance shift from lake sedimentation to erosion see section 4 3 may slow down the shrink trend to some degree anyhow reduced lake area and storage volume at a decadal time scale implies degenerated function of the lakes in buffering intra annual river discharge changes along the mainstream lake size reduction seasonal river discharge decline and associated draining effects enhance low water occurrence and severity inside the lakes given that it is dry season following tgd impoundments hastened and persistent low water conditions impair water security and riparian ecosystem in the lakes the wetlands in the dongting lake and poyang lake as valuable habitats for fishes and migratory birds in the eastern asia are exposed for longer time particularly in the dry seasons between october and march xu et al 2013b sun et al 2012 mei et al 2016 in october 2006 and may 2011 for instance the wet surface area of the poyang lake is estimated by merely 50 km2 due to persistent low water level zhang et al 2012b feng et al 2013 as a result it causes enormous growth of pioneer species such as poplar and over reproduction of microtus fortis etc endangering lake ecosystem as valuable natural reserves chang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 xu et al 2013b to protect the lakes from drying measures such as constructing sluices at the lake mouths to control lake outflow are under debating wang et al 2015 but it remains insufficiently known how such a sluice will change the river lake interactions further and has impacts on sediment imbalance flooding risk and lake water quality etc and integrated research work is needed to sort out nature based solutions the river lake interplay also plays an important role in mitigating flood risk in the middle lower cjr basin the tgd can proactively reduce outflow when its inflow is 55 000 m3 s thus protecting the downstream basin particularly the reaches between yichang and luoshan from big floods formed in the upper basin for instance the inflow of tgd was as large as 70 000 m3 s in july of 2010 and 2012 while the outflow was reduced to 50 000 m3 s see fig s2 in addition the tgd can reactively reduce outflow when the downstream basin encounters floods thus lowering mainstream river stage and providing beneficial conditions for downstream floods flushing by that the tgd is able to prevent occurrence of 1 100 probability disastrous floods as that in 1954 and 1998 in the downstream basin even though the tgd can not regulate regional river floods within the lake systems caused by local strong rain storms the effects of tgd in mitigating basin scale big floods need to be evaluated in long term and shall not be underestimated and overestimated the above discussion suggests that it is not only the magnitude of river discharge but also its frequency timing duration and rate of change that matters in basin scale hydrological processes as the tgd may be obligated to keep the pool level as high as early and as long as possible for more hydropower generation by advancing impoundment and slowing flushing li et al 2013b integrated management considering flood control power generation outflow reduction and resultant influences on the downstream basin is of pivotal importance the successive droughts occurred in recent years remind that low water management is also badly needed other than flood risk mitigation 5 3 causes of the hydrological changes 5 3 1 causes of streamflow changes natural hydro meteorological changes and human activities are generally two main forces driving hydrological changes at river basin scales we see that the basin wide air temperature has increased since the mid 1980s chen et al 2001a sang et al 2012 and precipitation has decreased since 1950s and evaporation rate is decreasing since 1960s wang et al 2011 at century time scales the actual evapotranspiration and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation has increased in 1955 2008 compared to 1901 1954 in the cjr basin i e by 30 mm per year and 0 06 per year respectively jaramillo and destouni 2015 which may explain the detected change point in 1954 and the afterward streamflow reduction see figs 4 and s4 there are attempts to isolate the impacts of natural climate changes and human interferences on the streamflow variations for instance there is a well established correlationship between basin wide averaged precipitation and streamflow at datong suggesting a dominant role of precipitation on streamflow changes yang et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 similarly wang et al 2013 inferred that rainfall variations may explain 29 of streamflow changes in the cjr basin between 1970 and 2008 note that there is large variability in the relationship between precipitation and streamflow thus consideration of both precipitation and evapotranspiration is necessary to isolate meteorological controls on streamflow changes human interferences play an increasingly significant role in modulating the hydrological regime annual water consumption consumptive use of water resources for agriculture and industry and domestic purposes has increased from 15 to 90 billion m3 between 1949 and 2000 due to booming economy and population within the cjr basin mwr 1997 2005 xu et al 2007 the ongoing south to north water transfer project withdraws annually 18 3 billion m3 of surface water out of the cjr basin to the north china since 2014 and the total diversion capacity will be 44 8 billion m3 per year after completion of the project in the near future osnwdpcc 2016 the number of hydropower dams has increased exponentially since 1950s reaching 50 000 nowadays yang et al 2011 the total reservoir storage capacity has increased markedly reaching 200 billion m3 by 2003 yang et al 2004 with 55 69 billion m3 in the upper basin by 2005 wei et al 2011 the dams recently constructed and under constructions in the upper basin are not yet included increasing water consumption and water withdrawal causes net reduction of streamflow while the dams mainly modulate the timing and magnitude of river discharges we see that the seasonal streamflow changes are more profound compared to the inter annual changes and human activities are ascribed to be the main cause of that 5 3 2 causes of sediment loads changes sediment loads changes are very much influenced by human activities rainfall variations affect sediment yield through surface erosion sediment source while the later is also influenced by human related land use changes sediment loads reduction is much more profound than streamflow changes see fig 10 suggesting that sediment transport is source limited instead of transport limited it was reported that the land surface area subject to hydraulic erosion nearly doubled between 1950 and 2001 over the entire cjr basin i e from 364 to 707 billion m2 yang et al 2004 suggesting possibly increasing sediment yield on the other hand implementation of anti deforestation measures in the upper cjr basin since 1980s reduces the area and intensity of surface erosion yang et al 2006 hu et al 2009 forest coverage rate is estimated by an increase from 33 8 to 56 2 in the upper basin by 2005 wei et al 2011 analysis of satellite images in 1980s and 2010 however shows only marginally increased forest area and residential land area and decreased irrigated land and dry farmland areas within the cjr basin and the change rates are overall small 4 zhao et al 2017 these studies are somehow inconsistent though reduced sediment yield in the upper basin due to land use changes is widely recognized as one of the main causes of sediment loads reduction at cuntan since the mid 1980s yang et al 2006 2011 wang et al 2007b hu et al 2009 reservoir sedimentation is another main reason of sediment loads reduction yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007b yang et al 2006 suggested that reservoirs were responsible for 66 of sediment loads reduction at cuntan and yichang since the mid 1980s downstream of cuntan the tgd retains annually 125 7 million tons sediment between 2003 and 2015 which is averagely 76 of its sediment influx table 2 a major portion of the reservoir sedimentation 95 occurs in the wet seasons xu and milliman 2009 cwrm 2006 2016 explaining pronounced sediment loads reduction in the wet seasons see fig 9 by adding the sediment trapped by the tgd to the measured sediment loads at yichang and datong we see that the linear reduction trend dating back to the early 1980s and mid 1960s at the two stations respectively continues until nowadays see fig s10 we also estimate that the sediment loads reduction at yichang and datong in the period of 2003 2015 would be 76 and 49 smaller respectively if there is no tgd see table 2 and fig s10 the newly constructed big dams in the upper mainstream e g the xiangjiaba dam have caused additional substantial sediment loads decrease at cuntan since 2012 it will slow down tgd sedimentation and in the mean time further reduce sediment loads downstream of tgd table 2 other human activities having impacts on sediment loads include river regulation lake sedimentation and sand mining and associated river morphological changes the sharp reduction of sediment loads at the three inlets in the late 1960s was ascribed to river regulations in the jing river the meander river between yichang and luoshan i e meander cutoff and river length reduction chen et al 2010 sand mining i e sediment extraction from the river bed in the cjr mainstream is overall limited dai and liu 2013 but intensive sand mining within the poyang lake lai et al 2014 by stirring the lake bed and enhancing suspension transport causes notably increased sediment loads at hukou see fig s11c the dongting lake changes from a sediment sink to a source regarding sediment exchange with the cjr mainstream since 2000 see fig s11a smaller sediment loads at datong compared to the summed sediment loads at yichang and that from the three main tributaries suggest river aggradations in 1978 2001 see figs s10 and s11 there is a switch from river deposition to erosion since 2002 which is evidenced by morphological survey li et al 2009 cwrm 2016 for instance an erosion of 1001 3 million m3 is observed along the river between yichang and luoshan a river length of 408 km between october 2002 and october 2015 cwrm 2016 and the erosion volume is 201 1 million m3 in the river between luoshan and hankou a river length of 251 km between november 2003 and november 2015 cwrm 2016 considering a bulk density of 1 05 tons per m3 the sediment erosion rate is 105 2 million tons per year in the river segment between yichang and hankou it suggests that river erosion in the mainstream and the sediment source from main tributaries contribute 70 and 20 of sediment loads at datong respectively in 2003 2015 it is these sediment sources that mitigating sediment loads reduction at hankou and datong compared to yichang see figs 8 and s10 so far we see that the tgd s impacts on the hydrological regime are not confined to river discharge regulation and sediment trapping but also include indirect influences in terms of reinforcing downstream river erosion and altering river lake interplay fig 11 the tgd s impacts on river discharges are more profound at seasonal time scales while its impacts on sediment loads reduction are more pronounced at annual to decadal time scales overall we see that climatic changes and human activities in the upper basin have caused remarkable river discharge and sediment loads changes and the tgd exerts additional modification on that and causes subsequent changes in the downstream river while along river buffering dissipate the changes in the downward direction 5 4 implications of the hydrological changes the changed hydrological regime has broad impacts and consequences on the river morphology and ecosystem and other relevant river functions the cjr downstream of yichang is a golden waterway regarding its importance on water transportation its navigation channel depth is threatened by the seasonally lowered river stages the suspended sediment concentrations have reduced from 0 467 0 539 kg m3 under the pre tgd condition to 0 070 0 108 kg m3 under the post tgd condition at yichang xiao and duan 2011 which can have profound impacts on the aquatic ecosystem given increased water transparency and light penetration downstream channel degradation in terms of bed scour and bank erosion and collapse threatens the safety of the dikes and other flood defense structures li et al 2009 xia et al 2016 as a result of bed erosion bed sediment is coarsening i e changes from coarse sand mm before 2003 to gravel and pebble cm in 2008 at yichang luo et al 2012 yang et al 2018 which will stimulate downward development of bed scour until a new river morphological equilibrium state is reached in long term decades to a century the altered river lake interplay and shrinking lakes will lower flood resilience in the middle lower cjr basin due to decreased lake storage capacity li et al 2009 fang et al 2012 and increase drought occurrence probability and impair lake ecosystem moreover dramatically declined sediment loads are accompanied by reduced nutrient loading because the suspended sediments are composed of dominantly fine material e g median size of 10 μm at datong and are transported in the form of aggregated flocs guo and he 2011 for instance there is a 77 reduction of total phosphorous and an 83 reduction of particulate phosphorous annually zhou et al 2013 and also a substantial decrease of silica flux ran et al 2016 these changes would have impacts on the biogeochemical cycling in the river estuary coastal ocean continuum zhang et al 2015 these issues deserve attention from both research and management point of view the changed river and sediment discharges impose a threat on the delta with respect to salt intrusion and delta erosion river discharge provides a critical force in inhibiting salt intrusion driven by marine tides and waves in the delta region landward salt intrusion affects freshwater intake in the cjr delta in the dry seasons when the river discharge at datong is 15 000 m3 s threatening freshwater supply to millions of people in shanghai luo and shen 1994 modeling studies have showed that tgd impoundments in autumn tend to advance the timing and enhance the intensity of salt intrusion while larger river discharges in the dry seasons may relieve salt intrusion to some degree qiu and zhu 2013 in addition water withdrawal along the river downstream of datong is considerable and will further reduce the river discharge in counteracting salt intrusion zhang et al 2012a the altered river discharge hydrograph is highly likely to hasten the onset of and induce more landward saltwater intrusion in the cjr delta in the wet to dry transition seasons regulating lake outflow by constructing sluices at the lake mouths may worsen this situation maintaining a river discharge at datong larger than a minimum threshold e g 12 000 m3 s through optimized dam operation can help to reduce the salt intrusion risk delta erosion and salt marshes loss is a global concern and also a big issue in the cjr delta yang et al 2011 had reported a shift from accretion to erosion around the sub merged cjr delta the study area is selective and small compared to the entire cjr delta in the recent decade and ascribed it to reduced sediment supply on the other hand the cjr delta as whole has not shown directional erosion in the period of 1958 2010 luan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 so far it is widely known that the deposition rate in the cjr delta has decreased measurably in the recent decade though overwhelming erosion has not emerged which can be ascribed to a time lag effect between deltaic morphological response and sediment supply reduction it is reasonably expected that the sediment loads at datong will remain low in the coming decades to century thus delta erosion is somehow inevitable in long term delta safety and ecosystem is at high risk considering sediment loads reduction sea level rise and land subsidence research work to figure out the effects of sediment redistribution within the delta in causing a time lag of large scale deltaic morphological adaptation is needed 6 conclusions in this work we collect and examine a long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data in the cjr basin downstream of the tgd and elaborate the hydrological regime changes at seasonal annual and decadal time scales the causes and implications of those changes are discussed and the role of the tgd is evaluated the annual streamflow changes are non significant downstream of tgd other than a significant change point in 1954 streamflow changes are more remarkable at seasonal time scales such as decreased flood peak and autumn discharges and increased dry season discharges the hydro climate changes occurred in the upper basin and the regulation effects of tgd together explain the seasonal changes sediment loads have decreased progressively in the cjr basin the decrease trend dates back to the mid 1980s and the tgd accelerates the decrease since 2003 the sediment loads immediately below tgd have decreased by 92 in 2003 2015 compared to 1950 1985 at yichang the tgd is responsible for 76 and 49 of the sediment loads reduction at yichang and datong respectively as a result subsequent bed scour and bank erosion occur in the downstream river the eroded sediment together with the sediment loads from the tributaries mitigates sediment reduction in the down river direction the altered river lake interplay in response to channel degradation and seasonal river discharge reduction is highly responsible for low stages in the lakes substantial river stage falling downstream of the tgd and enlarged water level gradients in the vicinities of river lake conjunctions induce a draining effect fostering faster lake outflow following tgd impoundments it results in lower stage and reduced lake water storage which threatens water resources security and riparian ecosystem in the lakes the hydrological changes have a wide scope of influences and consequences on water security flooding and drought risk management and delta safety more big dams are under construction along the mainstream upward tgd and they will further regulate the river discharge and sediment delivery processes we identify knowledge gaps in research including 1 there lacks of in depth analysis of climatic and hydrological changes and their coherent behavior at different time and space scales in particular regarding the role of nature and human activities e g land use changes big hydropower dams water transfer and consumption on streamflow changes based on analysis of precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow data together 2 insufficient understanding of the climatic impacts of the series of large reservoirs including the tgd and the others under construction in the upper basin 3 integrated water resources management and flooding and drought hazard management when considering both surface water and groundwater gross water storage changes optimized hydropower dam operations and fluvial ecosystem restoration opportunity etc and last but not least 4 study of basin scale hydrological and geomorphologic changes and ecosystem evolution given a doctrine switch from economical development first to environment protection

7342,streamflow and sediment loads undergo remarkable changes in worldwide rivers in response to climatic changes and human interferences understanding their variability and the causes is of vital importance regarding river management with respect to the changjiang river cjr one of the largest river systems on earth we provide a comprehensive overview of its hydrological regime changes by analyzing long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of three gorges dam tgd we find profound river discharge reduction during flood peaks and in the wet to dry transition period and slightly increased discharges in the dry season sediment loads have reduced progressively since 1980s owing to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin with notably accelerated reduction since the start of tgd operation in 2003 channel degradation occurs in downstream river leading to considerable river stage drop lowered river stages have caused a draining effect on lakes by fostering lake outflows following tgd impoundments the altered river lake interplay hastens low water occurrence inside the lakes which can worsen the drought given shrinking lake sizes in long term moreover lake sedimentation has decreased since 2002 with less sediment trapped in and more sediment flushed out of the lakes these hydrological changes have broad impacts on river flood and drought occurrences water security fluvial ecosystem and delta safety keywords river discharge streamflow sediment loads changjiang three gorges dam 1 introduction river and sediment discharges in worldwide large rivers are subject to significant changes dominantly reduction because of climate changes and increasing human activities walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 global climate changes induce accelerated hydrosphere circulation resulting in increased frequency of extreme events e g droughts and floods and possibly evoking hydrological and ecological influences at a broader scale xu and singh 2004 ipcc 2013 wmo 2016 arnell and gosling 2013 had modeled and projected that climate changes will cause significant changes in hydrological behavior by 2050 e g streamflow increase for nearly half of the global land surface and decrease over the other 36 of the land surface regional variability is still high because of the uncertainties in the climate models and the non linear regional responses to global changes arnell and gosling 2013 nakaegawa et al 2013 regional case studies can provide perspectives for interpretation of hydrological and climatic changes at global scale human activities in terms of dam constructions water consumption and land use changes exert increasing influences on basin scale hydrological regimes nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 dams are built worldwide to control river floods and store water for irrigation and power generation on the other hand dams can significantly alter hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes in fluvial systems milliman 1997 brandt 2000 walling and fang 2003 graf 2006 for instance at basin scales dam operation regulates river discharge hydrograph by changing the timing magnitude and frequency of low and high flows and disrupts sediment delivery e g the aswan dam in the nile river woodward et al 2007 and the hoover dam in the colorado river graf 2006 at continent scales large artificial reservoirs are able to alter regional climate regarding changes in precipitation and surface evaporation etc particularly in the semi arid regions degu et al 2011 moreover increasing global water storage by man made reservoirs has reduced water volume reaching oceans potentially slowing down global sea level rise by 30 mm in the past half century chao et al 2008 river flow regulation and irrigation at global scales also increase evapotranspiration and water consumption jaramillo and destouni 2015 these evidences demonstrate remarkable regional to global effects of water usage and hydrological regime changes which merit specific examinations the changjiang river cjr also called yangtze river basin in china is such a system undergoing significant hydrological changes under the influences of both climatic changes and human interferences regional climatic changes include changing intensity and behavior of the asian monsoon xu et al 2011a while human activities include increasing water consumption by a booming population more hydropower dams and water transfers etc a number of reports have been devoted to examining changes of precipitation temperature river and sediment discharges in the cjr basin yang et al 2004 2006 gao et al 2013 wei et al 2013 and chen et al 2001b 2016 etc had examined river discharge changes and reported no significant decrease or increase changes at the half century time scale yang et al 2004 2006 2011 2018 wang et al 2007b 2008 hu et al 2009 and xu et al 2009 etc had documented radical sediment load reductions due to the tgd li et al 2013a 2016 dai and lu 2013 xu et al 2013a and zheng 2016 discussed comprehensive impacts of the tgd on the river and sediment discharges and associated ecological environmental and socio economic influences these studies provide useful insights on the hydrological regime changes on the other hand we find that there is inconsistency remained to the author s knowledge for instance yang et al 2006 hu et al 2009 and zhao et al 2017 documented no apparent decrease or increase trend of the annual streamflow at yichang and datong data range 1953 2013 whereas jiang et al 2007 detected a weak decrease trend at yichang and a weak increase trend at datong data range 1961 2005 the different interpretations maybe caused by inconsistent data range and or different analysis methods at different significance levels in addition most previous studies interpreted inter annual changes of streamflow and sediment loads while the seasonal changes were insufficiently examined therefore there is still a demand to clarify hydrological changes by rigorous trend analysis of datasets at annual and seasonal time scales additionally low water conditions low river discharges and low river stages frequently occurred in the middle lower cjr basin downstream of tgd in the recent decade for instance nearly the lowest or the second lowest river stages at a 50 150 year time scale were recorded downstream of cuntan fig 1 in the summer of 2006 dai et al 2011 regional low water occurred successively in 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 in the dongting and poyang lakes fig 1 li et al 2012 this is controversial to that the tgd discharges more water in the dry seasons which is expected to relieve low water occurrence big floods still occurred in the downstream basin after the tgd was constructed rising doubt on the effectiveness of the tgd in mitigating flooding risk there are increasing debates on tgd s negative influences on the downstream basin regarding water resources security and drought and flood hazard and fluvial ecosystems the tgd has been put into operation for 14 years since 2003 and a rigorous assessment of its impacts on the river discharge and sediment delivery processes is needed for integrated river management in this work we review a wide range of publications collect a long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of the tgd and examine them rigorously by trend analysis methods we will clarify the tgd s role in the hydrological changes and elaborate consequent impacts in the river system in the end we identify knowledge gaps in our present understandings the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the cjr basin data source and methods section 3 presents the operation of the tgd section 4 addresses changes with respect to hydro meteorology river and sediment discharges at both seasonal and annual time scales and section 5 discusses causes and implications of the changes with a focus on the river lake interactions the last section formulates conclusions and briefs knowledge gaps 2 setting data and method 2 1 the changjiang river basin the cjr stretching west eastward in the middle china is one of the world longest rivers of great ecological and socio economic importance it has a mainstem length of 6 300 000 m a basin area of 1900 billion m2 19 5 of china s land area an annual streamflow of 903 4 billion m3 37 of china s total streamflow and an annual sediment load of 414 million tons between 1950 and 2005 at datong yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007b the cjr is home to 480 million people indicating its critical role on socio economic development chen et al 2001b xu et al 2008 the cjr basin is geographically divided into the upper middle and lower sub basins and the delta regions with divisions at yichang jiujiang and datong respectively based on landscape fig 1 the upper basin has a high relief and is mountainous and the main sediment source region while the middle lower basin consists of vast fluvial flood plains and its mainstream channel is a conduit conveying sediment to the sea the tgd is about 40 km upstream of yichang upstream of the tgd cuntan is the main gauge station where the tgd inflows are monitored another new dam the xiangjiaba dam which has a flood control capacity of 0 9 billion m3 and is 408 km upstream of cuntan was constructed and put into operation since 2012 downstream of the tgd yichang shashi jianli luoshan hankou jiujiang and datong are the major gauge stations along the mainstream in the downward direction fig 1 the annually mean river discharges are 10 870 13 620 28 400 m3 s at cuntan yichang and datong respectively a number of big tributaries scatter in the cjr basin such as the wu river the han river and the dongting lake and poyang lake systems fig 1 the dongting lake receives flows from four secondary tributaries and conjuncts the cjr mainstream at chenglingji in addition there are three inlets diverting mainstream water and sediment into the dongting lake in the wet seasons fig 1 the poyang lake has five secondary tributaries and conjuncts the cjr mainstream at hukou reverse flows i e flows from the cjr mainstream to the poyang lake can happen at hukou occasionally in the wet seasons the water and sediment exchanges between the lakes and mainstream play a profound role in buffering hydrological changes the cjr basin has a basin wide mean annual precipitation of 1100 mm and the precipitation exhibits strong spatiotemporal variations owing to asian monsoon wang et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation is 270 500 mm in the upper basin and 1 600 1900 mm in the middle lower basin gemmer et al 2008 temporally rainfall concentrates in the wet seasons between may and september and as a result a major portion of streamflow 75 and sediment loads 85 are discharged in the wet seasons chen et al 2001b spatially the prime rainy season is between may and october in the upper cjr basin one to two month lagging the rainy season in the middle lower basin i e between march and august jiang et al 2007 guo et al 2011 extreme floods or droughts are likely to happen if wet or dry climate occurs occasionally in the same season between the upper and middle lower basins such as the big river floods in the summer of 1954 and 1998 zong and chen 2000 and the severe droughts in the autumn of 2006 dai et al 2011 the highest flood peak discharges ever recorded are 105 000 m3 s at yichang in 1870 and 92 600 m3 s at datong in 1954 catastrophic floods impose huge risks on the densely populated flood plains downstream of yichang and there was an idea of constructing the tgd to control big floods many decades ago 2 2 data we collect hydro meteorological data including air temperature precipitation daily river discharges and water levels monthly and yearly streamflow and sediment loads at multiple stations along the mainstream downward cuntan and at the mouths of the tributaries and lakes fig 1 air temperature and precipitation data are collected from publications ncc 2011 sang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 daily river discharges and water levels http xxfb hydroinfo gov cn and the inflow and outflow of the tgd http www ctgpc com cn are obtained from official websites the monthly and yearly streamflow and sediment loads are from government bulletins e g cwrm 2006 2016 the annual streamflow and sediment loads data date back to 1950s and the daily river discharges and water levels date back to 1980s annually mean river discharges annually minimum and maximum monthly river discharges are also collected at yichang 1878 1986 hankou 1865 1986 and datong 1948 1986 from a global river discharge data base http www compositerunoff sr unh edu fekete et al 2002 preliminary analysis suggest that the data from the global data base are consistent with the officially published data in the overlap period 1950 1986 with a mean deviation 1 note that the annually minimum monthly discharge is not the same as the minimum 30 day averaged discharge the river discharge and sediment loads differences between the inflow that at cuntan plus wulong and outflow that at yichang of the tgd are used to indicate its regulation effects the streamflow differences between the inflow and outflow during tgd s impounding periods are taken as the amount of water stored by the reservoir when assuming limited water loss to evaporation and groundwater etc only surface flow is taken into account while groundwater and its exchange with surface water and evaporation are not analyzed in this work as a first approximate sediment loads are represented by suspended sediment transport while bed load is excluded in this study it is because bed load transport accounts for a small proportion 5 of the total load transport at cuntan for instance the annual bed load is 0 1 0 6 million tons prior 2000 and is 0 1 million tons afterward fang and dong 2011 the bed load transport flux is much smaller compared to suspended load downstream of yichang chen et al 2010 it is technically difficult to monitor bed load transport accurately in fluvial sandy environments and data in that sense is scarce 2 3 trend analysis methods we first apply change point analysis taylor 2000 to the normalized discharge anomaly to test non linear trend e g monotonic non linear plateau through peak rapid changes the cumulative function s whose values si are defined as s i s i 1 x x i while xi i 1 2 n is the time series of normalized anomaly and x is the mean value a potential change point is detected when a change in the direction of the s function occurs whose interval of occurrence is defined by the parameter sdiff max s min s statistical significance of the identified change points is verified by using a bootstrapping technique at a 5 significance level castino et al 2016 it is achieved by randomly resampling to remove any potential change point m times m 103 in this analysis 104 and the statistics for the parameter sdiff is generated the level of significance is given by the percentage of bootstrap cycles for which the synthetic sdiff parameter is greater than the observed one once a primary statistically significant change point is obtained the same procedure is applied to the sub time series of the x variable before and after the change point to search for secondary change points this iterative procedure is applied as long as statistically significant change points are detected castino et al 2016 preliminary tests show that the change point timing is independent of the normalization reference period thus the mean value in the interval of 1950 1985 considering that the mid 1980s is a visual changing point of annual streamflow and sediment load at most stations see section 4 for details is used in this study if not specified in particular note that the detected change points may not locate at an exact year but around some year when the changes are not sharp we then apply linear regression analysis to the normalized anomaly of streamflow and sediment loads to detect linear trends and change rates on both sides of the change points student s t test and mann kendall mk test at 5 significance level are used to determine the statistical significance of the linear trend mann 1945 kendall 1975 details of the linear trend analysis methods can be found in literatures thus are not repeated here 3 tgd operation in this section we provide a brief overview of tgd operation and its effects on river discharge hydrograph the tgd was constructed from 1993 to 2009 with a dam height of 185 m above mean sea level and a dam length of 2335 m the tgd forms a reservoir stretching about 600 000 m between the dam site and cuntan fig 1 and with a surface area of 1084 million m2 which was 452 million m2 under no tgd situation a total storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 15 billion m3 at a high pool level of 175 m the flood control capacity is 5 of the annual streamflow at yichang i e annually 451 0 billion m3 between 1950 and 2005 the tgd has generated a hydropower output of averagely 88 2 billion kilowatt hours per year in the past 14 years flood control power generation and promoting irrigation and navigation are its essential functions the tgd operation follows a scheme by storing and flushing water seasonally rising water level ahead the dam wlad suggests larger inflow than outflow and tgd impoundments while falling wlad indicates larger outflow than inflow and water release figs 2 and s1 specifically the wlad maintains at a low level of 145 m between june and september the wet season sustaining the flood control volume available for occasional river floods forming in the upper basin with a peak discharge 55 000 m3 s zheng 2016 since early october when the wet season ends the tgd will reduce outflow and store water for hydropower generation until the wlad reaches 175 m the wlad will stay at 175 m until january after which the wlad drops gradually until june when the wet season begins overall the tgd operation reflects a flood control scheme which is designed to control river floods and to store water for hydropower generation zheng 2016 regarding reservoir sedimentation management the tgd operation reflects a strategy of storing clear water in the dry season with a high pool level and releasing muddy water in the wet seasons with a low pool level even though reservoir sedimentation is still huge in its early stage of lifespan because of a large reservoir size see section 5 3 the realistic tgd operations follow the abovementioned scheme other than that the starting time of its impoundments is 1 2 months earlier than october fig 2 specifically the tgd started to store water the first time in may of 2003 and the wlad was raised from 67 to 135 m in the second phase of its pilot operation the wlad was raised from 135 to 156 m in october of 2006 in the third phase the wlad was raised from 145 to 172 m in 2008 given concerns of the safety of the dam and the influences on the downstream basin the wlad did not reach 175 m until 2010 the first time fig 2 since then the tgd is put into normal operation with a seasonally and regularly raised and dropped pool level so far we see that tgd impoundments in autumn last for a period of 37 90 days table 1 we compare tgd s inflow and outflow hydrographs to quantify its impacts on river discharges it shows that the peak river discharges of the outflow are up to 20 000 m3 s smaller in a short period of days to weeks reflecting tgd s capability in mitigating big floods see fig s2 in the appendix the outflow during the impounding periods in autumn is averagely reduced by 2790 5880 m3 s table 1 by adding the stored water to the actually measured streamflow at yichang and datong during the impounding periods we estimate that the mean streamflow is reduced by 11 32 and 7 20 respectively by contrast the outflow is averagely 2000 m3 s larger than the inflow in the dry months between january and may see fig s2 overall the tgd modulates river discharge hydrograph by reducing flood peak discharges and river discharges during the impounding periods and slightly increasing river discharges in the dry seasons 4 results 4 1 hydro meteorological changes this section describes hydro meteorological changes in terms of air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the nation wide daily maximum temperature is increasing in china since 1980s owing to changes in the asian monsoon indicating a warm trend kuang et al 2014 in the cjr basin the basin wide mean air temperature decreases slightly between 1950 and 1985 followed by a fast increase trend indicating climatic warming as well figs 3 a and s3a chen et al 2001a sang et al 2012 linear trend analysis reveals an increase rate of 0 45 c per decade between 1985 and 2010 for the cjr basin as a whole figs 3a and s3a the precipitation exhibits large spatial and temporal variations in the cjr basin wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the basin averaged precipitation shows a significant decrease trend between 1950 and 2015 p 0 02 i e a decrease rate of 13 mm per decade figs 3b and s3b similar decrease at decadal time scales occurs in the upper cjr basin particularly in the interval of 1950 1970 while the afterward decrease trend is non significant seasonally summer precipitation displays an increase trend while autumn precipitation decreases significantly particularly since the mid 1980s becker et al 2006 in contrast a significant decrease of summer precipitation occurs in the upper cjr basin jiang et al 2007 gemmer et al 2008 deng et al 2013 the basin wide precipitation becomes more concentrated in time i e increased precipitation intensity in short durations becker et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 regarding evaporation both annual reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation show a significant decrease trend between 1960 and 2007 which is ascribed to decreasing net total radiation and wind speed xu et al 2006 wang et al 2011 the decrease in evapotranspiration is more significant in summer and in the middle lower basin wang et al 2007a 2011 in the middle lower cjr basin the annual reference evapotranspiration also decreases significantly between 1960 and early 1990s mainly due to declined net radiation followed by an afterward slight increase which is ascribed to reduced relative humidity in the air xing et al 2016 as an evaporation source the large reservoir formed by tgd potentially has impacts on regional climate considering its surface cooling effects and reduced radiative heating the impacts diminish fast with distance away from the reservoir and so far measurable but non significant air temperature decrease is detected in the regions surrounding the reservoir miller et al 2005 wu et al 2012 data and modeling results suggest that the reservoir s impact on basin scale climate is overall limited ncc 2011 wu et al 2012 further monitor and in depth examination is needed to clarify the degree to which the large reservoirs formed by tgd and other new big dams in the upper cjr basin can affect regional and sub basin climate when looking forward into the future sun et al 2013 modeled that the temperature will increase and the annual rainfall will decrease in the upper cjr basin in the 21st century as a result of climatic warming nakaegawa et al 2013 predicted that the streamflow of the cjr basin may increase in the wet seasons between may and august if considering climate change impacts only considering the uncertainties in the model projections birkinshaw et al 2017 and the land use changes in the future it remains an open question how the basin scale hydro meteorology will change in response to climate changes and human activities 4 2 river discharge changes 4 2 1 annual streamflow changes the annual streamflow exhibits only slight decrease trends along the mainstream downward tgd at cuntan a non significant change point p 0 11 is detected in 1968 based on data between 1940 and 2015 figs 4 a and s4a the change points detected in 1954 and 1968 however are significant p 0 02 at yichang figs 4b and s4a there are no significant directional changes prior 1954 but an afterward decrease trend by a rate of 4 8 billion m3 per decade between 1955 and 2015 over century the annual streamflow decreases from averagely 455 8 billion m3 in 1878 1954 to 402 6 billion m3 in 2003 2015 at yichang indicating a reduction by 11 7 at hankou the annual streamflow decreases from averagely 750 2 billion m3 in 1865 1954 to 696 7 billion m3 in 1955 2015 but the change point detected in 1954 is non significant p 0 21 figs 4c and s4b similarly the change point in 1954 is non significant at datong though the data length is shorter figs 4d and s4c the change point in the early 2000s is non significant at both yichang and datong p 0 18 suggesting limited impacts of the tgd on the annual streamflow in the interval of 1955 2015 the decrease trends of the annual streamflow are significant at cuntan p 0 01 and yichang p 0 02 whereas it is non significant at hankou p 0 08 0 6 billion m3 per decade and datong p 0 14 6 9 billion m3 per decade more temporal streamflow changes are detected in the tributaries based on data between 1950 and 2015 in the dongting lake system the total streamflow of the three inlets exhibits significant decrease change points in the late 1960s p 0 01 and early 2000s p 0 05 figs 5 a and s5a specifically it decreases from 134 2 billion m3 in 1956 1968 to 48 6 billion m3 in 2001 2015 a reduction by 64 with no directional changes of the total streamflow of the four tributaries the streamflow at chenglingji has decreased significantly between 1950 and 1970 p 0 003 followed by a non significant decrease trend until 2015 i e from 338 3 billion m3 in 1951 1968 to 241 3 billion m3 in 2001 2015 no significant change points are detected on the time series of annual streamflow at huangzhuang hukou and poyang lake tributaries fig 5b and c the total streamflow of the poyang lake tributaries and that at hukou exhibits consistent temporal variations figs 5b and s5b linear trend analyses suggest significant streamflow decrease trends at chenglingji p 0 0001 three inlets p 0 0001 and huangzhuang p 0 03 in 1950 2015 while the decrease trends for dongting lake tributaries p 0 81 and the increasing trends at hukou p 0 60 and poyang lake tributaries p 0 66 are non significant in all the total streamflow of the dongting lake the han river and poyang lake represented by the summed streamflow at chenglingji huangzhuang and hukou minus that at three inlets exhibits a non significant increase trend p 0 27 figs 5c and s5c 4 2 2 seasonal river discharge changes river discharge may change remarkably at intra annual time scales when the annual streamflow remains unchanged the annually minimum monthly discharges not necessarily in the same month in different years increase substantially in the recent decades the minimum monthly discharges are slightly smaller in 1940 2000 compared to 1880 1940 at yichang figs 6 a and s6a a significant change point is present at both cuntan and yichang in 1999 the abrupt increase at yichang since 2007 is ascribed to tgd operation while the abrupt increase at cuntan since 2012 is caused by xiangjiaba dam specifically the annually minimum monthly discharges have increased by up to 3000 m3 s at yichang while the differences between cuntan and yichang increase sharply from averagely 800 m3 s 1940 1999 to 1900 m3 s 2007 2015 it suggests that the tgd flushes nearly 2000 m3 s more water downstream in the driest months the annually minimum monthly discharge starts to increase since 1900s at hankou and the afterward increase rate becomes larger with a significant change point in 1954 p 0 001 fig s6b similar increase is observed at datong since the late 1950s figs 6a and s6c i e an increase from averagely 9260 m3 s 1960 1980 to 12 000 m3 s 2007 2015 the changes since 2007 are less noticeable at both hankou and datong compared to yichang suggesting downward dissipated changes the annually maximum monthly discharge exhibits more spatial and temporal changes it changes limitedly at cuntan since 1960 whereas a stepwise reduction in late 1950s and a linear reduction trend since 1980s are detected at yichang figs 6b and s7a the maximum monthly discharges are averagely 3400 m3 s smaller at yichang in 2001 2015 compared to 1955 2000 they are slightly smaller in the decades since 2000 compared to the prior decades at hankou and datong figs s7b and s7c higher streamflow in the 1990s affects the trend detection at hankou and datong and it is too early to conclude whether the decrease trend since 2000 is significant the mean river discharges in october exhibit decrease trends the october river discharges decrease slightly since 1980 at cuntan figs 6c and s8a the decrease trend is at a faster rate at yichang than cuntan in the decades since 1980 and the october river discharges become smaller at yichang since 2006 implying the impacts of tgd impoundments in autumn specifically it declines from 19 800 m3 s in 1890 1954 to 11 000 m3 s in 2006 2015 at yichang similarly the october river discharges reduce significantly since 1960s at both hankou and datong figs s8b and s8c e g from 33 600 m3 s in 1960 1980 to 23 800 m3 s in 2006 2015 at datong we further estimate the probability distributions of daily river discharges at cuntan yichang and datong to infer seasonal changes notably we find that the probability of both extremely low and high river discharges has decreased while that of medium river discharges e g river discharges in the range of 10 000 25 000 m3 s at datong has increased at all three stations fig 7 a the river discharge at the 50th percentile reduces accordingly fig 7b the mean river discharge hydrographs show that the low river discharges in the dry seasons slightly increase while the high river discharges in the wet seasons decrease profoundly see fig s9 the river discharge reduction is much more significant at yichang and datong than cuntan between august and october again demonstrating the impacts of tgd impoundments overall these results suggest that the river discharge hydrograph of tgd inflow is ever changing and the tgd operation modulates it at a seasonal time scale 4 3 changes of sediment loads 4 3 1 sediment loads changes along the mainstream the sediment loads in the cjr basin exhibit radical decreases at the decadal time scales particularly since 1980s significant change points are detected in the early 1990s p 0 004 and early 2000s p 0 012 at both cuntan plus wulong to represent sediment influx of tgd and yichang figs 8 a and s10 the sediment loads variations display consistent behavior between cuntan and yichang in the decades prior 2002 though it is slightly larger at yichang since 2003 the sediment loads become smaller at yichang and the differences between cuntan and yichang become larger reflecting sediment trapping effects of the tgd specifically the summed sediment loads at cuntan and wulong have not changed very much between 1950 and mid 1980s annually 487 6 231 9 million tons but decreased to 164 4 131 3 million tons in 2003 2015 indicating a reduction by 66 immediately downstream of the tgd the sediment loads are 527 2 221 4 and 40 4 69 6 million tons in 1950 1985 and 2003 2015 respectively at yichang indicating a reduction by 92 the dramatic reduction reflects combined effects of a source reduction upstream of cuntan and tgd sedimentation in all these changes suggest that the sediment loads have reduced progressively since the mid 1980s and the tgd accelerates the reduction since 2003 at a remarkable rate the sediment loads downstream of yichang follow the reduction trend but at a smaller rate at hankou not shown the sediment loads have decreased from 431 3 167 8 1953 1985 to 105 9 68 1 million tons 2003 2015 suggesting a reduction by 75 further downstream at datong it decreases from annually 470 4 207 6 million tons in 1951 1985 to 138 7 77 3 million tons in 2003 2015 suggesting a reduction by 70 over time four statistically significant change points are detected in the late 1960s p 0 04 mid 1980s p 0 05 early 1990s p 0 02 and early 2000s p 0 001 at datong more variability at datong than yichang is ascribed to superimposed changes occurred in the upper and middle lower cjr basins see section 5 3 in the near future decades the annual sediment loads at yichang are highly likely to remain at a low level 10 million tons considering ongoing dam constructions in the upper basin fig s10 with sediment compensation from tributaries and bed erosion see section 5 3 the sediment loads at hankou and datong seem to have reached a decadal stable state i e annually averaged 88 2 and 126 1 million tons respectively in 2006 2016 it is reasonably expected that the sediment loads will not restore to a mean value larger than that in future at hankou and datong and further reduction may occur considering diminished river erosion downstream of tgd 4 3 2 sediment loads changes in the main tributaries the sediment loads of the main tributaries in the middle cjr basin have reduced profoundly as well the total sediment loads of the four tributaries of the dongting lake system exhibit non significant changes between 1950 and the mid 1980s except the extreme peak in 1954 but decrease abruptly in the mid 1980s followed by a slow decrease trend until nowadays figs 8b and s11a the annual sediment loads are 35 2 23 5 17 8 11 4 and 8 0 4 5 million tons in the interval of 1953 1984 1985 2005 and 2006 2015 respectively at the three inlets the sediment loads display three significant change points in the late 1960s mid 1980s and early 2000s it decreases from averagely 200 2 59 4 million tons in 1956 1968 to 118 2 59 5 64 7 87 6 and 6 5 6 8 million tons in 1969 1984 1985 2005 and 2006 2015 respectively accordingly significant change points of sediment loads reduction are detected in the early 1970s p 0 001 early 1980 p 0 008 and mid 2000 s p 0 001 at chenglingji figs 8b and s11a the sediment loads have decreased from averagely 62 5 22 5 million tons in 1951 1970 to 22 1 7 5 million tons in 2008 2015 note that slightly more sediment is flushed out of the dongting lake at chenglingji in 2008 2015 compared to the previous decade fig s11a the sediment balance between the mainstream and the dongting lake is reversed around 2006 the cjr mainstream diverted more sediment to the lake via the three inlets than its gain from the lake via chenglingji prior 2006 fig s11a the imbalance diminished over time due to more dramatic sediment loads reduction at the three inlets specifically the cjr mainstream annually lost a net of 136 3 56 1 and 48 1 72 1 million tons of sediment to the dongting lake in 1956 1966 and 1990 2000 respectively in the recent decade since 2006 the cjr mainstream has an annual sediment surplus of 16 1 7 7 million tons regarding its exchange with the lake fig s11b with respect to the dongting lake lake sedimentation and sediment surplus occurs prior 2006 because of more sediment sources from lake tributaries and three inlets than loss at chenglingji but it shifts to afterward lake erosion because of more sediment loss than the total sediment supply similar changes are observed in the poyang lake system the total sediment loads from five tributaries of the poyang lake show no directional changes between the mid 1950s and mid 1980s but a significant decrease trend p 0 001 between the late 1970s and late 2000s fig s11c it is averagely 16 2 12 4 million tons in 1956 1984 and 6 0 6 9 millions in 2001 2015 the sediment loads at hukou have decreased gradually between 1970 and 2000 and displayed an abrupt increase in 2001 p 0 007 figs 8c and s11c the mean sediment loads are 14 1 8 3 6 2 5 6 and 12 2 6 6 million tons in the decades of 1952 1962 1990 2000 and 2001 2015 respectively as a result the poyang lake receives less sediment supply from its tributaries comparing to its loss to the mainstream at hukou since 2000 suggesting a shift from lake sedimentation to erosion as well the sediment loads of the han river show two significant change points i e in the late 1960s p 0 04 and late 1980s p 0 02 figs 8c and s11d the mean sediment loads are 119 4 112 6 million tons in 1951 1964 but reduce sharply after the closure of the danjiangkou dam in the upper han river in 1965 and decline further to a relatively small quantity in the recent decade i e averagely 5 8 11 3 million tons in 2001 2015 the total sediment loads of the three main tributaries undergo dramatic decreases and exhibit strong temporal changes from a sediment budget point of view the cjr mainstream loses more sediment to the dongting lake than its total gain from the two lakes and the han river prior 2001 other than the extreme years fig s11d the late 1960s is featured by maximal net loss due to dramatically reduced sediment loads from the han river the cjr mainstream attains a net sediment surplus in the recent decade since 2002 which is mainly because of reduced sediment loss via the three inlets and increased sediment loads at both lake mouths i e chenglingji and hukou the net sediment surplus is 30 5 million tons per year in the interval of 2003 2015 4 3 3 seasonal changes of sediment loads sediment loads also change profoundly at seasonal time scales basically 85 of annual sediment loads are discharged between may and october in the middle lower cjr river because of higher precipitation and associated higher river discharge and higher sediment yield in the wet seasons fig 9 the sediment loads in the wet seasons however have decreased enormously in the recent decade since 2003 while the reduction in the dry seasons is less measurable specifically the sediment loads in the wet season are 456 5 425 3 96 of annual total and 364 7 361 7 millions tons 87 of annual total at yichang and datong respectively in the interval of 1950 2002 they decrease to 43 2 113 7 98 of annual total and 111 1 112 6 million tons 80 of annual total in 2003 2015 respectively fig 9 tgd sedimentation is the main reason of the dramatic reduction in the wet seasons see discussion in section 5 3 4 3 4 sediment rating curves the sediment rating curves imply changes out of phase between the streamflow and sediment loads we see that the lower crj mainstream i e at datong is overall much less sediment loaded compared to yichang and cuntan fig 10 a over time it becomes increasingly less sediment loaded at all three stations in the mainstream due to strikingly reduced sediment loads in the tributaries the han river and the three inlets are characterized by a higher sediment loading rate while the outflows of the dongting and poyang lakes are much less sediment loaded the annual sediment loads of the han river and at the three inlets have decreased significantly considering streamflow reduction at a smaller rate while the changes at chenglingji and hukou are comparatively less apparent because sedimentation and or erosion inside the lakes have buffering impacts on sediment flux at the lake mouths in all these changes suggest that the cjr downstream of the tgd becomes much less sediment loaded in the decades since the mid 1980s due to more remarkable reduction of sediment loads compared to streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity to data range in inferring long term changes the length of a data series has considerable impacts on interpretation of hydrological changes for instance the significant change point of the annual streamflow at yichang and hankou in 1954 is detected based on data in 1865 2015 which is however not revealed by datasets in 1950 2015 see fig 4b linear trend analysis of the streamflow at datong shows a slight but non significant decrease trend based on data in 1950 2015 whereas it exhibits a non significant increase trend in 1955 2015 the later is more reasonable given a significant change point in 1954 the extreme values e g much higher streamflow in 1954 and the late 1990s influence the trend analysis results too the sediment loads changes at datong provide another example of the sensitivity to data range the time series of annual sediment loads at datong do not show an apparent decrease or increase trend between 1950 and 1970 but a decrease trend is detected between the early 1960s and late 1990s as well as a much faster decrease trend between 1980 and 2015 see figs 8a and s10 these evidences explain why inconsistent interpretation was obtained by using data of different length in previous studies 5 2 river lake interplay and its hydrological impacts the interactions between the cjr mainstream and the two lakes in terms of water and sediment exchanges play an essential role on the hydrological regime downstream of the tgd hu et al 2007 guo et al 2011 ou et al 2012 diversion of water and sediment from the mainstream to the dongting lake via the three inlets is only observed in the wet seasons when river stages in mainstream are higher than the bed level at the inlets the diverted amount of water and sediment has reduced significantly because of lowered river stage in the mainstream and sedimentation in the inlet channels the former is partly caused by bed erosion due to sediment starvation at the year to decade time scale and by decreased river discharges at the seasonal time scale with non significant change of total streamflow from the lake tributaries the streamflow reduction at three inlets explains 89 of streamflow reduction at chenglingji in 2002 2015 compared to 1951 1968 see section 4 2 interactions between mainstream and poyang lake have changed considerably as well the poyang lake discharges water and sediment towards the mainstream and the mainstream has a backwater effect on the lake outflows most of the time in a year course guo et al 2011 reverse flow happens in the wet seasons between july and september when the cjr is at a river stage higher than that in the poyang lake river stage differences occur because of earlier start and ending of the rainy season in the middle lower basin than that in the upper cjr basin as mentioned in section 2 1 the magnitude and frequency of the reverse flow at hukou however have decreased profoundly even vanished in the recent decade guo et al 2011 zhang et al 2012b c in the mean time the annual streamflow at hukou has changed little between 1950 and 2015 see fig s5b it is because the reverse flow is overall limited compared to the total streamflow of the lake tributaries while the later exhibits no directional changes the river lake interactions are inherently controlled by river stages in the vicinity of river lake conjunctions there are highly linear correlationships between the river stages in the mainstream and at the lake mouth such as that between luoshan and chenglingji and that between jiujiang and hukou see fig s12 it implies that water level falling in the mainstream will induce synchronized water level drops at the lake mouth thus lowering the backwater effect guo et al 2011 mei et al 2016 river stages along the mainstream fall because of seasonal river discharge decreases and channel degradation xu et al 2011b dai and liu 2013 channel degradation is evidenced by river bank erosion and bed scour xia et al 2016 and by changed river discharge river stage rating curves river stages are falling under the same river discharge at yichang and shashi particularly under low and medium river discharges see fig s13 for instance the river stage under a river discharge of 10 000 m3 s drops from 43 8 m in 1960 to 42 7 m in 1990 42 1 in 2005 and 41 3 m in 2015 at yichang falling river stages in the mainstream cause consequent water level drop at the lake mouths enlarging the water level gradients in the river lake vicinity dai et al 2015 the enlarged water level gradients foster faster lake outflow which is in particular significant in the wet to dry transition season following tgd impoundments see fig s14 it creates a draining effect on the lake outflow resulting in decreased water storage inside the lakes and lowered lake stage the slightly increased river discharges along the mainstream in the dry seasons by the tgd may reinforce the backwater effects on the lake outflow but it is not able to restore water storage inside the lakes as a consequence low water occurrence is advanced in time e g by 20 days in the dongting lake fig 11 moreover there are non significant decreasing trends of precipitation zhang et al 2011 and reference evapotranspiration ye et al 2014 in autumn in the poyang lake basin these changes augment the low water regime and can cause severe droughts in the dry seasons lake size shrinkage in long term further endangers water resources security in the lakes the annually mean water levels at chenglingji have increased between 1960s and 1990s but underwent a switch to decline since 2000s duan et al 2012 similarly the mean water levels at hukou and xingzi a stage station 38 km more inside the poyang lake compared to hukou have increased between 1960 and 2000 and switched to an afterward decline mei et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 it is estimated that one meter water level drop will induce a surface area reduction and water storage volume shrinking by approximately 200 440 million m2 and 1 3 1 9 billion m3 respectively in the dongting lake according to the water level lake area and water level storage volume curves ding and li 2011 the yearly averaged surface area of the dongting lake has decreased from 4350 km2 in 1949 to 2518 km2 in 1998 and 1837 km2 in 2006 chen et al 2001a feng et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the surface area of the poyang lake has decreased from 5160 km2 in 1954 to 3860 km2 in 1992 at a water level of 22 m at hukou min 2000 in fact the water level at hukou rarely exceeds 22 m in the recent decade when the yearly averaged lake area is only 1740 520 km2 feng et al 2012 lake sedimentation and extensive reclamation of the low lying lands are the main causes of the lake shrinkage on the other hand extensive sand mining inside the lakes lai et al 2014 and a sediment balance shift from lake sedimentation to erosion see section 4 3 may slow down the shrink trend to some degree anyhow reduced lake area and storage volume at a decadal time scale implies degenerated function of the lakes in buffering intra annual river discharge changes along the mainstream lake size reduction seasonal river discharge decline and associated draining effects enhance low water occurrence and severity inside the lakes given that it is dry season following tgd impoundments hastened and persistent low water conditions impair water security and riparian ecosystem in the lakes the wetlands in the dongting lake and poyang lake as valuable habitats for fishes and migratory birds in the eastern asia are exposed for longer time particularly in the dry seasons between october and march xu et al 2013b sun et al 2012 mei et al 2016 in october 2006 and may 2011 for instance the wet surface area of the poyang lake is estimated by merely 50 km2 due to persistent low water level zhang et al 2012b feng et al 2013 as a result it causes enormous growth of pioneer species such as poplar and over reproduction of microtus fortis etc endangering lake ecosystem as valuable natural reserves chang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 xu et al 2013b to protect the lakes from drying measures such as constructing sluices at the lake mouths to control lake outflow are under debating wang et al 2015 but it remains insufficiently known how such a sluice will change the river lake interactions further and has impacts on sediment imbalance flooding risk and lake water quality etc and integrated research work is needed to sort out nature based solutions the river lake interplay also plays an important role in mitigating flood risk in the middle lower cjr basin the tgd can proactively reduce outflow when its inflow is 55 000 m3 s thus protecting the downstream basin particularly the reaches between yichang and luoshan from big floods formed in the upper basin for instance the inflow of tgd was as large as 70 000 m3 s in july of 2010 and 2012 while the outflow was reduced to 50 000 m3 s see fig s2 in addition the tgd can reactively reduce outflow when the downstream basin encounters floods thus lowering mainstream river stage and providing beneficial conditions for downstream floods flushing by that the tgd is able to prevent occurrence of 1 100 probability disastrous floods as that in 1954 and 1998 in the downstream basin even though the tgd can not regulate regional river floods within the lake systems caused by local strong rain storms the effects of tgd in mitigating basin scale big floods need to be evaluated in long term and shall not be underestimated and overestimated the above discussion suggests that it is not only the magnitude of river discharge but also its frequency timing duration and rate of change that matters in basin scale hydrological processes as the tgd may be obligated to keep the pool level as high as early and as long as possible for more hydropower generation by advancing impoundment and slowing flushing li et al 2013b integrated management considering flood control power generation outflow reduction and resultant influences on the downstream basin is of pivotal importance the successive droughts occurred in recent years remind that low water management is also badly needed other than flood risk mitigation 5 3 causes of the hydrological changes 5 3 1 causes of streamflow changes natural hydro meteorological changes and human activities are generally two main forces driving hydrological changes at river basin scales we see that the basin wide air temperature has increased since the mid 1980s chen et al 2001a sang et al 2012 and precipitation has decreased since 1950s and evaporation rate is decreasing since 1960s wang et al 2011 at century time scales the actual evapotranspiration and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation has increased in 1955 2008 compared to 1901 1954 in the cjr basin i e by 30 mm per year and 0 06 per year respectively jaramillo and destouni 2015 which may explain the detected change point in 1954 and the afterward streamflow reduction see figs 4 and s4 there are attempts to isolate the impacts of natural climate changes and human interferences on the streamflow variations for instance there is a well established correlationship between basin wide averaged precipitation and streamflow at datong suggesting a dominant role of precipitation on streamflow changes yang et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 similarly wang et al 2013 inferred that rainfall variations may explain 29 of streamflow changes in the cjr basin between 1970 and 2008 note that there is large variability in the relationship between precipitation and streamflow thus consideration of both precipitation and evapotranspiration is necessary to isolate meteorological controls on streamflow changes human interferences play an increasingly significant role in modulating the hydrological regime annual water consumption consumptive use of water resources for agriculture and industry and domestic purposes has increased from 15 to 90 billion m3 between 1949 and 2000 due to booming economy and population within the cjr basin mwr 1997 2005 xu et al 2007 the ongoing south to north water transfer project withdraws annually 18 3 billion m3 of surface water out of the cjr basin to the north china since 2014 and the total diversion capacity will be 44 8 billion m3 per year after completion of the project in the near future osnwdpcc 2016 the number of hydropower dams has increased exponentially since 1950s reaching 50 000 nowadays yang et al 2011 the total reservoir storage capacity has increased markedly reaching 200 billion m3 by 2003 yang et al 2004 with 55 69 billion m3 in the upper basin by 2005 wei et al 2011 the dams recently constructed and under constructions in the upper basin are not yet included increasing water consumption and water withdrawal causes net reduction of streamflow while the dams mainly modulate the timing and magnitude of river discharges we see that the seasonal streamflow changes are more profound compared to the inter annual changes and human activities are ascribed to be the main cause of that 5 3 2 causes of sediment loads changes sediment loads changes are very much influenced by human activities rainfall variations affect sediment yield through surface erosion sediment source while the later is also influenced by human related land use changes sediment loads reduction is much more profound than streamflow changes see fig 10 suggesting that sediment transport is source limited instead of transport limited it was reported that the land surface area subject to hydraulic erosion nearly doubled between 1950 and 2001 over the entire cjr basin i e from 364 to 707 billion m2 yang et al 2004 suggesting possibly increasing sediment yield on the other hand implementation of anti deforestation measures in the upper cjr basin since 1980s reduces the area and intensity of surface erosion yang et al 2006 hu et al 2009 forest coverage rate is estimated by an increase from 33 8 to 56 2 in the upper basin by 2005 wei et al 2011 analysis of satellite images in 1980s and 2010 however shows only marginally increased forest area and residential land area and decreased irrigated land and dry farmland areas within the cjr basin and the change rates are overall small 4 zhao et al 2017 these studies are somehow inconsistent though reduced sediment yield in the upper basin due to land use changes is widely recognized as one of the main causes of sediment loads reduction at cuntan since the mid 1980s yang et al 2006 2011 wang et al 2007b hu et al 2009 reservoir sedimentation is another main reason of sediment loads reduction yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007b yang et al 2006 suggested that reservoirs were responsible for 66 of sediment loads reduction at cuntan and yichang since the mid 1980s downstream of cuntan the tgd retains annually 125 7 million tons sediment between 2003 and 2015 which is averagely 76 of its sediment influx table 2 a major portion of the reservoir sedimentation 95 occurs in the wet seasons xu and milliman 2009 cwrm 2006 2016 explaining pronounced sediment loads reduction in the wet seasons see fig 9 by adding the sediment trapped by the tgd to the measured sediment loads at yichang and datong we see that the linear reduction trend dating back to the early 1980s and mid 1960s at the two stations respectively continues until nowadays see fig s10 we also estimate that the sediment loads reduction at yichang and datong in the period of 2003 2015 would be 76 and 49 smaller respectively if there is no tgd see table 2 and fig s10 the newly constructed big dams in the upper mainstream e g the xiangjiaba dam have caused additional substantial sediment loads decrease at cuntan since 2012 it will slow down tgd sedimentation and in the mean time further reduce sediment loads downstream of tgd table 2 other human activities having impacts on sediment loads include river regulation lake sedimentation and sand mining and associated river morphological changes the sharp reduction of sediment loads at the three inlets in the late 1960s was ascribed to river regulations in the jing river the meander river between yichang and luoshan i e meander cutoff and river length reduction chen et al 2010 sand mining i e sediment extraction from the river bed in the cjr mainstream is overall limited dai and liu 2013 but intensive sand mining within the poyang lake lai et al 2014 by stirring the lake bed and enhancing suspension transport causes notably increased sediment loads at hukou see fig s11c the dongting lake changes from a sediment sink to a source regarding sediment exchange with the cjr mainstream since 2000 see fig s11a smaller sediment loads at datong compared to the summed sediment loads at yichang and that from the three main tributaries suggest river aggradations in 1978 2001 see figs s10 and s11 there is a switch from river deposition to erosion since 2002 which is evidenced by morphological survey li et al 2009 cwrm 2016 for instance an erosion of 1001 3 million m3 is observed along the river between yichang and luoshan a river length of 408 km between october 2002 and october 2015 cwrm 2016 and the erosion volume is 201 1 million m3 in the river between luoshan and hankou a river length of 251 km between november 2003 and november 2015 cwrm 2016 considering a bulk density of 1 05 tons per m3 the sediment erosion rate is 105 2 million tons per year in the river segment between yichang and hankou it suggests that river erosion in the mainstream and the sediment source from main tributaries contribute 70 and 20 of sediment loads at datong respectively in 2003 2015 it is these sediment sources that mitigating sediment loads reduction at hankou and datong compared to yichang see figs 8 and s10 so far we see that the tgd s impacts on the hydrological regime are not confined to river discharge regulation and sediment trapping but also include indirect influences in terms of reinforcing downstream river erosion and altering river lake interplay fig 11 the tgd s impacts on river discharges are more profound at seasonal time scales while its impacts on sediment loads reduction are more pronounced at annual to decadal time scales overall we see that climatic changes and human activities in the upper basin have caused remarkable river discharge and sediment loads changes and the tgd exerts additional modification on that and causes subsequent changes in the downstream river while along river buffering dissipate the changes in the downward direction 5 4 implications of the hydrological changes the changed hydrological regime has broad impacts and consequences on the river morphology and ecosystem and other relevant river functions the cjr downstream of yichang is a golden waterway regarding its importance on water transportation its navigation channel depth is threatened by the seasonally lowered river stages the suspended sediment concentrations have reduced from 0 467 0 539 kg m3 under the pre tgd condition to 0 070 0 108 kg m3 under the post tgd condition at yichang xiao and duan 2011 which can have profound impacts on the aquatic ecosystem given increased water transparency and light penetration downstream channel degradation in terms of bed scour and bank erosion and collapse threatens the safety of the dikes and other flood defense structures li et al 2009 xia et al 2016 as a result of bed erosion bed sediment is coarsening i e changes from coarse sand mm before 2003 to gravel and pebble cm in 2008 at yichang luo et al 2012 yang et al 2018 which will stimulate downward development of bed scour until a new river morphological equilibrium state is reached in long term decades to a century the altered river lake interplay and shrinking lakes will lower flood resilience in the middle lower cjr basin due to decreased lake storage capacity li et al 2009 fang et al 2012 and increase drought occurrence probability and impair lake ecosystem moreover dramatically declined sediment loads are accompanied by reduced nutrient loading because the suspended sediments are composed of dominantly fine material e g median size of 10 μm at datong and are transported in the form of aggregated flocs guo and he 2011 for instance there is a 77 reduction of total phosphorous and an 83 reduction of particulate phosphorous annually zhou et al 2013 and also a substantial decrease of silica flux ran et al 2016 these changes would have impacts on the biogeochemical cycling in the river estuary coastal ocean continuum zhang et al 2015 these issues deserve attention from both research and management point of view the changed river and sediment discharges impose a threat on the delta with respect to salt intrusion and delta erosion river discharge provides a critical force in inhibiting salt intrusion driven by marine tides and waves in the delta region landward salt intrusion affects freshwater intake in the cjr delta in the dry seasons when the river discharge at datong is 15 000 m3 s threatening freshwater supply to millions of people in shanghai luo and shen 1994 modeling studies have showed that tgd impoundments in autumn tend to advance the timing and enhance the intensity of salt intrusion while larger river discharges in the dry seasons may relieve salt intrusion to some degree qiu and zhu 2013 in addition water withdrawal along the river downstream of datong is considerable and will further reduce the river discharge in counteracting salt intrusion zhang et al 2012a the altered river discharge hydrograph is highly likely to hasten the onset of and induce more landward saltwater intrusion in the cjr delta in the wet to dry transition seasons regulating lake outflow by constructing sluices at the lake mouths may worsen this situation maintaining a river discharge at datong larger than a minimum threshold e g 12 000 m3 s through optimized dam operation can help to reduce the salt intrusion risk delta erosion and salt marshes loss is a global concern and also a big issue in the cjr delta yang et al 2011 had reported a shift from accretion to erosion around the sub merged cjr delta the study area is selective and small compared to the entire cjr delta in the recent decade and ascribed it to reduced sediment supply on the other hand the cjr delta as whole has not shown directional erosion in the period of 1958 2010 luan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 so far it is widely known that the deposition rate in the cjr delta has decreased measurably in the recent decade though overwhelming erosion has not emerged which can be ascribed to a time lag effect between deltaic morphological response and sediment supply reduction it is reasonably expected that the sediment loads at datong will remain low in the coming decades to century thus delta erosion is somehow inevitable in long term delta safety and ecosystem is at high risk considering sediment loads reduction sea level rise and land subsidence research work to figure out the effects of sediment redistribution within the delta in causing a time lag of large scale deltaic morphological adaptation is needed 6 conclusions in this work we collect and examine a long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data in the cjr basin downstream of the tgd and elaborate the hydrological regime changes at seasonal annual and decadal time scales the causes and implications of those changes are discussed and the role of the tgd is evaluated the annual streamflow changes are non significant downstream of tgd other than a significant change point in 1954 streamflow changes are more remarkable at seasonal time scales such as decreased flood peak and autumn discharges and increased dry season discharges the hydro climate changes occurred in the upper basin and the regulation effects of tgd together explain the seasonal changes sediment loads have decreased progressively in the cjr basin the decrease trend dates back to the mid 1980s and the tgd accelerates the decrease since 2003 the sediment loads immediately below tgd have decreased by 92 in 2003 2015 compared to 1950 1985 at yichang the tgd is responsible for 76 and 49 of the sediment loads reduction at yichang and datong respectively as a result subsequent bed scour and bank erosion occur in the downstream river the eroded sediment together with the sediment loads from the tributaries mitigates sediment reduction in the down river direction the altered river lake interplay in response to channel degradation and seasonal river discharge reduction is highly responsible for low stages in the lakes substantial river stage falling downstream of the tgd and enlarged water level gradients in the vicinities of river lake conjunctions induce a draining effect fostering faster lake outflow following tgd impoundments it results in lower stage and reduced lake water storage which threatens water resources security and riparian ecosystem in the lakes the hydrological changes have a wide scope of influences and consequences on water security flooding and drought risk management and delta safety more big dams are under construction along the mainstream upward tgd and they will further regulate the river discharge and sediment delivery processes we identify knowledge gaps in research including 1 there lacks of in depth analysis of climatic and hydrological changes and their coherent behavior at different time and space scales in particular regarding the role of nature and human activities e g land use changes big hydropower dams water transfer and consumption on streamflow changes based on analysis of precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow data together 2 insufficient understanding of the climatic impacts of the series of large reservoirs including the tgd and the others under construction in the upper basin 3 integrated water resources management and flooding and drought hazard management when considering both surface water and groundwater gross water storage changes optimized hydropower dam operations and fluvial ecosystem restoration opportunity etc and last but not least 4 study of basin scale hydrological and geomorphologic changes and ecosystem evolution given a doctrine switch from economical development first to environment protection and ecosystem conservation first coping with these issues will need comprehensive management strategies by taking the entire river basin into consideration regarding water sediment and associated

7343,a new framework model is presented in this study for sharing of water in a river basin using certain governing variables in an effort to enhance the objectivity for a reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states the governing variables were normalised to reduce the governing variables of different co basin states of a river basin on same scale in the absence of objective methods for evaluating the weights to be assigned to co basin states for water allocation a framework was conceptualised and formulated to determine the normalised weighting factors of different co basin states as a function of the governing variables the water allocation to any co basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity which in turn was assumed to be a function of the normalised discontent satisfaction and weighting factors of each co basin state system dynamics was used effectively to represent and solve the proposed model formulation the proposed model was successfully applied to the vamsadhara river basin located in the south eastern part of india and a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model parameters was carried out to prove its robustness in terms of the proposed model convergence and validity over the broad spectrum values of the proposed model parameters the solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 million cubic metre mcm in the case of the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra pradesh co basin state the sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed model s allocation varied from 1584 mcm to 1336 mcm for odisha state and from 927 to 1175 mcm for andhra depending upon the importance weights given to the governing variables for the calculation of the weighting factors thus the proposed model was found to be very flexible to explore various policy options to arrive at a decision in a water sharing problem it can therefore be effectively applied to any trans boundary problem where there is conflict about water sharing among co basin states keywords system dynamics conflict resolution water sharing model water allocation water conflicts systemic approach 1 introduction water is essential to sustain life and its scarcity can be directly linked to conflicts among co basin states nations garg and hassan 2007 menzel and matovelle 2010 history is replete with examples of violent conflicts over water butts 1997 most of the time the quantity of water to be shared among co basin states constitutes the main issue pertaining to water related conflicts for example in the cauvery basin of india a water sharing conflict emerged between the downstream co basin state tamilnadu and the upstream co basin state karnataka the issue referred to decreases in the water volume for irrigation by karnataka owing to the increase in the supply of irrigation water for agriculture and as such affected the share of the downstream release of water to tamilnadu for irrigation both of the co basin states did not accept the adjudication of the tribunal iyer 2002 constituted to settle the dispute resulting in violence along the cauvery river and leading to social and political unrest the reason for not accepting the tribunal court award was that these verdicts appeared to be based on subjective decision making strategies and lacked an objective and scientific analysis of the water sharing problem traditional approaches for conflict resolution normally rely on classical game theory parrachino et al 2006 madani 2010 and or outside mediation wolf 1998 observed that traditional conflict resolution approaches provide solutions wherein one party gains at the expense of the other even when the systems involve only a few stakeholders simonovic and bender 1996 proposed a dynamic model to address conflicts through collaborative processes with the involvement of the stakeholders cobble and huffman 1999 also explored system dynamics approaches to conflict resolution wolf 2000 presented a system dynamics based indigenous approach to water conflict negotiations among nations simonovic 2002a b developed a world water model and presented a strong feedback relation between the availability of water and the different development sectors throughout the world nandalal and simonovic 2003 presented a system dynamics based conflict resolution model to resolve the conflict between two stakeholders in a hypothetical water resource system that extends across the boundaries of two different administrative units in addition to the assumption of arbitrary weighting factors the referred model dealt with the absolute values of the model variables and was likely to distort the results whenever there were significant differences in the absolute value of variables for different stakeholders even though numerous attempts have been made by researchers across disciplines wolf 2002 dinar et al 2007 to ameliorate the conflicts these were met with limited success in view of the limitations in adopting the variables in an objective manner and the inability to formulate rational approaches for the assignment of the weights to the co basin states for water sharing the general principle for trans boundary water sharing joseph 2007 among co basin states calls for a reasonable and equitable share of water ila 2004 however there is no definite approach for allocating water among co basin states even the berlin rules on water resources ila 2004 summarise the factors variables to be considered while making decisions on water allocation but they do not provide any objective criteria or formulations on how to use these factors for water allocation there is a lack of developed theoretical frameworks for water allocation among co basin states and the question still remains on how to translate these variables into objective models to determine the reasonable and equitable distribution of water among co basin states in this context a new model is proposed in the present study for water sharing among co basin states by conceptualising and formulating the struggle of the co basin states in terms of the governing variables leading to the reasonable and equitable allocation of the water of a river basin in an objective manner the present study also proposed a new conceptualisation and formulation for assessment of the weighting factors of the co basin states for water sharing by taking into account the governing variables 2 water sharing model the allocation of the limited amount of water available in the basin to the co basin states has led to conflicts among co basin states because the views of each state about their entitlement differ based on their present and perceived future demands as such an allocated amount of water that falls short of their aspired target triggers conflicts among them correspondingly the co basin states start fighting among themselves in their effort to gain their target water allocations such struggle continues till an equilibrium point is reached and can be conceptually represented in a simplified form as shown in fig 1 for the case of two co basin states x and y in general a detailed conceptualisation and formulation is needed for the reasonable and equitable allocation of the water of a river basin in an objective manner and this constitutes the focus of the present study 2 1 conceptualisation and model formulation the allocation of water to any co basin state is governed by many influencing variables in the present model the share of water for any co basin state has been assumed to be primarily a function of the following major variables that need to be considered however the authors have proposed a general formulation and therefore any number of variables can be considered if required drinking water demand of each co basin state agricultural demand of each co basin state industrial demand of each co basin state any other significant demand the geographical basin distribution in the territory of each co basin state i e co basin state catchment area arable area in each of the co basin states rainfall distribution over the catchment area of each of the co basin states and hence the contribution to the total volume of water by each co basin state existing utilisation of water by the co basin states the deviation in the allocation of water to any co basin state other than its target causes discontent the discontent of a co basin state was considered as the difference between the aspired target of a co basin state and the water allocated to that co basin state therefore it was considered conceptually essential to normalise the discontent and all the other variables before they can be used in a water sharing problem since their absolute values can lead to distortions in the results particularly when the values of the variables vary significantly among co basin states hence all the variables have been normalised in the proposed model let there be n co basin states which compete for their targeted share of water from the available water of a basin the normalised discontent of the ith co basin state dct i is defined as the difference between the target tgt i and the allocation alc i divided by its target when the target exceeds the allocation alc i the value of this variable is zero when the target is less than the allocation the discontent of the ith co basin state can be expressed in accordance to eq 1 1 dct i tgt i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 0 if alc i tgt i where i is the index of co basin states tgt i is the targeted amount of water of the ith co basin states alc i is the allocation of water to the ith co basin state and dct i is the normalised discontent of the ith co basin state let us also define the level of satisfaction stf i of the ith co basin state in a normalised form as the ratio of allocation to target the satisfaction for the ith co basin state can then be written in a general form in accordance to eq 2 2 stf i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 1 if alc i tgt i where stf i is the normalised satisfaction level of the ith co basin state in the present study the variables normalised discontent and normalised satisfaction have been interchangeably referred to as discontent and satisfaction respectively the target of the ith co basin state tgt i represents the summation of all the types of demand for the water for the ith co basin state accordingly the expression for the target of the ith state can be expressed in accordance to eq 3 3 tgt i j 1 p dsv i j where p is the number of the demand side variables and dsv i j denotes the jth demand variable for the ith co basin state in addition to this different co basin states are associated with different weighting factors w i to have their claims for more water from the total available water of the basin these weighting factors may depend upon various considerations and are discussed in detail in section 2 2 the discontents among co basin states would lead to a struggle for equity in water allocation this struggle would be directly proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and will be inversely proportional to their satisfaction therefore the general expression for struggle for equity sfe i for the ith co basin state can be written in accordance to eq 4 4 sfe i dct i stf i w i 2 2 conceptualisation and formulation for weighting factors for each co basin state the weighting factor of any co basin state towards its struggle for equity in water allocation is divided into two parts i the weights corresponding to the various water demands referred to as the demand side variables of the co basin states and ii the weights corresponding to other influencing variables referred to as the supply side variables of the co basin states irrigation water demand domestic water supply demand and industrial water demand of different co basin states have been considered as the demand side variables in the present study on the other hand the volume of the water from the rainfall contributions of different co basin states which is a function of the respective catchment area and rainfall of the co basin states existing water usage by the respective co basin states and the ratio of the respective arable areas to the catchment areas of the co basin states have been considered as the other influencing variables the idea behind the introduction of the ratio of arable to catchment areas was to take into account the fact that the hilly co basin states may have very small arable areas as compared to their catchment areas in contrast to other co basin states located in flat regions therefore this ratio may be considered as one of the influential variables for water allocation these influencing variables other than the water demand are termed as the supply side variables in the present study in order to develop a systematic procedure to determine the weights for co basin states corresponding to these demand and supply side variables it is necessary to evaluate the relative contributions and influences of each of these variables for a co basin state with respect to the entire basin accordingly the procedure can be divided into two steps as follows i the contribution of a particular demand or supply side variable to a co basin state relative to the contribution of that demand or supply side variable for the entire basin ii the influence of a particular demand or supply side variable to the entire basin relative to the entire contribution of all the demand or supply side variables for the entire basin formulations of each of these aspects are elaborated in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively finally the weighting factors of a co basin state are expressed in terms of these formulations in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 formulation for contribution of demand and supply variables the magnitudes of the various demand and supply side variables differ for the different co basin states for example different co basin states will have different water demands for domestic water supply depending upon their population the summation of the domestic water supply demands across all the co basin states would yield the total water demand of the river basin corresponding to the domestic water supply demand therefore the relative contribution of the demand side variable of a co basin state for domestic water supply can be estimated by dividing the domestic water supply of a co basin state by the total demand for domestic water supply of the entire basin the same approach can be applied for all demand and supply side variables these relative contributions of the demand and supply side variables of the co basin states are termed as demand side factors dsf and supply side factors ssf respectively for a general formulation let dsv i j denote the demand of the jth variable for the ith state and dsf i j as the corresponding demand factor the demand factors may be defined in general as the ratios of the value of the jth demand side variable for the ith co basin state to the total sum of all the jth demand side variables for all the co basin states therefore dsf i j represents the demand side factor that corresponds to the jth demand side variable for the ith co basin state and can be expressed in accordance to eq 5a 5a dsf i j dsv i j i 1 n dsv i j i 1 n j 1 p i j are integers where n is the number of the co basin states and p is the number of demand side variables in the present study p equals 3 and corresponds to the existence of three demand side variables for each co basin state namely irrigation drinking and industrial demands similarly let ssv i k denote the kth variable for the supply side for the ith state and ssf i k the corresponding supply side factor the general expression for ssf i k that corresponds to the kth supply side variable for the ith co basin state can be expressed in accordance to eq 5b 5b ssf i k ssv i k i 1 n ssv i k i 1 n k 1 q i k are integers in the present study q equals 3 and corresponds to three supply side variables namely to the existing water utilisation ratio of arable area to the respective catchment area and the volume of the water contribution function of catchment and rainfall for each co basin state 2 2 2 formulation of the influence weight of demand and supply side variables the influence weight of each of the demand side or supply side variables of the entire basin represents the proportion of that variable with respect to the total demand or supply side variables of the entire basin therefore the influence weight corresponding to a demand or supply variable can be estimated by dividing the sum of the values of particular demand or supply side variable of the entire basin with the sum of all the demand or supply side variables for the entire basin for example the influence weight of the domestic water supply of a basin can be estimated by dividing the total domestic water demand for the basin with the sum of the total water demand of the various sectors of the basin it may be worth mentioning that the influence weight of domestic water supply of a basin may not be significant since it does not normally exceed 10 to 15 of the total water demand therefore a priority policy can also be introduced while determining such influence weights for example although the domestic water supply demand may have less influence numerically in accordance to its influence weight it may be given a higher priority weight considering its importance these influence weights are termed as demand influence weights diw and supply influence weights siw respectively the general expression used to determine the demand and supply side influence weights is explained below based on the explanations given above the influence weight of each of the demand side variables may be considered as the ratio of the demand corresponding to the summation of a demand side variable across all of the co basin states to the summation of all the demands for all the co basin states i e the summation of the overall demand corresponding to different sectors within the basin after incorporating the corresponding priority weights the main purpose of assigning priority weights to any demand side variable is to ensure that a higher priority variable will have relatively higher weights as compared to lower priority demand variables even for the same magnitude of demand normally the highest priority is given to drinking water followed by irrigation and industrial usage therefore the influence weight of the demand side of the jth variable diw j can be written in accordance to eq 6a 6a diw j i 1 n dsv i j pwd j i 1 n r 1 p dsv i r pwd r i 1 n j 1 p r 1 p i r j are integers where pwd j is the priority weight for the jth demand side variable based on a similar logic the influence weights for the supply side variables have been estimated by assigning priority weight to respective supply side variables therefore the expression used for the supply side influence weight siw k for the kth supply side variable can be expressed using eq 6b 6b siw k i 1 n ssv i k pws k i 1 n s 1 q ssv i s pws s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k are integers where pws k is the priority weight for the kth supply side variables it may be worthwhile to mention that not all the supply side variables have the same nature and units therefore in order to assign equal influence weight to each of them the absolute total values of each of these variables were considered equivalent to each other based on this assumption the priority weight of any of the supply side variables can be estimated by expressing the total value of each of these variables across all co basin states in terms of the total sum of any one variable across all co basin states taken as a reference therefore the priority weight of any of the supply side variable can be considered as the ratio of the total value of the supply side reference variable to the total value of the concerned supply side variable apart from this it may be desired to allocate different importance weights iw k to each of the supply side variable for example higher priority may be assigned to the arable to catchment area ratio as compared to the volume of the water contribution which is a function of catchment and rainfall or the existing utilisation of the water by the co basin states etc however in the present study the value of the importance weights for all supply side variables iw k were considered equal therefore the expression for the priority weight pws k for the kth supply variable can be written in accordance to eq 7 by taking the first variable i e k 1 as the reference variable 7 pws k i 1 n ssv i 1 i 1 n ssv i k iw k i 1 n k 1 q i k are integers where iw k is the importance weight of the kth supply side variable 2 2 3 formulation of weighting factor for each co basin state after the calculation of the contribution factors i e dsf i j and ssf i k of each of the demand and supply side variables for each of the co basin states and influence weights of each of the demand diw j and supply siw k variables the weight of a co basin state can be calculated by multiplying the contribution factors and influence weights of the demand and supply variables appropriately in addition to this either equal or unequal importance can be assigned to the overall influence of demand α and to the overall influence of supply β to determine the overall weighting factor w of a co basin state therefore the weight of the ith co basin state w i can be expressed in accordance to eq 8 8 w i α j 1 p dsf i j diw j β k 1 q ssf i k siw k where α is the overall weight of the demand variables with values ranging between 0 and 1 β is the overall weight of the supply variables considered as 1 α to normalise the weights p is the number of demand side variables q is the number of the supply side variables j is the index of the demand side variable governing water allocations k is the index of the supply side variable governing water allocations dsf i j is the demand side factor of the jth demand side variable of the ith co basin state diw j is the influence weight of the jth demand side variable ssf i k is the supply side factor of the kth supply side variable of the ith co basin state and siw k is the influence weight of the kth supply side variable in the present model framework equal overall weights have been assigned to both the demand and supply side variables affecting the allocation of water among co basin states the values of α and β that represent the overall weight of the demand and supply side variables were both equated to 0 5 after the expressions for dsf i j ssf i k diw j and siw k have been formulated in accordance to eqs 5a 5b 6a and 6b respectively one can evaluate the values of these variables for a given set of values of demand and supply side variables thereafter the value of w i can be determined using the eq 8 2 3 water allocations among co basin states after the definition of the weighting factors of the various co basin states and the struggle for equity in water allocation the allocation of water to any co basin state from the overall water availability wa in the basin can be assumed to be proportional to the ratio of the struggle for equity of the concerned co basin state to the overall struggle for equity of all the co basin states accordingly water allocation to the ith state alc i can be written in accordance to eq 9 9 alc i sfe i wa i 1 n sfe i the above equation is non linear in terms of the variable alc i since sfe i is also a function of alc i there can be several ways to solve this non linear equation for the allocation alc i however a simple iterative technique based on a system dynamics approach has been used herein and it is described below it may be noted that the allocation of the ith state at any point of time would primarily be governed by its struggle for equity while searching for the equilibrium point of water allocation where the satisfaction and the discontent level of each co basin state would be approaching their equilibrium points depending upon the relative struggle for equity the allocation would improve further until this equilibrium point is reached thus the struggle for an equitable distribution of water allocation among the various co basin states of a basin can be initiated for a given allocation alc i of water according to eq 9 at time t in terms of the defined parameters variables the successive change in water allocation at time t δt can be determined by assigning a weight to a new value and a weight 1 to old value of alc i to control the convergence therefore this can be written in the form of eq 10 10 δ alc i sfe i wa i 1 n sfe i 1 alc i alc i where is the weight convergence factor that varies between 0 and 1 the changes in alc i over the time interval δ t are given by eq 10 hence the rate of change of alc i can be expressed in accordance to eq 11 11 alc i t kc δ alc i where kc is a time constant and δalc i is the change in the allocation for the ith co basin state in accordance to eq 10 if kc 1 0 then δalc i would correspond to the change in the value of alc i in the chosen time interval δ t eq 11 can be solved by system dynamics using alc i as the stock variable kc as the time constant and δalc i as expressed by eq 10 therefore alc i can be expressed by eq 12 in a system dynamics form 12 alc i integ kc δ alc i initial allocation the new value of the water allocation alc i to any state is adjusted in accordance with eq 12 and the process is repeated until equilibrium is reached i e δalc i 0 the above formulation for an equitable distribution of water allocation was modelled using a system dynamics approach it is explained in the next section with the help of a causal diagram by assuming two co basin states that share a basin 3 system dynamics model representation in this section the causal loop diagram and hence the system dynamics simulation model is developed to study the nature and behaviour of the proposed water sharing model although the generalised model formulation is applicable for a basin with n co basin states as described in an earlier section for ease of explanation only two co basin states namely x and y have been considered however based on a similar logic the causal loop diagram can also be extended for a basin that has more than two co basin states in the present case the development of a system dynamic causal loop diagram to represent the water sharing problem was carried out in two stages for a better understanding of the proposed mathematical model formulation in the first stage of the development of the causal loop diagram identification of the key factors and their inter relationships was conducted and then represented in the form of the diagram as shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the causal loop diagram that the overall water availability wa is to be shared between two states namely x and y furthermore the causal loop diagram also shows the stock variables namely the allocation alc1 and allocation alc2 respectively representing the allocations made to states x i e i 1 and y i e i 2 since both the states will be struggling to attain their target allocation targetx tgt1 and targety tgt2 discontent and satisfaction level changes would occur among them depending upon their target values and allocations these are represented by discontentx dct1 discontenty dct2 satisfactionx stf1 and satisfactiony stf2 respectively such a situation in water allocation leads to a propensity to struggle for equity in water allocation by both states which have been respectively represented by struggle for equityx sfe1 and struggle for equityy sfe1 in accordance to eq 4 since the two states will have different degrees of influence on water allocation they have been represented by weightx w1 and weighty w2 therefore the struggle for equity is also function of these weights as shown in the causal loop diagram details of these weights are shown and explained in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram the struggle for equity between the two states would lead to re adjustments in the allocation of water between the two states incr allocationx δalc1 and incr allocationy δalc2 respectively i e δalc1 and δalc2 this process of re adjustment in the allocation between the two states will continue as shown in the causal loop of fig 2 until the equilibrium is reached i e until both δalc1 and δalc2 approach zero after the development of the first stage of the causal loop diagram the details of the targets and weights corresponding to each of co basin states are shown in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram fig 3 for example the weights of the states x and y have been listed as weightx w1 and weighty w2 respectively and they are a function of the demand side variables such as the agricultural drinking water and industrial demands as well as a function of the supply side variables such as the existing water utilisation volume of water contribution and ratio of arable to catchment area for each of the co basin states it may be noted here that all the variable codes representing each of the factors in the casual loop diagram are shown by their descriptive names for example a struggle for equity for state x has been represented by sfe1 and similarly a struggle for equity for state y is represented by sfe2 while assigning the variable code in the casual loop diagram the subscript has been appended at the end of the variable code for example the first demand side variable i e j 1 which is the agricultural demand for statex i e i 1 is represented by dsv11 while for statey i e i 2 it is represented by dsv21 on a similar basis for the second demand variable j 2 which is the drinking water demand for statex i e i 1 and statey i e i 2 these have been denoted as dsv12 and dsv22 respectively the same indexing pattern has been adopted to represent the demand and supply factors along with their influence weights the calculations of weights were completed in accordance with eqs 5 through 8 and are self explanatory 4 vamsadhara river system the proposed model was applied to the vamsadhara river basin fig 4 in india the data had been estimated obtained from various government publications reports and information available on the internet the vamsadhara river basin vrb is situated between the mahanadi and godavari river basins of south india and geographically lies between the north latitude co ordinates of 18 15 to 19 55 and the east longitudes of 83 20 to 84 20 singh and jain 2015 it is an interstate drainage basin lying between andhra pradesh and odisha the vamsadhara river originates from the flanks of durgankar hills lingraj hills of the eastern ghats near village tentulipadar lanjigarh in the kalahandi district of odisha at an elevation of 1300 m from a location that has a latitude of 19 51 n and a longitude of 83 29 e it flows from the south to the east inside odisha for approximately 154 km until it approaches the odisha andhra pradesh border it enters andhra pradesh at bhattili and thereafter it runs along and adjacent to the inter state border for more than 40 km before entering the main land of the state of andhra pradesh south of baleru it finally joins the bay of bengal near kalingapatnam the total catchment area of the vamsadhara river basin is 10830 km2 out of which areas spanning 8796 km2 and 2034 km2 have been estimated to exist within the odisha and andhra pradesh states respectively the vamsadhara river basin can be divided in 18 sub basins based on the pattern of the drainage network its prominent tributaries on the right side are bhangi and pedagoda whereas on the left side are badanalla chauladhua pandaka nalla badajhar harbhangi sananadi and mahendratanaya its major tributary is mahendratanaya that originates in the state of odisha it enters andhra pradesh in pathapatanam mandal and joins the vamsadhara river at right angles north of hiramandalam the part of the catchment area lying in odisha is predominantly hilly and populated by tribes whereas that lying in andhra pradesh is predominantly a flat area the annual average rainfall for vamsadhara basin was estimated by theissen polygon method from the annual normal rainfall data of the rain gauges located in and around the vamsadhara basin the annual average rainfall for the entire vamsadhara basin was estimated to be 1326 mm whereas within the catchment areas lying within the odisha and andhra pradesh states the rainfall was estimated as 1349 mm and 1226 mm respectively the water availability in the vamsadhara basin has been estimated to be 2511 mcm nwda 2012 the cultivable arable areas within the odisha and andhra pradesh parts of the river basin have been estimated as 203525 ha and 125627 ha respectively based on the respective district handbooks it may be noted that even though the catchment area ratio between the two states i e odisha and andhra pradesh is approximately 81 19 the arable area ratio is 62 38 the arable to catchment area ratio for the odisha state is only 23 as most of the catchment area lies in hilly terrain whereas the arable to catchment area ratio for the andhra co basin state is 62 the existing irrigation demands for the odisha and andhra pradesh arable areas have been estimated to 226 mcm and 364 mcm respectively however the irrigation demand assuming full development has been estimated to 1612 mcm and 1192 mcm for odisha and andhra pradesh respectively these demands have been estimated by assuming average respective delta values of 0 79 m and 0 95 m based on various project reports for odisha and andhra pradesh the population of the basin was estimated using census data with the logistic curve method accordingly the population of the basin has been estimated to 2 745 464 in 2051 for the vamsadhara basin out of which 1 724 876 and 1 020 587 will be in odisha and andhra pradesh respectively the overall annual drinking water demand was estimated to be 135 mcm 85 mcm for odisha and 50 mcm for andhra pradesh assuming 135 l per capita per day while the existing drinking water demand had been estimated to 102 mcm 57 mcm for odisha and 45 mcm for andhra pradesh in the absence of relevant data to estimate the industrial water needs nwda 2012 suggested to assume that the industrial requirement was of the same order as that of the basin sub basin accordingly the industrial water requirement had been assumed to be 1 5 times the domestic water demand the existing industrial demand had been considered as 153 mcm for the vamsadhara basin out of which 85 mcm and 68 mcm were respectively estimated for odisha and andhra pradesh the industrial water requirement had been estimated to increase to 203 mcm by 2051 out of which 127 mcm will be within odisha and 75 mcm will be within andhra pradesh a summary of the vamsadhara basin data and other parameters associated with the proposed model are listed in table 1 two co basin states of the vamsadhara basin namely odisha and andhra pradesh states can be assumed as x and y of fig 3 respectively to visualize the proposed model variables parameters 5 results and discussion before applying the proposed model to a real basin it was considered necessary to compare the results of the present model with another objective model proposed by nandalal and simonovic 2003 since other water sharing models were subjective and were formulated based on negotiations such a comparison was made to generate more confidence in the proposed model as the present model was different from that of nandalal and simonovic 2003 5 1 comparisons with another water sharing model a comparison of the results of the proposed model with that of nandalal and simonovic 2003 were made using their original data pertaining to a hypothetical water resources system that had a water sharing conflict between the two stakeholders a and b the targets for stakeholders a and b were assumed to be 30 mcm and 60 mcm respectively with a water availability of 50 mcm the weights for stakeholders a and b were assumed to be 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the differences between the normalised discontents of stakeholders a and b for different water availabilities are plotted in fig 5 using both models it can be observed in fig 5 that the proposed model yielded differences in the normalised discontents of stakeholders a and b of 6 5 and 11 7 corresponding to water availabilities of 20 mcm and 60 mcm respectively the corresponding values of the difference in the normalised discontents using the nandalal and simonovic model 2003 can be observed from fig 5 to be 14 7 and 33 3 respectively it can further be noted from fig 5 that the differences in the discontents were always significantly lower when using the proposed model as compared to those predicted by nandalal and simonovic 2003 for different water availabilities therefore the proposed model is likely to give more equitable allocation of water among different stakeholders for a given set of parameters 5 2 application of model to vamsadhara basin the proposed model was then applied to a real basin namely to the vamsadhara basin of india whose water is to be shared between two co basin states odisha and andhra pradesh as described in section 4 the total water availability for the vamsadhara basin was estimated as 2511 mcm nwda 2012 whereas the total targeted demand for both co basin states had been estimated to 3141 mcm out of which the target for odisha was 1824 mcm and that for andhra pradesh was 1317 mcm the overall weight of the demand α and supply β variables had been assumed to equal 0 5 the importance weight of each of the supply side variable iw1 iw2 and iw3 and the priority weights of the three demand side variables pwd1 pwd2 and pwd3 were considered as unity the time constant and convergence factor were assumed to be equal to 1 and 0 2 respectively the proposed model for water sharing was run for the vamsadhara basin corresponding to the given set of parameter values as described in section 4 the initial allocation was assumed to be 100 mcm for both co basin states the proposed model yielded the weighting factor values of the respective co basin states namely odisha w1 and andhra pradesh w2 as 0 546 and 0 454 respectively the solution converged to a final allocation of 1444 mcm for the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra co basin state with the same order of discontent in the case of the two states at 0 20 0 21 for odisha and 0 19 for andhra pradesh the successive process of convergence until the final allocations is shown in fig 6 while the corresponding discontents are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from figs 6 and 7 that the allocations and discontents converged quickly to their final equilibrium values the proposed model for water sharing was also subjected to a number of simulation experiments in order to investigate its behaviour for different sets of possible parameter values accordingly simulation results for the vamsadhara river basin were investigated for i the impact of the initial trial values on the final allocations ii impact of convergence factor and time constant kc on the stability of the solution iii sensitivity of final water allocations with respect to the overall weights of the demand supply side variables and iv sensitivity of the final water allocations with respect to the influence weights given to various variables 5 2 1 impact of initial trial water allocations on final water allocations the initial water allocation was varied from a minimum value close to zero to a maximum value close to the water availability the results for the co basin state of odisha are shown in fig 8 since similar initial allocation impacts were also found for andhra pradesh it can be observed from fig 8 that the initial trial value of the water allocations does not have any impact on the final allocation for the odisha co basin state it is further evident from fig 8 that the results converged quickly to a final allocation value irrespective of the initial allocation value of water 5 2 2 impact of convergence factor and time constant on stability of allocations the convergence factor was used for the numerical stability and convergence of the final water allocation among co basin states the numerical stability and convergence of the proposed model solution can be ensured by assuming a suitable value for the convergence factor or a time constant kc or by assigning suitable values for both parameters simultaneously the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model solution was thus carried out for these three cases namely i 0 25 and kc 1 ii kc 0 25 and 1 and iii kc 0 25 the results of the sensitivity analysis were found to be same in all these three cases and it was found that the solution converged as long as kc was less than 0 25 irrespective of the individual values of and kc therefore the results corresponding to kc 0 25 are shown in fig 9 only for the odisha state since similar results were elicited for the state of andhra pradesh the upper bound curve in fig 9 corresponded to kc value close 0 25 it can be observed from fig 9 that the solution required a longer time to converge to the final allocation corresponding to the lower values of kc but quickly converged to the final allocation since kc was approaching 0 25 however the results for kc values greater than 0 25 are not shown since the solution became unstable 5 2 3 impact of the overall weight of demand α and supply β variables on water allocations the value of 0 5 was assigned to both α and β this implied that equal importance had been given to both the demand and supply side variables as the sums of α and β had been maintained to unity value to normalise the weights therefore when a zero value was allocated to α it would obviously mean that the entire weighting factor was assigned to the supply side variables while a value of unity allocated to α would imply that the entire weighting factor would be assigned to the demand side variables figs 10 and 11 show the effect of changing the overall weight of the demand α and supply β side variables within a range of 0 to 1 for the co basin states of odisha and andhra pradesh respectively the lowest value of the final water allocation of 1430 mcm to the odisha state in fig 10 correspond to a zero value for α while the highest value of 1458 mcm for odisha correspond to unity value for α the opposite was true for the water allocations of 1081 mcm and 1053 mcm to andhra pradesh that corresponded to α 0 and α 1 respectively as shown in fig 11 the same trend of water allocation was found for both co basin states that corresponded to α and β values within the range of 0 to 1 since the sum of α and β was always one 5 2 4 sensitivity of final water allocations to the importance priority weights given to demand and supply side variables table 2 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the importance weights of the supply side variables and priority weights of the demand side variables the importance weights for the supply side variables iw1 iw2 and iw3 corresponded to the existing utilisation volume of water contribution and arable area to catchment ratio respectively the priority weights for the demand side variable pwd1 pwd2 and pwd3 corresponded to agriculture drinking water and industrial water demands respectively scenario 1 of table 2 shows the allocations under normal conditions by assuming equal weightage to importance and priority weights of the supply and demand side variables the results of scenario 1 were already discussed in the section 5 2 the sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the importance weight of the supply side variables while keeping the overall weight of the supply side variables β equal to unity and by assuming that the overall weight of the demand side variables α was zero the results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the importance weight parameters are shown in table 2 in scenarios 2 6 scenario 2 considered the allocations based on the existing utilisation only scenario 2 yielded water allocation of 1110 mcm to andhra and 1401 mcm to odisha with respective discontents of approximately 0 16 for andhra and 0 23 for odisha since the existing utilisation to andhra was more than that for odisha it can be seen from table 2 that the maximum allocation of 1584 mcm to the odisha state corresponded to scenario 3 whereby the allocations were based only on the volume of the water contribution of the supply variable i e iw2 1 and assigned zero importance to the other supply side variables i e iwi 0 and iw3 0 under scenario 3 andhra pradesh is expected to receive an allocation of 927 mcm with a discontent of approximately 0 21 as compared to a discontent of approximately 0 13 that corresponded to the odisha state this was evident from the fact that the weighting factor for odisha increased to 0 8263 while it reduced to 0 1736 for the andhra pradesh co basin state because 81 of the catchment area of the basin lies in the odisha co basin state however the arable area to catchment ratio for the state of odisha was only 23 as most of the catchment areas were in hilly terrain whereas the arable area to catchment ratio for the andhra co basin state was 62 since both the co basin states can only utilise the water available in the basin it may not be proper to consider the allocations based only on the volume of the water contribution of the respective co basin states hence the arable area to catchment ratio was also conceived as one of the supply side variables scenario 4 of table 2 yielded the allocations based only on the arable area to catchment ratio by maintaining iw3 1 iw1 0 and iw2 0 the results indicated the reverse trend of water allocations as water allocations were reduced from 1584 to 1336 mcm for the odisha state and increased from 927 mcm to 1175 mcm for andhra therefore a balanced approach would give equal importance to both parameters and such was considered in scenario 5 as listed in table 2 the water allocation under scenario 5 yielded 1446 mcm for odisha and 1065 mcm for andhra pradesh with an almost similar discontent of approximately 0 20 for both co basin states scenario 6 was also considered by assigning unity importance weights for all the supply side variables scenario 6 yielded 1430 mcm for odisha and 1081 mcm for andhra pradesh with a discontent of approximately 0 22 for odisha and 0 18 for andhra pradesh finally scenario 7 was analysed by assigning different priority weights to the demand side variables while giving no weightage to the supply side variables the priority weight corresponding to the drinking water pwd2 was maintained to a value of 3 followed by the priority weight that corresponded to an agricultural demand pwd1 that was equal to 2 and to a corresponding industrial water demand for pwd3 equal to 1 it can be seen from scenario 7 of table 1 that the allocations became equal to 1458 mcm for odisha and 1053 mcm for andhra pradesh with an approximate discontent of 0 20 for both co basin states the increase in the allocation for odisha was attributed to the fact that the water requirement was increased for odisha and to the higher priority weight assigned to the drinking water demand therefore it can be concluded from the sensitivity analysis that the proposed model responded quite rationally to the variations in the importance weights and priority weights given to the supply and demand side variables 6 conclusions a new model for water sharing was proposed in the present study the main features of the proposed model can be summarised as follows i the proposed framework model was formulated for the reasonable and equitable sharing of water among co basin states based on governing variables ii the governing variables were suitably normalised to avoid any discrepancies in the results arising from the broad range of variations in their values among the co basin states iii the ratio of command to catchment has also been found to be a new governing variable for the reasonable and equitable sharing of water iv the conceptualisation and formulation were also presented to identify the normalised weights of co basin states for water sharing in a systematic manner as a function of the demand and supply side variables including their relative importance v a formulation was also developed to incorporate variables of different nature and convert units to a common scale vi the proposed model was generalized and can incorporate any number of governing variables different priority weights can also be assigned to the governing variables to explore the various policy options for water sharing vii the water allocation to any co basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity the struggle for equity of co basin states was assumed to be proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and inversely proportional to their satisfaction viii the proposed model can also be conveniently represented and solved using a system dynamics approach therefore various policy options can be easily explored through system dynamics the proposed model yielded remarkably better results for reasonable and equitable water sharing when compared to the modelling results using other model the proposed model was also applied to the vamsadhara basin in india whose water was required to be shared between two co basin states namely odisha and andhra pradesh the solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 mcm for the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra co basin state with the same discontent of 0 20 for both co basin states a sensitivity analysis was also carried out to investigate the proposed model behaviour under different sets of possible values for various parameters the results showed that the proposed model was not sensitive to the initial trial values of the water allocations to both co basin states and converged quickly to their final allocations irrespective of the initial allocations the results of the sensitivity analysis on convergence indicated that the solution converged quickly to the same final value as long as the product kc of the convergence factor and the time constant kc was less than 0 25 irrespective of the individual values of and kc the sensitivity analysis also showed that the volume of the water contribution of the co basin states needs to be considered along with the arable area to catchment ratio of the co basin states to avoid distortions in water allocations among co basin states the vamsadhara basin case study that was used for illustrative purposes confirmed that the proposed framework model is quite flexible and can be used effectively to resolve water sharing issues among co basin states of a river basin for reasonable and equitable allocation of water 7 disclaimer all the data used in this study were based on information available on the internet and or government publications available in the public domain as such they were not authenticated by concerned government of co basin states the purpose of this study is only to illustrate the use of the proposed water sharing framework model to real basin data and hence this study does not constitute a policy advice publication 
7343,a new framework model is presented in this study for sharing of water in a river basin using certain governing variables in an effort to enhance the objectivity for a reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states the governing variables were normalised to reduce the governing variables of different co basin states of a river basin on same scale in the absence of objective methods for evaluating the weights to be assigned to co basin states for water allocation a framework was conceptualised and formulated to determine the normalised weighting factors of different co basin states as a function of the governing variables the water allocation to any co basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity which in turn was assumed to be a function of the normalised discontent satisfaction and weighting factors of each co basin state system dynamics was used effectively to represent and solve the proposed model formulation the proposed model was successfully applied to the vamsadhara river basin located in the south eastern part of india and a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model parameters was carried out to prove its robustness in terms of the proposed model convergence and validity over the broad spectrum values of the proposed model parameters the solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 million cubic metre mcm in the case of the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra pradesh co basin state the sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed model s allocation varied from 1584 mcm to 1336 mcm for odisha state and from 927 to 1175 mcm for andhra depending upon the importance weights given to the governing variables for the calculation of the weighting factors thus the proposed model was found to be very flexible to explore various policy options to arrive at a decision in a water sharing problem it can therefore be effectively applied to any trans boundary problem where there is conflict about water sharing among co basin states keywords system dynamics conflict resolution water sharing model water allocation water conflicts systemic approach 1 introduction water is essential to sustain life and its scarcity can be directly linked to conflicts among co basin states nations garg and hassan 2007 menzel and matovelle 2010 history is replete with examples of violent conflicts over water butts 1997 most of the time the quantity of water to be shared among co basin states constitutes the main issue pertaining to water related conflicts for example in the cauvery basin of india a water sharing conflict emerged between the downstream co basin state tamilnadu and the upstream co basin state karnataka the issue referred to decreases in the water volume for irrigation by karnataka owing to the increase in the supply of irrigation water for agriculture and as such affected the share of the downstream release of water to tamilnadu for irrigation both of the co basin states did not accept the adjudication of the tribunal iyer 2002 constituted to settle the dispute resulting in violence along the cauvery river and leading to social and political unrest the reason for not accepting the tribunal court award was that these verdicts appeared to be based on subjective decision making strategies and lacked an objective and scientific analysis of the water sharing problem traditional approaches for conflict resolution normally rely on classical game theory parrachino et al 2006 madani 2010 and or outside mediation wolf 1998 observed that traditional conflict resolution approaches provide solutions wherein one party gains at the expense of the other even when the systems involve only a few stakeholders simonovic and bender 1996 proposed a dynamic model to address conflicts through collaborative processes with the involvement of the stakeholders cobble and huffman 1999 also explored system dynamics approaches to conflict resolution wolf 2000 presented a system dynamics based indigenous approach to water conflict negotiations among nations simonovic 2002a b developed a world water model and presented a strong feedback relation between the availability of water and the different development sectors throughout the world nandalal and simonovic 2003 presented a system dynamics based conflict resolution model to resolve the conflict between two stakeholders in a hypothetical water resource system that extends across the boundaries of two different administrative units in addition to the assumption of arbitrary weighting factors the referred model dealt with the absolute values of the model variables and was likely to distort the results whenever there were significant differences in the absolute value of variables for different stakeholders even though numerous attempts have been made by researchers across disciplines wolf 2002 dinar et al 2007 to ameliorate the conflicts these were met with limited success in view of the limitations in adopting the variables in an objective manner and the inability to formulate rational approaches for the assignment of the weights to the co basin states for water sharing the general principle for trans boundary water sharing joseph 2007 among co basin states calls for a reasonable and equitable share of water ila 2004 however there is no definite approach for allocating water among co basin states even the berlin rules on water resources ila 2004 summarise the factors variables to be considered while making decisions on water allocation but they do not provide any objective criteria or formulations on how to use these factors for water allocation there is a lack of developed theoretical frameworks for water allocation among co basin states and the question still remains on how to translate these variables into objective models to determine the reasonable and equitable distribution of water among co basin states in this context a new model is proposed in the present study for water sharing among co basin states by conceptualising and formulating the struggle of the co basin states in terms of the governing variables leading to the reasonable and equitable allocation of the water of a river basin in an objective manner the present study also proposed a new conceptualisation and formulation for assessment of the weighting factors of the co basin states for water sharing by taking into account the governing variables 2 water sharing model the allocation of the limited amount of water available in the basin to the co basin states has led to conflicts among co basin states because the views of each state about their entitlement differ based on their present and perceived future demands as such an allocated amount of water that falls short of their aspired target triggers conflicts among them correspondingly the co basin states start fighting among themselves in their effort to gain their target water allocations such struggle continues till an equilibrium point is reached and can be conceptually represented in a simplified form as shown in fig 1 for the case of two co basin states x and y in general a detailed conceptualisation and formulation is needed for the reasonable and equitable allocation of the water of a river basin in an objective manner and this constitutes the focus of the present study 2 1 conceptualisation and model formulation the allocation of water to any co basin state is governed by many influencing variables in the present model the share of water for any co basin state has been assumed to be primarily a function of the following major variables that need to be considered however the authors have proposed a general formulation and therefore any number of variables can be considered if required drinking water demand of each co basin state agricultural demand of each co basin state industrial demand of each co basin state any other significant demand the geographical basin distribution in the territory of each co basin state i e co basin state catchment area arable area in each of the co basin states rainfall distribution over the catchment area of each of the co basin states and hence the contribution to the total volume of water by each co basin state existing utilisation of water by the co basin states the deviation in the allocation of water to any co basin state other than its target causes discontent the discontent of a co basin state was considered as the difference between the aspired target of a co basin state and the water allocated to that co basin state therefore it was considered conceptually essential to normalise the discontent and all the other variables before they can be used in a water sharing problem since their absolute values can lead to distortions in the results particularly when the values of the variables vary significantly among co basin states hence all the variables have been normalised in the proposed model let there be n co basin states which compete for their targeted share of water from the available water of a basin the normalised discontent of the ith co basin state dct i is defined as the difference between the target tgt i and the allocation alc i divided by its target when the target exceeds the allocation alc i the value of this variable is zero when the target is less than the allocation the discontent of the ith co basin state can be expressed in accordance to eq 1 1 dct i tgt i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 0 if alc i tgt i where i is the index of co basin states tgt i is the targeted amount of water of the ith co basin states alc i is the allocation of water to the ith co basin state and dct i is the normalised discontent of the ith co basin state let us also define the level of satisfaction stf i of the ith co basin state in a normalised form as the ratio of allocation to target the satisfaction for the ith co basin state can then be written in a general form in accordance to eq 2 2 stf i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 1 if alc i tgt i where stf i is the normalised satisfaction level of the ith co basin state in the present study the variables normalised discontent and normalised satisfaction have been interchangeably referred to as discontent and satisfaction respectively the target of the ith co basin state tgt i represents the summation of all the types of demand for the water for the ith co basin state accordingly the expression for the target of the ith state can be expressed in accordance to eq 3 3 tgt i j 1 p dsv i j where p is the number of the demand side variables and dsv i j denotes the jth demand variable for the ith co basin state in addition to this different co basin states are associated with different weighting factors w i to have their claims for more water from the total available water of the basin these weighting factors may depend upon various considerations and are discussed in detail in section 2 2 the discontents among co basin states would lead to a struggle for equity in water allocation this struggle would be directly proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and will be inversely proportional to their satisfaction therefore the general expression for struggle for equity sfe i for the ith co basin state can be written in accordance to eq 4 4 sfe i dct i stf i w i 2 2 conceptualisation and formulation for weighting factors for each co basin state the weighting factor of any co basin state towards its struggle for equity in water allocation is divided into two parts i the weights corresponding to the various water demands referred to as the demand side variables of the co basin states and ii the weights corresponding to other influencing variables referred to as the supply side variables of the co basin states irrigation water demand domestic water supply demand and industrial water demand of different co basin states have been considered as the demand side variables in the present study on the other hand the volume of the water from the rainfall contributions of different co basin states which is a function of the respective catchment area and rainfall of the co basin states existing water usage by the respective co basin states and the ratio of the respective arable areas to the catchment areas of the co basin states have been considered as the other influencing variables the idea behind the introduction of the ratio of arable to catchment areas was to take into account the fact that the hilly co basin states may have very small arable areas as compared to their catchment areas in contrast to other co basin states located in flat regions therefore this ratio may be considered as one of the influential variables for water allocation these influencing variables other than the water demand are termed as the supply side variables in the present study in order to develop a systematic procedure to determine the weights for co basin states corresponding to these demand and supply side variables it is necessary to evaluate the relative contributions and influences of each of these variables for a co basin state with respect to the entire basin accordingly the procedure can be divided into two steps as follows i the contribution of a particular demand or supply side variable to a co basin state relative to the contribution of that demand or supply side variable for the entire basin ii the influence of a particular demand or supply side variable to the entire basin relative to the entire contribution of all the demand or supply side variables for the entire basin formulations of each of these aspects are elaborated in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively finally the weighting factors of a co basin state are expressed in terms of these formulations in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 formulation for contribution of demand and supply variables the magnitudes of the various demand and supply side variables differ for the different co basin states for example different co basin states will have different water demands for domestic water supply depending upon their population the summation of the domestic water supply demands across all the co basin states would yield the total water demand of the river basin corresponding to the domestic water supply demand therefore the relative contribution of the demand side variable of a co basin state for domestic water supply can be estimated by dividing the domestic water supply of a co basin state by the total demand for domestic water supply of the entire basin the same approach can be applied for all demand and supply side variables these relative contributions of the demand and supply side variables of the co basin states are termed as demand side factors dsf and supply side factors ssf respectively for a general formulation let dsv i j denote the demand of the jth variable for the ith state and dsf i j as the corresponding demand factor the demand factors may be defined in general as the ratios of the value of the jth demand side variable for the ith co basin state to the total sum of all the jth demand side variables for all the co basin states therefore dsf i j represents the demand side factor that corresponds to the jth demand side variable for the ith co basin state and can be expressed in accordance to eq 5a 5a dsf i j dsv i j i 1 n dsv i j i 1 n j 1 p i j are integers where n is the number of the co basin states and p is the number of demand side variables in the present study p equals 3 and corresponds to the existence of three demand side variables for each co basin state namely irrigation drinking and industrial demands similarly let ssv i k denote the kth variable for the supply side for the ith state and ssf i k the corresponding supply side factor the general expression for ssf i k that corresponds to the kth supply side variable for the ith co basin state can be expressed in accordance to eq 5b 5b ssf i k ssv i k i 1 n ssv i k i 1 n k 1 q i k are integers in the present study q equals 3 and corresponds to three supply side variables namely to the existing water utilisation ratio of arable area to the respective catchment area and the volume of the water contribution function of catchment and rainfall for each co basin state 2 2 2 formulation of the influence weight of demand and supply side variables the influence weight of each of the demand side or supply side variables of the entire basin represents the proportion of that variable with respect to the total demand or supply side variables of the entire basin therefore the influence weight corresponding to a demand or supply variable can be estimated by dividing the sum of the values of particular demand or supply side variable of the entire basin with the sum of all the demand or supply side variables for the entire basin for example the influence weight of the domestic water supply of a basin can be estimated by dividing the total domestic water demand for the basin with the sum of the total water demand of the various sectors of the basin it may be worth mentioning that the influence weight of domestic water supply of a basin may not be significant since it does not normally exceed 10 to 15 of the total water demand therefore a priority policy can also be introduced while determining such influence weights for example although the domestic water supply demand may have less influence numerically in accordance to its influence weight it may be given a higher priority weight considering its importance these influence weights are termed as demand influence weights diw and supply influence weights siw respectively the general expression used to determine the demand and supply side influence weights is explained below based on the explanations given above the influence weight of each of the demand side variables may be considered as the ratio of the demand corresponding to the summation of a demand side variable across all of the co basin states to the summation of all the demands for all the co basin states i e the summation of the overall demand corresponding to different sectors within the basin after incorporating the corresponding priority weights the main purpose of assigning priority weights to any demand side variable is to ensure that a higher priority variable will have relatively higher weights as compared to lower priority demand variables even for the same magnitude of demand normally the highest priority is given to drinking water followed by irrigation and industrial usage therefore the influence weight of the demand side of the jth variable diw j can be written in accordance to eq 6a 6a diw j i 1 n dsv i j pwd j i 1 n r 1 p dsv i r pwd r i 1 n j 1 p r 1 p i r j are integers where pwd j is the priority weight for the jth demand side variable based on a similar logic the influence weights for the supply side variables have been estimated by assigning priority weight to respective supply side variables therefore the expression used for the supply side influence weight siw k for the kth supply side variable can be expressed using eq 6b 6b siw k i 1 n ssv i k pws k i 1 n s 1 q ssv i s pws s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k are integers where pws k is the priority weight for the kth supply side variables it may be worthwhile to mention that not all the supply side variables have the same nature and units therefore in order to assign equal influence weight to each of them the absolute total values of each of these variables were considered equivalent to each other based on this assumption the priority weight of any of the supply side variables can be estimated by expressing the total value of each of these variables across all co basin states in terms of the total sum of any one variable across all co basin states taken as a reference therefore the priority weight of any of the supply side variable can be considered as the ratio of the total value of the supply side reference variable to the total value of the concerned supply side variable apart from this it may be desired to allocate different importance weights iw k to each of the supply side variable for example higher priority may be assigned to the arable to catchment area ratio as compared to the volume of the water contribution which is a function of catchment and rainfall or the existing utilisation of the water by the co basin states etc however in the present study the value of the importance weights for all supply side variables iw k were considered equal therefore the expression for the priority weight pws k for the kth supply variable can be written in accordance to eq 7 by taking the first variable i e k 1 as the reference variable 7 pws k i 1 n ssv i 1 i 1 n ssv i k iw k i 1 n k 1 q i k are integers where iw k is the importance weight of the kth supply side variable 2 2 3 formulation of weighting factor for each co basin state after the calculation of the contribution factors i e dsf i j and ssf i k of each of the demand and supply side variables for each of the co basin states and influence weights of each of the demand diw j and supply siw k variables the weight of a co basin state can be calculated by multiplying the contribution factors and influence weights of the demand and supply variables appropriately in addition to this either equal or unequal importance can be assigned to the overall influence of demand α and to the overall influence of supply β to determine the overall weighting factor w of a co basin state therefore the weight of the ith co basin state w i can be expressed in accordance to eq 8 8 w i α j 1 p dsf i j diw j β k 1 q ssf i k siw k where α is the overall weight of the demand variables with values ranging between 0 and 1 β is the overall weight of the supply variables considered as 1 α to normalise the weights p is the number of demand side variables q is the number of the supply side variables j is the index of the demand side variable governing water allocations k is the index of the supply side variable governing water allocations dsf i j is the demand side factor of the jth demand side variable of the ith co basin state diw j is the influence weight of the jth demand side variable ssf i k is the supply side factor of the kth supply side variable of the ith co basin state and siw k is the influence weight of the kth supply side variable in the present model framework equal overall weights have been assigned to both the demand and supply side variables affecting the allocation of water among co basin states the values of α and β that represent the overall weight of the demand and supply side variables were both equated to 0 5 after the expressions for dsf i j ssf i k diw j and siw k have been formulated in accordance to eqs 5a 5b 6a and 6b respectively one can evaluate the values of these variables for a given set of values of demand and supply side variables thereafter the value of w i can be determined using the eq 8 2 3 water allocations among co basin states after the definition of the weighting factors of the various co basin states and the struggle for equity in water allocation the allocation of water to any co basin state from the overall water availability wa in the basin can be assumed to be proportional to the ratio of the struggle for equity of the concerned co basin state to the overall struggle for equity of all the co basin states accordingly water allocation to the ith state alc i can be written in accordance to eq 9 9 alc i sfe i wa i 1 n sfe i the above equation is non linear in terms of the variable alc i since sfe i is also a function of alc i there can be several ways to solve this non linear equation for the allocation alc i however a simple iterative technique based on a system dynamics approach has been used herein and it is described below it may be noted that the allocation of the ith state at any point of time would primarily be governed by its struggle for equity while searching for the equilibrium point of water allocation where the satisfaction and the discontent level of each co basin state would be approaching their equilibrium points depending upon the relative struggle for equity the allocation would improve further until this equilibrium point is reached thus the struggle for an equitable distribution of water allocation among the various co basin states of a basin can be initiated for a given allocation alc i of water according to eq 9 at time t in terms of the defined parameters variables the successive change in water allocation at time t δt can be determined by assigning a weight to a new value and a weight 1 to old value of alc i to control the convergence therefore this can be written in the form of eq 10 10 δ alc i sfe i wa i 1 n sfe i 1 alc i alc i where is the weight convergence factor that varies between 0 and 1 the changes in alc i over the time interval δ t are given by eq 10 hence the rate of change of alc i can be expressed in accordance to eq 11 11 alc i t kc δ alc i where kc is a time constant and δalc i is the change in the allocation for the ith co basin state in accordance to eq 10 if kc 1 0 then δalc i would correspond to the change in the value of alc i in the chosen time interval δ t eq 11 can be solved by system dynamics using alc i as the stock variable kc as the time constant and δalc i as expressed by eq 10 therefore alc i can be expressed by eq 12 in a system dynamics form 12 alc i integ kc δ alc i initial allocation the new value of the water allocation alc i to any state is adjusted in accordance with eq 12 and the process is repeated until equilibrium is reached i e δalc i 0 the above formulation for an equitable distribution of water allocation was modelled using a system dynamics approach it is explained in the next section with the help of a causal diagram by assuming two co basin states that share a basin 3 system dynamics model representation in this section the causal loop diagram and hence the system dynamics simulation model is developed to study the nature and behaviour of the proposed water sharing model although the generalised model formulation is applicable for a basin with n co basin states as described in an earlier section for ease of explanation only two co basin states namely x and y have been considered however based on a similar logic the causal loop diagram can also be extended for a basin that has more than two co basin states in the present case the development of a system dynamic causal loop diagram to represent the water sharing problem was carried out in two stages for a better understanding of the proposed mathematical model formulation in the first stage of the development of the causal loop diagram identification of the key factors and their inter relationships was conducted and then represented in the form of the diagram as shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the causal loop diagram that the overall water availability wa is to be shared between two states namely x and y furthermore the causal loop diagram also shows the stock variables namely the allocation alc1 and allocation alc2 respectively representing the allocations made to states x i e i 1 and y i e i 2 since both the states will be struggling to attain their target allocation targetx tgt1 and targety tgt2 discontent and satisfaction level changes would occur among them depending upon their target values and allocations these are represented by discontentx dct1 discontenty dct2 satisfactionx stf1 and satisfactiony stf2 respectively such a situation in water allocation leads to a propensity to struggle for equity in water allocation by both states which have been respectively represented by struggle for equityx sfe1 and struggle for equityy sfe1 in accordance to eq 4 since the two states will have different degrees of influence on water allocation they have been represented by weightx w1 and weighty w2 therefore the struggle for equity is also function of these weights as shown in the causal loop diagram details of these weights are shown and explained in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram the struggle for equity between the two states would lead to re adjustments in the allocation of water between the two states incr allocationx δalc1 and incr allocationy δalc2 respectively i e δalc1 and δalc2 this process of re adjustment in the allocation between the two states will continue as shown in the causal loop of fig 2 until the equilibrium is reached i e until both δalc1 and δalc2 approach zero after the development of the first stage of the causal loop diagram the details of the targets and weights corresponding to each of co basin states are shown in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram fig 3 for example the weights of the states x and y have been listed as weightx w1 and weighty w2 respectively and they are a function of the demand side variables such as the agricultural drinking water and industrial demands as well as a function of the supply side variables such as the existing water utilisation volume of water contribution and ratio of arable to catchment area for each of the co basin states it may be noted here that all the variable codes representing each of the factors in the casual loop diagram are shown by their descriptive names for example a struggle for equity for state x has been represented by sfe1 and similarly a struggle for equity for state y is represented by sfe2 while assigning the variable code in the casual loop diagram the subscript has been appended at the end of the variable code for example the first demand side variable i e j 1 which is the agricultural demand for statex i e i 1 is represented by dsv11 while for statey i e i 2 it is represented by dsv21 on a similar basis for the second demand variable j 2 which is the drinking water demand for statex i e i 1 and statey i e i 2 these have been denoted as dsv12 and dsv22 respectively the same indexing pattern has been adopted to represent the demand and supply factors along with their influence weights the calculations of weights were completed in accordance with eqs 5 through 8 and are self explanatory 4 vamsadhara river system the proposed model was applied to the vamsadhara river basin fig 4 in india the data had been estimated obtained from various government publications reports and information available on the internet the vamsadhara river basin vrb is situated between the mahanadi and godavari river basins of south india and geographically lies between the north latitude co ordinates of 18 15 to 19 55 and the east longitudes of 83 20 to 84 20 singh and jain 2015 it is an interstate drainage basin lying between andhra pradesh and odisha the vamsadhara river originates from the flanks of durgankar hills lingraj hills of the eastern ghats near village tentulipadar lanjigarh in the kalahandi district of odisha at an elevation of 1300 m from a location that has a latitude of 19 51 n and a longitude of 83 29 e it flows from the south to the east inside odisha for approximately 154 km until it approaches the odisha andhra pradesh border it enters andhra pradesh at bhattili and thereafter it runs along and adjacent to the inter state border for more than 40 km before entering the main land of the state of andhra pradesh south of baleru it finally joins the bay of bengal near kalingapatnam the total catchment area of the vamsadhara river basin is 10830 km2 out of which areas spanning 8796 km2 and 2034 km2 have been estimated to exist within the odisha and andhra pradesh states respectively the vamsadhara river basin can be divided in 18 sub basins based on the pattern of the drainage network its prominent tributaries on the right side are bhangi and pedagoda whereas on the left side are badanalla chauladhua pandaka nalla badajhar harbhangi sananadi and mahendratanaya its major tributary is mahendratanaya that originates in the state of odisha it enters andhra pradesh in pathapatanam mandal and joins the vamsadhara river at right angles north of hiramandalam the part of the catchment area lying in odisha is predominantly hilly and populated by tribes whereas that lying in andhra pradesh is predominantly a flat area the annual average rainfall for vamsadhara basin was estimated by theissen polygon method from the annual normal rainfall data of the rain gauges located in and around the vamsadhara basin the annual average rainfall for the entire vamsadhara basin was estimated to be 1326 mm whereas within the catchment areas lying within the odisha and andhra pradesh states the rainfall was estimated as 1349 mm and 1226 mm respectively the water availability in the vamsadhara basin has been estimated to be 2511 mcm nwda 2012 the cultivable arable areas within the odisha and andhra pradesh parts of the river basin have been estimated as 203525 ha and 125627 ha respectively based on the respective district handbooks it may be noted that even though the catchment area ratio between the two states i e odisha and andhra pradesh is approximately 81 19 the arable area ratio is 62 38 the arable to catchment area ratio for the odisha state is only 23 as most of the catchment area lies in hilly terrain whereas the arable to catchment area ratio for the andhra co basin state is 62 the existing irrigation demands for the odisha and andhra pradesh arable areas have been estimated to 226 mcm and 364 mcm respectively however the irrigation demand assuming full development has been estimated to 1612 mcm and 1192 mcm for odisha and andhra pradesh respectively these demands have been estimated by assuming average respective delta values of 0 79 m and 0 95 m based on various project reports for odisha and andhra pradesh the population of the basin was estimated using census data with the logistic curve method accordingly the population of the basin has been estimated to 2 745 464 in 2051 for the vamsadhara basin out of which 1 724 876 and 1 020 587 will be in odisha and andhra pradesh respectively the overall annual drinking water demand was estimated to be 135 mcm 85 mcm for odisha and 50 mcm for andhra pradesh assuming 135 l per capita per day while the existing drinking water demand had been estimated to 102 mcm 57 mcm for odisha and 45 mcm for andhra pradesh in the absence of relevant data to estimate the industrial water needs nwda 2012 suggested to assume that the industrial requirement was of the same order as that of the basin sub basin accordingly the industrial water requirement had been assumed to be 1 5 times the domestic water demand the existing industrial demand had been considered as 153 mcm for the vamsadhara basin out of which 85 mcm and 68 mcm were respectively estimated for odisha and andhra pradesh the industrial water requirement had been estimated to increase to 203 mcm by 2051 out of which 127 mcm will be within odisha and 75 mcm will be within andhra pradesh a summary of the vamsadhara basin data and other parameters associated with the proposed model are listed in table 1 two co basin states of the vamsadhara basin namely odisha and andhra pradesh states can be assumed as x and y of fig 3 respectively to visualize the proposed model variables parameters 5 results and discussion before applying the proposed model to a real basin it was considered necessary to compare the results of the present model with another objective model proposed by nandalal and simonovic 2003 since other water sharing models were subjective and were formulated based on negotiations such a comparison was made to generate more confidence in the proposed model as the present model was different from that of nandalal and simonovic 2003 5 1 comparisons with another water sharing model a comparison of the results of the proposed model with that of nandalal and simonovic 2003 were made using their original data pertaining to a hypothetical water resources system that had a water sharing conflict between the two stakeholders a and b the targets for stakeholders a and b were assumed to be 30 mcm and 60 mcm respectively with a water availability of 50 mcm the weights for stakeholders a and b were assumed to be 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the differences between the normalised discontents of stakeholders a and b for different water availabilities are plotted in fig 5 using both models it can be observed in fig 5 that the proposed model yielded differences in the normalised discontents of stakeholders a and b of 6 5 and 11 7 corresponding to water availabilities of 20 mcm and 60 mcm respectively the corresponding values of the difference in the normalised discontents using the nandalal and simonovic model 2003 can be observed from fig 5 to be 14 7 and 33 3 respectively it can further be noted from fig 5 that the differences in the discontents were always significantly lower when using the proposed model as compared to those predicted by nandalal and simonovic 2003 for different water availabilities therefore the proposed model is likely to give more equitable allocation of water among different stakeholders for a given set of parameters 5 2 application of model to vamsadhara basin the proposed model was then applied to a real basin namely to the vamsadhara basin of india whose water is to be shared between two co basin states odisha and andhra pradesh as described in section 4 the total water availability for the vamsadhara basin was estimated as 2511 mcm nwda 2012 whereas the total targeted demand for both co basin states had been estimated to 3141 mcm out of which the target for odisha was 1824 mcm and that for andhra pradesh was 1317 mcm the overall weight of the demand α and supply β variables had been assumed to equal 0 5 the importance weight of each of the supply side variable iw1 iw2 and iw3 and the priority weights of the three demand side variables pwd1 pwd2 and pwd3 were considered as unity the time constant and convergence factor were assumed to be equal to 1 and 0 2 respectively the proposed model for water sharing was run for the vamsadhara basin corresponding to the given set of parameter values as described in section 4 the initial allocation was assumed to be 100 mcm for both co basin states the proposed model yielded the weighting factor values of the respective co basin states namely odisha w1 and andhra pradesh w2 as 0 546 and 0 454 respectively the solution converged to a final allocation of 1444 mcm for the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra co basin state with the same order of discontent in the case of the two states at 0 20 0 21 for odisha and 0 19 for andhra pradesh the successive process of convergence until the final allocations is shown in fig 6 while the corresponding discontents are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from figs 6 and 7 that the allocations and discontents converged quickly to their final equilibrium values the proposed model for water sharing was also subjected to a number of simulation experiments in order to investigate its behaviour for different sets of possible parameter values accordingly simulation results for the vamsadhara river basin were investigated for i the impact of the initial trial values on the final allocations ii impact of convergence factor and time constant kc on the stability of the solution iii sensitivity of final water allocations with respect to the overall weights of the demand supply side variables and iv sensitivity of the final water allocations with respect to the influence weights given to various variables 5 2 1 impact of initial trial water allocations on final water allocations the initial water allocation was varied from a minimum value close to zero to a maximum value close to the water availability the results for the co basin state of odisha are shown in fig 8 since similar initial allocation impacts were also found for andhra pradesh it can be observed from fig 8 that the initial trial value of the water allocations does not have any impact on the final allocation for the odisha co basin state it is further evident from fig 8 that the results converged quickly to a final allocation value irrespective of the initial allocation value of water 5 2 2 impact of convergence factor and time constant on stability of allocations the convergence factor was used for the numerical stability and convergence of the final water allocation among co basin states the numerical stability and convergence of the proposed model solution can be ensured by assuming a suitable value for the convergence factor or a time constant kc or by assigning suitable values for both parameters simultaneously the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model solution was thus carried out for these three cases namely i 0 25 and kc 1 ii kc 0 25 and 1 and iii kc 0 25 the results of the sensitivity analysis were found to be same in all these three cases and it was found that the solution converged as long as kc was less than 0 25 irrespective of the individual values of and kc therefore the results corresponding to kc 0 25 are shown in fig 9 only for the odisha state since similar results were elicited for the state of andhra pradesh the upper bound curve in fig 9 corresponded to kc value close 0 25 it can be observed from fig 9 that the solution required a longer time to converge to the final allocation corresponding to the lower values of kc but quickly converged to the final allocation since kc was approaching 0 25 however the results for kc values greater than 0 25 are not shown since the solution became unstable 5 2 3 impact of the overall weight of demand α and supply β variables on water allocations the value of 0 5 was assigned to both α and β this implied that equal importance had been given to both the demand and supply side variables as the sums of α and β had been maintained to unity value to normalise the weights therefore when a zero value was allocated to α it would obviously mean that the entire weighting factor was assigned to the supply side variables while a value of unity allocated to α would imply that the entire weighting factor would be assigned to the demand side variables figs 10 and 11 show the effect of changing the overall weight of the demand α and supply β side variables within a range of 0 to 1 for the co basin states of odisha and andhra pradesh respectively the lowest value of the final water allocation of 1430 mcm to the odisha state in fig 10 correspond to a zero value for α while the highest value of 1458 mcm for odisha correspond to unity value for α the opposite was true for the water allocations of 1081 mcm and 1053 mcm to andhra pradesh that corresponded to α 0 and α 1 respectively as shown in fig 11 the same trend of water allocation was found for both co basin states that corresponded to α and β values within the range of 0 to 1 since the sum of α and β was always one 5 2 4 sensitivity of final water allocations to the importance priority weights given to demand and supply side variables table 2 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the importance weights of the supply side variables and priority weights of the demand side variables the importance weights for the supply side variables iw1 iw2 and iw3 corresponded to the existing utilisation volume of water contribution and arable area to catchment ratio respectively the priority weights for the demand side variable pwd1 pwd2 and pwd3 corresponded to agriculture drinking water and industrial water demands respectively scenario 1 of table 2 shows the allocations under normal conditions by assuming equal weightage to importance and priority weights of the supply and demand side variables the results of scenario 1 were already discussed in the section 5 2 the sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the importance weight of the supply side variables while keeping the overall weight of the supply side variables β equal to unity and by assuming that the overall weight of the demand side variables α was zero the results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the importance weight parameters are shown in table 2 in scenarios 2 6 scenario 2 considered the allocations based on the existing utilisation only scenario 2 yielded water allocation of 1110 mcm to andhra and 1401 mcm to odisha with respective discontents of approximately 0 16 for andhra and 0 23 for odisha since the existing utilisation to andhra was more than that for odisha it can be seen from table 2 that the maximum allocation of 1584 mcm to the odisha state corresponded to scenario 3 whereby the allocations were based only on the volume of the water contribution of the supply variable i e iw2 1 and assigned zero importance to the other supply side variables i e iwi 0 and iw3 0 under scenario 3 andhra pradesh is expected to receive an allocation of 927 mcm with a discontent of approximately 0 21 as compared to a discontent of approximately 0 13 that corresponded to the odisha state this was evident from the fact that the weighting factor for odisha increased to 0 8263 while it reduced to 0 1736 for the andhra pradesh co basin state because 81 of the catchment area of the basin lies in the odisha co basin state however the arable area to catchment ratio for the state of odisha was only 23 as most of the catchment areas were in hilly terrain whereas the arable area to catchment ratio for the andhra co basin state was 62 since both the co basin states can only utilise the water available in the basin it may not be proper to consider the allocations based only on the volume of the water contribution of the respective co basin states hence the arable area to catchment ratio was also conceived as one of the supply side variables scenario 4 of table 2 yielded the allocations based only on the arable area to catchment ratio by maintaining iw3 1 iw1 0 and iw2 0 the results indicated the reverse trend of water allocations as water allocations were reduced from 1584 to 1336 mcm for the odisha state and increased from 927 mcm to 1175 mcm for andhra therefore a balanced approach would give equal importance to both parameters and such was considered in scenario 5 as listed in table 2 the water allocation under scenario 5 yielded 1446 mcm for odisha and 1065 mcm for andhra pradesh with an almost similar discontent of approximately 0 20 for both co basin states scenario 6 was also considered by assigning unity importance weights for all the supply side variables scenario 6 yielded 1430 mcm for odisha and 1081 mcm for andhra pradesh with a discontent of approximately 0 22 for odisha and 0 18 for andhra pradesh finally scenario 7 was analysed by assigning different priority weights to the demand side variables while giving no weightage to the supply side variables the priority weight corresponding to the drinking water pwd2 was maintained to a value of 3 followed by the priority weight that corresponded to an agricultural demand pwd1 that was equal to 2 and to a corresponding industrial water demand for pwd3 equal to 1 it can be seen from scenario 7 of table 1 that the allocations became equal to 1458 mcm for odisha and 1053 mcm for andhra pradesh with an approximate discontent of 0 20 for both co basin states the increase in the allocation for odisha was attributed to the fact that the water requirement was increased for odisha and to the higher priority weight assigned to the drinking water demand therefore it can be concluded from the sensitivity analysis that the proposed model responded quite rationally to the variations in the importance weights and priority weights given to the supply and demand side variables 6 conclusions a new model for water sharing was proposed in the present study the main features of the proposed model can be summarised as follows i the proposed framework model was formulated for the reasonable and equitable sharing of water among co basin states based on governing variables ii the governing variables were suitably normalised to avoid any discrepancies in the results arising from the broad range of variations in their values among the co basin states iii the ratio of command to catchment has also been found to be a new governing variable for the reasonable and equitable sharing of water iv the conceptualisation and formulation were also presented to identify the normalised weights of co basin states for water sharing in a systematic manner as a function of the demand and supply side variables including their relative importance v a formulation was also developed to incorporate variables of different nature and convert units to a common scale vi the proposed model was generalized and can incorporate any number of governing variables different priority weights can also be assigned to the governing variables to explore the various policy options for water sharing vii the water allocation to any co basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity the struggle for equity of co basin states was assumed to be proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and inversely proportional to their satisfaction viii the proposed model can also be conveniently represented and solved using a system dynamics approach therefore various policy options can be easily explored through system dynamics the proposed model yielded remarkably better results for reasonable and equitable water sharing when compared to the modelling results using other model the proposed model was also applied to the vamsadhara basin in india whose water was required to be shared between two co basin states namely odisha and andhra pradesh the solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 mcm for the odisha co basin state and to 1067 mcm for the andhra co basin state with the same discontent of 0 20 for both co basin states a sensitivity analysis was also carried out to investigate the proposed model behaviour under different sets of possible values for various parameters the results showed that the proposed model was not sensitive to the initial trial values of the water allocations to both co basin states and converged quickly to their final allocations irrespective of the initial allocations the results of the sensitivity analysis on convergence indicated that the solution converged quickly to the same final value as long as the product kc of the convergence factor and the time constant kc was less than 0 25 irrespective of the individual values of and kc the sensitivity analysis also showed that the volume of the water contribution of the co basin states needs to be considered along with the arable area to catchment ratio of the co basin states to avoid distortions in water allocations among co basin states the vamsadhara basin case study that was used for illustrative purposes confirmed that the proposed framework model is quite flexible and can be used effectively to resolve water sharing issues among co basin states of a river basin for reasonable and equitable allocation of water 7 disclaimer all the data used in this study were based on information available on the internet and or government publications available in the public domain as such they were not authenticated by concerned government of co basin states the purpose of this study is only to illustrate the use of the proposed water sharing framework model to real basin data and hence this study does not constitute a policy advice publication 
7344,the nile delta is essential to egypt s agro and socio economy although surface water is the traditional source for egypt s irrigation the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600 m depth the occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the nile delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets in this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models it is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from quaternary free convection systems or from compaction induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the messinian salinity crisis our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses furthermore it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the nile delta aquifer abbreviations nda nile delta aquifer nda c nile delta aquifer compaction model nda f nile delta aquifer free convection model kes kafr el sheikh formation keywords nile delta hydrogeology hypersaline brine groundwater 1 introduction the nile delta is essential to egypt s agro and socio economy as it constitutes most of the limited 3 of the country that is suitable for agriculture wri 2008 its wet and fertile lands have supported the egyptian population for over 5000 years mączyńska 2014 and currently host nearly 50 million inhabitants making it the second most populated delta in the world after the bengal delta higgins 2016 however its fresh groundwater resources are suffering from agriculture increasingly relying on groundwater barrocu and dahab 2010 and a growing population bucx et al 2010 that will further amplify extraction rates making fresh water availability its most challenging issue for agriculture fao 2005 these stress factors have led to a continuous interest in available fresh groundwater resources and several studies on the topic kashef 1983 critically reviewed the available data conducted water balance calculations and estimated the extent of salt water intrusion with the ghyben herzberg relationship he found several discrepancies in the available data and concluded based on his water balance that at that time the aquifer was gaining fresh water despite this gain he found that the extent of sea water intrusion was large sherif et al 1988 constructed the first numerical groundwater model for the area which was a 2d finite element model for variable density flow also accounting for dispersion next to the large extent of sea water intrusion the model showed that the width of the hydrodynamic dispersion zone could be considerable sefelnasr and sherif 2014 created a 3d model and showed the sensitivity of the nile delta aquifer to sea level rise as the shallow relief of the area resulted in a large extent of land surface inundation geirnaert and laeven 1992 used hydrogeochemistry to reconstruct the paleohydrogeology of the area up to 20 000 years bp providing the first conceptual model for this period they furthermore found that that the shallow groundwater in the center of the nile delta was recharged 3500 years bp as river water and in the bordering desert over 5000 years bp barrocu and dahab 2010 extended this conceptual model up to 180 000 years bp and further discussed the hydrogeochemistry they concluded that the saline groundwater in the north is likely not in connection with the current sea instead it is connate sea water and further stress the fragility of the groundwater system despite that the previously discussed works increased our understanding of the system we identify several research gaps a the numerical models made for this area do not take the paleohydrogeology in account presumably due to computational limitations b most studies implicitly assumed a completely open connection between aquifer and the sea while this is uncertain c the studies mainly used data of the shallow groundwater system roughly the upper 200 m of the upper aquifer even though the upper aquifer is believed to extend up to 1000 m depth kashef 1983 sestini 1989 with increasing stress on the shallow groundwater system interest in possible deeper fresh groundwater grows kang and jackson 2016 therefore the egyptian research institute for groundwater rigw measured salinity at 200 m 400 m and 600 m depth in 2013 and measured high values of total dissolved solids tds nofal et al 2015 starting from 400 m depth at several locations fig 1 a strongly suggesting a widespread occurrence of hypersaline groundwater at larger depths no hypersaline groundwater was observed at 200 m depth given the interest in finding deeper fresh groundwater resources in the nile delta aquifer nda see fig 1b a better understanding of the possible origins and transport of this hypersaline groundwater is necessary to assess further possibilities hypersaline groundwater is defined as groundwater exceeding the salinity of sea water 35 g l in this paper apart from the findings shown in fig 1a two other observations of hypersaline groundwater in the nda have been published firstly diab and saleh 1982 found hypersaline groundwater near the shore but did not report the depths of their samples secondly there is the incidental remark by shata 1999 hot brine is recorded in oil wells at a depth of 1000 m below ground surface as far as we are aware of no other observations hydrogeophysical or hydrogeochemical have been published that reach 600 m depth despite the multiple petroleum exploration wells that have been drilled and logged in the area given the occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater we question the often made assumption that seawater is the only source of salt in nda groundwater and deem further investigation necessary therefore we test a number of plausible hypotheses on the origin of the nda hypersaline groundwater using a combination of analytical solutions and numerical simulations this analysis provides more insight into a the timescales of salt transport involved in this large delta b which measurements should be collected to discern the origins of this hypersaline groundwater and c the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets the goals of this study are to investigate the plausibility of a number of hypotheses listed in section 3 to find a method to discriminate them in the field and where possible falsify hypotheses given the lack of study on this topic in this area a brief summary of findings in other deltaic areas is warranted as far as we are aware of four other cases have been published that are relevant to this research firstly hypersaline groundwater is found in fluvio deltaic sediments near the louisiana gulf coast mississippi delta which is probably the most well studied area for this topic here it is thought to originate from dissolution of salt domes brought upwards by thermal convection hanor and mercer 2011 secondly in the netherlands the rhine meuse delta hypersaline groundwater is found below the hydrogeological base presumably caused by rock salt dissolution griffioen et al 2016 largely varying salinities are observed on the national scale which can be partly explained by the presence of evaporite deposits and diffusive transport thirdly high salinities found in the burdekin delta are explained by transpiration of mangroves and subsequent downward free convection fass et al 2007 fourthly it is thought that intruded evapoconcentrated seawater is the cause of hypersaline groundwater near the yellow river delta han et al 2011 in summary these cases can be seperated into two groups 1 those where hypersaline groundwater is thought to have originated from rock salt dissolution and 2 those where it is thought to be caused by evapoconcentration we argue here that these four cases are relevant to the nile delta since evaporites are found below the hydrogeological base rizzini et al 1978 and its climate provides ample opportunity for evapoconcentration these processes will be discussed in further detail in section 3 the methods and findings of this research can also be applied to other deltaic areas overlying thick unconsolidated formations such as the four previously mentioned cases furthermore they might be applied to cases where hypersaline groundwater might be found in the future such as the mekong delta minderhoud et al 2017 the ganges brahmaputra delta lindsay et al 1991 and in particular the niger delta which is geologically similar to the nile delta summerhayes et al 1978 2 hydrogeological setting a conceptual geological cross section of the central nda is shown in fig 1b the nda ranges in thickness from approximately 200 m near cairo to 1000 m near the coast farid 1980 it consists mainly of coarse pleistocene sands and gravels with some clay intercalations laeven 1991 it is topped by a holocene clay cap ranging in thickness from 3 m at cairo to a maximum of 100 m near the shore shata 1999 in seismic studies it is found that the bottom 750 m of the coastal boundary of the nda is partially closed off by marine clays abdel aal et al 2000 samuel et al 2003 abdel fattah 2014 which is unaccounted for in previous groundwater research though the existence of connections between the nda and the sea is deemed possible in the form of conductive paleo channels there is an east west trending fault system fault flexure zone that presents a break in stratigraphy sestini 1989 and causes an increase in thickness of the aquifer in northern direction north of the fault flexure zone the nda is resting on top of a 1500 m thick formation consisting of mainly pliocene marine clays sestini 1989 farouk et al 2014 called the kafr el sheikh formation kes south of the fault flexure zone the nile delta is underlain by limestones and shales ranging from miocene to oligocene age geirnaert and laeven 1992 directly below kes there is a 50 m thick layer of messinian evaporites consisting mainly of anhydrite rizzini et al 1978 below these evaporites there is 1000 m of miocene sands and conglomerates underlain by compacted miocene shales below these shales the pore pressures approach geostatic pressure nashaat 1998 implying limited flow through the shales therefore we assumed this serves as a hydrogeological base furthermore we assumed the fault flexure zone is an impermeable boundary to flow since 1 at larger depths there are several processes that can reduce fault horizontal permeability bense et al 2013 such as clay smearing and particulate flow and 2 offshore faults at similar depth clearly compartmentalize the subsurface inferring from the high lateral differences in overpressure underneath the evaporate layer in nashaat 1998 3 hypotheses there are two possible origins of the hypersaline groundwater firstly the hypersaline groundwater could originate from deeper deposits we argue that it is certainly possible that hypersaline groundwater occurs in the 1 km thick miocene layer as evaporites are found up to the fault flexure zone just underneath kes these are correlated with the messinian salinity crisis rizzini et al 1978 during which the mediterrenean sea reached high salinities and its water intruded bottom sediments some of this residual hypersaline water remained here vengosh et al 1998 furthermore mud volcanos are found that seep hot brines originating from messinian salt formations offshore at 3000 m water depth pierre et al 2014 if hypersaline groundwater was transported upwards from deeper deposits onshore it had to overcome resistance exerted by the high groundwater density and the low permeable kes there are three physical processes that can possibly overcome these resistances hanor 1994 person and garven 1994 namely 1 molecular diffusion domenico and schwartz 1990 shackelford and daniel 1991a b 2 thermal driven free convection nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 nield and bejan 2013 as temperatures up to 90 c have been observed underneath the kes riad et al 1989 which may be associated with strong temperature gradients and 3 upward solute transport driven by sediment compaction since considerable overpressures have been measured onshore underneath the kes fig 1a these overpressures were likely caused by sediment loading since the sedimentation rates during the pleistocene and pliocene were extreme nashaat 1998 roughly 2500 m of deposits in 5 3 million years secondly it could originate from the top as the effect of 4 holocene or pleistocene free convection systems originating from the evapotranspiration of sea or river water schreiber and hsü 1980 wooding et al 1997 similar to the cases in the burdekin delta and near the yellow river delta that were mentioned in section 1 fass et al 2007 han et al 2011 the high evapotranspiration rates in the nile delta of the past 10 000 years provide ample opportunity for the formation of hypersaline groundwater deduced from the pockets of hypersaline groundwater found in the holocene clay layer diab et al 1997 and the hypersaline groundwater found underneath a sabkha neighbouring the nile delta west et al 1979 stanley and warne 1993 made a paleogeographical reconstruction of the past 30 000 years showing several possibilities for hypersaline groundwater formation in this relatively short geological period for example sabkha muds salt muds were deposited in seasonally dry depressions between former channels from 30 000 to 11 500 years bp furthermore the widespread wetlands of 6500 2000 years bp also at times transpired enough to create hypersalinity inferred from the previously mentioned pockets of hypersaline groundwater in the holocene clay diab et al 1997 another option might be a coastal lagoon that received little river water for a long period of time such as during the early holocene arid phase geirnaert and laeven 1992 analogue to the coastal sabkhas in the northern sinai gat and levy 1978 we want to stress that this list of hypotheses is not exhaustive due to the limited amount of data available at the depth of interest 4 methods computational analyses were conducted with either analytical solutions hypotheses 1 and 2 or numerical models hypotheses 3 and 4 to test the physical feasibility of mentioned four hypotheses since this is exploratory research we tried to reduce the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection as much as possible our ground rule was to set unconstrained parameters and boundary conditions in favor of the respective hypothesis under research since constraining data was often scarce if the hypothesis was then still falsified we could then be quite certain that this process played no important role in bringing hypersaline groundwater to 600 m depth one assumption we made in this research affected our analyses for all hypotheses namely we assumed nacl as the sole source of salt as this is the dominant salt in groundwater under natural conditions at tds values up to 200 g l hanor 1994 at larger tds values calcium becomes the more dominant cation as groundwater gets saturated with respect to halite this assumption affected both the molecular diffusion coefficient used used for hypotheses 1 4 and the conversion from concentration to density used for hypotheses 2 4 the effects of this assumption on our computational analyses are deemed unimportant since the molecular diffusion coefficient of nacl is higher than that of cacl2 shackelford and daniel 1991a thus not interfering with our ground rule and the uncertainties introduced by a different linear equation of state are negligible compared to the other uncertainties in this research kohfahl et al 2015 4 1 hypothesis 1 analytical solution here we test whether molecular diffusion could have transported enough dissolved salts to explain the observed salinities upwards over the kes assuming no groundwater flow solutetransport is purely governed by fick s second law of diffusion in 1d adapted for porous media which is written as follows 1 c t d c n e 2 c z 2 where c is the concentration of the solute g l n e the effective porosity z the vertical distance m t is time s and d c the effective diffusion coefficient m2 s there is no general consensus regarding the exact definition of d c domenico and schwartz 1990 shackelford and daniel 1991a in this study we used values of shackelford and shackelford and daniel 1991b who defined 2 d c d 0 τ a where d 0 is the molecular diffusion in free water at a certain temperature m2 s and τ a is an apparent tortuosity which accounts for the combined effects of tortuosity anion exclusion and viscosity the following analytical solution to eq 1 describes the concentration development through the compacted clay through time 3 c z t c max c min c max erf z 4 d c t where c max and c min are the maximum and minimum concentrations respectively we varied c max in our analysis and set c min to the tds of seawater which is 35 g l d c was approximated by estimating τ a we used the highest values of d c that we could estimate from the literature in order to reduce the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection shackelford and daniel 1991b rigorously conducted multiple experiments 8 test series in triplicate at 25 c for multiple species of which they calculated the mean d c of each test series the highest mean d c these authors found for cl at 25 c is 10 6e 10 m2 s since d 0 of cl at 25 c is 20 3e 10 m2 s shackelford and daniel 1991a an upper limit for τ a of 0 522 is inferred in addition we corrected for temperature as riad et al 1989 measured temperatures of 80 c on average directly underneath the kafr el sheikh layer at multiple points in the onshore nile delta d 0 of nacl at 80 c is around 44e 10 m2 s fell and hutchison 1971 thus assuming that τ a for cl is isotherm and is representative for nacl a d c 22 9e 10 m2 s was used for compacted clay at 80 c this hypothesis is rejected if filling in eq 3 with the most favorable parameters does not result in a concentration of 100 g l at 1000 m depth the top of the kes formation this is the concentration that was observed at 600 m depth in the nda 4 2 hypothesis 2 rayleigh number for double diffusive convection here we will test thermal convection could have had its onset over the kes which could subsequently transport dissolved salts upwards assuming initially stagnant groundwater and a homogeneous isotropic aquitard the onset of free convection over the kes formation was investigated by calculating the double diffusive rayleigh number nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 and comparing it to its critical boundary 4 ra t ra c ra

rayleigh number ra crit the critical rayleigh number the rest of the parameters is explained in table 1 these are extreme parameters all chosen to maximize ra t and ra c to minimize the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection it should be noted that ra t and ra c become negative when temperature or concentration gradients act stabilizing trevisan and bejan 1990 in this case ra c is negative when ra t ra c ra crit the groundwater system in the kes becomes unstable and free convection is possible the value of ra crit depends on the chosen type of boundary conditions in this case a fixed head concentration and temperature on top and a no flux boundary and a fixed temperature and concentration at the bottom gives ra crit 27 10 nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 the hypothesis is rejected if ra t ra c ra crit 4 3 hypotheses 3 4 numerical models 4 3 1 general approach the variable density solute transport code seawat langevin et al 2007 was used to simulate the development of tds fields pore pressures and groundwater age within a cross sectional domain up to 1 km depth representing the nda fig 1b all of the models described in this paper were built with the flopy package bakker et al 2016 groundwater ages were modeled directly as first implemented by voss and wood 1993 and later extensively supported by goode 1996 by adding age as an extra species with a constant production rate zheng 2010 seawat solves the following governing equation for flow 11 ρ q ρ q s ρ s p p t n e ρ c c t with 12 s p β p 1 n e n e β w and for solute transport 13 c t d c q n e c q s n e

term d 1 p is the pore pressure n m2 t is time d s p is the specific storage in terms of pressure m2 n β p and β w are the compressibility of the pores and water m2 n respectively c is the salt

the effective porosity for an elaborate explanation of eqs 11 13 the reader is referred to the seawat manual guo and langevin 2002 boundary conditions were varied to either model salt input by compaction driven inflow from below nda c model or free convection from the top nda f model these models evaluate hypotheses 3 and 4 based on their ability to approach the observed tds at several points at 600 m a separate model for the kes domain 1 3 5 km depth was developed to produce the basal boundary condition of the nda c model this sequential split domain approach first kes then nda c was chosen to maintain practicable computation times which ranged from half a day kes model up to a week nda c model with open coastal boundary these large differences in computational times were caused mainly by the solute transport solver mt3dms which based its time step internally on the maximum velocity in the model domain zheng and wang 1999 the nda model had the highest velocities while the kes model had a larger number of cells therefore combining model domains would seriously burden simulation times as this would result in three times the number of cells of the nda model with the same small time steps causing maximum predicted model simulation times of three weeks per simulation the sequential split domain approach is reasonable since groundwater flows predominantly upwards from kes into nda 4 3 2 methodological aspects of the numerical models the nda numerical models spanned 240 km by 1 km the kes model 180 km by 3 km and all models were discretized into cells of 1000 m horizontal by 10 m vertical see also fig d1 for a grid convergence test the time domain of the models ranged from 120 000 years nda f up to 2 5 million years kes nda c the latter time domain implies we assume no overpressure build up during the pliocene in the kes formation 4 3 2 1 kes model to quantify volumetric flow and solute transport within the kes depositional strata during the pleistocene and in particular the outflow at the top of this formation we used a modified version of bear 1972 partial differential equation for mass conservation in a deformable porous medium with external loading his equation 6 3 26 14 ρ q ρ β p σ t p t ρ n e β w p t n e ρ c c t where σ is the total stress or confining pressure m2 n which is a function of sediment loading and β p σ t p t ε t is the strain rate of the porous medium d 1 the applied modifications to bear s original equation which allow the equations to be solved with seawat without any modifications to the original code were a the addition of the last term which allows local groundwater mass change due to change in salt content and b the use of eulerian fixed space coordinates rather than lagrangian relative to moving solids time derivatives the latter modification reflects the fact that we solve for pore pressure tds and flows on a rigid model domain present day compressed state and neglect temporal changes of vertical grid spacing and domain height associated with the compaction this is considered reasonable as it yields conservative underestimated magnitudes of the compaction driven flow to solve eq 14 in seawat three variables of eq 11 were altered s p q s and ρ firstly whereas normally s p β p 1 n e n e β w eq 12 in the kes model s p n e β w eq 14 this required no modifications to the original code as seawat takes s p as an input parameter directly secondly the strain rate which equals the volumetric source term q s in eq 11 was specified to be constant in the model proportional to a constant pleistocene sedimentation rate and constant pore compressibility 15 q s β p σ t p t β p ρ b g z b t ρ w g z b t β p ρ b ρ w g z b t where ρ b the bulk density of the sediment ρ w the density of fresh water kg m3 and z b t the sedimentation rate m d eq 15 approximates the temporal change of pore pressure to equal a hydrostatic pressure change p p h as the depth of the kes strata relative to the water table increases during burial this overestimates the compression during early phases of pleistocene sedimentation when excess pore pressures increase but this overestimation becomes negligible after a short time as excess pore pressures stabilize the validity of this approach is shown in appendix c q s is constrained by the fact that the total amount of expelled pore water cannot exceed the pore water volume at time of deposition and the latter can be approximated a priori by 16 v s t 0 t q s d t n init where v s is the total volume of water expelled from the pores relative to the initial bulk volume or total strain t 0 and t are the beginning and the end of the time domain d respectively and n init is the initial porosity just after sediment deposition with the parameters chosen in this research table 2 v s equaled 0 26 and 0 13 for the pliocene clay and miocene deposits respectively we consider this an upper limit of the total water expelled by the pores during the pleistocene thirdly ρ the density of the water injected in a cell by q s had to equal the current concentration of the cell this was determined by seawat internally by using the recirculation well option of mt3dms zheng 2010 to ensure convergence the maximum number of outer iteration steps of the dispersion solver gcg was set at 10 the default value is 1 in practice no more than three outer iterations were required for convergence the upper boundary of the kes model was a cauchy boundary condition of which the fresh water head is set at zero to incorporate the effects of deposition of nda sediments on this upper boundary namely that the distance to the fixed head boundary increases the conductance of the top boundary of the kes model m2 d was adapted seawat takes the conductance as input for its cauchy boundary condition together with a prescribed head the conductance is defined as follows guo and langevin 2002 17 cond ka l where k is the hydraulic conductivity a is the cross sectional area of the flow l is the distance of the boundary to the model cell m we increased this conductance with time as sedimentation progresses 18 cond k v sand a cell top z b t t k v sand is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the nda deposits m d a cell top is the area of a model cell top interface m2 t is the time d and z b t is the sedimentation rate m d all other boundaries were assumed to be no flow boundaries as for the initial conditions we assumed completely stagnant conditions during the pliocene and therefore applied 3 4 million years duration of the pliocene of molecular diffusion over the kes clay layer the initial tds concentration at the miocene deposits varied between 125 200 300 400 g l respectively scenarios m125 m200 m300 and m400 and the initial groundwater age of the miocene deposits was set at 3 4 million years the upward salt fluxes of the kes scenario that showed the best fit to pressure observations were injected into the nda c model as part of a base case in this base case all parameters of the nda c model were set in favor of hypothesis 3 based on their expected behavior 4 3 2 2 nda models the boundary conditions of both nda models are shown in fig 2 the fresh water boundary had a fixed point water head linearly increasing land inwards roughly following the topography of the delta the coastal boundary of the nda models was modeled either open or closed off from 250 m to 1000 m depth see also section 4 3 2 3 as the connectivity between the deeper parts of the nda and the sea is still uncertain the geometry of this boundary was determined with the general bathymetric chart for the oceans gridded dataset gebco 2014 this is a 30 arc second grid providing global bathymetric coverage in addition four horizontal clay layers were placed at different depths spanning from the coastal boundary to the middle of the onshore model domain following the conceptual cross section by shata and hefny 1995 at the bottom of the nda c model the model receives its flow dissolved salts and groundwater ages from the kes model as a fixed flux the large time domain of the nda c model 2 5e6 years matches the extent of the deposition of sediments that form the nda therefore the aquifer is initially thin at the start of the pleistocene and grows in thickness with time this implies that the distance between the bottom and top boundary increases with time seawat does not support a change of spatial domain size over time therefore we ensured the undeposited part of the model did not contribute to the flow or solute transport system by making every undeposited cell a cauchy boundary cell with zero salinity and a head matching the sea level at that timestep after deposition of a cell the boundary condition in that cell was deactivated turning it into a regular active cell this created stacked cauchy boundaries fig 2 which were deactivated upwards as sedimentation progresses the validity of this approach is shown in appendix c we used the most parsimonious sedimentation possible namely assuming a constant sedimentation rate with this we determined the location of the cauchy boundary cells apriori for every input timestep called stress period in seawat we used a number of input timesteps 365 that exceeded the amount of model layers 100 to ensure the most gradual increase of the aquifer size that was possible on top of the nda f model a hypothetical 50 km long hypersaline inundation of 90 g l was added for 8000 years roughly the spatiotemporal extent of the late pleistocene sabkha muds near the current coastline stanley and warne 1993 as these were the most favorable circumstances for free convection appendix b it is assumed that free convection was not limited by salt production or by water availability the aim of the free convection model was not to accurately model chaotic fingering patterns nor their onset as these are controlled by a model discretization for example see kooi et al 2000 prasad and simmons 2005 zimmermann et al 2006 b heterogeneity simmons et al 2001 post and simmons 2010 c dimensionality simmons et al 2010 d numerical solvers chosen zimmermann et al 2006 e dynamic boundary conditions e g as reflected by the differences between the dimensionless numbers in nield 1968 and wooding et al 1997 for flooded and dry circumstances respectively this model was intended to obtain a sense of the time scale of free convection in a regional groundwater system of this size for which this setup is sufficient fig d2 for this model a warm up period of 120 000 years was chosen to set the initial conditions roughly the extent of a glaciation cycle but sea levels were kept constant to their relatively high current level for the sake of parsimony to ensure both vertical and horizontal propagation of hypersaline plumes the clay layers were further extended land inward with a conductivity of 19 log k extension log k sand log k clay 2 without this extension hypersaline plumes would only travel vertically downwards without intruding horizontally in between clay layers the conceptual idea behind this extension is a clay layer becoming thinner land inwards see also fig 1b thus reducing in hydraulic conductivity 4 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed on the compaction models kes nda c to study the influence of some of the underlying assumptions on the results inputs parameters boundary conditions and initial conditions were altered one at a time from a base case of which the values can be found in table 3 firstly the initial concentration in the miocene deposits in kes was increased from 125 g l to 200 g l and the increased upward salt flux is injected into nda c model secondly the horizontal clay layers in the nda c model were removed thirdly the river stage at the apex was increased from 5 m to 15 m fourthly the hydraulic conductivity of the nda c model was increased from 10 m d to 25 m d and 75 m d respectively finally the bottom 750 m of the seaside boundary was either open or closed off by setting the conductance eq 17 of the sea boundary to 1000 m2 d or 2 5e 9 m2 d the first is seen as an extreme upper limit and was calculated by assuming a 1 m thick layer of gravel of 100 m d and multiplying this by the area of a horizontal cell interface 10 m2 the latter was calculated by multiplying an assumed horizontal hydraulic conductivity for unweathered marine clay 5e 6 m d by the area of a horizontal cell interface 10 m2 and dividing this by the maximum observed horizontal extent of 20 km abdel aal et al 2000 and thus presents a lower limit scenarios were compared by looking at the depth difference between the 70 g l isoconcentration line and 600 m at three observation locations ε m 5 results 5 1 hypothesis 1 molecular diffusion fig 3 shows that even given a tds concentration of 643 g l the highest ever measured as far as we are aware of hanor 1994 the concentration at 1000 m depth is still below the observed concentration at 600 m depth even though all parameters are set in favor of this hypothesis the observed tds cannot be reproduced which means that diffusion cannot be the sole cause of the observed hypersalinity at 600 m and there has to be at least a second process involved to cause enough upward salt transport through kes 5 2 hypothesis 2 double diffusiveconvection filling in the most favorable limits for this hypothesis see table 1 for their values results in ra t ra c being strongly negative 516 which is caused by the high le 690 this entails that the buoyancy due to salinity works very stabilizing assuming there is enough mechanical dispersion d mch so that the theoretical minimum of le is approached 20 lim d mch le lim d mch d t d mch d c d mch 1 then given the parameters in table 1 still n 1 meaning that 21 ra t ra c ra t ra t nle ra t ra t 0 furthermore ra t 0 089 ra crit so even with a constant salinity gradient no free thermohaline convection is expected based on the high le n 1 and low ra t it is unlikely that there was any upward transport of solutes due to thermohaline induced free convection through kes the thick low permeable kes formation s potential for dampening instabilities is too high for any large scale instability to occur 5 3 hypothesis 3 sediment compaction fig 4 a shows a comparison between modeled pressures and observations in a well near the city of kafr el sheikh personal communication with dr m tingay per initial concentration scenario m125 m400 both observations and our models follow a hydrostatic pressure distribution up to a depth of less than approximately 2 8 km to which an initial concentration of 125 g l seems to give the best fit around 2 8 km depth the observations show a sudden jump in pressure indicating the presence of a low permeable seal which consists of the messinian evaporites rizzini et al 1978 nashaat 1998 this seal is not completely impermeable otherwise the observed pressure underneath the seal would approach lithostatic pressure our models also capture the pressure difference across this messinian seal which means that the upward groundwater flow encounters enough resistance the resistance in our model might be overestimated as part of the pressure difference may already have been established during the pliocene in addition the dissolved salts had more time to be transported through the seal thus our model represents a conservative estimate of upward salt transport fig 4b shows hypersaline groundwater with a concentration above the observed 100 g l fig 1a moving from the kes to the nda due to compaction induced upward salt transport and molecular diffusion the increasing concentrations over time imply that salt transport has not yet reached steady state therefore if the hypersaline groundwater in the nda is caused by compaction induced salt transport the mass flux of salt into the nda is still present and presumably even increasing slowly on a geological time scale the results in fig 5 a as obtained from the nda c model show that these upward salt mass fluxes from the kes to the nda have the potential to cause salinities similar to those observed at 600 m depth in the nda nowadays furthermore if this has indeed occurred in reality the hypersaline groundwater should be older than 2 5 million years and thus older than its surrounding sediment matrix a subsequent sensitivity analysis shows that hypothesis 3 only holds if the bottom of the coastal boundary is closed as shown in fig 5b if the boundary were open the tds at 600 m would decrease towards the coast see also fig a1 which is not observed in the field fig 1a moreover with an open coastal boundary the 70 g l contour would not reach 600 m 5 4 hypothesis 4 free convection in the nda f model a considerable volume of hypersaline groundwater is transported downwards in this model fig 6 after onset the plume travels downwards for roughly 600 years until it reaches the bottom this plume subsequently reaches the observation points in the case of an open boundary but does not in the case of closed boundary a closed coastal boundary in our model results in rejection of the nda f hypothesis the hypersaline groundwater has difficulty to replace fresh groundwater that is trapped between clay layers and a closed coastal boundary we also make two observations that might be relevant to groundwater age measurement campaigns in the future firstly free convective transport leads to an inversion in groundwater ages fig 6 left though this inversion becomes negligible on longer timescales with an open coastal boundary fig 6 right see also supplementary video a2 secondly it is observed that a closed boundary results in groundwater ages exceeding the duration of glacial cycles 100 000 year see also supplementary video a3 despite the high hydraulic conductivity 75 m d and low porosity 0 10 of the aquifer in this model 6 discussion our computational investigation did not lead to a final conclusion as to the origins of the hypersaline groundwater consequently a brief discussion of measurements to discriminate hypothesis 3 from 4 is necessary with groundwater dating it might be possible to discriminate these two hypotheses upward compaction induced salt transport leads to groundwater ages older than the surrounding sediment matrix since overpressures are a common phenomenon in deltas sharp and domenico 1976 neuzil 2003 it is safe to assume that the same holds for upward transport of major volumes of connate groundwater into delta aquifers e g as presumably occurred in the netherlands verweij 1999 griffioen et al 2016 whether this groundwater is still present in these aquifers highly depends on the hydrogeological connection between aquifer and sea this connection is critical to coastal hydrogeology yechieli et al 2009 since it also influences potential offshore fresh water reserves post et al 2013 and submarine groundwater discharge taniguchi et al 2002 groundwater dating in combination with our current analysis could thus lead to important conclusions regarding both the origins of the hypersaline groundwater and the interaction between the deeper parts of the nda and the mediterranean sea if the groundwater is found to be older than 2 million years old fig 5 it originates from messinian deposits and the hydrogeological connection with the sea is limited in contrast if it is found to be younger than 100 000 years old it presumably is the result of free convective systems and the coastal boundary is open 81kr dating may be the most suitable method to discriminate these two hypotheses sturchio et al 2004 aeschbach hertig 2014 as 36cl dating is not suited for saline fluids park et al 2002 determining the chemical composition of the groundwater and comparing this to published cases will certainly lead to new insights a start would be the br cl ratio which is useful in discriminating whether salinity is caused by evapoconcentration or rock salt dissolution hanor 1994 this is not necessarily enough information to discriminate hypothesis 3 from 4 since the groundwater from underneath the kes could also have been evapoconcentrated during the messinian as thought to have happened in the east mediterranean sea vengosh et al 1998 more suitable might be non conservative environmental tracers that interact with clay as hypersaline groundwater of hypothesis 3 had more time to interact with clay minerals under higher temperatures than groundwater of hypothesis 4 examples of these are na ca2 sr2 b k and δ 11 b vengosh et al 1999 useful cases for the comparison are the hypersaline water found in the deep eastern mediterranean basin vengosh et al 1998 and at the coastal sabkhas in the northern sinai levy 1977 gat and levy 1978 which might be suitable analogues for the hypersaline groundwater of respectively hypothesis 3 and 4 there are limitations to this computational investigation regarding the free convection model nda f it is difficult to constrain a paleo reconstruction of a process controlled so strongly by heterogeneity and that acted on such a relatively small timescale this is in part reflected by the very limited number of field observations of free convection in groundwater despite over a century of research the first field observations started to be reported only in the last decade andersen et al 2007 van dam et al 2009 in addition our assumption of free convection unrestricted by salt or fluid availability is applicable to a sabkha delta which continuously receives new saline water but may be inappropriate for a floodplain furthermore in both this model and nda c we did not take the sea level variation of a glacial cycle into account the low sea level stands during a glacial period would result in a wider fresh water zone post et al 2013 and the sea level variations might also result in a wider mixing zone e g as happens on a larger spatiotemporal scale in carbonate platforms jones et al 2002 the effect of a higher hydraulic gradient on the nda c model is shown in the sensitivity analysis though not to the extent as the gradient reached during the pleistocene in short our results intentionally present a hypothetical extreme case regarding the kes model it is possible that the hydrogeological system in the pre miocene deposits is connected to the miocene deposits in some compartimized areas through faults which may imply that thermal processes become important in determining the salt concentration underneath the kes formation garven 1995 lopez and smith 1995 however this is excluded from this research because of the scarcity of published data of the deep hydrogeology underneath the nile delta furthermore we assumed that the side boundaries are impermeable due to faulting for the side boundary offshore in the north this is reasonable given the high lateral differences in overpressure nashaat 1998 but onshore this might be different as far as we are aware off no pressure measurements in the deeper strata underneath the nile valley have been published to assess the validity of this assumption two processes are not covered in this research which could serve as alternative hypotheses firstly hypersaline groundwater may preferentially flow along faults as faults are observed that propagate through the kes formation abd allah et al 2012 these faults might act as a conduit for upward flow bense et al 2013 secondly leaking abandoned petroleum exploration wells could act as an anthropogenic source of salt water at least 90 wells had been drilled in 1989 sestini 1989 because of the area s high oil and natural gas potential kirschbaum et al 2010 which may potentially leak hypersaline groundwater upwards driven by the overpressures underneath kes this would result in high salinities focused around exploration areas both these processes would result in a more heterogeneous distribution of salinities and also in temperature anomalies bense et al 2013 thus testing these two hypotheses requires more data than is currently available and is therefore a topic for further research the origins of the hypersaline groundwater have crucial implications for the expected occurrence of deeper fresh water pockets our results show that the salinity distribution by free convection is largely affected by clay layers whereas the slow compaction induced upward advection is quite insensitive to these layers our models with free convection show that lower salinity water might be trapped between clay layers whereas no salinity inversions were simulated in models with sedimentation compaction as the driver 7 conclusions two of the four hypotheses of this research remain valid the hypersaline groundwater in the nda is either caused by compaction induced salt transport hypothesis 3 or free convective systems hypothesis 4 both the nda c model and the nda f model are able to reproduce the observed high tds values given the right coastal boundary condition this condition has opposite effects on the plausibility of these models an open boundary results in the rejection of the nda c model the hypersaline groundwater does not reach 600 m depth whereas in the nda f model a closed boundary hinders the hypersaline groundwater in replacing the fresh water between the clay layers and in our conceptualization reaching the observation point the origins of this hypersaline groundwater affect the probability of the existence of deep fresh water pockets this probability is reduced if the hypersaline groundwater originates from underneath the kes and was transported upwards following the assumptions made in this paper deep fresh water pockets are considered more probable if the hypersaline groundwater was brought downwards by free convection acknowledgements firstly we thank hanneke verweij and andrea forzoni for their helpful ideas and

appendix b onset of convection during the pleistocene and holocene we assess the onset of free convection under two conditions applicable to semi arid deltas during an inundation and during a dry stand for values sources and definitions of symbols used in this analysis the reader is referred to table b1 the onset of free convection underneath a dry salt lake is determined by the destabilizing buoyancy force and the stabilizing upward flux caused by evapotranspiration zimmermann et al 2006 wooding et al 1997 derived a dimensionless number for the theoretical onset of free convection underneath a dry salt lake with impermeable boundaries at the bottom and sides b 1 r δ ρ m ρ a k v n e ρ a et where ρ m and ρ a are the salinity of the salt lake and surrounding water kg m3 respectively k v is the vertical hydraulic conductivity m d n e is the effective porosity and et the evapotranspiration rate m d it was found with both lab and numerical experiments that for r values above 10 free convection is expected wooding et al 1997 for flooded conditions the onset of free convection can be assessed by the rayleigh number nield and bejan 2013 b 2 ra c ρ m ρ a k v h ρ a d where h is the thickness of the aquifer m and d is the dispersion tensor m2 d here taken as the scalar effective diffusion constant d c since we assume initially stagnant water with a fixed head on top due to an inundation the critical value for ra c 27 10 nield 1968 important underlying assumptions of both these dimensionless numbers are a a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity b a linear upward trend in concentration and c initially stagnant water we therefore want to stress that the values of these numbers only allow for a qualitative interpretation as under field conditions free convection can still occur below these critical numbers due to heterogeneities non linear trends in concentration and changing boundary conditions simmons et al 2001 for k v k v clay r δ 0 19 and ra c 3600 and for k v k v sand r δ 470 and ra c 8 6 e 7 we interpret these values as follows during the pleistocene amidst a salt inversion free convection endured little resistance and definitely developed during the holocene buoyancy forces endured increasing resistance from the deposited clay free convection likely still occurred with inundations during and after dry periods where respectively evapoconcentration and dissolution of salts might have occurred but unlikely occurred on a large scale during periods without any inundations appendix c a comparison between compaction in seawat and an analytical solution here we compare numerical results of overpressure to the analytical solution of bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 who wrote the original solution of gibson 1958 in terms of excess head instead of excess pressure they define excess head as c 1 h h h s where h is head h s is the steady state component of head if there would be no compaction and h is the excess head generated by compaction the latter component can be transient assuming a constant density of incompressible water and homogeneous hydraulic conductivity and by ignoring compression in the spatial derivatives the one dimensional equation that describes the excess head in sediments is c 2 k 2 h z 2 s s h t ρ ρ w l t with c 3 ρ ρ b ρ w where k is the hydraulic conductivity z is the height above the impermeable base s s is the specific storage t is time ρ b is the bulk density of the sediments ρ w is the density of fresh water and l is the sediment thickness gibson considered the following problem sediment is deposited at a constant rate on top of an impermeable base this base is taken as the reference datum the sediment deposition causes the upward boundary where h 0 to move upwards at constant rate the initial thickness of the aquifer is zero the equation that describes excess head with time and depth is then c 4 h l ρ ρ w l ρ ρ w π kt s s l 2 1 2 exp z l 2 s s l 2 4 kt 0 ξ tanh ξ s s l 2 2 kt cosh z l ξ s s l 2 2 kt exp ξ 2 s s l 2 4 kt d ξ for a derivation see bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 and gibson 1958 if we assume h s 0 then h h and we can calculate the amount of overpressure generated with seawat this requires two boundary conditions to be set in seawat an upward moving top boundary and a volumetric source term which equals the strain rate the first is implemented similar as how we approached the pleistocene sedimentation in the nda c model by stacking cauchy boundary cells and deactivating them upwards through time the latter is implemented as how we modeled the effects of compaction on groundwater flow in the kes model by adding source terms to every cell in the domain injecting a fixed flux equalling the strain rate in this case c 5 q s s s ρ ρ w l t eq c 5 is very similar to eq 15 in the main text for the reader familiar with seawat we used the ghb and the wel package respectively in fig c1 we recreated fig 6 in bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 it shows an excellent fit between the numerical model and analytical solution we conclude that using seawat in combination with our modifications is appropriate to model groundwater problems on a geological timescale as one can solve a moving boundary problem and incorporate the effects of compaction with seawat appendix d effects of cell discretization a grid convergence test was conducted for both the kes model as the nda c model cell discretization was decreased or increased in both dimensions one at a time as the kes model provides the basal boundary condition for the nda c model we ensured that the models had the same cell size in each simulation thus hypothetical numerical errors of the kes model are also reflected in the tds distribution of the nda c model fig d1 shows a comparison of the tds contours of the nda c model the contours for the finer discretization are sufficiently similar to the base case the coarser grid sizes tend to underestimate the height of the 70 g l contour we ascribe this to numerical dispersion we conclude that the cell size is sufficient and if it were not it would not affect our conclusions in this paper since the 70 g l contour would only be higher for the nda f model a different approach was taken to assess the effect of a wider range of δ x since this dimension had the coarsest resolution 1 km we modeled a simple 800 m thick sandbox with a hypersaline lake on top this allowed us to stretch the domain as much as necessary in the horizontal direction the chosen parameters for this model are the same as in table 3 the amount of cells was kept at 100 in the horizontal direction ξ is the normalized fluid mass increase which is calculated by dividing the increase in fluid mass across the top boundary by the maximum mass storage increase d 1 ξ q δ x ρ d x d t v tot ρ max ρ 0 n 1 2 s f ρ max ρ 0 ρ 0 z max ρ max where q is the volumetric flux through a boundary cell m2 d v tot is the total volume of the model domain m2 ρ max is the concentration at the top boundary which was set at 1078 kg m3 ρ 0 was the initial density of the groundwater in the domain 1000 kg m3 s f is the specific storage in terms of fresh water head d 1 z max the depth of the domain m and n the porosity for the test with δ x δ z was kept at 10 m in testing δ z δ x was kept at 10 m as the density at the top boundary of the model was perturbed randomly 10 simulations were started for each discretization of which the minimum maximum and mean of ξ are plotted it can be seen in fig d2 that there is some spread in ξ which is caused both by integration errors and differences between realizations furthermore a larger δ x causes a delay in the onset of free convection and causes a slower downward movement of fingers however all errors are unimportant on timescales larger than 100 years and thus also on our timescales of interest which is over 1000 years 
7344,the nile delta is essential to egypt s agro and socio economy although surface water is the traditional source for egypt s irrigation the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600 m depth the occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the nile delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets in this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models it is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from quaternary free convection systems or from compaction induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the messinian salinity crisis our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses furthermore it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the nile delta aquifer abbreviations nda nile delta aquifer nda c nile delta aquifer compaction model nda f nile delta aquifer free convection model kes kafr el sheikh formation keywords nile delta hydrogeology hypersaline brine groundwater 1 introduction the nile delta is essential to egypt s agro and socio economy as it constitutes most of the limited 3 of the country that is suitable for agriculture wri 2008 its wet and fertile lands have supported the egyptian population for over 5000 years mączyńska 2014 and currently host nearly 50 million inhabitants making it the second most populated delta in the world after the bengal delta higgins 2016 however its fresh groundwater resources are suffering from agriculture increasingly relying on groundwater barrocu and dahab 2010 and a growing population bucx et al 2010 that will further amplify extraction rates making fresh water availability its most challenging issue for agriculture fao 2005 these stress factors have led to a continuous interest in available fresh groundwater resources and several studies on the topic kashef 1983 critically reviewed the available data conducted water balance calculations and estimated the extent of salt water intrusion with the ghyben herzberg relationship he found several discrepancies in the available data and concluded based on his water balance that at that time the aquifer was gaining fresh water despite this gain he found that the extent of sea water intrusion was large sherif et al 1988 constructed the first numerical groundwater model for the area which was a 2d finite element model for variable density flow also accounting for dispersion next to the large extent of sea water intrusion the model showed that the width of the hydrodynamic dispersion zone could be considerable sefelnasr and sherif 2014 created a 3d model and showed the sensitivity of the nile delta aquifer to sea level rise as the shallow relief of the area resulted in a large extent of land surface inundation geirnaert and laeven 1992 used hydrogeochemistry to reconstruct the paleohydrogeology of the area up to 20 000 years bp providing the first conceptual model for this period they furthermore found that that the shallow groundwater in the center of the nile delta was recharged 3500 years bp as river water and in the bordering desert over 5000 years bp barrocu and dahab 2010 extended this conceptual model up to 180 000 years bp and further discussed the hydrogeochemistry they concluded that the saline groundwater in the north is likely not in connection with the current sea instead it is connate sea water and further stress the fragility of the groundwater system despite that the previously discussed works increased our understanding of the system we identify several research gaps a the numerical models made for this area do not take the paleohydrogeology in account presumably due to computational limitations b most studies implicitly assumed a completely open connection between aquifer and the sea while this is uncertain c the studies mainly used data of the shallow groundwater system roughly the upper 200 m of the upper aquifer even though the upper aquifer is believed to extend up to 1000 m depth kashef 1983 sestini 1989 with increasing stress on the shallow groundwater system interest in possible deeper fresh groundwater grows kang and jackson 2016 therefore the egyptian research institute for groundwater rigw measured salinity at 200 m 400 m and 600 m depth in 2013 and measured high values of total dissolved solids tds nofal et al 2015 starting from 400 m depth at several locations fig 1 a strongly suggesting a widespread occurrence of hypersaline groundwater at larger depths no hypersaline groundwater was observed at 200 m depth given the interest in finding deeper fresh groundwater resources in the nile delta aquifer nda see fig 1b a better understanding of the possible origins and transport of this hypersaline groundwater is necessary to assess further possibilities hypersaline groundwater is defined as groundwater exceeding the salinity of sea water 35 g l in this paper apart from the findings shown in fig 1a two other observations of hypersaline groundwater in the nda have been published firstly diab and saleh 1982 found hypersaline groundwater near the shore but did not report the depths of their samples secondly there is the incidental remark by shata 1999 hot brine is recorded in oil wells at a depth of 1000 m below ground surface as far as we are aware of no other observations hydrogeophysical or hydrogeochemical have been published that reach 600 m depth despite the multiple petroleum exploration wells that have been drilled and logged in the area given the occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater we question the often made assumption that seawater is the only source of salt in nda groundwater and deem further investigation necessary therefore we test a number of plausible hypotheses on the origin of the nda hypersaline groundwater using a combination of analytical solutions and numerical simulations this analysis provides more insight into a the timescales of salt transport involved in this large delta b which measurements should be collected to discern the origins of this hypersaline groundwater and c the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets the goals of this study are to investigate the plausibility of a number of hypotheses listed in section 3 to find a method to discriminate them in the field and where possible falsify hypotheses given the lack of study on this topic in this area a brief summary of findings in other deltaic areas is warranted as far as we are aware of four other cases have been published that are relevant to this research firstly hypersaline groundwater is found in fluvio deltaic sediments near the louisiana gulf coast mississippi delta which is probably the most well studied area for this topic here it is thought to originate from dissolution of salt domes brought upwards by thermal convection hanor and mercer 2011 secondly in the netherlands the rhine meuse delta hypersaline groundwater is found below the hydrogeological base presumably caused by rock salt dissolution griffioen et al 2016 largely varying salinities are observed on the national scale which can be partly explained by the presence of evaporite deposits and diffusive transport thirdly high salinities found in the burdekin delta are explained by transpiration of mangroves and subsequent downward free convection fass et al 2007 fourthly it is thought that intruded evapoconcentrated seawater is the cause of hypersaline groundwater near the yellow river delta han et al 2011 in summary these cases can be seperated into two groups 1 those where hypersaline groundwater is thought to have originated from rock salt dissolution and 2 those where it is thought to be caused by evapoconcentration we argue here that these four cases are relevant to the nile delta since evaporites are found below the hydrogeological base rizzini et al 1978 and its climate provides ample opportunity for evapoconcentration these processes will be discussed in further detail in section 3 the methods and findings of this research can also be applied to other deltaic areas overlying thick unconsolidated formations such as the four previously mentioned cases furthermore they might be applied to cases where hypersaline groundwater might be found in the future such as the mekong delta minderhoud et al 2017 the ganges brahmaputra delta lindsay et al 1991 and in particular the niger delta which is geologically similar to the nile delta summerhayes et al 1978 2 hydrogeological setting a conceptual geological cross section of the central nda is shown in fig 1b the nda ranges in thickness from approximately 200 m near cairo to 1000 m near the coast farid 1980 it consists mainly of coarse pleistocene sands and gravels with some clay intercalations laeven 1991 it is topped by a holocene clay cap ranging in thickness from 3 m at cairo to a maximum of 100 m near the shore shata 1999 in seismic studies it is found that the bottom 750 m of the coastal boundary of the nda is partially closed off by marine clays abdel aal et al 2000 samuel et al 2003 abdel fattah 2014 which is unaccounted for in previous groundwater research though the existence of connections between the nda and the sea is deemed possible in the form of conductive paleo channels there is an east west trending fault system fault flexure zone that presents a break in stratigraphy sestini 1989 and causes an increase in thickness of the aquifer in northern direction north of the fault flexure zone the nda is resting on top of a 1500 m thick formation consisting of mainly pliocene marine clays sestini 1989 farouk et al 2014 called the kafr el sheikh formation kes south of the fault flexure zone the nile delta is underlain by limestones and shales ranging from miocene to oligocene age geirnaert and laeven 1992 directly below kes there is a 50 m thick layer of messinian evaporites consisting mainly of anhydrite rizzini et al 1978 below these evaporites there is 1000 m of miocene sands and conglomerates underlain by compacted miocene shales below these shales the pore pressures approach geostatic pressure nashaat 1998 implying limited flow through the shales therefore we assumed this serves as a hydrogeological base furthermore we assumed the fault flexure zone is an impermeable boundary to flow since 1 at larger depths there are several processes that can reduce fault horizontal permeability bense et al 2013 such as clay smearing and particulate flow and 2 offshore faults at similar depth clearly compartmentalize the subsurface inferring from the high lateral differences in overpressure underneath the evaporate layer in nashaat 1998 3 hypotheses there are two possible origins of the hypersaline groundwater firstly the hypersaline groundwater could originate from deeper deposits we argue that it is certainly possible that hypersaline groundwater occurs in the 1 km thick miocene layer as evaporites are found up to the fault flexure zone just underneath kes these are correlated with the messinian salinity crisis rizzini et al 1978 during which the mediterrenean sea reached high salinities and its water intruded bottom sediments some of this residual hypersaline water remained here vengosh et al 1998 furthermore mud volcanos are found that seep hot brines originating from messinian salt formations offshore at 3000 m water depth pierre et al 2014 if hypersaline groundwater was transported upwards from deeper deposits onshore it had to overcome resistance exerted by the high groundwater density and the low permeable kes there are three physical processes that can possibly overcome these resistances hanor 1994 person and garven 1994 namely 1 molecular diffusion domenico and schwartz 1990 shackelford and daniel 1991a b 2 thermal driven free convection nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 nield and bejan 2013 as temperatures up to 90 c have been observed underneath the kes riad et al 1989 which may be associated with strong temperature gradients and 3 upward solute transport driven by sediment compaction since considerable overpressures have been measured onshore underneath the kes fig 1a these overpressures were likely caused by sediment loading since the sedimentation rates during the pleistocene and pliocene were extreme nashaat 1998 roughly 2500 m of deposits in 5 3 million years secondly it could originate from the top as the effect of 4 holocene or pleistocene free convection systems originating from the evapotranspiration of sea or river water schreiber and hsü 1980 wooding et al 1997 similar to the cases in the burdekin delta and near the yellow river delta that were mentioned in section 1 fass et al 2007 han et al 2011 the high evapotranspiration rates in the nile delta of the past 10 000 years provide ample opportunity for the formation of hypersaline groundwater deduced from the pockets of hypersaline groundwater found in the holocene clay layer diab et al 1997 and the hypersaline groundwater found underneath a sabkha neighbouring the nile delta west et al 1979 stanley and warne 1993 made a paleogeographical reconstruction of the past 30 000 years showing several possibilities for hypersaline groundwater formation in this relatively short geological period for example sabkha muds salt muds were deposited in seasonally dry depressions between former channels from 30 000 to 11 500 years bp furthermore the widespread wetlands of 6500 2000 years bp also at times transpired enough to create hypersalinity inferred from the previously mentioned pockets of hypersaline groundwater in the holocene clay diab et al 1997 another option might be a coastal lagoon that received little river water for a long period of time such as during the early holocene arid phase geirnaert and laeven 1992 analogue to the coastal sabkhas in the northern sinai gat and levy 1978 we want to stress that this list of hypotheses is not exhaustive due to the limited amount of data available at the depth of interest 4 methods computational analyses were conducted with either analytical solutions hypotheses 1 and 2 or numerical models hypotheses 3 and 4 to test the physical feasibility of mentioned four hypotheses since this is exploratory research we tried to reduce the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection as much as possible our ground rule was to set unconstrained parameters and boundary conditions in favor of the respective hypothesis under research since constraining data was often scarce if the hypothesis was then still falsified we could then be quite certain that this process played no important role in bringing hypersaline groundwater to 600 m depth one assumption we made in this research affected our analyses for all hypotheses namely we assumed nacl as the sole source of salt as this is the dominant salt in groundwater under natural conditions at tds values up to 200 g l hanor 1994 at larger tds values calcium becomes the more dominant cation as groundwater gets saturated with respect to halite this assumption affected both the molecular diffusion coefficient used used for hypotheses 1 4 and the conversion from concentration to density used for hypotheses 2 4 the effects of this assumption on our computational analyses are deemed unimportant since the molecular diffusion coefficient of nacl is higher than that of cacl2 shackelford and daniel 1991a thus not interfering with our ground rule and the uncertainties introduced by a different linear equation of state are negligible compared to the other uncertainties in this research kohfahl et al 2015 4 1 hypothesis 1 analytical solution here we test whether molecular diffusion could have transported enough dissolved salts to explain the observed salinities upwards over the kes assuming no groundwater flow solutetransport is purely governed by fick s second law of diffusion in 1d adapted for porous media which is written as follows 1 c t d c n e 2 c z 2 where c is the concentration of the solute g l n e the effective porosity z the vertical distance m t is time s and d c the effective diffusion coefficient m2 s there is no general consensus regarding the exact definition of d c domenico and schwartz 1990 shackelford and daniel 1991a in this study we used values of shackelford and shackelford and daniel 1991b who defined 2 d c d 0 τ a where d 0 is the molecular diffusion in free water at a certain temperature m2 s and τ a is an apparent tortuosity which accounts for the combined effects of tortuosity anion exclusion and viscosity the following analytical solution to eq 1 describes the concentration development through the compacted clay through time 3 c z t c max c min c max erf z 4 d c t where c max and c min are the maximum and minimum concentrations respectively we varied c max in our analysis and set c min to the tds of seawater which is 35 g l d c was approximated by estimating τ a we used the highest values of d c that we could estimate from the literature in order to reduce the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection shackelford and daniel 1991b rigorously conducted multiple experiments 8 test series in triplicate at 25 c for multiple species of which they calculated the mean d c of each test series the highest mean d c these authors found for cl at 25 c is 10 6e 10 m2 s since d 0 of cl at 25 c is 20 3e 10 m2 s shackelford and daniel 1991a an upper limit for τ a of 0 522 is inferred in addition we corrected for temperature as riad et al 1989 measured temperatures of 80 c on average directly underneath the kafr el sheikh layer at multiple points in the onshore nile delta d 0 of nacl at 80 c is around 44e 10 m2 s fell and hutchison 1971 thus assuming that τ a for cl is isotherm and is representative for nacl a d c 22 9e 10 m2 s was used for compacted clay at 80 c this hypothesis is rejected if filling in eq 3 with the most favorable parameters does not result in a concentration of 100 g l at 1000 m depth the top of the kes formation this is the concentration that was observed at 600 m depth in the nda 4 2 hypothesis 2 rayleigh number for double diffusive convection here we will test thermal convection could have had its onset over the kes which could subsequently transport dissolved salts upwards assuming initially stagnant groundwater and a homogeneous isotropic aquitard the onset of free convection over the kes formation was investigated by calculating the double diffusive rayleigh number nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 and comparing it to its critical boundary 4 ra t ra c ra t ra t nle ra crit with 5 ra t kgh ζ t δ t d t ν 6 ra c kgh ζ c δ c d c ν 7 n ζ c δ c ζ t δ t 8 le d t d c 9 ζ t 1 ρ ρ t 10 ζ c 1 ρ ρ c where ra t is the thermal rayleigh number ra c the compositional rayleigh number ra crit the critical rayleigh number the rest of the parameters is explained in table 1 these are extreme parameters all chosen to maximize ra t and ra c to minimize the risk of incorrect hypothesis rejection it should be noted that ra t and ra c become negative when temperature or concentration gradients act stabilizing trevisan and bejan 1990 in this case ra c is negative when ra t ra c ra crit the groundwater system in the kes becomes unstable and free convection is possible the value of ra crit depends on the chosen type of boundary conditions in this case a fixed head concentration and temperature on top and a no flux boundary and a fixed temperature and concentration at the bottom gives ra crit 27 10 nield 1968 trevisan and bejan 1990 the hypothesis is rejected if ra t ra c ra crit 4 3 hypotheses 3 4 numerical models 4 3 1 general approach the variable density solute transport code seawat langevin et al 2007 was used to simulate the development of tds fields pore pressures and groundwater age within a cross sectional domain up to 1 km depth representing the nda fig 1b all of the models described in this paper were built with the flopy package bakker et al 2016 groundwater ages were modeled directly as first implemented by voss and wood 1993 and later extensively supported by goode 1996 by adding age as an extra species with a constant production rate zheng 2010 seawat solves the following governing equation for flow 11 ρ q ρ q s ρ s p p t n e ρ c c t with 12 s p β p 1 n e n e β w and for solute transport 13 c t d c q n e c q s n e

term d 1 p is the pore pressure n m2 t is time d s p is the specific storage in terms of pressure m2 n β p and β w are the compressibility of the pores and water m2 n respectively c is the salt concentration g l c s is the source concentration g l d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 d r i is the rate of solute production or decay in reaction i of n different reactions and n e is the effective porosity for an elaborate explanation of eqs 11 13 the reader is referred to the seawat manual guo and langevin 2002 boundary conditions were varied to either model salt input by compaction driven inflow from below nda c model or free convection from the top nda f model these models evaluate hypotheses 3 and 4 based on their ability to approach the observed tds at several points at 600 m a separate model for the kes domain 1 3 5 km depth was developed to produce the basal boundary condition of the nda c model this sequential split domain approach first kes then nda c was chosen to maintain practicable computation times which ranged from half a day kes model up to a week nda c model with open coastal boundary these large differences in computational times were caused mainly by the solute transport solver mt3dms which based its time step internally on the maximum velocity in the model domain zheng and wang 1999 the nda model had the highest velocities while the kes model had a larger number of cells therefore combining model domains would seriously burden simulation times as this would result in three times the number of cells of the nda model with the same small time steps causing maximum predicted model simulation times of three weeks per simulation the sequential split domain approach is reasonable since groundwater flows predominantly upwards from kes into nda 4 3 2 methodological aspects of the numerical models the nda numerical models spanned 240 km by 1 km the kes model 180 km by 3 km and all models were discretized into cells of 1000 m horizontal by 10 m vertical see also fig d1 for a grid convergence test the time domain of the models ranged from 120 000 years nda f up to 2 5 million years kes nda c the latter time domain implies we assume no overpressure build up during the pliocene in the kes formation 4 3 2 1 kes model to quantify volumetric flow and solute transport within the kes depositional strata during the pleistocene and in particular the outflow at the top of this formation we used a modified version of bear 1972 partial differential equation for mass conservation in a deformable porous medium with external loading his equation 6 3 26 14 ρ q ρ β p σ t p t ρ n e β w p t n e ρ c c t where σ is the total stress or confining pressure m2 n which is a function of sediment loading and β p σ t p t ε t is the strain rate of the porous medium d 1 the applied modifications to bear s original equation which allow the equations to be solved with seawat without any modifications to the original code were a the addition of the last term which allows local groundwater mass change due to change in salt content and b the use of eulerian fixed space coordinates rather than lagrangian relative to moving solids time derivatives the latter modification reflects the fact that we solve for pore pressure tds and flows on a rigid model domain present day compressed state and neglect temporal changes of vertical grid spacing and domain height associated with the compaction this is considered reasonable as it yields conservative underestimated magnitudes of the compaction driven flow to solve eq 14 in seawat three variables of eq 11 were altered s p q s and ρ firstly whereas normally s p β p 1 n e n e β w eq 12 in the kes model s p n e β w eq 14 this required no modifications to the original code as seawat takes s p as an input parameter directly secondly the strain rate which equals the volumetric source term q s in eq 11 was specified to be constant in the model proportional to a constant pleistocene sedimentation rate and constant pore compressibility 15 q s β p σ t p t β p ρ b g z b t ρ w g z b t β p ρ b ρ w g z b t where ρ b the bulk density of the sediment ρ w the density of fresh water kg m3 and z b t the sedimentation rate m d eq 15 approximates the temporal change of pore pressure to equal a hydrostatic pressure change p p h as the depth of the kes strata relative to the water table increases during burial this overestimates the compression during early phases of pleistocene sedimentation when excess pore pressures increase but this overestimation becomes negligible after a short time as excess pore pressures stabilize the validity of this approach is shown in appendix c q s is constrained by the fact that the total amount of expelled pore water cannot exceed the pore water volume at time of deposition and the latter can be approximated a priori by 16 v s t 0 t q s d t n init where v s is the total volume of water expelled from the pores relative to the initial bulk volume or total strain t 0 and t are the beginning and the end of the time domain d respectively and n init is the initial porosity just after sediment deposition with the parameters chosen in this research table 2 v s equaled 0 26 and 0 13 for the pliocene clay and miocene deposits respectively we consider this an upper limit of the total water expelled by the pores during the pleistocene thirdly ρ the density of the water injected in a cell by q s had to equal the current concentration of the cell this was determined by seawat internally by using the recirculation well option of mt3dms zheng 2010 to ensure convergence the maximum number of outer iteration steps of the dispersion solver gcg was set at 10 the default value is 1 in practice no more than three outer iterations were required for convergence the upper boundary of the kes model was a cauchy boundary condition of which the fresh water head is set at zero to incorporate the effects of deposition of nda sediments on this upper boundary namely that the distance to the fixed head boundary increases the conductance of the top boundary of the kes model m2 d was adapted seawat takes the conductance as input for its cauchy boundary condition together with a prescribed head the conductance is defined as follows guo and langevin 2002 17 cond ka l where k is the hydraulic conductivity a is the cross sectional area of the flow l is the distance of the boundary to the model cell m we increased this conductance with time as sedimentation progresses 18 cond k v sand a cell top z b t t k v sand is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the nda deposits m d a cell top is the area of a model cell top interface m2 t is the time d and z b t is the sedimentation rate m d all other boundaries were assumed to be no flow boundaries as for the initial conditions we assumed completely stagnant conditions during the pliocene and therefore applied 3 4 million years duration of the pliocene of molecular diffusion over the kes clay layer the initial tds concentration at the miocene deposits varied between 125 200 300 400 g l respectively scenarios m125 m200 m300 and m400 and the initial groundwater age of the miocene deposits was set at 3 4 million years the upward salt fluxes of the kes scenario that showed the best fit to pressure observations were injected into the nda c model as part of a base case in this base case all parameters of the nda c model were set in favor of hypothesis 3 based on their expected behavior 4 3 2 2 nda models the boundary conditions of both nda models are shown in fig 2 the fresh water boundary had a fixed point water head linearly increasing land inwards roughly following the topography of the delta the coastal boundary of the nda models was modeled either open or closed off from 250 m to 1000 m depth see also section 4 3 2 3 as the connectivity between the deeper parts of the nda and the sea is still uncertain the geometry of this boundary was determined with the general bathymetric chart for the oceans gridded dataset gebco 2014 this is a 30 arc second grid providing global bathymetric coverage in addition four horizontal clay layers were placed at different depths spanning from the coastal boundary to the middle of the onshore model domain following the conceptual cross section by shata and hefny 1995 at the bottom of the nda c model the model receives its flow dissolved salts and groundwater ages from the kes model as a fixed flux the large time domain of the nda c model 2 5e6 years matches the extent of the deposition of sediments that form the nda therefore the aquifer is initially thin at the start of the pleistocene and grows in thickness with time this implies that the distance between the bottom and top boundary increases with time seawat does not support a change of spatial domain size over time therefore we ensured the undeposited part of the model did not contribute to the flow or solute transport system by making every undeposited cell a cauchy boundary cell with zero salinity and a head matching the sea level at that timestep after deposition of a cell the boundary condition in that cell was deactivated turning it into a regular active cell this created stacked cauchy boundaries fig 2 which were deactivated upwards as sedimentation progresses the validity of this approach is shown in appendix c we used the most parsimonious sedimentation possible namely assuming a constant sedimentation rate with this we determined the location of the cauchy boundary cells apriori for every input timestep called stress period in seawat we used a number of input timesteps 365 that exceeded the amount of model layers 100 to ensure the most gradual increase of the aquifer size that was possible on top of the nda f model a hypothetical 50 km long hypersaline inundation of 90 g l was added for 8000 years roughly the spatiotemporal extent of the late pleistocene sabkha muds near the current coastline stanley and warne 1993 as these were the most favorable circumstances for free convection appendix b it is assumed that free convection was not limited by salt production or by water availability the aim of the free convection model was not to accurately model chaotic fingering patterns nor their onset as these are controlled by a model discretization for example see kooi et al 2000 prasad and simmons 2005 zimmermann et al 2006 b heterogeneity simmons et al 2001 post and simmons 2010 c dimensionality simmons et al 2010 d numerical solvers chosen zimmermann et al 2006 e dynamic boundary conditions e g as reflected by the differences between the dimensionless numbers in nield 1968 and wooding et al 1997 for flooded and dry circumstances respectively this model was intended to obtain a sense of the time scale of free convection in a regional groundwater system of this size for which this setup is sufficient fig d2 for this model a warm up period of 120 000 years was chosen to set the initial conditions roughly the extent of a glaciation cycle but sea levels were kept constant to their relatively high current level for the sake of parsimony to ensure both vertical and horizontal propagation of hypersaline plumes the clay layers were further extended land inward with a conductivity of 19 log k extension log k sand log k clay 2 without this extension hypersaline plumes would only travel vertically downwards without intruding horizontally in between clay layers the conceptual idea behind this extension is a clay layer becoming thinner land inwards see also fig 1b thus reducing in hydraulic conductivity 4 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed on the compaction models kes nda c to study the influence of some of the underlying assumptions on the results inputs parameters boundary conditions and initial conditions were altered one at a time from a base case of which the values can be found in table 3 firstly the initial concentration in the miocene deposits in kes was increased from 125 g l to 200 g l and the increased upward salt flux is injected into nda c model secondly the horizontal clay layers in the nda c model were removed thirdly the river stage at the apex was increased from 5 m to 15 m fourthly the hydraulic conductivity of the nda c model was increased from 10 m d to 25 m d and 75 m d respectively finally the bottom 750 m of the seaside boundary was either open or closed off by setting the conductance eq 17 of the sea boundary to 1000 m2 d or 2 5e 9 m2 d the first is seen as an extreme upper limit and was calculated by assuming a 1 m thick layer of gravel of 100 m d and multiplying this by the area of a horizontal cell interface 10 m2 the latter was calculated by multiplying an assumed horizontal hydraulic conductivity for unweathered marine clay 5e 6 m d by the area of a horizontal cell interface 10 m2 and dividing this by the maximum observed horizontal extent of 20 km abdel aal et al 2000 and thus presents a lower limit scenarios were compared by looking at the depth difference between the 70 g l isoconcentration line and 600 m at three observation locations ε m 5 results 5 1 hypothesis 1 molecular diffusion fig 3 shows that even given a tds concentration of 643 g l the highest ever measured as far as we are aware of hanor 1994 the concentration at 1000 m depth is still below the observed concentration at 600 m depth even though all parameters are set in favor of this hypothesis the observed tds cannot be reproduced which means that diffusion cannot be the sole cause of the observed hypersalinity at 600 m and there has to be at least a second process involved to cause enough upward salt transport through kes 5 2 hypothesis 2 double diffusiveconvection filling in the most favorable limits for this hypothesis see table 1 for their values results in ra t ra c being strongly negative 516 which is caused by the high le 690 this entails that the buoyancy due to salinity works very stabilizing assuming there is enough mechanical dispersion d mch so that the theoretical minimum of le is approached 20 lim d mch le lim d mch d t d mch d c d mch 1 then given the parameters in table 1 still n 1 meaning that 21 ra t ra c ra t ra t nle ra t ra t 0 furthermore ra t 0 089 ra crit so even with a constant salinity gradient no free thermohaline convection is expected based on the high le n 1 and low ra t it is unlikely that there was any upward transport of solutes due to thermohaline induced free convection through kes the thick low permeable kes formation s potential for dampening instabilities is too high for any large scale instability to occur 5 3 hypothesis 3 sediment compaction fig 4 a shows a comparison between modeled pressures and observations in a well near the city of kafr el sheikh personal communication with dr m tingay per initial concentration scenario m125 m400 both observations and our models follow a hydrostatic pressure distribution up to a depth of less than approximately 2 8 km to which an initial concentration of 125 g l seems to give the best fit around 2 8 km depth the observations show a sudden jump in pressure indicating the presence of a low permeable seal which consists of the messinian evaporites rizzini et al 1978 nashaat 1998 this seal is not completely impermeable otherwise the observed pressure underneath the seal would approach lithostatic pressure our models also capture the pressure difference across this messinian seal which means that the upward groundwater flow encounters enough resistance the resistance in our model might be overestimated as part of the pressure difference may already have been established during the pliocene in addition the dissolved salts had more time to be transported through the seal thus our model represents a conservative estimate of upward salt transport fig 4b shows hypersaline groundwater with a concentration above the observed 100 g l fig 1a moving from the kes to the nda due to compaction induced upward salt transport and molecular diffusion the increasing concentrations over time imply that salt transport has not yet reached steady state therefore if the hypersaline groundwater in the nda is caused by compaction induced salt transport the mass flux of salt into the nda is still present and presumably even increasing slowly on a geological time scale the results in fig 5 a as obtained from the nda c model show that these upward salt mass fluxes from the kes to the nda have the potential to cause salinities similar to those observed at 600 m depth in the nda nowadays furthermore if this has indeed occurred in reality the hypersaline groundwater should be older than 2 5 million years and thus older than its surrounding sediment matrix a subsequent sensitivity analysis shows that hypothesis 3 only holds if the bottom of the coastal boundary is closed as shown in fig 5b if the boundary were open the tds at 600 m would decrease towards the coast see also fig a1 which is not observed in the field fig 1a moreover with an open coastal boundary the 70 g l contour would not reach 600 m 5 4 hypothesis 4 free convection in the nda f model a considerable volume of hypersaline groundwater is transported downwards in this model fig 6 after onset the plume travels downwards for roughly 600 years until it reaches the bottom this plume subsequently reaches the observation points in the case of an open boundary but does not in the case of closed boundary a closed coastal boundary in our model results in rejection of the nda f hypothesis the hypersaline groundwater has difficulty to replace fresh groundwater that is trapped between clay layers and a closed coastal boundary we also make two observations that might be relevant to groundwater age measurement campaigns in the future firstly free convective transport leads to an inversion in groundwater ages fig 6 left though this inversion becomes negligible on longer timescales with an open coastal boundary fig 6 right see also supplementary video a2 secondly it is observed that a closed boundary results in groundwater ages exceeding the duration of glacial cycles 100 000 year see also supplementary video a3 despite the high hydraulic conductivity 75 m d and low porosity 0 10 of the aquifer in this model 6 discussion our computational investigation did not lead to a final conclusion as to the origins of the hypersaline groundwater consequently a brief discussion of measurements to discriminate hypothesis 3 from 4 is necessary with groundwater dating it might be possible to discriminate these two hypotheses upward compaction induced salt transport leads to groundwater ages older than the surrounding sediment matrix since overpressures are a common phenomenon in deltas sharp and domenico 1976 neuzil 2003 it is safe to assume that the same holds for upward transport of major volumes of connate groundwater into delta aquifers e g as presumably occurred in the netherlands verweij 1999 griffioen et al 2016 whether this groundwater is still present in these aquifers highly depends on the hydrogeological connection between aquifer and sea this connection is critical to coastal hydrogeology yechieli et al 2009 since it also influences potential offshore fresh water reserves post et al 2013 and submarine groundwater discharge taniguchi et al 2002 groundwater dating in combination with our current analysis could thus lead to important conclusions regarding both the origins of the hypersaline groundwater and the interaction between the deeper parts of the nda and the mediterranean sea if the groundwater is found to be older than 2 million years old fig 5 it originates from messinian deposits and the hydrogeological connection with the sea is limited in contrast if it is found to be younger than 100 000 years old it presumably is the result of free convective systems and the coastal boundary is open 81kr dating may be the most suitable method to discriminate these two hypotheses sturchio et al 2004 aeschbach hertig 2014 as 36cl dating is not suited for saline fluids park et al 2002 determining the chemical composition of the groundwater and comparing this to published cases will certainly lead to new insights a start would be the br cl ratio which is useful in discriminating whether salinity is caused by evapoconcentration or rock salt dissolution hanor 1994 this is not necessarily enough information to discriminate hypothesis 3 from 4 since the groundwater from underneath the kes could also have been evapoconcentrated during the messinian as thought to have happened in the east mediterranean sea vengosh et al 1998 more suitable might be non conservative environmental tracers that interact with clay as hypersaline groundwater of hypothesis 3 had more time to interact with clay minerals under higher temperatures than groundwater of hypothesis 4 examples of these are na ca2 sr2 b k and δ 11 b vengosh et al 1999 useful cases for the comparison are the hypersaline water found in the deep eastern mediterranean basin vengosh et al 1998 and at the coastal sabkhas in the northern sinai levy 1977 gat and levy 1978 which might be suitable analogues for the hypersaline groundwater of respectively hypothesis 3 and 4 there are limitations to this computational investigation regarding the free convection model nda f it is difficult to constrain a paleo reconstruction of a process controlled so strongly by heterogeneity and that acted on such a relatively small timescale this is in part reflected by the very limited number of field observations of free convection in groundwater despite over a century of research the first field observations started to be reported only in the last decade andersen et al 2007 van dam et al 2009 in addition our assumption of free convection unrestricted by salt or fluid availability is applicable to a sabkha delta which continuously receives new saline water but may be inappropriate for a floodplain furthermore in both this model and nda c we did not take the sea level variation of a glacial cycle into account the low sea level stands during a glacial period would result in a wider fresh water zone post et al 2013 and the sea level variations might also result in a wider mixing zone e g as happens on a larger spatiotemporal scale in carbonate platforms jones et al 2002 the effect of a higher hydraulic gradient on the nda c model is shown in the sensitivity analysis though not to the extent as the gradient reached during the pleistocene in short our results intentionally present a hypothetical extreme case regarding the kes model it is possible that the hydrogeological system in the pre miocene deposits is connected to the miocene deposits in some compartimized areas through faults which may imply that thermal processes become important in determining the salt concentration underneath the kes formation garven 1995 lopez and smith 1995 however this is excluded from this research because of the scarcity of published data of the deep hydrogeology underneath the nile delta furthermore we assumed that the side boundaries are impermeable due to faulting for the side boundary offshore in the north this is reasonable given the high lateral differences in overpressure nashaat 1998 but onshore this might be different as far as we are aware off no pressure measurements in the deeper strata underneath the nile valley have been published to assess the validity of this assumption two processes are not covered in this research which could serve as alternative hypotheses firstly hypersaline groundwater may preferentially flow along faults as faults are observed that propagate through the kes formation abd allah et al 2012 these faults might act as a conduit for upward flow bense et al 2013 secondly leaking abandoned petroleum exploration wells could act as an anthropogenic source of salt water at least 90 wells had been drilled in 1989 sestini 1989 because of the area s high oil and natural gas potential kirschbaum et al 2010 which may potentially leak hypersaline groundwater upwards driven by the overpressures underneath kes this would result in high salinities focused around exploration areas both these processes would result in a more heterogeneous distribution of salinities and also in temperature anomalies bense et al 2013 thus testing these two hypotheses requires more data than is currently available and is therefore a topic for further research the origins of the hypersaline groundwater have crucial implications for the expected occurrence of deeper fresh water pockets our results show that the salinity distribution by free convection is largely affected by clay layers whereas the slow compaction induced upward advection is quite insensitive to these layers our models with free convection show that lower salinity water might be trapped between clay layers whereas no salinity inversions were simulated in models with sedimentation compaction as the driver 7 conclusions two of the four hypotheses of this research remain valid the hypersaline groundwater in the nda is either caused by compaction induced salt transport hypothesis 3 or free convective systems hypothesis 4 both the nda c model and the nda f model are able to reproduce the observed high tds values given the right coastal boundary condition this condition has opposite effects on the plausibility of these models an open boundary results in the rejection of the nda c model the hypersaline groundwater does not reach 600 m depth whereas in the nda f model a closed boundary hinders the hypersaline groundwater in replacing the fresh water between the clay layers and in our conceptualization reaching the observation point the origins of this hypersaline groundwater affect the probability of the existence of deep fresh water pockets this probability is reduced if the hypersaline groundwater originates from underneath the kes and was transported upwards following the assumptions made in this paper deep fresh water pockets are considered more probable if the hypersaline groundwater was brought downwards by free convection acknowledgements firstly we thank hanneke verweij and andrea forzoni for their helpful ideas and

current sedimentation level video a2 animation of the results of the nda f model with an open sea boundary video a3 animation of the results of the nda f model with a closed sea boundary see fig a1 appendix b onset of convection during the pleistocene and holocene we assess the onset of free convection under two conditions applicable to semi arid deltas during an inundation and during a dry stand for values sources and definitions of symbols used in this analysis the reader is referred to table b1 the onset of free convection underneath a dry salt lake is determined by the destabilizing buoyancy force and the stabilizing upward flux caused by evapotranspiration zimmermann et al 2006 wooding et al 1997 derived a dimensionless number for the theoretical onset of free convection underneath a dry salt lake with impermeable boundaries at the bottom and sides b 1 r δ ρ m ρ a k v n e ρ a et where ρ m and ρ a are the salinity of the salt lake and surrounding water kg m3 respectively k v is the vertical hydraulic conductivity m d n e is the effective porosity and et the evapotranspiration rate m d it was found with both lab and numerical experiments that for r values above 10 free convection is expected wooding et al 1997 for flooded conditions the onset of free convection can be assessed by the rayleigh number nield and bejan 2013 b 2 ra c ρ m ρ a k v h ρ a d where h is the thickness of the aquifer m and d is the dispersion tensor m2 d here taken as the scalar effective diffusion constant d c since we assume initially stagnant water with a fixed head on top due to an inundation the critical value for ra c 27 10 nield 1968 important underlying assumptions of both these dimensionless numbers are a a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity b a linear upward trend in concentration and c initially stagnant water we therefore want to stress that the values of these numbers only allow for a qualitative interpretation as under field conditions free convection can still occur below these critical numbers due to heterogeneities non linear trends in concentration and changing boundary conditions simmons et al 2001 for k v k v clay r δ 0 19 and ra c 3600 and for k v k v sand r δ 470 and ra c 8 6 e 7 we interpret these values as follows during the pleistocene amidst a salt inversion free convection endured little resistance and definitely developed during the holocene buoyancy forces endured increasing resistance from the deposited clay free convection likely still occurred with inundations during and after dry periods where respectively evapoconcentration and dissolution of salts might have occurred but unlikely occurred on a large scale during periods without any inundations appendix c a comparison between compaction in seawat and an analytical solution here we compare numerical results of overpressure to the analytical solution of bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 who wrote the original solution of gibson 1958 in terms of excess head instead of excess pressure they define excess head as c 1 h h h s where h is head h s is the steady state component of head if there would be no compaction and h is the excess head generated by compaction the latter component can be transient assuming a constant density of incompressible water and homogeneous hydraulic conductivity and by ignoring compression in the spatial derivatives the one dimensional equation that describes the excess head in sediments is c 2 k 2 h z 2 s s h t ρ ρ w l t with c 3 ρ ρ b ρ w where k is the hydraulic conductivity z is the height above the impermeable base s s is the specific storage t is time ρ b is the bulk density of the sediments ρ w is the density of fresh water and l is the sediment thickness gibson considered the following problem sediment is deposited at a constant rate on top of an impermeable base this base is taken as the reference datum the sediment deposition causes the upward boundary where h 0 to move upwards at constant rate the initial thickness of the aquifer is zero the equation that describes excess head with time and depth is then c 4 h l ρ ρ w l ρ ρ w π kt s s l 2 1 2 exp z l 2 s s l 2 4 kt 0 ξ tanh ξ s s l 2 2 kt cosh z l ξ s s l 2 2 kt exp ξ 2 s s l 2 4 kt d ξ for a derivation see bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 and gibson 1958 if we assume h s 0 then h h and we can calculate the amount of overpressure generated with seawat this requires two boundary conditions to be set in seawat an upward moving top boundary and a volumetric source term which equals the strain rate the first is implemented similar as how we approached the pleistocene sedimentation in the nda c model by stacking cauchy boundary cells and deactivating them upwards through time the latter is implemented as how we modeled the effects of compaction on groundwater flow in the kes model by adding source terms to every cell in the domain injecting a fixed flux equalling the strain rate in this case c 5 q s s s ρ ρ w l t eq c 5 is very similar to eq 15 in the main text for the reader familiar with seawat we used the ghb and the wel package respectively in fig c1 we recreated fig 6 in bredehoeft and hanshaw 1968 it shows an excellent fit between the numerical model and analytical solution we conclude that using seawat in combination with our modifications is appropriate to model groundwater problems on a geological timescale as one can solve a moving boundary problem and incorporate the effects of compaction with seawat appendix d effects of cell discretization a grid convergence test was conducted for both the kes model as the nda c model cell discretization was decreased or increased in both dimensions one at a time as the kes model provides the basal boundary condition for the nda c model we ensured that the models had the same cell size in each simulation thus hypothetical numerical errors of the kes model are also reflected in the tds distribution of the nda c model fig d1 shows a comparison of the tds contours of the nda c model the contours for the finer discretization are sufficiently similar to the base case the coarser grid sizes tend to underestimate the height of the 70 g l contour we ascribe this to numerical dispersion we conclude that the cell size is sufficient and if it were not it would not affect our conclusions in this paper since the 70 g l contour would only be higher for the nda f model a different approach was taken to assess the effect of a wider range of δ x since this dimension had the coarsest resolution 1 km we modeled a simple 800 m thick sandbox with a hypersaline lake on top this allowed us to stretch the domain as much as necessary in the horizontal direction the chosen parameters for this model are the same as in table 3 the amount of cells was kept at 100 in the horizontal direction ξ is the normalized fluid mass increase which is calculated by dividing the increase in fluid mass across the top boundary by the maximum mass storage increase d 1 ξ q δ x ρ d x d t v tot ρ max ρ 0 n 1 2 s f ρ max ρ 0 ρ 0 z max ρ max where q is the volumetric flux through a boundary cell m2 d v tot is the total volume of the model domain m2 ρ max is the concentration at the top boundary which was set at 1078 kg m3 ρ 0 was the initial density of the groundwater in the domain 1000 kg m3 s f is the specific storage in terms of fresh water head d 1 z max the depth of the domain m and n the porosity for the test with δ x δ z was kept at 10 m in testing δ z δ x was kept at 10 m as the density at the top boundary of the model was perturbed randomly 10 simulations were started for each discretization of which the minimum maximum and mean of ξ are plotted it can be seen in fig d2 that there is some spread in ξ which is caused both by integration errors and differences between realizations furthermore a larger δ x causes a delay in the onset of free convection and causes a slower downward movement of fingers however all errors are unimportant on timescales larger than 100 years and thus also on our timescales of interest which is over 1000 years
