1 keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization membrane stack energy efficiency productivity 1 introduction global water demand is projected to rise by 55 over the next 50 years and in view of the limited supply of surface waters and near surface groundwaters of suitable quality pierce 2017 there has been increasing interest in exploiting the huge volumes of waters that are available but are too brackish and or otherwise degraded for domestic and agricultural uses cath et al 2010 pan et al 2017 porada et al 2013 while the state of the art process of reverse osmosis ro is widely used for seawater desalination it may be inappropriate for the treatment of brackish waters in view of its low energy efficiency when desalting dilute streams with salinities in the range of 2 5 g l 1 fritzmann et al 2007 greenlee et al 2009 therefore a number of innovative technologies specifically aimed at brackish water desalination have been developed with the method of capacitive deionization cdi otherwise known as electrosorption gaining in popularity ma et al 2019b oyarzun et al 2018 su et al 2018 suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is one of the recent variants of cdi he et al 2018 jeon et al 2013 rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2016b although the underpinning mechanism relating to salt removal in fcdi is similar to that of cdi i e ion migration in an electrical field followed by immobilisation in the electrical double layers edls of the oppositely charged electrode ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 so called short circuited closed cycle scc operation of the flow electrodes enables continuous regeneration of the charged carbon materials with the released salt enriched in the electrolytes of the flow electrodes the scc fcdi thus provides the possibility of i pseudo infinite electrosorption at low energy cost ii individual management of the desalted water and the brine and iii extremely high flow efficiency doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 one of our recent studies indicated that fcdi is capable of removing uncharged species in this case ca2 uo2 2 co3 3 aq from brackish streams as there is equilibrium with the homologous anion ca uo2 2 co3 3 2 ma et al 2019b in addition the combination of fcdi with other processes enables the partitioning of the charged and uncharged species and the recovery of valuable products such as ammonia from waste streams linnartz et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b despite the merits mentioned above critical concerns relating to the practical application of fcdi remain for example the planar size of most fcdi cells is limited to centimeters by centimeters with the productivity limited to only liters per hour hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018 yang et al 2016b pioneered a stack design of five unit cells with results showing that the flow electrodes could be uniformly segmented from the manifold into individual channels at no extra pressure loss yang et al 2016b a highly scalable 3d fcdi unit with 1 3 channels has subsequently been proposed by use of honeycomb shaped porous cordierite mg2al4si5o18 scaffolds with the inner walls alternatively coated with anion and cation exchange membranes cho et al 2017 by increasing the porosity and permeability of the scaffolds the honeycomb shaped design can be made more compact with the membrane spacer assembly with 1 2 channels serving as the brackish water channels choo et al 2019 compared to the progress in enlarging the dimensions of flow electrodes to scale up the capacity there has been surprisingly limited investigation of the membrane stack in fcdi rommerskirchen et al 2015 although such configurations of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes have been widely used in comparable electrochemical processes to increase the productivity valero et al 2011 as for scc fcdi one may expect that the membrane stack configuration would not only improve the salt removal capacity but also alleviate the accumulation of ions in the flow electrodes scheme 1 these advantages may significantly reduce the operating cost because less regular replacement of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes would be required on the other hand it is recognized that capacitive sorption plays an important role in ion transfer in flow electrode technologies with increased electro sorption of ions at high carbon contents hatzell et al 2017 ma et al 2018 because there is no carbon flowing between the membrane stack scheme 1 an increase in the number of membrane pairs may result in a reduction in fcdi performance with ion transport more related to electrodialysis than electrosorption in this study we systematically investigate the impacts of alternate membrane stack configurations on salt removal and energy consumption in scc fcdi while suss et al 2015 and hawks et al 2019 have proposed standardised metrics to compare the performance of different cdi configurations it should be noted that parameters such as average salt adsorption rate and maximum salt adsorption capacity may be not applicable to fcdi because of i the contribution of ion transfer removal within the spacers in the inner parts of the membrane stack and ii the continuous regeneration of electrode capacitance in scc mode ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 yang et al 2017 as such we compare the performance of the fcdi membrane stack with alternate designs using a range of metrics including average salt removal rate asrr energy normalized removed salt enrs and water recovery wr results of this study are expected to provide insight into possible approaches to scaling up fcdi such that energy efficient water desalination can be achieved 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent grade from sigma aldrich and used without further purification the artificial brackish water and electrolyte in the flow electrodes were prepared by using 18 2 mω cm milli q water the flow electrodes were made of suspensions of 100 mesh darco activated carbon norit chemically activated charcoal from sigma aldrich with bet surface areas of 920 and 1050 m2 g 1 respectively and carbon black powders vulcan xc72r from cabot co with an average size of 50 nm at a mass ratio of 8 1 1 in 1 or 20 g l 1 nacl solution with an initial ph of around 7 the total mass percentage of carbon materials in the flow electrodes was 10 wt in all experiments to ensure the surface of the carbon was well wetted all flow electrodes were continually mixed on a magnetic stirrer for at least 24 h prior to experimentation 2 2 experimental setup the fcdi cells scheme 1 consisting of one pair of graphite current collectors 90 mm 90 mm thickness 4 mm n pairs of ion exchange membranes aem type ii cem type ii fujifilm europe n 1 2 or 3 in this study effective size 44 mm 50 mm each and 2n 1 pieces of polyester spacer 100 mesh 44 mm 50 mm each thickness 0 5 mm between the ion exchange membranes were assembled in a similar manner to that of an electrodialysis stack strathmann 2010 polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates were used to hold all components together the flow anode and cathode chambers were located on the alternate sides of the outer anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem respectively scheme 1 with the channels fabricated by computerized numerical control cnc milling of the graphite current collectors note that the anode is considered to be the electrode and or current collector that was positively charged during the charging process while the cathode is the electrode and or current collector that was negatively charged during the charging process each serpentine channel in rectangular profile 2 mm 2 mm with 570 mm in total length was carved on the graphite plates and covered by the aem and cem to form the anode and cathode chambers the contact area between the current collectors and each membrane a was 22 0 cm2 with an effective contact area between the flow channels and each membrane a eff of 11 9 cm2 all experiments were conducted in single pass scc mode with brackish water initially containing 1000 mg l 1 nacl running through the spacers for an fcdi cell with one pair of membranes n 1 schemes 1a and 2 a salt ions accumulated in the flow electrodes with the brine generated by regular replacement of the electrolyte δv ele the electrical conductivity of the desalted water was measured using a conductivity meter con bta vernier connected to a data acquisition system sensordaq vernier scheme 2a for an fcdi cell with two or three pairs of membranes n 2 or 3 schemes 1b and 2 salt ions transported through the ion exchange membranes accumulate in both the flow electrodes and the adjacent brine chambers with the electrical conductivity of the desalted water and the brine with an initial volume v br 40 ml and salt concentration c br 1000 mg nacl l 1 for both n 2 and 3 measured by individual conductivity meters connected to the data acquisition system schemes 2b and c the initial mass of the flow electrodes was fixed at 40 g in all tests with an aqueous volume v ele 36 ml unless elsewhere documented the internal recirculation flow rates of the brine stream and flow electrodes were fixed at 2 4 l h 1 in order to evaluate the performance of the membrane stacked fcdi in semi continuous operation the dual pairs n 2 system was tested with brackish water containing 1000 mg l 1 nacl constantly running through the spacers at q 0 32 l h 1 and i 18 2 a m 2 for over 18 h the brine see scheme 2b was replaced with a fresh solution i e v br 40 ml and salt concentration c br 1 g l 1 nacl every 4 h the scc flow electrodes 40 g were initially prepared using 1 g l 1 nacl solution according to the change of the flow electrode volume a water transport rate dv ele 2a eff dt of 1 0 10 7 m s 1 was obtained in regard to dilution of the flow electrodes and deterioration in desalination efficiency that results from undesirable water transport through the ion exchange membranes 7 ml of the electrolyte was removed from the flow electrodes every 8 h to maintain the concentration of carbon materials 2 3 operating conditions and calculations the productivity of the fcdi system p a l m 2 h 1 p v m3 m 3 h 1 normalized to the cross sectional area a see fig s1 or the bed volume v bed al tot see scheme 2 hawks et al 2019 was adjusted by changing the flow rate of the influent brackish water q l h 1 eq 1 1 p a q a o r p v q v b e d q a l t o t where l tot is the total thickness of the current collectors the membranes and the spacers cm i e l tot 2l e 2nl m 2n 1 l sp l e is the thickness of the current collector electrode 4 mm l m the thickness of cation or anion exchange membrane 0 16 mm and l sp the thickness of the nylon spacer 0 5 mm note that throughout the paper unit conversions are implied in one operating step of 3600 s a constant current density i i a 9 1 or 18 2 a m 2 was applied to the cell using a dc power supply mp3094 powertech note that similar to studies using graphite current collectors and flow channels nativ et al 2017 porada et al 2014 yang et al 2016a the current density in all studies described here was expressed in units of cross sectional area i e the contact area between the current collectors and each membrane a in contrast this index was normalized to the effective contact area between the flow channels and each membrane a eff when composite current collectors were used ma et al 2018 2019b song et al 2019 because the acrylic sheets used in these studies were non conductive the current i 20 or 40 ma through and voltage u cell across the fcdi electrodes were recorded using vernier current and voltage probes connected to the sensordaq in regards to the ion removal within the spacers in the inner parts of the membrane stack and the fact that there is no energy recovery step in scc mode average salt removal rate asrr μg cm 2 s 1 or μmol cm 2 min 1 energy normalized removed salt enrs μmol j 1 and overall current efficiency cetot were determined as follows hawks et al 2019 suss et al 2015 eqs 2 4 2 asrr c i n c o u t q d t a t δ c p a 3 enrs c i n c o u t q d t i u c e l l d t δ c q t i u c e l l d t 4 ce tot n a e c i n c o u t q d t i d t 100 n a e δ c q i 100 where c in and c out represent the influent and effluent salt concentrations with δ c c in c out in constant current mode while asrr has been widely reported in units of a eff because of ion transport occurring over the contact area between the flow electrodes and membranes the cross sectional area was used in this study for a fair comparison of systems with different pairs of membranes as aforementioned hawks et al 2019 the molar parameter asrr can be connected to the volumetric indicator p a when δ c is specified eq 2 n a is avogadro s number 6 02 1023 and e is the charge of each ion i e 1 60 10 19 c in this study in eq 4 cetot indicates the total ion transfer efficiency in the electrical field and that in individual desalination chambers can be determined by ce cetot n 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane stack configuration in fcdi time course results of the cell voltages and desalination performance of fcdi with different pairs of membranes are illustrated in figs s2 s4 specifically when n 1 or 2 the cell voltages decreased during the experiments this finding is to be expected since it has been reported that the increase in the conductivity of the flow electrode and the brine on continued operation of the fcdi system is conducive to reducing the circuit internal resistance he et al 2018 song et al 2019 yang et al 2016a however with another pair of membranes n 3 inserted a constant increase in cell voltage was observed during desalination fig s4a results shown in fig s5 indicate that this increase is relatively independent of operating conditions such as current densities and influent flow rate moreover stable desalination performance has been achieved in all experiments when two or three pairs of membranes are used a portion i e n 1 n of the ions removed in scc mode accumulate in the brine stream figs s3b and s4b changes of asrr corresponding u cell and current efficiencies as a function of n are shown in fig 1 while the variation of influent flow rate q resulting in changes in δ c has minimal effect on asrr provided that i is fixed fig 1a a higher desalination efficiency e g δ c 14 5 mm compared to that ranging 4 10 mm inevitably resulted in increased concentration polarization at the membrane interface against the spacer and as a result an increase in cell voltage in constant current mode fig 1b with the cross sectional area a specified asrr 2 3 μg cm 2 s 1 at i 18 2 a m 2 of fcdi with two pairs of membranes was roughly two times that of n 1 fig 1a though the difference would be marginal when normalization is performed with regard to the total membrane areas note that the desalting rate did not increase further on increasing n to 3 likewise the total current efficiency cetot for n 2 was significantly higher than n 1 with the specific current efficiencies ce being around 100 fig 1c in contrast only 62 of the input charge in fcdi with three pairs of membranes contributed to ion transport with δ c fig s4b substantially lower than those for n 1 and 2 figs s2b and s3b under comparable operating conditions as such cetot and asrr for n 3 were even lower than n 2 to elucidate the desalination energy efficiency in different fcdi systems we plot the concentration reduction δ c in relation to the removal rate as described by asrr and electrical consumption as described by enrs in fig 2 in accordance with the resistive models developed by hawks et al 2018 and wang and lin 2018 for cdi assessment results in fig 2 show that on increasing the applied i resulting in a higher asrr lower salt rejection for example by increasing the influent flow rate would be required to maintain the same enrs likewise decreasing δ c at the same asrr results in improvement in enrs although no energy recovery process rommerskirchen et al 2018 was included in our scc fcdi scheme 2 its performance for example δ c 14 7 mm at asrr 0 52 μg cm 2 s 1 and enrs 7 4 μmol j 1 was comparable with cdi in which complete energy recovery and reuse η 1 from the external circuit hawks et al 2018 2019 was assumed with the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas similar to enrs normalized to the net energy input i e the total energy subtracted by the energy recovered in regard to the changed contribution of different resistances and thus potentials in the scc fcdi the high efficacy can partially be explained by the modified donnan model liu et al 2018 porada et al 2013 the excess salt adsorption γ in relation to δ c is associated with both the effective micropore volume p mi ρ e 1 and the non dimensional donnan potential within the micropores δφ d previous studies have shown that charge neutralization and ion release can be passively achieved in scc fcdi ma et al 2019b song et al 2019 with the relatively low micropore concentrations expected to lead to minimal specific electrical consumption in the edls and higher enrs and asrr compared to icc fcdi under similar conditions in the dual pair fcdi fig 2b similar desalination performance δ c can be achieved at higher separation rate i e higher asrr and lower energy consumption i e higher enrs compared to the single pair system n 1 fig 2a these findings are in good agreement with the increased cetot and approximately 100 ce in each chamber fig 1c with these results indicating that there were few faradaic losses to compare with the electrodialysis technology the energy demand of scc fcdi in 0 16 0 38 wh g 1 salt removed at δ c 7 0 9 0 mm and asrr 1 1 2 3 μg cm 2 s 1 is competitive fig s6 in contrast at n 3 although the productivity of the system went up fig s7 the energy efficiency of the desalination process was compromised potentially as a result of the dominance of the electrolysis process in ion transport our preliminary results have shown that the presence of carbon materials in the flow electrodes can significantly alleviate the formation of concentration polarization that results from the different ion transfer rates in the ion exchange membranes and the bulk solution fig s8 however with n increasing one can expect that the benefits would gradually decrease leading to elevated energy consumption for instance enrs 13 8 μmol j 1 was only half that 29 1 μmol j 1 at n 2 under similar conditions δ c 6 7 mm and asrr 1 1 μg cm 2 s 1 the energy demand in unit of wh g 1 salt removed was increased to 0 34 0 46 wh g 1 we therefore conclude that the dual pairs membrane stack configuration is optimum for scaling up fcdi system 3 2 comparison of different fcdi systems using standardised metrics water recovery wr is one of the benchmarks for fair comparison of different cdi systems hawks et al 2019 in contrast to isolated closed cycle icc operation of fcdi in which the desalted and brine streams are alternatively generated from the desalination chamber by changing the potential difference between the current collectors charged species constantly migrate to the flow electrode chambers in scc fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2017 the periodic replacement of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes generates the concentrate stream doornbusch et al 2016 song et al 2019 the introduction of the membrane stack configuration results in ongoing production of a clear brine stream scheme 2 assuming that water transport across the membranes is insignificant in short term experiments and that the desalination performance is relatively stable we can roughly estimate wr in scc fcdi via the following equation eq 5 5 w r q d t q d t δ v e l e δ v b r where σ δv ele δv br is the total volume of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes and brine replaced with fresh solutions at time t in this study it was initially proposed that only the brine 40 ml was replaced at predetermined intervals every 3600 s with the remaining ions accumulating in the electrolyte of the flow electrode to evaluate the ideal fcdi performance after 20 or 10 cycles we therefore prepared flow electrodes with elevated electrolyte concentrations i e 20 g l 1 note that this approach is aimed at avoiding the influence of water transfer across the ion exchange membranes in semi continuous operation water transfer due to the hydrostatic mechanism osmosis electro osmosis and water molecules embedded around the hydrated ions is inevitable song et al 2019 yang et al 2017 this water input can dilute the flow electrodes and consequently result in a deterioration in process efficiency non ideal semi continuous operation of the dual pairs scc fcdi is examined further in section 3 3 with consideration given to the concomitant water transfer dual pair fcdi performance at wr of 73 0 and 84 3 is compared in fig 3 as an example with the influent flow rates q fixed at 0 11 and 0 22 l h 1 respectively 1x stands for the first cycle with the electrolyte concentration of the flow electrode 1000 mg l 1 nacl while 20x or 10x represents the 20th or 10th cycle at i 9 1 or 18 2 a m 2 respectively with an electrolyte concentration 20 g l 1 nacl note that the high resistance due to the low conductivity in the desalination chamber under these conditions results in high cell voltages while faradaic reactions are expected to occur the impact on current efficiency was minimal fig 1c likely because i the charged particles were immediately mixed in the shared reservoir and or ii the generated h oh if any may have contributed to ion migration and charge balance in the electrolyte it can be seen from fig 3a that provided that ion concentrations in the flow electrodes increase during electrosorption from 1x to 20x u cell decrease at both wr yang et al 2016a have found that a moderate amount of ions in the flow electrode is conducive to shortening the diffusion path in the intrapores of activated carbon by increasing the current density and flow rate similar desalination efficiency δ c can be achieved at a higher wr fig 3b though the current efficiency decreased at 20x compared to 1x mass balance calculations in fig 3c show that uniform ion fluxes across the membranes are expected with this result likely ascribed to the even flow distribution between different desalination chambers we therefore calculated the minimum specific energy se min kwh m 3 required for desalination as a function of c in c out and wr hemmatifar et al 2018 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2018 eq 6 6 s e min 2 r t c i n w r ln c b r c i n c o u t ln c b r c o u t where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t the absolute temperature 293 k in this study the volumetric energy consumption e v in unit of kwh m 3 can be estimated according to the metric relationship hawks et al 2019 shown in eq 3 i e e v δ c enrs as such the energy efficiency η can be defined via division of se min by e v η se min e v the performance metrics of our dual pair fcdi with different icc and scc fcdi systems documented elsewhere doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2019 are summarized in fig 4 in these cases the composition of the flow electrode suspension e g carbon content around 10 wt with particle sizes of 10 100 μm the module design e g flow channel thicknesses and spacer thicknesses and salt rejection rates δ c were comparable table s1 note that the comparison also includes results from the same fcdi systems but operated under different modes table s2 it can be seen from fig 4a that for comparable cell configurations scc fcdi generally possesses better desalting performance than icc fcdi i e similar concentration reduction at higher asrr and enrs an electrical recovery rate up to 20 has been implied in icc fcdi jeon et al 2014 ma et al 2019a potentially rendering the desalination process more competitive though qin et al 2019 reported that the implementation of energy recovery in improving cdi performance might be marginal as such the continuous regeneration of the adsorption capacity in scc mode would appear to be more viable for energy efficient operation of fcdi as shown in fig 4b similar η 2 7 5 1 are achievable in the dual pairs system but at significantly higher productivity even when the productivity p a was normalized to individual components in the dual pairs fcdi the performance is still considerably better fig s9 note that the aforementioned efficiencies i e diamonds and semi filled diamonds in fig 4 were calculated based on the 1st cycle 1x results for example shown in fig 3 in ongoing desalination with regard to the elevated salt concentrations in the flow electrodes that can be regarded as an increase in c br eq 6 it is to be expected that η increase further 7 8 25 0 see semi filled squares in fig 4b and section s1 and table s3 3 3 semi continuous operation of the dual pairs fcdi system according to the preliminary results from fig 3a the dual pairs fcdi system can be operated with the electrolyte of the flow electrode containing high salt concentrations 20 g nacl l 1 therefore by regular replacement of the brine stable desalination efficiency has been achieved in semi continuous operation fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5a that the cell voltage varies between 1 0 and 1 4 v with the effluent salt concentration initially decreased to 450 mg l 1 followed by a gradual increase to 480 mg l 1 after 19 h while the 40 ml brine solution was replenished every 4 h with the concentration repeatedly going up from 1 to 11 g l 1 nacl it was found that the volume changed likely as a result of water transport across the ion exchange membrane although it has been documented that this phenomenon can be ascribed to the hydrostatic water transfer induced by the difference in velocities of flows holt et al 1981 this may not be the case in view of the low water permeability of aem type ii cem type ii ion exchange membranes yang et al 2017 our preliminary results indicate a water transport rate of 3 0 10 8 m s 1 at i 9 1 a m 2 compared to 1 0 10 7 m s 1 at i 18 2 a m 2 in this study therefore the fluid transport that occurs is more likely due to a combination of electro osmosis and water embedded in the hydration shell around the ions to avoid undesirable dilution of the carbon content in flow electrodes 7 ml of the electrolyte was removed from the flow electrode every 8 h taking the water transport into consideration the calculated brine concentrations based on mass balance were in good agreement with the measured results fig 5b since the time varying salt concentrations in the flow electrode and the brine were not the same wr and η in the four stages i e the operating cycle before the brine was replenished table s4 were calculated according to the protocol described in section s1 it can be seen from fig 4b that high η 13 8 20 2 has been achieved in the semi continuous system at better than acceptable productivity i e p a 147 3 l m 2 h 1 and δ c 8 8 9 3 mm with the process operated at high wr 97 competitive with most desalination technologies gendel et al 2014 hawks et al 2019 ramachandran et al 2019 moreover in regard to the much lower electrical efficiency when a carbon free flow electrode i e essentially an electrodialysis process was used for desalination fig s10 it can be concluded that the presence of carbon materials in the flow electrodes of the dual pairs fcdi system plays an important role in high productivity energy efficient desalination of brackish water 4 conclusions results of this study clearly show that use of a membrane stack configuration is a viable means of increasing the productivity of fcdi whilst sustaining its high desalination efficiency and low electrical cost by comparison of standardised metrics including asrr enrs and p a it has been found that the fcdi system with two pairs of ion exchange membranes provides the highest efficiency with further insertion of membranes resulting in a deterioration of the current efficiency compared to previous studies of icc and scc fcdi the dual pairs system is capable of desalting the brackish influent to potable levels 150 mg l 1 but at higher asrr and enrs and higher p a the results of this study provide proof of concept that semi continuous desalination can be achieved in fcdi at reasonable η 13 8 20 2 and productivity 100 l m 2 h 1 though further attention should be given to reducing the extent of water transport across the ion exchange membranes this phenomenon results in dilution of the carbon contents in the flow electrodes with a concomitant decrease in process performance in addition to the need for functionalized carbon materials that have high capacitance and ease of separation from the electrolyte results of this study highlight the need for development and use of dense ion exchange membranes of reasonable conductivity for optimal implementation of fcdi declaration of

1 keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization membrane stack energy efficiency productivity 1 introduction global water demand is projected to rise by 55 over the next 50 years and in view of the limited supply of surface waters and near surface groundwaters of suitable quality pierce 2017 there has been increasing interest in exploiting the huge volumes of waters that are available but are too brackish and or otherwise degraded for domestic and agricultural uses cath et al 2010 pan et al 2017 porada et al 2013 while the state of the art process of reverse osmosis ro is widely used for seawater desalination it may be inappropriate for the treatment of brackish waters in view of its low energy efficiency when desalting dilute streams with salinities in the range of 2 5 g l 1 fritzmann et al 2007 greenlee et al 2009 therefore a number of innovative technologies specifically aimed at brackish water desalination have been developed with the method of capacitive deionization cdi otherwise known as electrosorption gaining in popularity ma et al 2019b oyarzun et al 2018 su et al 2018 suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is one of the recent variants of cdi he et al 2018 jeon et al 2013 rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2016b although the underpinning mechanism relating to salt removal in fcdi is similar to that of cdi i e ion migration in an electrical field followed by immobilisation in the electrical double layers edls of the oppositely charged electrode ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 so called short circuited closed cycle scc operation of the flow electrodes enables continuous regeneration of the charged carbon materials with the released salt enriched in the electrolytes of the flow electrodes the scc fcdi thus provides the possibility of i pseudo infinite electrosorption at low energy cost ii individual management of the desalted water and the brine and iii extremely high flow efficiency doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 one of our recent studies indicated that fcdi is capable of removing uncharged species in this case ca2 uo2 2 co3 3 aq from brackish streams as there is equilibrium with the homologous anion ca uo2 2 co3 3 2 ma et al 2019b in addition the combination of fcdi with other processes enables the partitioning of the charged and uncharged species and the recovery of valuable products such as ammonia from waste streams linnartz et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b despite the merits mentioned above critical concerns relating to the practical application of fcdi remain for example the planar size of most fcdi cells is limited to centimeters by centimeters with the productivity limited to only liters per hour hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018 yang et al 2016b pioneered a stack design of five unit cells with results showing that the flow electrodes could be uniformly segmented from the manifold into individual channels at no extra pressure loss yang et al 2016b a highly scalable 3d fcdi unit with 1 3 channels has subsequently been proposed by use of honeycomb shaped porous cordierite mg2al4si5o18 scaffolds with the inner walls alternatively coated with anion and cation exchange membranes cho et al 2017 by increasing the porosity and permeability of the scaffolds the honeycomb shaped design can be made more compact with the membrane spacer assembly with 1 2 channels serving as the brackish water channels choo et al 2019 compared to the progress in enlarging the dimensions of flow electrodes to scale up the capacity there has been surprisingly limited investigation of the membrane stack in fcdi rommerskirchen et al 2015 although such configurations of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes have been widely used in comparable electrochemical processes to increase the productivity valero et al 2011 as for scc fcdi one may expect that the membrane stack configuration would not only improve the salt removal capacity but also alleviate the accumulation of ions in the flow electrodes scheme 1 these advantages may significantly reduce the operating cost because less regular replacement of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes would be required on the other hand it is recognized that capacitive sorption plays an important role in ion transfer in flow electrode technologies with increased electro sorption of ions at high carbon contents hatzell et al 2017 ma et al 2018 because there is no carbon flowing between the membrane stack scheme 1 an increase in the number of membrane pairs may result in a reduction in fcdi performance with ion transport more related to electrodialysis than electrosorption in this study we systematically investigate the impacts of alternate membrane stack configurations on salt removal and energy consumption in scc fcdi while suss et al 2015 and hawks et al 2019 have proposed standardised metrics to compare the performance of different cdi configurations it should be noted that parameters such as average salt adsorption rate and maximum salt adsorption capacity may be not applicable to fcdi because of i the contribution of ion transfer removal within the spacers in the inner parts of the membrane stack and ii the continuous regeneration of electrode capacitance in scc mode ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 yang et al 2017 as such we compare the performance of the fcdi membrane stack with alternate designs using a range of metrics including average salt removal rate asrr energy normalized removed salt enrs and water recovery wr results of this study are expected to provide insight into possible approaches to scaling up fcdi such that energy efficient water desalination can be achieved 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent grade from sigma aldrich and used without further purification the artificial brackish water and electrolyte in the flow electrodes were prepared by using 18 2 mω cm

percentage of carbon materials in the flow electrodes was 10 wt in all experiments to ensure the surface of the carbon was well wetted all flow electrodes were continually mixed on a magnetic stirrer

ion exchange membranes were assembled in a similar manner to that of an electrodialysis stack strathmann 2010 polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates were used to hold all components together the flow anode and cathode chambers were located on the alternate sides of the outer anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem respectively scheme 1 with the channels fabricated by computerized numerical control cnc milling of the graphite current collectors note that the anode is considered to be the electrode and or current collector that was positively charged during the charging process while the cathode is the electrode and or current collector that was negatively charged during the charging process each serpentine channel in rectangular profile 2 mm 2 mm with 570 mm in total length was carved on the graphite plates and covered by the aem and cem to form the anode and cathode chambers the contact area between the current collectors and each membrane a was 22 0 cm2 with an effective contact area between the flow channels and each membrane a eff of 11 9 cm2 all experiments were conducted in single pass scc mode with brackish water initially containing 1000 mg l 1 nacl

documented the internal recirculation flow rates of the brine stream and flow electrodes were fixed at 2 4 l h 1 in order to evaluate the performance of the membrane stacked fcdi in semi continuous operation the dual pairs n 2 system was tested with brackish water containing 1000 mg l 1 nacl constantly running through the spacers at q 0 32 l h 1 and i 18 2 a m 2 for over 18 h the brine see scheme 2b was replaced with a fresh solution i e v br 40 ml and salt concentration c br 1 g l 1 nacl every 4 h the scc flow electrodes 40 g were initially prepared using 1 g l 1 nacl solution according to the change of the flow electrode volume a water transport rate dv ele 2a eff dt of 1 0 10 7 m s 1 was obtained in regard to dilution of the flow electrodes and deterioration in desalination efficiency that results from undesirable water transport through the ion exchange membranes 7 ml of the electrolyte was removed from the flow electrodes every 8 h to maintain the concentration of carbon materials 2 3 operating conditions and calculations the productivity of the fcdi system p a l m 2 h 1 p v m3 m 3 h 1 normalized to the cross sectional area a see fig s1 or the

i i a 9 1 or 18 2 a m 2 was applied to the cell using a dc power supply mp3094 powertech note that similar to studies using graphite current collectors and flow channels nativ et al 2017 porada et al 2014 yang et al 2016a the current density in all studies described here was expressed in units of cross sectional area i e the contact area between the current collectors and each membrane a in contrast this index was normalized to the effective contact area between the flow channels and each membrane a eff when composite current collectors were used ma et al 2018 2019b song et al 2019 because the acrylic sheets used in these studies were non conductive the current i 20 or 40 ma through and voltage u cell across the fcdi electrodes were recorded using vernier current and voltage probes connected to the sensordaq in regards to the ion removal within the spacers in the inner parts of the membrane stack and the fact that there is no energy recovery step in scc mode average salt removal rate asrr μg cm 2 s 1 or μmol cm 2 min 1 energy normalized removed salt enrs μmol j 1 and overall current efficiency cetot were determined as follows hawks et al 2019 suss et al 2015 eqs 2 4 2

the influent and effluent salt concentrations with δ c c in c out in constant current mode while asrr has been widely reported in units of a eff because of ion transport occurring over the contact area between the flow electrodes and membranes the cross sectional area was used in this study for a fair comparison of systems with different pairs of membranes as aforementioned hawks et al 2019 the molar parameter asrr can be connected to the volumetric indicator p a when δ c is specified eq 2 n a is avogadro s number 6 02 1023 and e is the charge of each ion i e 1 60 10 19 c in this study in eq 4 cetot indicates the total ion transfer efficiency in the electrical field and that in individual desalination chambers can be determined by ce cetot n 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane stack configuration in fcdi time course results of the cell voltages and desalination performance of fcdi with different pairs of membranes are illustrated in figs s2 s4 specifically when n 1 or 2 the cell voltages decreased during the experiments this finding is to be expected since it has been reported that the increase in the conductivity of the flow electrode and the brine on continued operation of the fcdi system is conducive to reducing the circuit internal resistance he et al 2018 song et al 2019 yang et al 2016a however with another pair of membranes n 3 inserted a constant increase in cell voltage was observed during desalination fig s4a results shown in fig s5 indicate that this increase is relatively independent of operating conditions such as current densities and influent flow rate moreover stable desalination performance has been achieved in all experiments when two or three pairs of membranes are used a portion i e n 1 n of the ions removed in scc mode accumulate in the brine stream figs s3b and s4b changes of asrr corresponding u cell and current efficiencies as a function of n are shown in fig 1 while the variation of influent flow rate q resulting in changes in δ c has minimal effect on asrr provided that i is fixed fig 1a a higher desalination efficiency e g δ c 14 5 mm compared to that ranging 4 10 mm inevitably resulted in increased concentration polarization at the membrane interface against the spacer and as a result an increase in cell voltage in constant current mode fig 1b with the cross sectional area a specified asrr 2 3 μg cm 2 s 1 at i 18 2 a m 2 of fcdi with two pairs of membranes was roughly two times that of n 1 fig 1a though the difference would be marginal when normalization is performed with regard to the total membrane areas note that the desalting rate did not increase further on increasing n to 3 likewise the total current efficiency cetot for n 2 was significantly higher than n 1 with the specific current efficiencies ce being around 100 fig 1c in contrast only 62 of the input charge in fcdi with three pairs of membranes contributed to ion transport with δ c fig s4b substantially lower than those for n 1 and 2 figs s2b and s3b under comparable operating conditions as such cetot and asrr for n 3 were even lower than n 2 to elucidate the desalination energy efficiency in different fcdi systems we plot the concentration reduction δ c in relation to the removal rate as described by asrr and electrical consumption as described by enrs in fig 2 in accordance with the resistive models developed by hawks et al 2018 and wang and lin 2018 for cdi assessment results in fig 2 show that on increasing the applied i resulting in a higher asrr lower salt rejection for example by increasing the influent flow rate would be required to maintain the same enrs likewise decreasing δ c at the same asrr results in improvement in enrs although no energy recovery process rommerskirchen et al 2018 was included in our scc fcdi scheme 2 its performance for example δ c 14 7 mm at asrr 0 52 μg cm 2 s 1 and enrs 7 4 μmol j 1 was comparable with cdi in which complete energy recovery and reuse η 1 from the external circuit hawks et al 2018 2019 was assumed with the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas similar to enrs normalized to the net energy input i e the total energy subtracted by the energy recovered in regard to the changed contribution of different resistances and thus potentials in the scc fcdi the high efficacy can partially be explained by the modified donnan model liu et al 2018 porada et al 2013 the excess salt adsorption γ in relation to δ c is associated with both the effective micropore volume p mi ρ e 1 and the non dimensional donnan potential within the micropores δφ d previous studies have shown that charge neutralization and ion release can be passively achieved in scc fcdi ma et al 2019b song et al 2019 with the relatively low micropore concentrations expected to lead to minimal specific electrical consumption in the edls and higher enrs and asrr compared to icc fcdi under similar conditions in the dual pair fcdi fig 2b similar desalination performance δ c can be achieved at higher separation rate i e higher asrr and lower energy consumption i e higher enrs compared to the single pair system n 1 fig 2a these findings are in good agreement with the increased cetot and approximately 100 ce in each chamber fig 1c with these results indicating that there were few faradaic losses to compare with the electrodialysis technology the energy demand of scc fcdi in 0 16 0 38 wh g 1 salt removed at δ c 7 0 9 0 mm and asrr 1 1 2 3 μg cm 2 s 1 is competitive fig s6 in contrast at n 3 although the productivity of the system went up fig s7 the energy efficiency of the desalination process was compromised potentially as a result of the dominance of the electrolysis process in ion transport our preliminary results have shown that the presence of carbon materials in the flow electrodes can significantly alleviate the formation of concentration polarization that results from the different ion transfer rates in the ion exchange membranes and the bulk solution fig s8 however with n increasing one can expect that the benefits would gradually decrease leading to elevated energy consumption for instance enrs 13 8 μmol j 1 was only half that 29 1 μmol j 1 at n 2 under similar conditions δ c 6 7 mm and asrr 1 1 μg cm 2 s 1 the energy demand in unit of wh g 1 salt removed was increased to 0 34 0 46 wh g 1 we therefore conclude that the dual pairs membrane stack configuration is optimum for scaling up fcdi system 3 2 comparison of different fcdi systems using standardised metrics water recovery wr is one of the benchmarks for fair comparison of different cdi systems hawks et al 2019 in contrast to isolated closed cycle icc operation of fcdi in which the desalted and brine streams are alternatively generated from the desalination chamber by changing the potential difference between the current collectors charged species constantly migrate to the flow electrode chambers in scc fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2017 the periodic replacement of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes generates the concentrate stream doornbusch et al 2016 song et al 2019 the introduction of the membrane stack configuration results in ongoing production of a clear brine stream scheme 2 assuming that water transport across the membranes is insignificant in short term experiments and that the desalination performance is relatively stable we can roughly estimate wr in scc fcdi via the following equation eq 5 5 w r q d t q d t δ v e l e δ v b r where σ δv ele δv br is the total volume of the electrolyte of the flow electrodes and brine replaced with fresh solutions at time t in this study it was initially proposed that only the brine 40 ml was replaced at predetermined intervals every 3600 s with the remaining ions accumulating in the electrolyte of the flow electrode to evaluate the ideal fcdi performance after 20 or 10 cycles we therefore prepared flow electrodes with elevated electrolyte concentrations i e 20 g l 1 note that this approach is aimed at avoiding the influence of water transfer across the ion exchange membranes in semi continuous operation water transfer due to the hydrostatic mechanism osmosis electro osmosis and water molecules embedded around the hydrated ions is inevitable song et al 2019 yang et al 2017 this water input can dilute the flow electrodes and consequently result in a deterioration in process efficiency non ideal semi continuous operation of the dual pairs scc fcdi is examined further in section 3 3 with consideration given to the concomitant water transfer dual pair fcdi performance at wr of 73 0 and 84 3 is compared in fig 3 as an example with the influent flow rates q fixed at 0 11 and 0 22 l h 1 respectively 1x stands for the first cycle with the electrolyte concentration of the flow electrode 1000 mg l 1 nacl while 20x or 10x represents the 20th or 10th cycle at i 9 1 or 18 2 a m 2 respectively with an electrolyte concentration 20 g l 1 nacl note that the high resistance due to the low conductivity in the desalination chamber under these conditions results in high cell voltages while faradaic reactions are expected to occur the impact on current efficiency was minimal fig 1c likely because i the charged particles were immediately mixed in the shared reservoir and or ii the generated h oh if any may have contributed to ion migration and charge balance in the electrolyte it can be seen from fig 3a that provided that ion concentrations in the flow electrodes increase during electrosorption from 1x to 20x u cell decrease at both wr yang et al 2016a have found that a moderate amount of ions in the flow electrode is conducive to shortening the diffusion path in the intrapores of activated carbon by increasing the current density and flow rate similar desalination efficiency δ c can be achieved at a higher wr fig 3b though the current efficiency decreased at 20x compared to 1x mass balance calculations in fig 3c show that uniform ion fluxes across the membranes are expected with this result likely ascribed to the even flow distribution between different desalination chambers we therefore calculated the minimum specific energy se min kwh m 3 required for desalination as a function of c in c out and wr hemmatifar et al 2018 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2018 eq 6 6 s e min 2 r t c i n w r ln c b r c i n c o u t ln c b r c o u t where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t the absolute temperature 293 k in this study the volumetric energy consumption e v in unit of kwh m 3 can be estimated according to the metric relationship hawks et al 2019 shown in eq 3 i e e v δ c enrs as such the energy efficiency η can be defined via division of se min by e v η se min e v the performance metrics of our dual pair fcdi with different icc and scc fcdi systems documented elsewhere doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2019 are summarized in fig 4 in these cases the composition of the flow electrode suspension e g carbon content around 10 wt with particle sizes of 10 100 μm the module design e g flow channel thicknesses and spacer thicknesses and salt rejection rates δ c were comparable table s1 note that the comparison also includes results from the same fcdi systems but operated under different modes table s2 it can be seen from fig 4a that for comparable cell configurations scc fcdi generally possesses better desalting performance than icc fcdi i e similar concentration reduction at higher asrr and enrs an electrical recovery rate up to 20 has been implied in icc fcdi jeon et al 2014 ma et al 2019a potentially rendering the desalination process more competitive though qin et al 2019 reported that the implementation of energy recovery in improving cdi performance might be marginal as such the continuous regeneration of the adsorption capacity in scc mode would appear to be more viable for energy efficient operation of fcdi as shown in fig 4b similar η 2 7 5 1 are achievable in the dual pairs system but at significantly higher productivity even when the productivity p a was normalized to individual components in the dual pairs fcdi the performance is still considerably better fig s9 note that the aforementioned efficiencies i e diamonds and semi filled diamonds in fig 4 were calculated based on the 1st cycle 1x results for example shown in fig 3 in ongoing desalination with regard to the elevated salt concentrations in the flow electrodes that can be regarded as an increase in c br eq 6 it is to be expected that η increase further 7 8 25 0 see semi filled squares in fig 4b and section s1 and table s3 3 3 semi continuous operation of the dual pairs fcdi system according to the preliminary results from fig 3a the dual pairs fcdi system can be operated with the electrolyte of the flow electrode containing high salt concentrations 20 g nacl l 1 therefore by regular replacement of the brine stable desalination efficiency has been achieved in semi continuous operation fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5a that the cell voltage varies between 1 0 and 1 4 v with the effluent salt concentration initially decreased to 450 mg l 1 followed by a gradual increase to 480 mg l 1 after 19 h while the 40 ml brine solution was replenished every 4 h with the concentration repeatedly going up from 1 to 11 g l 1 nacl it was found that the volume changed likely as a result of water transport across the ion exchange membrane although it has been documented that this phenomenon can be ascribed to the hydrostatic water transfer induced by the difference in velocities of flows holt et al 1981 this may not be the case in view of the low water permeability of aem type ii cem type ii ion exchange membranes yang et al 2017 our preliminary results indicate a water transport rate of 3 0 10 8 m s 1 at i 9 1 a m 2 compared to 1 0 10 7 m s 1 at i 18 2 a m 2 in this study therefore the fluid transport that occurs is more likely due to a combination of electro osmosis and water embedded in the hydration shell around the ions to avoid undesirable dilution of the carbon content in flow electrodes 7 ml of the electrolyte was removed from the flow electrode every 8 h taking the water transport into consideration the calculated brine concentrations based on mass balance were in good agreement with the measured results fig 5b since the time varying salt concentrations in the flow electrode and the brine were not the same wr and η in the four stages i e the operating cycle before the brine was replenished table s4 were calculated according to the protocol described in section s1 it can be seen from fig 4b that high η 13 8 20 2 has been achieved in the semi continuous system at better than acceptable productivity i e p a 147 3 l m 2 h 1 and δ c 8 8 9 3 mm with the process operated at high wr 97 competitive with most desalination technologies gendel et al 2014 hawks et al 2019 ramachandran et al 2019 moreover in regard to the much lower electrical efficiency when a carbon free flow electrode i e essentially an electrodialysis process was used for desalination fig s10 it can be concluded that the presence of carbon materials in the flow electrodes of the dual pairs fcdi system plays an important role in high productivity energy efficient desalination of brackish water 4 conclusions results of this study clearly show that use of a membrane stack configuration is a viable means of increasing the productivity of fcdi whilst sustaining its high desalination efficiency and low electrical cost by comparison of standardised metrics including asrr enrs and p a it has been found that the fcdi system with two pairs of ion exchange membranes provides the highest efficiency with further insertion of membranes resulting in a deterioration of the current efficiency compared to previous studies of icc and scc fcdi the dual pairs system is capable of desalting the brackish influent to potable levels 150 mg l 1 but at higher asrr and enrs and higher p a the results of this study provide proof of concept that semi continuous desalination can be achieved in fcdi at reasonable η 13 8 20 2 and productivity 100 l m 2 h 1 though further attention should be given to reducing the extent of water transport across the ion exchange membranes this phenomenon results in dilution of the carbon contents in the flow electrodes with a concomitant decrease in process performance in addition to the need for functionalized carbon materials that have high capacitance and ease of separation from the electrolyte results of this study highlight the need for development and use of dense ion exchange membranes of reasonable conductivity for optimal implementation of fcdi declaration of

18421,consumption of drinking water containing arsenic at concentrations even below the world health organization provisional limit of 10 μg l can still lead to unacceptable health risks consequently the drinking water sector in the netherlands has recently agreed to target 1 μg l of arsenic in treated water unfortunately in many poor arsenic affected countries the costs and complexity of current methods that can achieve 1 μg l are prohibitive which highlights the need for innovative methods that can remove arsenic to 1 μg l without costly support infrastructure and complicated supply chains in this work we used fe 0 electrolysis a low cost and scalable technology that is also known as fe 0 electrocoagulation ec to achieve 1 μg l residual dissolved arsenic we compared the arsenic removal performance of green rust gr ferric oxyhydr oxides fe iii oxides and magnetite mag generated by ec at different ph 7 5 and 9 in the presence of as iii or as v initial concentrations of 200 11 000 μg l although gr and fe iii oxides removed up to 99 of initial arsenic neither fe phase could reliably meet the 1 μg l target at both ph values in contrast ec generated mag consistently achieved 1 μg l regardless of the initial as v concentration and ph only solutions with initial as iii concentrations 2200 μg l resulted in residual arsenic 1 μg l as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy showed that mag also sorbed arsenic in a unique mode consistent with partial arsenic incorporation near the particle surface this sorption mode contrasts with the binuclear corner sharing surface complex for gr and fe iii oxides which could explain the difference in arsenic removal efficiency among the three fe phases our results suggest that ec generated mag is an attractive method for achieving 1 μg l

comparisons between water treatment innovation and arsenic related health impacts the drinking water sector in the netherlands has recently agreed to target arsenic concentrations at 1 μg l van der wens et al 2016 ahmad et al 2019 while many other countries suffer from geogenic arsenic contamination the costs and complexity of current methods to achieve 1 μg l prohibit targeting similarly low

initial product of fe 0 electrolysis is fe ii lakshmanan et al 2009 mixed valent fe ii iii hydr oxides such as magnetite mag and green rust gr can form when fe ii fluxes are high enough to prevent complete fe ii oxidation van genuchten et al 2018 the controlled production of fe ii iii hydr oxides by fe 0 ec could lead to significant improvements in arsenic removal performance partly because of the potential for unique arsenic uptake modes by these minerals wang et al 2010 2011 for example arsenite as iii and arsenate as v have been proposed to substitute for tetrahedral feo4 in the mag structure wang et al 2008 2011 2014 this uptake mechanism differs from the typical binuclear corner sharing arsenic adsorption complex detected for fe iii oxyhydr oxides waychunas et al 1993 however the relationship between the arsenic complex and the ability to decrease aqueous arsenic to 1 μg l has not been investigated in addition to the mode of arsenic uptake the efficiency of arsenic removal by fe 0 ec is expected to depend on a variety of factors including the rate of fe ii production the initial arsenic oxidation state and solution ph the fe ii production rate is an important parameter for fe 0 ec treatment because it controls the type of fe phase that forms i e fe ii iii vs fe iii precipitates van genuchten et al 2018 it can also impact the extent of as iii oxidation by altering the dynamics of reactive oxidants li et al 2012 i e the reaction of fe ii with o2 generates oxidants fe iv that can oxidize as iii but these oxidants can also be quenched by residual fe ii hug and leupin 2003 because the sorption affinity of negatively charged as v for fe oxyhydr oxide surfaces is orders of magnitude higher than as iii roberts et al 2004 arsenic removal benefits from effective as iii oxidation however as v sorption to fe precipitates depends strongly on ph decreasing as ph increases above the point of zero charge of the mineral which contrasts the low ph dependence of as iii uptake dixit and hering 2003 since several co occurring processes can impact the arsenic removal efficiency a complete understanding of the potential of fe 0 ec to achieve 1 μg l aqueous arsenic requires investigating a range of parameters including the initial concentration of as v and as iii solution ph and the identity of the fe phase as controlled by the fe ii production rate in this work we compare the arsenic removal performance of gr mag and fe iii precipitates generated by fe 0 ec with the purpose of achieving the target of 1 μg l residual arsenic arsenic removal experiments were performed at ph 7 5 and 9 in solutions with 200 to 11 000 μg l initial as v or as iii which spans the range of typical geogenic arsenic levels bgs 2001 the experiments were combined with characterization of the oxidation state and local bonding environment of sorbed arsenic by x ray absorption spectroscopy xas these results are essential to design the most efficient fe 0 ec system that meets low target levels of residual arsenic while considering important secondary criteria such as electricity consumption arsenic remobilization from the solids and ease of particle separation from treated water 2 methods 2 1 arsenic removal experiment using fe 0 ec for the arsenic removal experiments we followed the synthesis procedures for gr fe iii precipitates and mag by fe 0 ec reported in our previous work van genuchten et al 2018 experiments were performed in teflon reactors using 200 ml electrolyte solutions at room temperature open to the atmosphere the ec cell consisted of fe 0 electrodes with 10 cm2 submerged surface area spaced 1 cm apart the solution compositions were similar to those previously reported van genuchten et al 2018 with all solids generated in 10 mm sodium chloride background electrolyte and solutions for gr experiments also containing 2 mm carbonate we used 10 mm nacl as an inert background electrolyte to ensure our solutions had similar ionic strength as groundwater in arsenic affected regions of south asia bgs 2001 we note that orders of magnitude lower chloride concentrations could be used with negligible impact on the efficiency of fe ii production by ec van genuchten et al 2017 the initial as iii or as v concentrations ranged from 200 to 11 000 μg l mixtures of n2 g and air were used to set the initial o2 at 3 0 mg l which was measured with a hach ldo optical probe experiments were performed at ph of 7 5 and 9 0 to cover a typical range of ph for groundwaters contaminated by arsenic bgs 2001 the initial ph was set using dilute hcl or naoh arsenic removal experiments were initiated by applying a galvanostatic current to the fe 0 ec cell a total of 3 mm fe 168 mg fe l 600 c l by faraday s law was generated in each experiment using an iron ii production rate ipr of 300 μm min current of 200 mc s to generate fe ii iii phases and 30 μm min current of 20 mc s to form fe iii precipitates at these iprs the gr and mag experiments required shorter electrolysis time 10 min than the fe iii precipitate experiments 100 min the 3 mm total fe 168 mg fe l generated by ec in our experiments was selected to be consistent with the fe concentration added in existing ec field treatment of arsenic contaminated groundwater in west bengal india amrose et al 2014 müller et al 2019 this 3 mm fe 168 mg fe l corresponds to as fe ratios of 0 1 5 mol during electrolysis ph was adjusted manually where needed to maintain the initial value using dilute hcl or naoh which is not typically performed in field fe 0 ec treatment but was required in our experiments to interpret the impact of ph on our results the do was allowed to drift in response to fe ii addition without active n2 g purging at the end of electrolysis the suspension was immediately transferred to an anaerobic chamber where it was filtered using 0 22 μm filters the separated solution was reserved for measurements of total dissolved arsenic by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry fi hg aas using a perkinelmer aanalyst 800 a detailed description of the fi hg aas measurements is presented in the supplementary data the separated solids were used for characterization by xas filtered solids from selected experiments were also characterized by x ray diffraction xrd the xrd data are presented in the supplementary data finally a series of chemical extractions using naoh and phosphate were performed on the solids from a subset of samples to investigate the potential for arsenic remobilization details in the supplementary data 2 2 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 2 1 data collection arsenic k edge xas data were collected at beam line 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa and the dubble beam line bm 26 of the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf grenoble fr xanes and exafs spectra were recorded for the ec samples and a series of reference samples consisting of

software webb 2005 following standard methods described previously van genuchten et al 2012 the exafs spectra were extracted using k3 weighting and were fourier transformed over the k range from 3 to 12 or 13 å 1 using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 2 2 2 data analysis the percentage of as iii and as v sorbed by ec samples was quantified by linear combination fits lcfs of the as k edge xanes spectra using the sixpack software webb 2005 the reference spectra for as iii and as v adsorbed to gr 2 line ferrihydrite and mag were used in the lcfs the coordination environment of arsenic

are reported in the supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of fe hydr oxide precipitates during fe 0 ec introduction of fe ii by fe 0 electrolysis consumed dissolved oxygen o2 and resulted in the formation of insoluble fe hydr oxides in the presence of dissolved arsenic the production of the various fe phases including gr fe iii precipitates and mag depended on key electro chemical variables in experiments to generate gr the high rate of fe ii addition 300 μm fe ii min was greater than the rate of o2 influx from the atmosphere leading to rapid 5 min o2 depletion during electrolysis the solution turned from beige indicative of fe ii oxidation and fe iii precipitation to dark blue green indicative of gr fig s1 provides macroscopic images of the suspension the xrd of ec generated green rust ec gr formed in the presence and absence of arsenic showed the characteristic bragg peaks of carbonate gr fig s2 including the intense 003 and 006 reflections near 12 and 24 2θ the presence of arsenic during ec gr formation did not shift xrd peak positions but peaks were broadened suggesting decreased crystallinity the formation of fe iii precipitates by fe 0 ec required a lower iron ii production rate of 30 μm fe ii min and a longer electrolysis time of 100 min which did not deplete o2 during electrolysis resulting in complete fe ii oxidation xrd patterns of the orange solids showed peaks for lepidocrocite and broad peaks of poorly ordered fe iii oxyhydr oxides the contribution of broad peaks increased in the presence of arsenic suggesting that arsenic decreased the crystallinity of the ferric precipitates because xrd showed evidence for both lepidocrocite and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates we refer henceforth to these samples as ferric oxyhydr oxides fe iii oxides similar to the ec gr experiments the formation of mag by fe 0 ec required an fe ii production rate of 300 μm fe ii min applied for 10 min which depleted o2 leaving fe ii available for mineral formation peaks in the xrd patterns of the black solids figs s1 and s2 generated in the presence and absence of arsenic were consistent with magnetite including the main 220 400 and 440 peaks at 30 43 and 63 2θ the major peaks were shifted slightly to higher angle in the presence of arsenic and were also broadened especially at as fe solid ratios 1 mol 3 2 arsenic removal as a function of ph and fe phase the concentration of residual aqueous arsenic depended on a number of factors including the initial concentration of as v or as iii the ph and the type of fe phase produced fig 1 when ec gr formed approximately 98 99 removal of arsenic that had been added as as v was achieved with more effective removal at ph 7 5 than ph 9 ec gr decreased the as v concentration to 10 μg l for initial as v 2200 μg l at ph 7 5 and 1100 μg l at ph 9 however ec gr could not meet the 1 μg l target for any initial as v concentration or ph when ec gr was formed with as iii the residual arsenic concentration was higher which is consistent with the lower sorption affinity of as iii for fe hydr oxides than as v in the investigated ph range roberts et al 2004 approximately 67 84 of initial as iii was removed at ph 7 5 with the percentage increasing with decreasing initial as iii concentration fig 1b arsenite removal by ec gr was slightly more effective at ph 9 78 87 than 7 5 in contrast to removal of as v the residual arsenic level exceeded the 10 μg l who provisional limit for all ec gr experiments in as iii solutions when fe iii oxides formed by ec both as v and as iii were more effectively removed than with ec gr at ph 7 5 ec fe iii oxides removed 99 9 of all initial as v only the experiment with the highest initial as v concentration had residual arsenic 1 μg l removal of as v by fe iii oxides was also effective at ph 9 99 9 for each sample but no experiment that produced fe iii oxides at ph 9 achieved the 1 μg l target the enhanced removal over ec gr was most pronounced for experiments in as iii solutions at ph 7 5 ec fe iii oxides removed more than 99 of the initial as iii at all tested concentrations decreasing residual arsenic to near 1 μg l for some samples and below 10 μg l for all but the highest initial as iii concentration 11 000 μg l as fe 5 mol arsenite removal by ec fe iii oxides was less effective at ph 9 than 7 5 leading to residual arsenic concentrations near 10 μg l at ph 9 fig 1 although arsenic removal was effective with fe iii oxides and gr formed by ec ec mag outperformed both in all experiments with initial as v 220 7000 μg l at both ph 7 5 and 9 ec mag achieved 99 9 removal and decreased the residual arsenic level to 1 μg l this outstanding as v removal easily satisfies the who 10 μg l limit and also meets the 1 μg l target the removal of as iii by ec mag was also superior with 99 9 removal of each initial as iii concentration regardless of ph at both ph 7 5 and 9 residual arsenic was 1 μg l for initial as iii 1100 μg l 3 3 arsenic oxidation state by as k edge xanes analysis for ec gr formed with as v the xanes spectra had a smooth absorption edge with a maximum near 11 875 ev matching the peak position from the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr fig 2 a the absence of a shoulder at lower energy indicates that significant as v reduction did not occur consistent with the negligible as iii fraction determined in the xanes lcfs table s1 for ec gr formed with as iii the distinct shoulders in the xanes spectra indicate that as iii was partially oxidized at initial concentrations of 2200 μg l as iii 1 mol as fe the fractions of as iii 68 and as v 33 sorbed by ec gr were similar at both ph 7 5 and 9 table s1 arsenic sorbed by ec fe iii oxides was present almost exclusively as as v regardless of initial as v or as iii concentrations and ph fig 2b table s1 consistent with the ec gr system the xanes spectra showed no evidence for the reduction of as v for ec fe iii oxides generated in 2200 μg l as iii 1 mol as fe at ph 7 5 the xanes lcfs indicated that arsenic was bound primarily as as v 97 this fraction is substantially higher than the 33 as v bound to ec gr produced at equivalent as iii concentrations and ph at the highest initial as iii concentration 11 000 μg l 5 mol as fe and ph 7 5 which are conditions that should favor the lowest fraction of as iii oxidation li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 as v was still the predominant species 86 detected by xanes lcfs the xanes derived oxidation states of arsenic taken up by ec mag matched those of ec gr samples fig 2c table s1 while it has been proposed that as v uptake by magnetite can produce small fractions of as iii huhmann et al 2017 the xanes lcfs did not support the presence of reduced arsenic in ec mag samples table s1 for ec mag formed with as iii the oxidation to as v was effective 70 at ph 7 5 and initial as iii 220 μg l 0 1 mol as fe however at the same ph the fraction of as v bound to ec mag decreased to 13 for initial as iii concentrations of 1100 μg l 0 5 mol as fe the significantly greater uptake of arsenic by ec mag relative to ec gr but similar fractions of surface bound as iii and as v suggests that the enhanced arsenic removal by ec mag is caused by processes beyond as iii oxidation although the positions of the as iii and as v shoulders in the absorption edge of the ec mag samples match those of the as iii and as v adsorption references fig 2c unique post edge features are present in ec mag samples these oscillations which have maxima near 11 880 and 11 892 ev appear in ec mag formed with both as iii or as v but are absent from all other ec samples and the adsorption references these distinct post edge oscillations which have also been observed in the as k edge xanes spectra of magnetite produced by biogenic fe iii reduction in the presence of as iii or as v wang et al 2014 hints at a different coordination environment of arsenic taken up by ec mag relative to the other ec samples 3 4 arsenic coordination environment by as k edge exafs analysis comparison of exafs spectra the exafs spectra of ec gr generated in as v solutions fig 2d are characterized by smooth symmetric oscillations with the exception of the peak near 5 å 1 this asymmetric peak contains a shoulder at lower k which is more pronounced in the reference exafs spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr little difference in the exafs spectra of ec gr formed with as v at increasing as fe loading was observed for ec gr produced in as iii solutions the exafs spectra have lower amplitude than as v samples with flatter more plateaued oscillations near 5 and 7 å 1 compared with the as iii and as v gr adsorption references the flattened oscillations in the ec gr as iii samples likely arise from the combination of exafs signals from sorbed as iii and as v consistent with the xanes analysis the exafs spectra of ec fe iii oxides generated in the presence of as v were similar to those for ec gr fig 2e including the asymmetric peak near 5 å 1 and the smooth oscillations at k 5 å 1 the exafs spectra of the as iii ec fe iii oxide samples matched well with those generated in as v solutions in agreement with the predominance of as v determined in the xanes lcfs regardless of the initial arsenic oxidation state the exafs spectra of ec fe iii oxides strongly resembled the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to ferrihydrite in contrast to the smooth oscillations of the ec gr and ec fe iii oxides exafs spectra pronounced beat features permeated the ec mag exafs spectra fig 2f in particular distinct bumps at 4 1 and 6 9 å 1 appeared in the first major exafs oscillations a shoulder at higher k was also present in the oscillation at 9 5 å 1 which contrasts the symmetric shape of this oscillation in the other ec samples these features were present in all ec mag samples generated with as v and were also evident for ec mag formed with 220 μg l as iii combined with the unique post edge oscillations in the xanes spectra the additional beat features in the ec mag exafs spectra further imply a different arsenic coordination environment than for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides and the as iii and as v adsorption references shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectra for ec gr produced in as v solutions the shell by shell fits resulted in similar first shell as o parameters with coordination numbers cn ranging from 3 7 to 4 0 and interatomic distances r of 1 70 å fig 3 a table 1 table s2 these values are in good agreement with those from fits of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr and are consistent with as o scattering from as v tetrahedra waychunas et al 1993 fits of the second shell peak which arises from as fe atomic pairs were also similar for all ec gr samples formed with as v regardless of ph and solids ratio 0 1 2 mol as fe fits of the second shell peak for these samples yielded cnas fe 1 9 to 2 0 and ras fe 3 40 to 3 43 å compared to the fit of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr cnas fe 3 1 0 9 ras fe 3 38 0 02 å ec gr had a slightly lower second shell cn and longer r the fitting output for the first and second shell peaks of ec fe iii oxides were similar regardless of ph and the concentration and initial oxidation state of arsenic the first shell was fit with an as o path with cnas o 4 1 to 4 6 and ras o 1 70 å table 1 table s2 the second shell was fit with an as fe path with cnas fe 1 7 to 2 3 and ras fe 3 34 to 3 36 å these fitting parameters matched well with those from the fit of as v adsorbed to ferrihydrite cnas o 4 1 0 5 ras o 1 70 0 1 å cnas fe 1 8 1 0 and ras fe 3 29 0 02 å however the second shell ras fe for ec fe iii oxides was slightly longer than for the ferrihydrite adsorption reference which reflects the presence of both lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite in ec fe iii oxides consistent with the xrd the fits of the first as o shell of ec mag samples generated with as v were similar to those for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides yielding cnas o 3 6 to 3 9 and ras fe 1 70 å table 1 table s2 however in contrast to the second shell fits for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides spectra which required only a single as fe path the fit of the ec mag spectra required two as fe paths the parameters returned by the fit for the first as fe path were cnas fe1 5 1 to 7 3 and ras fe1 3 44 to 3 47 å whereas the second as fe path had cnas fe2 2 8 to 5 0 and ras fe2 3 64 to 3 68 å these cn and r values are significantly different than those obtained in fits of the reference spectrum for as v adsorbed to presynthesized mag cnas fe 2 1 0 8 ras fe 3 36 0 02 å and also differ from the ec gr and ec fe iii oxides spectra this indicates a different arsenic uptake mode by ec mag multiple as fe atomic pairs at different spacing were also required in the fit of the spectrum for ec mag generated in 220 μg l as iii for this sample the first shell was fit with cnas o 2 9 0 4 and ras o 1 72 0 1 å this fit derived ras o is consistent with the presence of both as iii and as v determined from the xanes lcfs the second shell of this sample was fit using as fe atomic pairs at ras fe1 3 42 0 04 å and ras fe2 3 61 0 09 table 1 although the fit derived cn for these as fe paths was 3 the comparable ras fe1 and ras fe2 for this sample and the as v samples in the ec mag system was strong evidence for similar arsenic sorption configurations 3 5 modes of arsenic uptake by ec gr ec fe iii oxides and ec mag the shell by shell fits indicate that arsenic binds to both ec gr and ec fe iii oxides primarily in the binuclear corner sharing 2c surface complex fig 3 this conclusion is founded on the fit derived cnas fe 1 9 to 2 0 and ras fe 3 40 to 3 43 å for ec gr spectra and cnas fe 1 7 to 2 3 and ras fe 3 34 to 3 36 å for ec fe iii oxides spectra table 1 table s2 the fitting output is in excellent agreement with previous exafs studies of as v adsorbed to gr co3 jonsson and sherman 2008 and fe iii oxides waychunas et al 1993 and is inconsistent with the formation of distinct as bearing fe ii parasymplesite babechuk et al 2009 or fe iii scorodite kitahama et al 1975 minerals the formation of similar binuclear corner sharing 2c adsorption geometries for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides is supported by the match between the shorter ras fe for ec fe iii oxides 3 34 3 36 å than for ec gr spectra 3 40 3 43 å and the shorter average rfe o 2 01 å and rfe fe 3 05 å for edge sharing feo6 octahedra in fe iii oxyhydr oxides wyckoff 1963 relative to gr rfe o 2 08 å rfe fe 3 18 å trolard et al 2007 although layered double hydroxides such as gr can take up oxyanions as outer sphere complexes in the interlayer ma et al 2017 2018 our data do not support this arsenic uptake mode which would lack the observed as fe atomic pair and most likely change the spacing for the basal plane reflections in xrd therefore arsenic adsorption to ec gr particle edges and ec fe iii oxide surfaces is the most likely uptake mode for these samples in contrast to the fits of ec gr and ec fe iii oxides the fits for ec mag required two sets of as fe atomic pairs at 3 42 to 3 47 å and 3 61 to 3 68 å consistent with arsenic occupying tetrahedral feo4 sites in the magnetite structure wang et al 2011 based on the magnetite crystal structure bragg 1915 arsenic substitution for fe in tetrahedral coordination would result in theoretical ras fe1 and ras fe2 3 45 å and 3 60 å which correspond to arsenic bonding with nearest neighbor feo6 octahedra and nearest neighbor feo4 tetrahedra fig 3d these theoretical ras fe values are in excellent agreement with the fit derived values however the fit derived cnas fe for ec mag samples are lower cnas fe1 7 3 table 1 table s2 than the theoretical cn of arsenic incorporated perfectly into bulk magnetite cnas fe1 inc 12 two scenarios can explain this i the co existence of adsorbed and completely incorporated arsenic and ii the substitution of arsenic for tetrahedral feo4 near the surface of the ec mag particle i e partial incorporation we argue against the first explanation for several reasons first chemical extractions with naoh and phosphate that target adsorbed arsenic only mobilized 12 and 4 of arsenic taken up by ec mag which was significantly less than the 38 and 33 mobilized from ferrihydrite fig s3 shell by shell fits of the extracted and initial ec mag samples yielded similar cnas fe values within fit derived error which is inconsistent with the mobilization of strictly adsorbed arsenic table s3 second extensive incorporation of arsenic in the bulk structure is unlikely because of differences in the charge and size of feo4 fe3 rfe o 1 80 å and aso4 as5 ras o 1 70 å wang et al 2011 which would generate strain and require charge compensation most likely in the form of fe vacancies partial incorporation of arsenic at the outermost part of the particle would be accommodated more easily because of structural relaxation at the surface and easier balancing of charge by surface deprotonation finally the nanoscale particle size of ec mag i e 5 nm diameter crystallites van genuchten et al 2018 gives rise to a high ratio of surface to bulk which facilitates partial arsenic incorporation at the particle exterior therefore we propose that arsenic removal occurs by occupation of tetrahedral feo4 sites near the surface of ec mag fig 3d several possible sorption configurations consistent with our data are presented in fig s4 incomplete as iii oxidation in the ec mag system produces a mixture of partially incorporated as v and adsorbed as iii but from our data partial as iii incorporation cannot be ruled out 3 6 factors influencing residual arsenic during fe hydr oxide formation by ec for experiments in both as iii and as v solutions the residual arsenic concentration decreased in order of ec gr ec fe iii oxides ec mag with ec mag achieving 1 μg l arsenic in all but the highest as iii experiments furthermore the ratio of arsenic partitioning to the solid μg g and liquid μg l phase for the three types of fe oxyhydr oxides increased in the same order ec gr 21 6 l g ec fe iii oxides 466 l g ec mag 16 800 l g for experiments with 1125 μg l 15 μm initial as iii at ph 9 these trends in removal efficiency and affinity for the solid phase can be explained by synthesis conditions structural properties of the solids and differences in the as iii and as v sorption affinity for fe hydr oxide surfaces the modes of arsenic uptake by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides were similar i e binuclear 2c adsorption geometry fig 3 which indicates the more effective removal of arsenic by ec fe iii oxides is not a result of the arsenic coordination geometry the xanes analysis revealed a lower extent of as iii oxidation during formation of ec gr than ec fe iii oxides which is due to the higher fe ii production rate during ec gr experiments the build up of fe ii at high fe ii production rates is required for gr formation but fe ii also competes with as iii for the fenton type oxidants o2 fe iv generated in ec systems li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 less competition between fe ii and as iii for reactive oxidants occurs at the low fe ii production rate required for ec fe iii oxide formation van genuchten et al 2018 which leads to more effective generation of the readily adsorbed as v oxyanion and lower residual arsenic concentration roberts et al 2004 in as v solutions the differences between arsenic removal by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides were less pronounced than in as iii solutions although carbonate competes weakly with arsenic for fe hydr oxide surfaces brechbuhl et al 2012 meng et al 2000 the more effective removal of as v by ec fe iii oxides than ec gr is best explained by differences in the density and type of reactive sorption sites poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates spadini et al 2003 are expected to have higher specific surface and more diverse surface structure than moderately crystalline gr williams and scherer 2001 which has an ordered sheet structure with arsenic sorption sites located primarily on particle edges wang et al 2010 concomitant with the best arsenic removal performance fig 1 the spectra from ec mag also displayed xanes and exafs features consistent with a unique arsenic uptake mode where arsenic substitutes for feo4 tetrahedra near the particle surface this sorption configuration was detected in ec mag produced in both as v and as iii solutions arsenic was removed reliably to 1 μg l when partially incorporated arsenic was detected and in this sorption mode arsenic was mobilized less by naoh and phosphate than when present in the 2c surface complex fig s3 the presence of feo4 tetrahedra is the most likely reason partial arsenic incorporation is favorable in ec mag and not in the other ec samples and this unique arsenic uptake mode explains why ec mag bonds arsenic more easily and removes arsenic more effectively finally the efficiency of arsenic removal by ec mag was not impacted significantly by ph whereas as v removal by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides decreased with increasing ph this likely reflects a transition from net positive to net negative surface charge for gr guilbaud et al 2013 and fe iii oxides spadini et al 2003 as ph increases from 7 5 to 9 leading to less favorable sorption of the as v oxyanion at ph 9 because of electrostatic repulsion in contrast formation of solid solutions partial incorporation of arsenic in ec mag is less likely to depend on ph 3 7 practical considerations for achieving 1 μg l residual arsenic with ec mag treatment of drinking water to low levels 1 μg l of arsenic can reduce the disease burden caused by chronic arsenic exposure in high van halem et al 2009 and low income countries howard et al 2007 the netherlands is currently the only country in the world where the drinking water sector targets 1 μg l which arose from comparing the costs of arsenic related health impacts and water treatment infrastructure ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 van der wens et al 2016 ahmad et al 2019 however the development of innovative technologies that can achieve 1 μg l without major infrastructure renovation can improve this cost benefit analysis to favor lower arsenic targets particularly in countries where improvements to treatment infrastructure are prohibitively costly in this study we have shown that formation of mag by fe 0 electrolysis reliably yields residual arsenic 1 μg l for a wide range of initial conditions whereas ec fe iii oxides and ec gr would require more charge passed i e more electricity and fe consumed and thus more costs to meet 1 μg l if possible at all arsenic removal to 1 μg l is difficult to achieve using other treatment methods such as fecl3 addition without as iii preoxidation hering et al 1996 passive fe 0 corrosion leupin et al 2005 neumann et al 2013 and membrane techniques schmidt et al 2016 in some cases removal to 1 μg l has been reported using adsorption media that require sophisticated synthesis procedures and costly materials chandra et al 2010 luo et al 2012 or by augmenting conventional fecl3 addition by preoxidation with kmno4 ahmad et al 2018 however ec mag formation is a promising alternative because high concentrations of both as v and as iii can be treated to 1 μg l at a range of ph 7 5 9 and it requires only a small input of electricity and small amounts of fe 0 metal which is readily available everywhere and completely non hazardous our experiments were designed to compare the arsenic removal efficiency of ec mag ec gr and ec fe iii oxides using a constant fe dosage 3 mm total fe and systematically varied initial arsenic concentration spanning the range of the worst case scenario geogenic arsenic levels e g bgs 2001 while we show that ec mag outperformed ec fe iii oxides primarily at arsenic levels 500 μg l and at ph 9 it is reasonable to expect that ec mag would similarly outperform ec fe iii oxides at lower initial arsenic levels if the total fe dosage is optimized for example because 3 mm ec mag could remove 1125 μg l initial as iii to 1 μg l at ph 9 which was not possible for ec fe iii oxides fig 1 ec mag would likely require significantly less fe than ec fe iii oxides for full removal of 50 μg l as iii at ph 9 our study sets the foundation for subsequent research to optimize the total ec mag concentration required to achieve 1 μg l for a constant arsenic level which would help to more accurately identify the best fe 0 ec operating conditions for field treatment another important practical consideration for arsenic treatment is the appropriate management of arsenic rich waste that is generated as a by product from all arsenic removal methods e g fecl3 addition membrane filtration fe 0 ec the formation of mag by fe 0 ec is more attractive than the production of fe iii oxides with respect to waste production for several reasons as the chemical formula fe3o4 shows the mass ratio of fe to total solid is higher for mag 0 72 than for fe iii oxides i e ferrihydrite with an approximate chemical formula of fe oh 3 has a fe mass ratio of 0 52 therefore per mol of fe generated by ec the formation of mag theoretically produces 28 less sludge mass 3 mm fe 232 mg fe3o4 l than ferrihydrite 3 mm fe 321 mg fe oh 3 l the most common fe iii precipitate formed in arsenic treatment by fecl3 addition hering et al 1996 also the density of mag 5 3 g cm3 is higher than that of ferrihydrite 3 4 g cm3 because it has less space filling o atoms per fe atom 1 33 o fe for fe3o4 3 o fe for fe oh 3 therefore per mol of fe generated by ec 36 less sludge volume would be generated for mag than for ferrihydrite an additional benefit is the ease of separating ec mag particles from treated water using low strength magnetic fields which would likely facilitate sludge dewatering we also found that arsenic taken up by partial incorporation in the ec mag structure is more resistant to mobilization than when associated with ferrihydrite fig s3 making arsenic exposure less likely during ec mag sludge handling and storage finally mag is one of the highest valued fe oxides having applications across several industries e g electronics catalysis and biotechnology which makes reuse of mag treatment sludge more appealing than ferrihydrite gawande et al 2013 arbab et al 2003 with respect to infrastructure requirements fe 0 ec systems and the production of ec mag in particular also offers a number of benefits relative to conventional treatment methods such as fecl3 addition for example per mass of iron steel is cheaper hot rolled plate steel 800 per ton of fe meps 2018 than the 40 fecl3 solution used in conventional water treatment 1450 per ton of fe alibaba com 2018 transport of the more dense fe 0 metal to the treatment site is also easier and cheaper than the large volumes of acidic fecl3 solution and the treated water does not inherit unnecessary chloride although fe 0 ec systems require electricity energy consumption is comparable or lower than other methods e g reverse osmosis schmidt et al 2016 and it can be provided by sustainable power sources such as photovoltaics and fuel cells finally low cost separation of ec mag particles using a magnetic field would eliminating extra requirements for coagulation or filtration to complete treatment yavuz et al 2006 in summary our results suggest that the formation of ec mag is one of the most attractive methods to achieve 1 μg l residual arsenic because this method provides i exceptional arsenic removal efficiency ii unique arsenic uptake modes and resistance to arsenic mobilization iii lower mass and volume of sludge produced per mol of fe iv magnetic properties that favor particle separation and v higher valued sludge than production of fe iii oxides these benefits favor the reuse of the treatment waste however additional research is necessary before ec mag can be implemented in practice first groundwater contaminated by geogenic arsenic often contains substantial concentrations of phosphate and silicate which can alter the structure of co precipitated fe oxides voegelin et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2014 senn et al 2015 and are well known to compete with arsenic for sorption sites roberts et al 2004 therefore the effect of phosphate and silicate on the arsenic removal efficiency of ec mag needs to be evaluated second the stability and best management practices of the treatment sludge must be determined 4 conclusions for a given coulomb of charge passed or mass of fe produced ec mag was more effective than ec fe iii oxide and ec gr at achieving 1 μg l residual arsenic regardless of the as v or as iii species or ph the exceptional performance of ec mag is attributed in part to the formation of a unique arsenic sorption mode where arsenic substitutes for tetrahedral iron near the mag particle surface while ec fe iii oxides and ec gr removed arsenic effectively 67 99 the production of these solids by ec would likely require significantly higher charge passed and fe added to meet 1 μg l resulting in greater electricity consumption and more solid waste therefore especially in decentralized treatment systems based on fe ii addition such as fe 0 ec magnetite formation is desirable relative to other fe phases for the following reasons i enhanced ability to meet 1 μg l ii more stable arsenic bonding mode that resists mobilization more than standard surface complexes and iii potential for simplified particle separation from treated water by

18421,consumption of drinking water containing arsenic at concentrations even below the world health organization provisional limit of 10 μg l can still lead to unacceptable health risks consequently the drinking water sector in the netherlands has recently agreed to target 1 μg l of arsenic in treated water unfortunately in many poor arsenic affected countries the costs and complexity of current methods that can achieve 1 μg l are prohibitive which highlights the need for innovative methods that can remove arsenic to 1 μg l without costly support infrastructure and complicated supply chains in this work we used fe 0 electrolysis a low cost and scalable technology that is also known as fe 0 electrocoagulation ec to achieve 1 μg l residual dissolved arsenic we compared the arsenic removal performance of green rust gr ferric oxyhydr oxides fe iii oxides and magnetite mag generated by ec at different ph 7 5 and 9 in the presence of as iii or as v initial concentrations of 200 11 000 μg l although gr and fe iii oxides removed up to 99 of initial arsenic neither fe phase could reliably meet the 1 μg l target at both ph values in contrast ec generated mag consistently achieved 1 μg l regardless of the initial as v concentration and ph only solutions with initial as iii concentrations 2200 μg l resulted in residual arsenic 1 μg l as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy showed that mag also sorbed arsenic in a unique mode consistent with partial arsenic incorporation near the particle surface this sorption mode contrasts with the binuclear corner sharing surface complex for gr and fe iii oxides which could explain the difference in arsenic removal efficiency among the three fe phases our results suggest that ec generated mag is an attractive method for achieving 1 μg l

millions of people roy 2008 in the 1990s the world health organization who revised its recommended limit of arsenic in drinking water from 50 μg l to the current provisional limit of 10 μg l world

effects e g excess risk of bladder and kidney cancer saint jacques et al 2018 and diabetes brauner et al 2014 can result from chronic exposure to arsenic at levels 10 μg l motivated by cost comparisons between water treatment innovation and arsenic related health impacts the drinking water sector in the netherlands has recently agreed to target arsenic concentrations at 1 μg l van der wens et al 2016 ahmad et al 2019 while many other countries suffer from geogenic arsenic contamination the costs and complexity of current methods to achieve 1 μg l prohibit targeting similarly low arsenic levels consequently there is a strong need for innovative technologies that can meet the 1 μg l criterion without major costs complex support infrastructure and supply chains the electrolysis of fe 0 metal or steel also known as fe 0 electrocoagulation fe 0 ec is a promising cost effective and scalable arsenic treatment method with proven suitability in a range of arsenic affected communities amrose et al 2014 2015 in ec a low electric current is applied to fe 0 electrodes in contact with a solution containing arsenic electrolysis of fe 0 produces dissolved fe ii at a rate that is controlled by the magnitude of the applied current bard and faulkner 2001 van genuchten et al 2018 the aqueous fe ii is then oxidized by dissolved oxygen o2 to form insoluble fe oxyhydr oxide precipitates lakshmanan et al 2009 li et al 2012 arsenic removal in fe 0 ec systems occurs by sorption to these fe oxyhydr oxides van genuchten et al 2012 while fe 0 ec is gaining acceptance as a robust arsenic treatment method its full potential is not yet known because fe 0 ec is traditionally applied to produce fe iii precipitates kobya et al 2016 kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 since the initial product of fe 0 electrolysis is fe ii lakshmanan et al 2009 mixed valent fe ii iii hydr oxides such as magnetite mag and green rust gr can form when fe ii fluxes are high enough to prevent complete fe ii oxidation van genuchten et al 2018 the controlled production of fe ii iii hydr oxides by fe 0 ec could lead to significant improvements in arsenic removal performance partly because of the potential for unique arsenic uptake modes by these minerals wang et al 2010 2011 for example arsenite as iii and arsenate as v have been proposed to substitute for tetrahedral feo4 in the mag structure wang et al 2008 2011 2014 this uptake mechanism differs from the typical binuclear corner sharing arsenic adsorption complex detected for fe iii oxyhydr oxides waychunas et al 1993 however the relationship between the arsenic complex and the ability to decrease aqueous arsenic to 1 μg l has not been investigated in addition to the mode of arsenic uptake the efficiency of arsenic removal by fe 0 ec is expected to depend on a variety of factors including the rate of fe ii production the initial arsenic oxidation state and solution ph the fe ii production rate is an important parameter for fe 0 ec treatment because it controls the type of fe phase that forms i e fe ii iii vs fe iii precipitates van genuchten et al 2018 it can also impact the extent of as iii oxidation by altering the dynamics of reactive oxidants li et al 2012 i e the reaction of fe ii with o2 generates oxidants fe iv that can oxidize as iii but these oxidants can also be quenched by residual fe ii hug and leupin 2003 because the sorption affinity of negatively charged as v for fe oxyhydr oxide surfaces is orders of magnitude higher than as iii roberts et al 2004 arsenic removal benefits from effective as iii oxidation however as v sorption to fe precipitates depends strongly on ph decreasing as ph increases above the point of zero charge of the mineral which contrasts the low ph dependence of as iii uptake dixit and hering 2003 since several co occurring processes can impact the arsenic removal efficiency a complete understanding of the potential of fe 0 ec to achieve 1 μg l aqueous arsenic requires investigating a range of parameters including the initial concentration of as v and as iii solution ph and the identity of the fe phase as controlled by the fe ii production rate in this work we compare the arsenic removal performance of gr mag and fe iii precipitates generated by fe 0 ec with the purpose of achieving the target of 1 μg l residual arsenic arsenic removal experiments were performed at ph 7 5 and 9 in solutions with 200 to 11 000 μg l initial as v or as iii which spans the range of typical geogenic arsenic levels bgs 2001 the experiments were combined with characterization of the oxidation state and local bonding environment of sorbed arsenic by x ray absorption spectroscopy xas these results are essential to design the most efficient fe 0 ec system that meets low target levels of residual arsenic while considering important secondary criteria such as electricity consumption arsenic remobilization from the solids and ease of particle separation from treated water 2 methods 2 1 arsenic removal experiment using fe 0 ec for the arsenic removal experiments we followed the synthesis procedures for gr fe iii precipitates and mag by fe 0 ec reported in our previous work van genuchten et al 2018 experiments were performed in teflon reactors using 200 ml electrolyte solutions at room temperature open to the atmosphere the ec cell consisted of fe 0 electrodes with 10 cm2 submerged surface area spaced 1 cm apart the solution compositions were similar to those previously reported van genuchten et al 2018 with all solids generated in 10 mm sodium chloride background electrolyte and solutions for gr experiments also containing 2 mm carbonate we used 10 mm nacl as an inert background electrolyte to ensure our solutions had similar ionic strength as groundwater in arsenic affected regions of south asia bgs 2001 we note that orders of magnitude lower chloride concentrations could be used with negligible impact on the efficiency of fe ii production by ec van genuchten et al 2017 the initial as iii or as v concentrations ranged from 200 to 11 000 μg l mixtures of n2 g and air were used to set the initial o2 at 3 0 mg l which was measured with a hach ldo optical probe experiments were performed at ph of 7 5 and 9 0 to cover a typical range of ph for groundwaters contaminated by arsenic bgs 2001 the initial ph was set using dilute hcl or naoh arsenic removal experiments were initiated by applying a galvanostatic current to the fe 0 ec cell a total of 3 mm fe 168 mg fe l 600 c l by faraday s law was generated in each experiment using an iron ii production rate ipr of 300 μm min current of 200 mc s to generate fe ii iii phases and 30 μm min current of 20 mc s to form fe iii precipitates at these iprs the gr and mag experiments required shorter electrolysis time 10 min than the fe iii precipitate experiments 100 min the 3 mm total fe 168 mg fe l generated by ec in our experiments was selected to be consistent with the fe concentration added in existing ec field treatment of arsenic contaminated groundwater in west bengal india amrose et al 2014 müller et al 2019 this 3 mm fe 168 mg fe l corresponds to as fe ratios of 0 1 5 mol during electrolysis ph was adjusted manually where needed to maintain the initial value using dilute hcl or naoh which is not typically performed in field fe 0 ec treatment but was required in our experiments to interpret the impact of ph on our results the do was allowed to drift in response to fe ii addition without active n2 g purging at the end of electrolysis the suspension was immediately transferred to an anaerobic chamber where it was filtered using 0 22 μm filters the separated solution was reserved for measurements of total dissolved arsenic by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry fi hg aas using a perkinelmer aanalyst 800 a detailed description of the fi hg aas measurements is presented in the supplementary data the separated solids were used for characterization by xas filtered solids from selected experiments were also characterized by x ray diffraction xrd the xrd data are presented in the supplementary data finally a series of chemical extractions using naoh and phosphate were performed on the solids from a subset of samples to investigate the potential for arsenic remobilization details in the supplementary data 2 2 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 2 1 data collection arsenic k edge xas data were collected at beam line 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa and the dubble beam line bm 26 of the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf grenoble fr xanes and exafs spectra were recorded for the ec samples and a series of reference samples consisting of as iii or as v adsorbed to presynthesized gr 2 line ferrihydrite and mag details on adsorption experiments in supplementary data spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures 80 k in fluorescence mode to k 13 5 or 14 å 1 an au 0 foil was used to calibrate the beam to 11 919 ev maximum of the first derivative spectra were aligned averaged and background was subtracted using sixpack software webb 2005 following standard methods described previously van genuchten et al 2012 the exafs spectra were extracted using k3 weighting and were fourier transformed over the k range from 3 to 12 or 13 å 1 using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 2 2 2 data analysis the percentage of as iii and as v sorbed by ec samples was quantified by linear combination fits lcfs of the as k edge xanes spectra using the sixpack software webb 2005 the reference spectra for as iii and as v adsorbed to gr 2 line ferrihydrite and mag were used in the lcfs the coordination environment of arsenic

are reported in the supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of fe hydr oxide precipitates during fe 0 ec introduction of fe ii by fe 0 electrolysis consumed dissolved oxygen o2 and resulted in the formation of insoluble fe hydr oxides in the presence of dissolved arsenic the production of the various fe phases including gr fe iii precipitates and mag depended on key electro chemical variables in experiments to generate gr the high rate of fe ii addition 300 μm fe ii min was greater than the rate of o2 influx from the atmosphere leading to rapid 5 min o2 depletion during electrolysis the solution turned from beige indicative of fe ii oxidation and fe iii precipitation to dark blue green indicative of gr fig s1 provides macroscopic images of the suspension the xrd of ec generated green rust ec gr formed in the presence and absence of arsenic showed the characteristic bragg peaks of carbonate gr fig s2 including the intense 003 and 006 reflections near 12 and 24 2θ the presence of arsenic during ec gr formation did not shift xrd peak positions but peaks were broadened suggesting decreased crystallinity the formation of fe iii precipitates by fe 0 ec required a lower iron ii production rate of 30 μm fe ii min and a longer electrolysis time of 100 min which did not deplete o2 during electrolysis resulting in complete fe ii oxidation xrd patterns of the orange solids showed peaks for lepidocrocite and broad peaks of poorly ordered fe iii oxyhydr oxides the contribution of broad peaks increased in the presence of arsenic suggesting that arsenic decreased the crystallinity of the ferric precipitates because xrd showed evidence for both lepidocrocite and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates we refer henceforth to these samples as ferric oxyhydr oxides fe iii oxides similar to the ec gr experiments the formation of mag by fe 0 ec required an fe ii production rate of 300 μm fe ii min applied for 10 min which depleted o2 leaving fe ii available for mineral formation peaks in the xrd patterns of the black solids figs s1 and s2 generated in the presence and absence of arsenic were consistent with magnetite including the main 220 400 and 440 peaks at 30 43 and 63 2θ the major peaks were shifted slightly to higher angle in the presence of arsenic and were also broadened especially at as fe solid ratios 1 mol 3 2 arsenic removal as a function of ph and fe phase the concentration of residual aqueous arsenic depended on a number of factors including the initial concentration of as v or as iii the ph and the type of fe phase produced fig 1 when ec gr formed approximately 98 99 removal of arsenic that had been added as as v was achieved with more effective removal at ph 7 5 than ph 9 ec gr decreased the as v concentration to 10 μg l for initial as v 2200 μg l at ph 7 5 and 1100 μg l at ph 9 however ec gr could not meet the 1 μg l target for any initial as v concentration or ph when ec gr was formed with as iii the residual arsenic concentration was higher which is consistent with the lower sorption affinity of as iii for fe hydr oxides than as v in the investigated ph range roberts et al 2004 approximately 67 84 of initial as iii was removed at ph 7 5 with the percentage increasing with decreasing initial as iii concentration fig 1b arsenite removal by ec gr was slightly more effective at ph 9 78 87 than 7 5 in contrast to removal of as v the residual arsenic level exceeded the 10 μg l who provisional limit for all ec gr experiments in as iii solutions when fe iii oxides formed by ec both as v and as iii were more effectively removed than with ec gr at ph 7 5 ec fe iii oxides removed 99 9 of all initial as v only the experiment with the highest initial as v concentration had residual arsenic 1 μg l removal of as v by fe iii oxides was also effective at ph 9 99 9 for each sample but no experiment that produced fe iii oxides at ph 9 achieved the 1 μg l target the enhanced removal over ec gr was most pronounced for experiments in as iii solutions at ph 7 5 ec fe iii oxides removed more than 99 of the initial as iii at all tested concentrations decreasing residual arsenic to near 1 μg l for some samples and below 10 μg l for all but the highest initial as iii concentration 11 000 μg l as fe 5 mol arsenite removal by ec fe iii oxides was less effective at ph 9 than 7 5 leading to residual arsenic concentrations near 10 μg l at ph 9 fig 1 although arsenic removal was effective with fe iii oxides and gr formed by ec ec mag outperformed both in all experiments with initial as v 220 7000 μg l at both ph 7 5 and 9 ec mag achieved 99 9 removal and decreased the residual arsenic level to 1 μg l this outstanding as v removal easily satisfies the who 10 μg l limit and also meets the 1 μg l target the removal of as iii by ec mag was also superior with 99 9 removal of each initial as iii concentration regardless of ph at both ph 7 5 and 9 residual arsenic was 1 μg l for initial as iii 1100 μg l 3 3 arsenic oxidation state by as k edge xanes analysis for ec gr formed with as v the xanes spectra had a smooth absorption edge with a maximum near 11 875 ev matching the peak position from the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr fig 2 a the absence of a shoulder at lower energy indicates that significant as v reduction did not occur consistent with the negligible as iii fraction determined in the xanes lcfs table s1 for ec gr formed with as iii the distinct shoulders in the xanes spectra indicate that as iii was partially oxidized at initial concentrations of 2200 μg l as iii 1 mol as fe the fractions of as iii 68 and as v 33 sorbed by ec gr were similar at both ph 7 5 and 9 table s1 arsenic sorbed by ec fe iii oxides was present almost exclusively as as v regardless of initial as v or as iii concentrations and ph fig 2b table s1 consistent with the ec gr system the xanes spectra showed no evidence for the reduction of as v for ec fe iii oxides generated in 2200 μg l as iii 1 mol as fe at ph 7 5 the xanes lcfs indicated that arsenic was bound primarily as as v 97 this fraction is substantially higher than the 33 as v bound to ec gr produced at equivalent as iii concentrations and ph at the highest initial as iii concentration 11 000 μg l 5 mol as fe and ph 7 5 which are conditions that should favor the lowest fraction of as iii oxidation li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 as v was still the predominant species 86 detected by xanes lcfs the xanes derived oxidation states of arsenic taken up by ec mag matched those of ec gr samples fig 2c table s1 while it has been proposed that as v uptake by magnetite can produce small fractions of as iii huhmann et al 2017 the xanes lcfs did not support the presence of reduced arsenic in ec mag samples table s1 for ec mag formed with as iii the oxidation to as v was effective 70 at ph 7 5 and initial as iii 220 μg l 0 1 mol as fe however at the same ph the fraction of as v bound to ec mag decreased to 13 for initial as iii concentrations of 1100 μg l 0 5 mol as fe the significantly greater uptake of arsenic by ec mag relative to ec gr but similar fractions of surface bound as iii and as v suggests that the enhanced arsenic removal by ec mag is caused by processes beyond as iii oxidation although the positions of the as iii and as v shoulders in the absorption edge of the ec mag samples match those of the as iii and as v adsorption references fig 2c unique post edge features are present in ec mag samples these oscillations which have maxima near 11 880 and 11 892 ev appear in ec mag formed with both as iii or as v but are absent from all other ec samples and the adsorption references these distinct post edge oscillations which have also been observed in the as k edge xanes spectra of magnetite produced by biogenic fe iii reduction in the presence of as iii or as v wang et al 2014 hints at a different coordination environment of arsenic taken up by ec mag relative to the other ec samples 3 4 arsenic coordination environment by as k edge exafs analysis comparison of exafs spectra the exafs spectra of ec gr generated in as v solutions fig 2d are characterized by smooth symmetric oscillations with the exception of the peak near 5 å 1 this asymmetric peak contains a shoulder at lower k which is more pronounced in the reference exafs spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr little difference in the exafs spectra of ec gr formed with as v at increasing as fe loading was observed for ec gr produced in as iii solutions the exafs spectra have lower amplitude than as v samples with flatter more plateaued oscillations near 5 and 7 å 1 compared with the as iii and as v gr adsorption references the flattened oscillations in the ec gr as iii samples likely arise from the combination of exafs signals from sorbed as iii and as v consistent with the xanes analysis the exafs spectra of ec fe iii oxides generated in the presence of as v were similar to those for ec gr fig 2e including the asymmetric peak near 5 å 1 and the smooth oscillations at k 5 å 1 the exafs spectra of the as iii ec fe iii oxide samples matched well with those generated in as v solutions in agreement with the predominance of as v determined in the xanes lcfs regardless of the initial arsenic oxidation state the exafs spectra of ec fe iii oxides strongly resembled the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to ferrihydrite in contrast to the smooth oscillations of the ec gr and ec fe iii oxides exafs spectra pronounced beat features permeated the ec mag exafs spectra fig 2f in particular distinct bumps at 4 1 and 6 9 å 1 appeared in the first major exafs oscillations a shoulder at higher k was also present in the oscillation at 9 5 å 1 which contrasts the symmetric shape of this oscillation in the other ec samples these features were present in all ec mag samples generated with as v and were also evident for ec mag formed with 220 μg l as iii combined with the unique post edge oscillations in the xanes spectra the additional beat features in the ec mag exafs spectra further imply a different arsenic coordination environment than for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides and the as iii and as v adsorption references shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectra for ec gr produced in as v solutions the shell by shell fits resulted in similar first shell as o parameters with coordination numbers cn ranging from 3 7 to 4 0 and interatomic distances r of 1 70 å fig 3 a table 1 table s2 these values are in good agreement with those from fits of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr and are consistent with as o scattering from as v tetrahedra waychunas et al 1993 fits of the second shell peak which arises from as fe atomic pairs were also similar for all ec gr samples formed with as v regardless of ph and solids ratio 0 1 2 mol as fe fits of the second shell peak for these samples yielded cnas fe 1 9 to 2 0 and ras fe 3 40 to 3 43 å compared to the fit of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to gr cnas fe 3 1 0 9 ras fe 3 38 0 02 å ec gr had a slightly lower second shell cn and longer r the fitting output for the first and second shell peaks of ec fe iii oxides were similar regardless of ph and the concentration and initial oxidation state of arsenic the first shell was fit with an as o path with cnas o 4 1 to 4 6 and ras o 1 70 å table 1 table s2 the second shell was fit with an as fe path with cnas fe 1 7 to 2 3 and ras fe 3 34 to 3 36 å these fitting parameters matched well with those from the fit of as v adsorbed to ferrihydrite cnas o 4 1 0 5 ras o 1 70 0 1 å cnas fe 1 8 1 0 and ras fe 3 29 0 02 å however the second shell ras fe for ec fe iii oxides was slightly longer than for the ferrihydrite adsorption reference which reflects the presence of both lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite in ec fe iii oxides consistent with the xrd the fits of the first as o shell of ec mag samples generated with as v were similar to those for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides yielding cnas o 3 6 to 3 9 and ras fe 1 70 å table 1 table s2 however in contrast to the second shell fits for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides spectra which required only a single as fe path the fit of the ec mag spectra required two as fe paths the parameters returned by the fit for the first as fe path were cnas fe1 5 1 to 7 3 and ras fe1 3 44 to 3 47 å whereas the second as fe path had cnas fe2 2 8 to 5 0 and ras fe2 3 64 to 3 68 å these cn and r values are significantly different than those obtained in fits of the reference spectrum for as v adsorbed to presynthesized mag cnas fe 2 1 0 8 ras fe 3 36 0 02 å and also differ from the ec gr and ec fe iii oxides spectra this indicates a different arsenic uptake mode by ec mag multiple as fe atomic pairs at different spacing were also required in the fit of the spectrum for ec mag generated in 220 μg l as iii for this sample the first shell was fit with cnas o 2 9 0 4 and ras o 1 72 0 1 å this fit derived ras o is consistent with the presence of both as iii and as v determined from the xanes lcfs the second shell of this sample was fit using as fe atomic pairs at ras fe1 3 42 0 04 å and ras fe2 3 61 0 09 table 1 although the fit derived cn for these as fe paths was 3 the comparable ras fe1 and ras fe2 for this sample and the as v samples in the ec mag system was strong evidence for similar arsenic sorption configurations 3 5 modes of arsenic uptake by ec gr ec fe iii oxides and ec mag the shell by shell fits indicate that arsenic binds to both ec gr and ec fe iii oxides primarily in the binuclear corner sharing 2c surface complex fig 3 this conclusion is founded on the fit derived cnas fe 1 9 to 2 0 and ras fe 3 40 to 3 43 å for ec gr spectra and cnas fe 1 7 to 2 3 and ras fe 3 34 to 3 36 å for ec fe iii oxides spectra table 1 table s2 the fitting output is in excellent agreement with previous exafs studies of as v adsorbed to gr co3 jonsson and sherman 2008 and fe iii oxides waychunas et al 1993 and is inconsistent with the formation of distinct as bearing fe ii parasymplesite babechuk et al 2009 or fe iii scorodite kitahama et al 1975 minerals the formation of similar binuclear corner sharing 2c adsorption geometries for ec gr and ec fe iii oxides is supported by the match between the shorter ras fe for ec fe iii oxides 3 34 3 36 å than for ec gr spectra 3 40 3 43 å and the shorter average rfe o 2 01 å

take up oxyanions as outer sphere complexes in the interlayer ma et al 2017 2018 our data do not support this arsenic uptake mode which would lack the observed as fe atomic pair and most likely change the spacing for the basal plane reflections in xrd therefore arsenic adsorption to ec gr particle edges and ec fe iii oxide surfaces is the most likely uptake mode for these samples in contrast to the fits of ec gr and ec fe iii oxides the fits for ec mag required two sets of as fe atomic pairs at 3 42 to 3 47 å and 3 61 to 3 68 å consistent with arsenic occupying tetrahedral feo4 sites in the magnetite structure wang et al 2011 based on the magnetite crystal structure bragg 1915 arsenic substitution for fe in tetrahedral coordination would result in theoretical ras fe1 and ras fe2 3 45 å and 3 60 å which correspond to arsenic bonding with nearest neighbor feo6 octahedra and nearest neighbor feo4 tetrahedra fig 3d these theoretical ras fe values are in excellent agreement with the fit derived values however the fit derived cnas fe for ec mag samples are lower cnas fe1 7 3 table 1 table s2 than the theoretical cn of arsenic incorporated perfectly into bulk magnetite cnas fe1 inc 12 two scenarios can explain this i the co existence of adsorbed and completely incorporated arsenic and ii the substitution of arsenic for tetrahedral feo4 near the surface of the ec mag particle i e partial incorporation we argue against the first explanation for several reasons first chemical extractions with naoh and phosphate that target adsorbed arsenic only mobilized 12 and 4 of arsenic taken up by ec mag which was significantly less than the 38 and 33 mobilized from ferrihydrite fig s3 shell by shell fits of the extracted and initial ec mag samples yielded similar cnas fe values within fit derived error which is inconsistent with the mobilization of strictly adsorbed arsenic table s3 second extensive incorporation of arsenic in the bulk structure is unlikely because of differences in the charge and size of feo4 fe3 rfe o 1 80 å and aso4 as5 ras o 1 70 å wang et al 2011 which would generate strain and require charge compensation most likely in the form of fe vacancies partial incorporation of arsenic at the outermost part of the particle would be accommodated more easily because of structural relaxation at the surface and easier balancing of charge by surface deprotonation finally the nanoscale particle size of ec mag i e 5 nm diameter crystallites van genuchten et al 2018 gives rise to a high ratio of surface to bulk which facilitates partial arsenic incorporation at the particle exterior therefore we propose that arsenic removal occurs by occupation of tetrahedral feo4 sites near the surface of ec mag fig 3d several possible sorption configurations consistent with our data are presented in fig s4 incomplete as iii oxidation in the ec mag system produces a mixture of partially incorporated as v and adsorbed as iii but from our data partial as iii incorporation cannot be ruled out 3 6 factors influencing residual arsenic during fe hydr oxide formation by ec for experiments in both as iii and as v solutions the residual arsenic concentration decreased in order of ec gr ec fe iii oxides ec mag with ec mag achieving 1 μg l arsenic in all but the highest as iii experiments furthermore the ratio of arsenic partitioning to the solid μg g and liquid μg l phase for the three types of fe oxyhydr oxides increased in the same order ec gr 21 6 l g ec fe iii oxides 466 l g ec mag 16 800 l g for experiments with 1125 μg l 15 μm initial as iii at ph 9 these trends in removal efficiency and affinity for the solid phase can be explained by synthesis conditions structural properties of the solids and differences in the as iii and as v sorption affinity for fe hydr oxide surfaces the modes of arsenic uptake by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides were similar i e binuclear 2c adsorption geometry fig 3 which indicates the more effective removal of arsenic by ec fe iii oxides is not a result of the arsenic coordination geometry the xanes analysis revealed a lower extent of as iii oxidation during formation of ec gr than ec fe iii oxides which is due to the higher fe ii production rate during ec gr experiments the build up of fe ii at high fe ii production rates is required for gr formation but fe ii also competes with as iii for the fenton type oxidants o2 fe iv generated in ec systems li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 less competition between fe ii and as iii for reactive oxidants occurs at the low fe ii production rate required for ec fe iii oxide formation van genuchten et al 2018 which leads to more effective generation of the readily adsorbed as v oxyanion and lower residual arsenic concentration roberts et al 2004 in as v solutions the differences between arsenic removal by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides were less pronounced than in as iii solutions although carbonate competes weakly with arsenic for fe hydr oxide surfaces brechbuhl et al 2012 meng et al 2000 the more effective removal of as v by ec fe iii oxides than ec gr is best explained by differences in the density and type of reactive sorption sites poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates spadini et al 2003 are expected to have higher specific surface and more diverse surface structure than moderately crystalline gr williams and scherer 2001 which has an ordered sheet structure with arsenic sorption sites located primarily on particle edges wang et al 2010 concomitant with the best arsenic removal performance fig 1 the spectra from ec mag also displayed xanes and exafs features consistent with a unique arsenic uptake mode where arsenic substitutes for feo4 tetrahedra near the particle surface this sorption configuration was detected in ec mag produced in both as v and as iii solutions arsenic was removed reliably to 1 μg l when partially incorporated arsenic was detected and in this sorption mode arsenic was mobilized less by naoh and phosphate than when present in the 2c surface complex fig s3 the presence of feo4 tetrahedra is the most likely reason partial arsenic incorporation is favorable in ec mag and not in the other ec samples and this unique arsenic uptake mode explains why ec mag bonds arsenic more easily and removes arsenic more effectively finally the efficiency of arsenic removal by ec mag was not impacted significantly by ph whereas as v removal by ec gr and ec fe iii oxides decreased with increasing ph this likely reflects a transition from net positive to net negative surface charge for gr guilbaud et al 2013 and fe iii oxides spadini et al 2003 as ph increases from 7 5 to 9 leading to less favorable sorption of the as v oxyanion at ph 9 because of electrostatic repulsion in contrast formation of solid solutions partial incorporation of arsenic in ec mag is less likely to depend on ph 3 7 practical considerations for achieving 1 μg l residual arsenic with ec mag treatment of drinking water to low levels 1 μg l of arsenic can reduce the disease burden caused by chronic arsenic exposure in high van halem et al 2009 and low income countries howard et al 2007 the netherlands is currently the only country in the world where the drinking water sector targets 1 μg l which arose from comparing the costs of arsenic related health impacts and water treatment infrastructure ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 van der wens et al 2016 ahmad et al 2019 however the development of innovative technologies that can achieve 1 μg l without major infrastructure renovation can improve this cost benefit analysis to favor lower arsenic targets particularly in countries where improvements to treatment infrastructure are prohibitively costly in this study we have shown that formation of mag by fe 0 electrolysis reliably yields residual arsenic 1 μg l for a wide range of initial conditions whereas ec fe iii oxides and ec gr would require more charge passed i e more electricity and fe consumed and thus more costs to meet 1 μg l if possible at all arsenic removal to 1 μg l is difficult to achieve using other treatment methods such as fecl3 addition without as iii preoxidation hering et al 1996 passive fe 0 corrosion leupin et al 2005 neumann et al 2013 and membrane techniques schmidt et al 2016 in some cases removal to 1 μg l has been reported using adsorption media that require sophisticated synthesis procedures and costly materials chandra et al 2010 luo et al 2012 or by augmenting conventional fecl3 addition by preoxidation with kmno4 ahmad et al 2018 however ec mag formation is a promising alternative because high concentrations of both as v and as iii can be treated to 1 μg l at a range of ph 7 5 9 and it requires only a small input of electricity and small amounts of fe 0 metal which is readily available everywhere and completely non hazardous our experiments were designed to compare the arsenic removal efficiency of ec mag ec gr and ec fe iii oxides using a constant fe dosage 3 mm total fe and systematically varied initial arsenic concentration spanning the range of the worst case scenario geogenic arsenic levels e g bgs 2001 while we show that ec mag outperformed ec fe iii oxides primarily at arsenic levels 500 μg l and at ph 9 it is reasonable to expect that ec mag would similarly outperform ec fe iii oxides at lower initial arsenic levels if the total fe dosage is optimized for example because 3 mm ec mag could remove 1125 μg l initial as iii to 1 μg l at ph 9 which was not possible for ec fe iii oxides fig 1 ec mag would likely require significantly less fe than ec fe iii oxides for full removal of 50 μg l as iii at ph 9 our study sets the foundation for subsequent research to optimize the total ec mag concentration required to achieve 1 μg l for a constant arsenic level which would help to more accurately identify the best fe 0 ec operating conditions for field treatment another important practical consideration for arsenic treatment is the appropriate management of arsenic rich waste that is generated as a by product from all arsenic removal methods e g fecl3 addition membrane filtration fe 0 ec the formation of mag by fe 0 ec is more attractive than the production of fe iii oxides with respect to waste production for several reasons as the chemical formula fe3o4 shows the mass ratio of fe to total solid is higher for mag 0 72 than for fe iii oxides i e ferrihydrite with an approximate chemical formula of fe oh 3 has a fe mass ratio of 0 52 therefore per mol of fe generated by ec the formation of mag theoretically produces 28 less sludge mass 3 mm fe 232 mg fe3o4 l than ferrihydrite 3 mm fe 321 mg fe oh 3 l the most common fe iii precipitate formed in arsenic treatment by fecl3 addition hering et al 1996 also the density of mag 5 3 g cm3 is higher than that of ferrihydrite 3 4 g cm3 because it has less space filling o atoms per fe atom 1 33 o fe for fe3o4 3 o fe for fe oh 3 therefore per mol of fe generated by ec 36 less sludge volume would be generated for mag than for ferrihydrite an additional benefit is the ease of separating ec mag particles from treated water using low strength magnetic fields which would likely facilitate sludge dewatering we also found that arsenic taken up by partial incorporation in the ec mag structure is more resistant to mobilization than when associated with ferrihydrite fig s3 making arsenic exposure less likely during ec mag sludge handling and storage finally mag is one of the highest valued fe oxides having applications across several industries e g electronics catalysis and biotechnology which makes reuse of mag treatment sludge more appealing than ferrihydrite gawande et al 2013 arbab et al 2003 with respect to infrastructure requirements fe 0 ec systems and the production of ec mag in particular also offers a number of benefits relative to conventional treatment methods such as fecl3 addition for example per mass of iron steel is cheaper hot rolled plate steel 800 per ton of fe meps 2018 than the 40 fecl3 solution used in conventional water treatment 1450 per ton of fe alibaba com 2018 transport of the more dense fe 0 metal to the treatment site is also easier and cheaper than the large volumes of acidic fecl3 solution and the treated water does not inherit unnecessary chloride although fe 0 ec systems require electricity energy consumption is comparable or lower than other methods e g reverse osmosis schmidt et al 2016 and it can be provided by sustainable power sources such as photovoltaics and fuel cells finally low cost separation of ec mag particles using a magnetic field would eliminating extra requirements for coagulation or filtration to complete treatment yavuz et al 2006 in summary our results suggest that the formation of ec mag is one of the most attractive methods to achieve 1 μg l residual arsenic because this method provides i exceptional arsenic removal efficiency ii unique arsenic uptake modes and resistance to arsenic mobilization iii lower mass and volume of sludge produced per mol of fe iv magnetic properties that favor particle separation and v higher valued sludge than production of fe iii oxides these benefits favor the reuse of the treatment waste however additional research is necessary before ec mag can be implemented in practice first groundwater contaminated by geogenic arsenic often contains substantial concentrations of phosphate and silicate which can alter the structure of co precipitated fe oxides voegelin et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2014 senn et al 2015 and are well known to compete with arsenic for sorption sites roberts et al 2004 therefore the effect of phosphate and silicate on the arsenic removal efficiency of ec mag needs to be evaluated second the stability and best management practices of the treatment sludge must be determined 4 conclusions for a given coulomb of charge passed or mass of fe produced ec mag was more effective than ec fe iii oxide and ec gr at achieving 1 μg l residual arsenic regardless of the as v or as iii species or ph the exceptional performance of ec mag is attributed in part to the formation of a unique arsenic sorption mode where arsenic substitutes for tetrahedral iron near the mag particle surface while ec fe iii oxides and ec gr removed arsenic effectively 67 99 the production of these solids by ec would likely require significantly higher charge passed and fe added to meet 1 μg l resulting in greater electricity consumption and more solid waste therefore especially in decentralized treatment systems based on fe ii addition such as fe 0 ec magnetite formation is desirable relative to other fe phases for the following reasons i enhanced ability to meet 1 μg l ii more stable arsenic bonding mode that resists mobilization more than standard surface complexes and iii potential for simplified particle separation from treated water by

respectively creusot et al 2013 weiss et al 2011 2009 via eda compounds not analyzed by routine chemical analysis are identified based on their biological activity in bioassays bioactivity measured in sample fractions collected following chromatographic separation are correlated to accurate masses detected in parallel using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms via non target analysis corresponding structures of masses in active fractions can be identified reducing fraction complexity through high resolution fractionation decreases the number of compounds per fraction the number of masses to be identified will also decrease as a result which leads to a faster and more focused identification this study focused on the improvement of the current eda approach by increasing the throughput and the fractionation resolution to allow faster and more successful identification for high resolution eda of mutagens and endocrine disruptive chemicals four different bioassays were used

ms system to confirm retention time and mass spectrum bioactivity was confirmed in the respective bioassay 3 results and discussion 3 1 mutagenic androgenic estrogenic and glucocorticoid potency of unfractionated surface water and wastewater extracts the mutagenic and the agonistic and antagonistic potency of three water samples was determined by testing the unfractionated extracts on the luminescent ames and ar er and gr reporter gene assays respectively mutagenicity was detected in wwtp influent and effluent ta98 and ta100 and river meuse ta98 extracts diluted 1 3 or 10 times table 1 mutagenicity was detected under all conditions in all samples except in river meuse by ta100 and wwtp effluent by ta98 s9 the absence of measureable mutagenicity may be explained by the absence of base pair substitution mutagens or the presence of cytotoxicity respectively all extracts were selected for further investigation after fractionation ar er and gr agonism was observed in the wwtp influent wwtp effluent and river meuse extracts ranked from the strongest to weakest response table 2 antagonism was observed in the gr but not in ar or er assays gr agonism and antagonism were both detected in wwtp in and effluent extracts this may indicate the presence of gr agonists less potent compared to dexamethasone present during the antagonistic assay while the agonists produce a response in the agonist assay dexamethasone can be displaced in the antagonistic assay which results in reduced induction registered as antagonism the antagonistic response was not further investigated in fractionated samples mutagenicity and endocrine disruption of unfractionated extracts was determined in a single experiment as a quick semi quantitative screening method the ability to distinguish between weak and strong mutagenic samples was however limited by measuring mutagenicity as number of revertants in a limited number of wells 5 the extract screening method is therefore best suited for detection of mutagenicity only and can be followed by quantification of positive samples in the regular or earlier developed downscaled luminescent ames test zwart et al 2018a to further increase throughput during sample selection for eda screening can be limited to 1 or 2 dilutions combined with a threshold induction for rapid determination of bioactive samples 3 2 application of high resolution eda to surface and wastewater extracts water extracts from the river meuse and wwtp influent and effluent in the netherlands were fractionated using uplc and 228 collected fractions were tested in the downscaled luminescent ames mutagenicity test fig 2 and ar er and gr reporter gene assays fig 3 both in unfractionated extracts and in various fractions mutagenicity and ar er and gr agonism were observed gr antagonism was not further investigated fractions from a single fractionation plate of each extract were analyzed on the three ar er and gr reporter gene assays exposed in parallel for the downscaled luminescent ames test a separate injection followed by fraction collection was performed for each test condition ta98 ta100 ta98 s9 and ta100 s9 fig 2 given the lower sensitivity of the luminescent ames test micromolar concentrations range compared to the reporter gene assays picomolar concentrations range compared to the response in unfractionated extracts reported as number of revertants responses in fractions could be reported by their induction factor based on the measured luminescent response relative to the luminescent response to the negative control induction factors in unfractionated extracts were often low ta98 2 and ta100 3 data not shown and revertants did not grow in all wells table 1 the higher induction factors in fractions may be explained by 1 the higher concentration of the compound s in each well and 2 the purity of the compound s after chromatographic separation complex mixtures may contain compounds which inhibit the mutagenicity or limit the availability of a mutagen given the observed responses at the currently used concentrations the downscaled luminescent ames test is compatible with high resolution fractionated samples and applicable for ht eda a limited number of mutagens has previously been identified in the aquatic environment ohe et al 2004 and often found associated with suspended particulate matter spm hamers et al 2015 mutagens present in filtered water samples are restricted to water soluble compounds which further limits the number of compounds responsible for the mutagenic activity this is reflected by the limited number of bioactivity peaks in the fractions fig 2 furthermore elution of mutagens at very different retention times indicates the presence of different classes of compounds with varying structures and physico chemical properties in contrast the most potent activators of hormone receptors in reporter gene assays are natural and synthetic steroid hormones which share structural similarity and solubility with similar retention times this results in peak clusters with poor separation fig 3 compared to the good peak separation observed in the luminescent ames chromatogram fig 2 the major part of the observed mutagenic response was represented by 5 peaks additionally minor peak features consisting of weak 2 fold induction responses from multiple adjacent fractions were observed fig 2b these were most prominent in the response of ta98 in the presence of s9 to fractions of the wwtp effluent extract at 6 5 8 15 and 16 5 min fig 2b while not investigated this may reveal the presence of additional mutagens in the effluent extract the absence of a comparable response in the wwtp influent extract may be explained by its 5 times lower concentration factor compared to that of the wwtp effluent extract or by the formation of mutagenic products during the water treatment process e g metabolites breakdown product or transformation products in river meuse mutagenicity was detected in the unfractionated table 1 but not in the fractionated extract fig 2 this may be explained by the presence of multiple mutagens which are unable to induce a response at their individual concentrations present in the wells while the total concentrations of mutagens in the unfractionated extract is sufficient to induce a response further increase in the extract concentration factor or larger injection volumes on the lc column can increase compound concentrations in each fraction this in turn may improve detection of relevant mutagens present at lower concentrations by the downscaled luminescent ames test and allow their identification the major part of the bioactivity measured in fractions by the ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 and gr calux corresponds with retention times of steroid hormones fig 3 retention times of bioactivity peaks measured in fractions by the gr calux however did not correspond to predicted retention times of synthetic gcs like cortisol dexamethasone and prednisolone previously detected in water chang et al 2007 schriks et al 2010 the bioactivity peaks fig 3 suggest that the gr activity should be attributed to less polar gcs bioactivity in fractions of the wwtp influent extract of all endpoints however was observed at earlier retention times compared to wwtp effluent this may be explained by the presence of steroid hormone metabolites with increased water solubility present in wwtp influent reddy et al 2005 metabolites with increased water solubility like sulfate and glucuronide conjugates can however revert back to their unconjugated form through hydrolysis during water treatment naldi et al 2016 a shift in bioactivity retention times between wwtp influent and effluent samples may therefore be explained by the formation of steroid hormone metabolite transformation products during water treatment similarly wastewater treatment may lead to the formation of other bioactive transformation and breakdown products leusch et al 2019 pflug et al 2017 wolfson et al 2019 the ht eda technique may be applied to investigate such changes in bioactivity patterns to track the removal or formation of bioactivity this allows to determine water treatment efficiency identify and investigate formation of bioactive products and guide improvements to the treatment process effective detection and identification of novel endocrine disruptors however is hindered by high concentrations of potent synthetic steroid hormones in aquatic samples which mask the response from often weaker xenobiotic edcs due to similar log kow values of various hormones modifying lc conditions or further increasing the number of fractions may be insufficient to increase the bioassay peak separation alternatively potent synthetic hormones and their metabolites may be analyzed in fractions more effectively with a smaller ms fraction collector split ratio 1 9 to 1 1 this may improve bioactivity peak separation when sample concentrations in fractions at the flank of a peak become too low to elicit a response a smaller ratio also diverts more sample to the ms which improves detection of masses during ms analysis identification of novel xenobiotic endocrine disruptors however may be more successful if focused on sources of potential edcs that do not contain natural or synthetic hormones including plastics jonker et al 2016 or house dust rudel et al 2003 3 3 identification and confirmation of active compounds masses present in active fractions were subjected to identification through non target analysis resolution of the high resolution fractionation method previously described zwart et al 2018b could be further increased from 192 to 228 fractions but did not lead to a reduced number of masses associated with each active fraction the number of masses to identify could however be reduced further by selecting masses present in active fractions at the investigated retention time in multiple samples mass 2 in fig 1 masses could be excluded when also detected at the investigated retention time in inactive fractions of a different sample mass 1 in fig 1 poor ionization of bioactive compounds however can result in detection of masses in samples with high but not in samples with low concentrations of the compound and can lead to false negatives by determining the ratio between the bioactivity and ms intensity of the suspected mass a prediction can be made of the ms intensity corresponding with bioactivity in other samples when due to low bioactivity the corresponding ms intensity is predicted to be below the detection limit of the ms a mass can still be considered for identification to avoid exclusion of relevant masses structures were tentatively identified for 3 masses out of 5 investigated peaks observed in fractions producing a response in the luminescent ames and for 5 masses observed in fractions producing a response in the ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 or gr calux identification of edcs was focused on synthetic steroid hormones and their metabolites or transformation products the synthetic steroid hormones are regarded as the receptor agonists responsible for the vast majority of observed bioactivity their metabolites and transformation products formed during water treatment however are the suspected cause of different peaks between responses in wwtp in and effluent from the candidates 1 mutagen and 1 androgen were selected for analysis and subsequently confirmed with regard to toxicity and identity as 1 2 3 benzotriazole bta and androstenedione respectively table 3 mass 2 and 4 bta fig 2 peak 1 is a small polar molecule log kow 1 34 used as household and industrial corrosion inhibitor or drug precursor and was detected in meuse water at low and wwtp samples at high intensity bta was predicted as ames mutagen in a qsar study kazius et al 2005 as well as in toxtree qsar analysis carcinogenicity was not detected in rodents however bta is regarded as potential carcinogen and has been reported earlier in surface and wastewater where it is poorly removed during wastewater treatment due to its solubility and resistance to degradation weiss et al 2006 bta was previously found active in ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of s9 activation in the regular agar based ames test kirkland et al 2014 reissig 1990 bta was also active in the newly developed luminescent ames fluctuation test while no bioactivity was observed in the regular colorimetric ames fluctuation test zwart et al 2018a this abundance and persistence of bta in wwtp in and effluent samples as an ames mutagen warrants further investigation into bta and its possible contribution to the mutagenicity of environmental samples diethylene glycol bis di 2 chloroisopropyl phosphate deg bdcipp a chlorinated phosphorus based flame retardant was tentatively identified as potential mutagen but could not be acquired for further confirmation analysis the mass was observed at 15 8 min in effluent fig 2 peak 2 and identified based on the observed fragmentation pattern which corresponds with fragments reported by matsukami et al 2015 while no mutagenicity data of deg bdcipp is known at present the chlorinated phosphorus based flame retardant tdcpp has been found mutagenic in the ta100 salmonella strain gold et al 1978 the bioactivity was undiminished following exposure in the presence of s9 mix indicating resistance to metabolic degradation however the compound was not detected in the influent which might indicate that the observed mass is a breakdown product transformation product or metabolite of an inactive compound and was formed during water treatment the lack of an available deg bdcipp standard for chemical analytical and toxicological confirmation of the identity especially without any preconditions for publication of scientific results is a serious problem for our case study and at a broader level for ht eda in general custom synthesis may be considered but is generally time consuming and costly additional major ames bioactivity peaks 3 4 and 5 were detected in wwtp influent at 17 9 2 1 to 4 1 and 21 4 min respectively fig 2 peak cluster 4 was detected by ta100 in the presence of s9 mix and was tentatively identified as 2 formyl 1h pyrrole peak 3 detected by ta100 with increased bioactivity after exposure in the presence of s9 mix and peak 5 detected by ta98 only in the presence of s9 mix could not be linked to a specific mass and could not be identified the androgen androstenedione observed in wwtp influent and at 3 5 fold lower intensity in wwtp effluent was selected as candidate compound and could be confirmed chemically based on retention time and mass spectrum in positive esi mode masses from other routinely monitored hormones including estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and testosterone or their metabolites could however not be detected despite the use of esi in negative ionization mode to improve detection of hormones reddy et al 2005 zhang and fent 2018 while the corresponding masses were not detected retention times of e2 e3 testosterone and bpa corresponded with bioactivity peaks which suggest their presence and activity fig 3 fractions with increased or decreased bioactivity in the wwtp influent extract compared to the effluent extract were analyzed to identify bioactive compounds which are formed or degraded during water treatment two human steroid hormone sulfate esters and two hydroxylated metabolites predominantly or exclusively present in influent were tentatively identified table 3 mass 5 8 sulfate esters were readily detected with esi in negative mode and accompanied by sulfate fragments while sulfate conjugated steroid hormones are inactive forms cho k1 wolff et al 2003 mcf 7 james et al 2001 and u2 os purohit et al 1992 express steroid sulfatase sts which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfate steroids to their active unconjugated form while endogenous sts expression levels are low sufficient deconjugated steroid hormones may form during the 24 h exposure time to generate a response the absence of bioactivity and masses in effluent extract previously observed in influent extract may be explained by deconjugation carballa et al 2004 d ascenzo et al 2003 or transformation of steroid hormone metabolites during water treatment weber et al 2005 while loss of bioactivity was mainly observed fractions in er 14 min and gr 16 min were increasingly active in effluent compared to influent this may indicate the presence of bioactive products formed during the wwtp treatment however no compounds could be identified filtering of masses observed in the same active fractions from different samples aided in selecting relevant masses for identification this indicated that the identification process can be further improved by developing a database of masses associated with active fractions over a large number of samples additional ms analysis in negative mode under the same chromatographic conditions further increased the number of detected masses this however did not improve the detection of common hormones at the present concentrations analyzing samples in negative ionization mode with optimized eluents i e at basic ph levels may increase the ionization of compounds and improve their detection however a separate fractionation and bioassay analysis is required for each sample as retention times are shifted under different chromatographic conditions for the complete identification of bioactive compounds in waste water samples additional approaches may be required for instance separation of co eluting compounds in exceedingly complex mixtures like wastewater can be improved through application of different lc methods like two dimensional liquid chromatography lc x lc ouyang et al 2016 alternatively during ms analysis atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci or atmospheric pressure photoionization appi can be used to detect compounds that are poorly ionized by esi different extraction methods and chromatography conditions may be used to measure different classes of compounds polar compounds are poorly retained during spe of the large volumes required to sufficiently concentrate compounds and remain undetectable to improve detection of polar compounds samples can be extracted with optimized spe methods and separated on a hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic column this would allow detection identification and investigation of persistent polar compounds that are poorly removed during wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2016 combining a number of these approaches which double the number of pipetting steps with each additional fractionation will be feasible with the introduction of automated liquid handling in addition routine eda of environmental samples depends on processing of a large number of samples followed by rapid and complete identification automation in bioassay analysis and identification will therefore be a requirement for future optimization of the ht eda platform for application in routine analysis of aquatic samples 4 conclusion hyphenation of the downscaled luminescent ames test and cell based reporter gene assays to a high resolution fractionation setup enabled detection of mutagenicity and endocrine disruptive potency in sample fractions respectively mutagenicity and ar er and gr activity could be analyzed in 228 fractions collected from surface and wwtp influent effluent water extracts and were detected in all samples the identification process could be improved through selection of masses detected in active fractions at the same retention time over multiple extracts reducing the number of masses to analyze eight compounds were tentatively identified as active compounds from which bta and androstenedione were further investigated and confirmed as active mutagen and androgen respectively introduction of the downscaled luminescent ames test to the ht eda platform enables rapid detection of mutagenicity in addition to endocrine disruption at high resolution and allows future application in the detection and identification of novel mutagenic toxicants during routine monitoring of the drinking water production process to fully exploit the power of ht eda the lack of standards for confirmation studies such as in this case with deg bdcipp should be addressed possibly with the support of regulatory bodies for instance by hosting a repository of

18422,effect directed analysis eda has shown its added value for the detection and identification of compounds with varying toxicological properties in water quality research however for routine toxicity assessment of multiple toxicological endpoints current eda is considered labor intensive and time consuming to achieve faster eda and identification a high throughput ht eda platform coupling a downscaled luminescent ames and cell based reporter gene assays with a high resolution fraction collector and uplc qtof ms was developed the applicability of the ht eda platform in the analysis of

mutagenic byproducts kleindienst et al 1992 mestankova et al 2014 the ability to rapidly determine the presence and identity of previously unknown mutagens and edcs in drinking surface ground and effluent water is essential in efforts to keep track of their release into the environment and to assure their removal during the drinking water purification process previous studies have used the salmonella microsome test ames test and cell based luciferase reporter gene assays in effect directed analysis eda for the identification of novel mutagens and edcs in environmental samples respectively creusot et al 2013 weiss et al 2011 2009 via eda compounds not analyzed by routine chemical analysis are identified based on their biological activity in bioassays bioactivity measured in sample fractions collected following chromatographic separation are correlated to accurate masses detected in parallel using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms via non target analysis corresponding structures of masses in active fractions can be identified reducing fraction complexity through high resolution fractionation decreases the number of compounds per fraction the number of masses to be identified will also decrease as a result which leads to a faster and more focused identification this study focused on the improvement of the current eda approach by increasing the throughput and the fractionation resolution to allow faster and more successful identification for high resolution eda of mutagens and endocrine disruptive chemicals four different bioassays were used to screen 228 fractions from extracts of surface water sample a wastewater influent and wastewater effluent the bioassays included a recently developed downscaled luminescent variation to the ames

and b denote minimal and maximal response respectively c is the ec50 or ic50 d is the hillslope and x represents the tested concentration unfractionated extracts were tested in a single experiment reporter gene assay responses were interpolated in the linear phase of dose response curves of the cell line specific reference hormone concentrations were calculated from the responses of the most diluted extracts to limit matrix effects and potential cytotoxicity calculated concentrations were reported as equivalent concentration in ng l to the respective reference hormone measured responses of the downscaled luminescent ames test to unfractionated extracts were scored as previously described zwart et al 2018a briefly wells were counted positive when the measured luminescent response exceeded the mean luminescence of the negative control by two standard deviations mutagenicity was reported as the number of revertants out of 5 possible revertants samples were regarded mutagenic when the response was above 2 revertants per 5 wells responses to the 228 fractions in the downscaled luminescent ames test were reported as fold induction of the luminescent response from each well compared to the averaged negative control response 2 9 identification and confirmation non target analysis was performed on masses correlating with active fractions as previously described zwart et al 2018b with minor modifications in brief masses with a signal to noise ratio above 30 were selected for identification when detected in active fractions and not detected in inactive fractions at the same retention time in multiple samples fig 1 molecular formulas were determined by the maximum scoring based on the lowest combined exact mass difference 0 002 mda and isotopic distribution difference msigma 20 calculated with the smartformula module in the bruker dataanalysis software the elements c h n o p s f cl and br were selected as allowed elements in determining the molecular formula corresponding structures were retrieved from pubchem and chemspider databases partition coefficients logp were predicted for each retrieved structure with alogps 2 1 software and retention time was calculated based on experimental retention time logp correlation data exclusively structures with predicted retention times that corresponded with the observed retention time were selected candidate structures of known compounds i e with a compound name and cas number or that were described in the literature were manually selected from the remaining structures fragmentation patterns of candidate structures retrieved from the mzcloud database were matched with the recorded mass spectrum biological data for a candidate was retrieved from the literature or from pubchem and toxcast toxicological databases mutagenic activity was predicted with the toxtree software carcinogenicity and in vitro mutagenicity decision trees candidates selected for confirmation were tested on the lc ms system to confirm retention time and mass spectrum bioactivity was confirmed in the respective bioassay 3 results and discussion 3 1 mutagenic androgenic estrogenic and glucocorticoid potency of unfractionated surface water and wastewater extracts the mutagenic and the agonistic and antagonistic potency of three water samples was determined by testing the unfractionated extracts on the luminescent ames and ar er and gr reporter gene assays respectively mutagenicity was detected in wwtp influent and effluent ta98 and ta100 and river meuse ta98 extracts diluted 1 3 or 10 times table 1 mutagenicity was detected under all conditions in all samples except in river meuse by ta100 and wwtp effluent by ta98 s9 the absence of measureable mutagenicity may be explained by the absence of base pair substitution mutagens or the presence of cytotoxicity respectively all extracts were selected for further investigation after fractionation ar er and gr agonism was observed in the wwtp influent wwtp effluent and river meuse extracts ranked from the strongest to weakest response table 2 antagonism was observed in the gr but not in ar or er assays gr agonism and antagonism were both detected in wwtp in and effluent extracts this may indicate the presence of gr agonists less potent compared to dexamethasone present during the antagonistic assay while the agonists produce a response in the agonist assay dexamethasone can be displaced in the antagonistic assay which results in reduced induction registered as antagonism the antagonistic response was not further investigated in fractionated samples mutagenicity and endocrine disruption of unfractionated extracts was determined in a single experiment as a quick semi quantitative screening method the ability to distinguish between weak and strong mutagenic samples was however limited by measuring mutagenicity as number of revertants in a limited number of wells 5 the extract screening method is therefore best suited for detection of mutagenicity only and can be followed by quantification of positive samples in the regular or earlier developed downscaled luminescent ames test zwart et al 2018a to further increase throughput during sample selection for eda screening can be limited to 1 or 2 dilutions combined with a threshold induction for rapid determination of bioactive samples 3 2 application of high resolution eda to surface and wastewater extracts water extracts from the river meuse and wwtp influent and effluent in the netherlands were fractionated using uplc and 228 collected fractions were tested in the downscaled luminescent ames mutagenicity test fig 2 and ar er and gr reporter gene assays fig 3 both in unfractionated extracts and in various fractions mutagenicity and ar er and gr agonism were observed gr antagonism was not further investigated fractions from a single fractionation plate of each extract were analyzed on the three ar er and gr reporter gene assays exposed in parallel for the downscaled luminescent ames test a separate injection followed by fraction collection was performed for each test condition ta98 ta100 ta98 s9 and ta100 s9 fig 2 given the lower sensitivity of the luminescent ames test micromolar concentrations range compared to the reporter gene assays picomolar concentrations range compared to the response in unfractionated extracts reported as number of revertants responses in fractions could be reported by their induction factor based on the measured luminescent response relative to the luminescent response to the negative control induction factors in unfractionated extracts were often low ta98 2 and ta100 3 data not shown and revertants did not grow in all wells table 1 the higher induction factors in fractions may be explained by 1 the higher concentration of the compound s in each well and 2 the purity of the compound s after chromatographic separation complex mixtures may contain compounds which inhibit the mutagenicity or limit the availability of a mutagen given the observed responses at the currently used concentrations the downscaled luminescent ames test is compatible with high resolution fractionated samples and applicable for ht eda a limited number of mutagens has previously been identified in the aquatic environment ohe et al 2004 and often found associated with suspended particulate matter spm hamers et al 2015 mutagens present in filtered water samples are restricted to water soluble compounds which further limits the number of compounds responsible for the mutagenic activity this is reflected by the limited number of bioactivity peaks in the fractions fig 2 furthermore elution of mutagens at very different retention times indicates the presence of different classes of compounds with varying structures and physico chemical properties in contrast the most potent activators of hormone receptors in reporter gene assays are natural and synthetic steroid hormones which share structural similarity and solubility with similar retention times this results in peak clusters with poor separation fig 3 compared to the good peak separation observed in the luminescent ames chromatogram fig 2 the major part of the observed mutagenic response was represented by 5 peaks additionally minor peak features consisting of weak 2 fold induction responses from multiple adjacent fractions were observed fig 2b these were most prominent in the response of ta98 in the presence of s9 to fractions of the wwtp effluent extract at 6 5 8 15 and 16 5 min fig 2b while not investigated this may reveal the presence of additional mutagens in the effluent extract the absence of a comparable response in the wwtp influent extract may be explained by its 5 times lower concentration factor compared to that of the wwtp effluent extract or by the formation of mutagenic products during the water treatment process e g metabolites breakdown product or transformation products in river meuse mutagenicity was detected in the unfractionated table 1 but not in the fractionated extract fig 2 this may be explained by the presence of multiple mutagens which are unable to induce a response at their individual concentrations present in the wells while the total concentrations of mutagens in the unfractionated extract is sufficient to induce a response further increase in the extract concentration factor or larger injection volumes on the lc column can increase compound concentrations in each fraction this in turn may improve detection of relevant mutagens present at lower concentrations by the downscaled luminescent ames test and allow their identification the major part of the bioactivity measured in fractions by the ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 and gr calux corresponds with retention times of steroid hormones fig 3 retention times of bioactivity peaks measured in fractions by the gr calux however did not correspond to predicted retention times of synthetic gcs like cortisol dexamethasone and prednisolone previously detected in water chang et al 2007 schriks et al 2010 the bioactivity peaks fig 3 suggest that the gr activity should be attributed to less polar gcs bioactivity in fractions of the wwtp influent extract of all endpoints however was observed at earlier retention times compared to wwtp effluent this may be explained by the presence of steroid hormone metabolites with increased water solubility present in wwtp influent reddy et al 2005 metabolites with increased water solubility like sulfate and glucuronide conjugates can however revert back to their unconjugated form through hydrolysis during water treatment naldi et al 2016 a shift in bioactivity retention times between wwtp influent and effluent samples may therefore be explained by the formation of steroid hormone metabolite transformation products during water treatment similarly wastewater treatment may lead to the formation of other bioactive transformation and breakdown products leusch et al 2019 pflug et al 2017 wolfson et al 2019 the ht eda technique may be applied to investigate such changes in bioactivity patterns to track the removal or formation of bioactivity this allows to determine water treatment efficiency identify and investigate formation of bioactive products and guide improvements to the treatment process effective detection and identification of novel endocrine disruptors however is hindered by high concentrations of potent synthetic steroid hormones in aquatic samples which mask the response from often weaker xenobiotic edcs due to similar log kow values of various hormones modifying lc conditions or further increasing the number of fractions may be insufficient to increase the bioassay peak separation alternatively potent synthetic hormones and their metabolites may be analyzed in fractions more effectively with a smaller ms fraction collector split ratio 1 9 to 1 1 this may improve bioactivity peak separation when sample concentrations in fractions at the flank of a peak become too low to elicit a response a smaller ratio also diverts more sample to the ms which improves detection of masses during ms analysis identification of novel xenobiotic endocrine disruptors however may be more successful if focused on sources of potential edcs that do not contain natural or synthetic hormones including plastics jonker et al 2016 or house dust rudel et al 2003 3 3 identification and confirmation of active compounds masses present in active fractions were subjected to identification through non target analysis resolution of the high resolution fractionation method previously described zwart et al 2018b could be further increased from 192 to 228 fractions but did not lead to a reduced number of masses associated with each active fraction the number of masses to identify could however be reduced further by selecting masses present in active fractions at the investigated retention time in multiple samples mass 2 in fig 1 masses could be excluded when also detected at the investigated retention time in inactive fractions of a different sample mass 1 in fig 1 poor ionization of bioactive compounds however can result in detection of masses in samples with high but not in samples with low concentrations of the compound and can lead to false negatives by determining the ratio between the bioactivity and ms intensity of the suspected mass a prediction can be made of the ms intensity corresponding with bioactivity in other samples when due to low bioactivity the corresponding ms intensity is predicted to be below the detection limit of the ms a mass can still be considered for identification to avoid exclusion of relevant masses structures were tentatively identified for 3 masses out of 5 investigated peaks observed in fractions producing a response in the luminescent ames and for 5 masses observed in fractions producing a response in the ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 or gr calux identification of edcs was focused on synthetic steroid hormones and their metabolites or transformation products the synthetic steroid hormones are regarded as the receptor agonists responsible for the vast majority of observed bioactivity their metabolites and transformation products formed during water treatment however are the suspected cause of different peaks between responses in wwtp in and effluent from the candidates 1 mutagen and 1 androgen were selected for analysis and subsequently confirmed with regard to toxicity and identity as 1 2 3 benzotriazole bta and androstenedione respectively table 3 mass 2 and 4 bta fig 2 peak 1 is a small polar molecule log kow 1 34 used as household and industrial corrosion inhibitor or drug precursor and was detected in meuse water at low and wwtp samples at high intensity bta was predicted as ames mutagen in a qsar study kazius et al 2005 as well as in toxtree qsar analysis carcinogenicity was not detected in rodents however bta is regarded as potential carcinogen and has been reported earlier in surface and wastewater where it is poorly removed during wastewater treatment due to its solubility and resistance to degradation weiss et al 2006 bta was previously found active in ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of s9 activation in the regular agar based ames test kirkland et al 2014 reissig 1990 bta was also active in the newly developed luminescent ames fluctuation test while no bioactivity was observed in the regular colorimetric ames fluctuation test zwart et al 2018a this abundance and persistence of bta in wwtp in and effluent samples as an ames mutagen warrants further investigation into bta and its possible contribution to the mutagenicity of environmental samples diethylene glycol bis di 2 chloroisopropyl phosphate deg bdcipp a chlorinated phosphorus based flame retardant was tentatively identified as potential mutagen but could not be acquired for further confirmation analysis the mass was observed at 15 8 min in effluent fig 2 peak 2 and identified based on the observed fragmentation pattern which corresponds with fragments reported by matsukami et al 2015 while no mutagenicity data of deg bdcipp is known at present the chlorinated phosphorus based flame retardant tdcpp has been found mutagenic in the ta100 salmonella strain gold et al 1978 the bioactivity was undiminished following exposure in the presence of s9 mix indicating resistance to metabolic degradation however the compound was not detected in the influent which might indicate that the observed mass is a breakdown product transformation product or metabolite of an inactive compound and was formed during water treatment the lack of an available deg bdcipp standard for chemical analytical and toxicological confirmation of the identity especially without any preconditions for publication of scientific results is a serious problem for our case study and at a broader level for ht eda in general custom synthesis may be considered but is generally time consuming and costly additional major ames bioactivity peaks 3 4 and 5 were detected in wwtp influent at 17 9 2 1 to 4 1 and 21 4 min respectively fig 2 peak cluster 4 was detected by ta100 in the presence of s9 mix and was tentatively identified as 2 formyl 1h pyrrole peak 3 detected by ta100 with increased bioactivity after exposure in the presence of s9 mix and peak 5 detected by ta98 only in the presence of s9 mix could not be linked to a specific mass and could not be identified the androgen androstenedione observed in wwtp influent and at 3 5 fold lower intensity in wwtp effluent was selected as candidate compound and could be confirmed chemically based on retention time and mass spectrum in positive esi mode masses from other routinely monitored hormones including estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and testosterone or their metabolites could however not be detected despite the use of esi in negative ionization mode to improve detection of hormones reddy et al 2005 zhang and fent 2018 while the corresponding masses were not detected retention times of e2 e3 testosterone and bpa corresponded with bioactivity peaks which suggest their presence and activity fig 3 fractions with increased or decreased bioactivity in the wwtp influent extract compared to the effluent extract were analyzed to identify bioactive compounds which are formed or degraded during water treatment two human steroid hormone sulfate esters and two hydroxylated metabolites predominantly or exclusively present in influent were tentatively identified table 3 mass 5 8 sulfate esters were readily detected with esi in negative mode and accompanied by sulfate fragments while sulfate conjugated steroid hormones are inactive forms cho k1 wolff et al 2003 mcf 7 james et al 2001 and u2 os purohit et al 1992 express steroid sulfatase sts which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfate steroids to their active unconjugated form while endogenous sts expression levels are low sufficient deconjugated steroid hormones may form during the 24 h exposure time to generate a response the absence of bioactivity and masses in effluent extract previously observed in influent extract may be explained by deconjugation carballa et al 2004 d ascenzo et al 2003 or transformation of steroid hormone metabolites during water treatment weber et al 2005 while loss of bioactivity was mainly observed fractions in er 14 min and gr 16 min were increasingly active in effluent compared to influent this may indicate the presence of bioactive products formed during the wwtp treatment however no compounds could be identified filtering of masses observed in the same active fractions from different samples aided in selecting relevant masses for identification this indicated that the identification process can be further improved by developing a database of masses associated with active fractions over a large number of samples additional ms analysis in negative mode under the same chromatographic conditions further increased the number of detected masses this however did not improve the detection of common hormones at the present concentrations analyzing samples in negative ionization mode with optimized eluents i e at basic ph levels may increase the ionization of compounds and improve their detection however a separate fractionation and bioassay analysis is required for each sample as retention times are shifted under different chromatographic conditions for the complete identification of bioactive compounds in waste water samples additional approaches may be required for instance separation of co eluting compounds in exceedingly complex mixtures like wastewater can be improved through application of different lc methods like two dimensional liquid chromatography lc x lc ouyang et al 2016 alternatively during ms analysis atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci or atmospheric pressure photoionization appi can be used to detect compounds that are poorly ionized by esi different extraction methods and chromatography conditions may be used to measure different classes of compounds polar compounds are poorly retained during spe of the large volumes required to sufficiently concentrate compounds and remain undetectable to improve detection of polar compounds samples can be extracted with optimized spe methods and separated on a hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic column this would allow detection identification and investigation of persistent polar compounds that are poorly removed during wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2016 combining a number of these approaches which double the number of pipetting steps with each additional fractionation will be feasible with the introduction of automated liquid handling in addition routine eda of environmental samples depends on processing of a large number of samples followed by rapid and complete identification automation in bioassay analysis and identification will therefore be a requirement for future optimization of the ht eda platform for application in routine analysis of aquatic samples 4 conclusion hyphenation of the downscaled luminescent ames test and cell based reporter gene assays to a high resolution fractionation setup enabled detection of mutagenicity and endocrine disruptive potency in sample fractions respectively mutagenicity and ar er and gr activity could be analyzed in 228 fractions collected from surface and wwtp influent effluent water extracts and were detected in all samples the identification process could be improved through selection of masses detected in active fractions at the same retention time over multiple extracts reducing the number of masses to analyze eight compounds were tentatively identified as active compounds from which bta and androstenedione were further investigated and confirmed as active mutagen and androgen respectively introduction of the downscaled luminescent ames test to the ht eda platform enables rapid detection of mutagenicity in addition to endocrine disruption at high resolution and allows future application in the detection and identification of novel mutagenic toxicants during routine monitoring of the drinking water production process to fully exploit the power of ht eda the lack of standards for confirmation studies such as in this case with deg bdcipp should be addressed possibly with the support of regulatory bodies for instance by hosting a repository of

remove nitrate from water or wastewater lacking organic carbon sources and ph is one of its most important process parameters hcl and co2 addition are known as adequate ph control methods for practical purposes however because of h2 added co2 may participate in microbial metabolisms and affect denitrification mechanisms here a combined micro electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification cead reactor in which h2 is generated based on galvanic cell reactions between zero valent iron and carbon was optimized and continuously operated for 233 days by adding hcl or co2 to control ph in the range of 7 2 8 2 microbial communities were compared between the two ph control methods through high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna nirs and nirk genes under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 in the influent with 36 mgno3 n l when adding hcl the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency reached 91 4 0 9 with a 28 h hydraulic retention time hrt when adding co2 the tn removal efficiency was improved to 96 5 1 7 with 24 h hrt significant differences of 16s rrna and nirs genes between the two ph control stages indicated the variation of microbial communities and nirs type denitrifiers with hcl addition thiobacillus unclassified comamonadaceae arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas which were reported previously as likely autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrifiers were most dominant in the biofilms with co2 addition the biofilms became dominated by anaerolineaceae and methylocystaceae related to organic carbon metabolism denitratisoma likely heterotrophic denitrifier and uncultured bacteria tk10 and akyg587 the results suggest that the added co2 not only contributed to ph control but also participated in microbial metabolisms this study provides useful insights into microbial mechanisms and further optimization of h2 based autotrophic denitrification in water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords autotrophic denitrification zero valent iron carbon dioxide high throughput sequencing microbial community 1 introduction in a water environment nitrogen pollutants can cause eutrophication and potentially harm human health rivett et al 2008 biological heterotrophic denitrification in which microorganisms usually rely on organic carbon to obtain electron donors is widely used for removing oxidized inorganic nitrogen in water and wastewater treatment processes gan et al 2019 in some cases polluted water such as groundwater contaminated by nitrate or secondary effluent requiring advanced nitrogen removal is characterized by a low cod n ratio and therefore lacks organic carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrification rivett et al 2008 pelaz et al 2018 accordingly dosing with exogenous organic carbon such as methanol and acetate is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of denitrification however this method is unsustainable costly and may lead to the secondary pollution of organics or nitrite accumulation when the added organic carbon is excessive or insufficient park and yoo 2009 alzate marin et al 2016 autotrophic denitrification in which inorganic electron donors and carbon sources are utilized to reduce nitrate was recently reported to be attractive for water and wastewater treatment under low cod n conditions park and yoo 2009 di capua et al 2015 h2 based autotrophic denitrification which includes hydrogenotrophic denitrification karanasios et al 2010 zero valent iron zvi supported biological denitrification xu et al 2017b and bio electrochemical denitrification ghafari et al 2008 has attracted widespread attention in our previous studies we developed an innovative process of combined micro electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification cead based on nitrate removal mechanisms similar to zvi supported biological denitrification xing et al 2016 in cead iron carbon micro electrolysis carriers mecs filled in the reactor provide h2 based on numerous galvanic cell reactions between zvi and carbon promoting the growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria h2 based autotrophic denitrification has been proven to be an effective process for nitrate removal sunger and bose 2009 karanasios et al 2010 mousavi et al 2012 however ph is one of the most important parameters affecting its performance ghafari et al 2010b mousavi et al 2012 many researchers have pointed out that the optimum ph value for hydrogenotrophic denitrification which related to the different hydrogenotrophic cultures used is in the range of 7 6 8 6 with higher ph values resulting in lowered nitrate removal lee and rittmann 2003 karanasios et al 2010 till et al 1998 reported that hydrogenotrophic denitrification was inhibited at ph of 10 or greater on the other hand in many studies on h2 based autotrophic denitrification the significant ph increases to 9 5 or even greater were reported without adequate ph control karanasios et al 2010 xing et al 2016 therefore implementing ph control for optimized bacterial growth could benefit h2 based autotrophic denitrification particularly in zvi supported biological denitrification abiotic reduction of nitrate to ammonium occurred at the same time and inoculating hydrogenotrophic denitrifiers was effective at decreasing the generation of ammonium an et al 2009 di capua et al 2019 considering the completion of abiotic reduction and biological denitrification providing the optimal ph required to enhance biological denitrification could help further reduce undesired ammonium in effluents some researchers controlled the ph in h2 based autotrophic denitrification using phosphate buffers lee and rittmann 2003 zhang et al 2019 however phosphate buffers are only suitable for studies on a lab scale for practical purposes continuous acid supplements such as hcl and co2 have been investigated for ph control in h2 based autotrophic denitrification sakakibara and nakayama 2001 ghafari et al 2010a xia et al 2015 ghafari et al 2009 found that continuous sparging of co2 gas was difficult to control causing the ph to decrease dramatically to the range of 5 5 6 thereby inhibiting denitrification however xia et al 2015 proved that the sparging of co2 through membranes was suitable for accurate ph control and stable operation regarding ph control for h2 based autotrophic denitrification previous studies mainly focused on process performances and kinetic parameters ghafari et al 2010b tang et al 2011 xia et al 2015 because of the existence of h2 in the autotrophic denitrification system the added co2 may result in acetogenesis from its reaction with h2 marshall et al 2013 established a microbial electrosynthesis system for consuming co2 and generating acetate and h2 and they found that the acetogen acetobacterium spp dominated the active microbial population on the cathodes usher et al 2015 reported that co2 was reduced and fixed as acetate on the corrosion of steel via h2 production it is hypothesized that the added co2 may not only affect the ph value in h2 based autotrophic denitrification but also participate in carbon and nitrogen metabolism to our knowledge relevant studies on microbial communities and mechanisms in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with co2 addition are rare only xia et al 2016 reported on microbial communities in a hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactor under co2 addition however they mainly focused on the performance and model without discussing if the co2 addition affected the microbial communities a comparison of microbial communities in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with and without co2 is worth further study and the knowledge gap regarding the effect of co2 on microbial mechanisms should be considered further in the present study two ph control strategies namely hcl addition and co2 addition were implemented in the 5 73 l h2 based cead reactor we developed previously xing et al 2016 using synthetic water under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 with no3 n 36 mgno3 n l as the influent the reactor was operated continuously for 233 days under ph control under two strategies the ph ranges in stable stages were maintained between 7 2 and 8 2 microbial communities in the two ph control strategies were investigated through high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna nirs and nirk genes the purpose of the study was to investigate both the reactor performance and microbial communities in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with ph control and specifically determine whether co2 addition affects the microbial communities and microbial metabolisms the findings could help to improve the process performance by ph control and provide useful insights into microbial mechanisms of h2 based autotrophic denitrification in water and wastewater treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor structure the reactor was constructed with a plexiglass cylinder 120 cm in height and 9 cm in inner diameter as illustrated in fig 1 the influent was pumped in from the bottom with a water pump aks603nhp0800 seko co ltd italy and the effluent was discharged from the top a water bath jacket with a thermometer was installed to control the temperature in the reactor the mecs developed in our laboratory were filled in the reactor to a height of 90 cm resulting in an effective volume of 5 73 l and a filling water volume of 3 62 l as previously reported deng et al 2016 xing et al 2018 the mecs were produced with powdered iron 17 5 volume scrap iron 25 0 volume powdered activated carbon 35 0 volume passed through a 200 mesh screen three types of catalysts each of 2 5 volume adhesive x 10 0 volume and foaming agent y 5 0 volume and were roasted in an oxygen free atmosphere at 900 1000 c for 3 h the mecs possessed a diameter of 0 5 1 0 cm a specific surface area of 3 3 104 4 2 104 m2 kg and a porosity of 50 based on galvanic cell reactions which occurred between anodes zvi and cathodes activated carbon in mecs h2 was generated thus supporting the autotrophic denitrifiers the detailed mechanisms of this process are described in the supporting information fig s1 in this study to further enhance biological denitrification and improve the total nitrogen tn removal the previously reported reactor was optimized as follows first a ph control module providing either hcl or co2 was installed when adjusting the ph with diluted hcl as shown in the red box in fig 1 the acid storage tank was filled with 1 100 diluted hcl and the acid peristaltic pump was started by a timer for 1 min every 2 h to inject hcl into the reactor each time 10 ml of diluted hcl was added and the ph in the reactor changed periodically during the hcl addition cycles as shown in fig s2 a when adjusting the ph with co2 it was continuously sprayed into the reactor using a module of polypropylene hollow fiber membranes which was submerged in water at the top of the reactor as shown in the green box in fig 1 thus ph was maintained by adjusting the co2 flow rate and the ph value in the reactor could be more stable than with hcl addition as illustrated in fig s2 b second to ensure good mixing and flush generated precipitation on carriers internal circulation was added the water was pumped from the top to the bottom by a circulation pump mp 20rz xinxishan co ltd shanghai china with a circulation ratio i e circulation pump flow influent flow of 10 1 2 2 experimental operation of the reactor the reactor was inoculated with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing that was applied to an anaerobic anoxic oxic process before this study began it continuously run for approximately 8 months without ph control resulting in a ph of greater than 10 in effluents for a long time and tn removal efficiencies lower than 40 the representative results were shown in fig s3 the first day of this study was defined as the day on which ph control was started and the reactor operation was divided into two stages stage a days 1 95 in which ph was controlled by diluted hcl and stage b days 118 233 in which ph was controlled by co2 addition between days 96 and 117 the reactor was maintained at the conditions of stage a but was not monitored nine specific stages were defined with different ph control methods and hrts as listed in table 1 considering nitrogen contaminated natural water is usually organic limited rather than organic free synthetic influent containing 36 mg l no3 n with a low cod n ratio of 0 5 was prepared with tap water for simulating the actual water quality with organic limited conditions cod was prepared with ch3coona which could theoretically remove 6 3 mg l no3 n through heterotrophic denitrification according to the stoichiometric equation s5 in the supporting information the influent also contained 280 mg l nahco3 and a 1 ml l trace element solution till et al 1998 although the co2 added in stage b could also supply inorganic carbon for autotrophic denitrification thereby replacing nahco3 the same concentration of nahco3 was used in all influents for the entire 233 day operation period for the purpose of comparison the initial ph of the influent was 8 0 the temperature of the reactor was

days at stage a is shown in fig 2 in prior of stage a 1 without ph control the ph values in the effluents were observed to be higher than 10 for a long time then ph control strategy was implemented and the hcl dosage was adjusted frequently at stage a 1 to determine the optimal dosage resulting in ph fluctuation in the effluent 7 6 0 5 in this period during the first 10 days of stage a 1 the nitrate removal efficiency reached 88 7 4 1 but the tn removal efficiency was only 35 5 3 0 because of significant ammonium and nitrite accumulation from the end of stage a 1 the hcl dosage was maintained at 10 ml per 2 h whereby the daily effluent ph stabilized at 7 9 0 2 afterwards at the end of stage a 1 with an hrt of 32 h the nitrate removal efficiency was observed at 94 5 1 7 and the tn removal efficiency increased significantly to 85 9 4 9 indicating that tn removal increased significantly during this stage at stage a 2 when the hrt was shortened to 28 h the tn removal efficiency dropped at the beginning then recovered to 91 4 0 9 from the 51st day the sludge sampling resulted in a decrease of tn removal efficiency and the residual tn was mainly attributed to the unreacted nitrate and generated ammonium then tn removal efficiency increased again to 88 4 3 3 at the end of stage a 2 at stage a 3 when the hrt was further shortened to 20 h the nitrate and tn removal efficiencies were 94 8 1 6 and 82 7 4 1 respectively these results indicate that tn removal efficiency is more significantly affected than nitrate removal efficiency in general hcl ph control resulted in good tn removal performance under weak alkaline conditions in the reactor under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 with an hrt of 28 h the tn concentration in effluents was observed at 3 18 0 34 mg l and the nitrate and tn removal rates were calculated as 29 7 1 0 mgn l d and 28 9 0 9 mgn l d respectively at stage a 3 the highest nitrate and tn removal rates reached 41 5 0 9 mgn l d and 36 2 1 8 mgn l d respectively 3 2 nitrogen removal performance with co2 addition the ph control strategy was changed to co2 addition during days 118 233 stage b the reactor performance at stage b is shown in fig 3 at the beginning of stage b 1 we also adjusted the co2 flow rate to test the optimal dosage which led to ph instability in the effluent 7 6 0 4 from the end of stage b 1 the co2 flow rate was fixed at 2 ml min the tn removal efficiency increased to 93 8 1 6 with an hrt of 24 h at the end of stage b 1 and 95 6 1 7 with an hrt of 18 h in stage b 2 however when the hrt was shortened to 12 h the tn removal efficiency gradually decreased to 63 3 4 0 at the end of stage b 3 at the same time the ph in the effluent increased from 7 5 0 1 in stage b 2 to 7 9 0 1 in stage b 3 with the same co2 dosage to avoid the potential effects caused by ph variation the co2 flow rate at stage b 4 was increased to 3 ml min this operation recovered ph in the effluent to 7 4 0 1 in stage b 4 but the tn removal efficiency was still at 62 2 4 3 this may indicate that the reactor performance is not sensitive to ph values in the range of 7 5 8 0 therefore we increased the hrt to 24 h again and found that the tn removal efficiency returned to 96 5 1 7 in the entire co2 addition period the average nitrate removal efficiency stably reached 97 8 1 9 the tn concentration in effluents was maintained at 1 72 0 90 mg l with an hrt of 24 h the nitrate and tn removal rates were calculated as 37 0 0 3 mgn l d and 36 0 0 6 mgn l d respectively in the end of stage b 6 with the highest removal efficiency the highest nitrate and tn removal rates reached 72 3 0 9 mgn l d and 50 9 2 9 mgn l d respectively in the end of stage b 3 with an hrt of 12 h it is worth noting that residual tn in the effluent at stage b was dominated by nitrite rather than ammonium which was dominant in stage a 3 3 comparison of microbial communities between hcl and co2 addition 3 3 1 high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna the compositions of microbial communities in the eight samples were analysed by high throughput sequencing rarefaction curves and rank abundance curves of the 16s rrna gene are shown in fig s4 indicating that high throughput sequencing data effectively represented the microbial communities the community richness and diversity indices based on the 16s rrna gene are shown in table s1 in the supporting information the microbial communities at class family and genus levels are shown in fig s5 a heat map and pca are shown in fig 4 at stage a the microbial communities in 1t 1m and 1b were clustered together but those in the suspended sludge sample 1s were different from those in the three biofilm samples attached to the mecs at stage b the microbial communities of 2t 2m 2b and 2s were clustered together but differed significantly from those at stage a in 1t 1m and 1b the genus thiobacillus affiliated with the family hydrogenophilaceae was predominant accounting for 5 0 14 2 and 13 6 respectively other dominant microbes in these three samples included genera arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas as well as unclassified bacteria in the family comamonadaceae it was verified in our previous work that these microorganisms represent the dominant autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the system xing et al 2016 2018 in 1s the proportions of thiobacillus and thermomonas were significantly lower than in 1t 1m and 1b while the proportions of the genus arenimonas and family comamonadaceae were similar additionally the proportion of the family anaerolineaceae was significantly higher in 1s in the four samples at stage b the family anaerolineaceae was predominant with a proportion of 16 3 3 2 moreover uncultured bacteria tk10 unclassified bacteria in the family methylocystaceae genus denitratisoma and uncultured bacteria akyg587 which had proportions of 0 7 0 4 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 and 0 1 at stage a increased to 9 5 0 5 7 4 1 3 5 4 2 0 and 5 3 1 1 at stage b respectively the proportions of the family comamonadaceae at stage a 5 9 2 1 and stage b 3 1 0 3 showed an insignificant difference 3 3 2 high throughput sequencing of nirs and nirk the results of high throughput sequencing based on nirs and nirk were analysed to investigate denitrifiers in the reactor rarefaction curves and rank abundance curves are shown in figs s6 and s7 the richness and diversity indices based on nirs and nirk gene are shown in tables s2 and s3 the analysis indicated that most otus could not be classified into subdivision levels these otus were classified as proteobacteria at the phylum level or no rank bacteria here we discuss the results at the otu level the heat map and pca are shown in fig 5 nirs and s8 nirk respectively dominant otus with proportions higher than 2 were selected to generate phylogenetic trees as shown in fig 6 nirs and s9 nirk similar to the results with 16s rrna the nirs genes from the two stages were significantly different for example the nirs otu 380 which was clustered with uncultured bacteria and thiobacillus sp accounted for 10 7 4 1 in 1t 1m and 1b from stage a but reduced significantly in stage b the nirs otus 24 66 49 and 44 which were almost zero at stage a increased significantly to 17 7 1 0 11 7 0 7 9 6 0 7 and 8 4 1 2 respectively in 2t 2m and 2b these abundant nirs otus were clustered with uncultured bacteria and rhodocyclaceae rhodocyclales bacteria although many nirs otus were only clustered with uncultured bacteria these results indicate that the nirs type denitrifiers were significantly different between the two stages according to the sequencing analysis of nirk more than 60 of the total sequences could be classified as the nirk otu 158 indicating that this otu was the major nirk type denitrifier in the reactor other otus also showed significant differences between the two stages for example the nirk otus 155 and 75 were dominant in 1t 1m and 1b the nirk otus 2 and 21 increased significantly to 19 2 2 1 and 15 0 0 1 respectively in 2t 2m and 2b however the phylogenetic analysis revealed that most nirk otus were only clustered with uncultured bacteria 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different ph control strategies on nitrogen removal in the current study the results indicate that good performances were achieved when both of the ph control strategies were applied in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification system in stable stages the tn removal efficiency was 91 4 0 9 with hcl addition at an hrt of 28 h and it reached 96 5 1 7 with co2 addition at an hrt of 24 h with hcl or co2 addition the highest nitrate removal rates were 41 5 0 9 mgn l d and 72 3 0 9 mgn l d respectively the nitrate removal mechanisms in the current study were similar to those of zvi supported biological denitrification as shown in the supporting information i e the major reactions in the reactor are hydrogenotrophic denitrification biological reaction and ammonium generation from zvi abiotic reaction till et al 1998 in studies on zvi supported biological denitrification sunger and bose 2009 applied an influent nitrate loading of 0 029 mgn l d and achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of 95 with a long hrt of 15 6 days till et al 1998 fed 50 mg l no3 n into the influent and achieved a stable nitrate removal efficiency of 61 under an hrt of 2 33 days however 50 of the removed nitrate was converted to ammonium and the nitrate removal rate was calculated as 0 012 mgn l d the removal rates were low and limited by hydrogen generation through zvi corrosion biswas and bose 2005 by using a high biomass of 3930 100 mg mlss l in an sbr wang et al 2012 obtained a nitrate removal rate as high as 52 32 mgn l d with nitrate removal efficiency of 79 8 in a recent literature zhang et al 2019 the effect of initial nitrate concentration ph and zvi dosage on the nitrate removal rate were investigated and the results showed that three days were required to achieve complete nitrate removal under the optimal conditions 25 mg no3 n l in influents ammonium accumulation resulting in low tn removal was often reported in zvi supported biological denitrification di capua et al 2015 xie et al 2017 the treatment target of this current study is to achieve high and stable tn removal efficiencies and the results were satisfactory in addition the nitrate removal rates were better than most results obtained in comparable studies on zvi supported biological denitrification as shown in the supporting information the required h2 in the reactor was produced by galvanic cell reactions in mecs eq s2 thus nitrate removal rate could be improved by promoting electron transfer between anodes zvi and cathodes carbon xing et al 2016 in a comparison with those reported in hydrogenotrophic denitrification for example a maximum of 770 mgn l d ergas and reuss 2001 the nitrate removal rates in this study as well as the other studies on zvi supported biological denitrification were much lower this is because the h2 in the reactor was generated in situ from zvi rather than a directly supply which reduces risks associated with h2 storage and explosions therefore although biological denitrification based on zvi has the drawback of low removal rate zvi was considered environmentally friendly non toxic abundant with versatile functions as a reductant sorbent and coagulant fu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 and the zvi supported biological denitrification was easy to handle and especially suitable for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater or surface water di capua et al 2019 additionally compared with the results in the beginning of stage a 1 controlling ph stably in neutral or weakly alkaline ranges 7 5 8 0 achieved good performance with much less ammonium or nitrite accumulation karanasios et al 2010 have reported that an increase of the ph value above 8 6 could significantly decrease the nitrate removal rate in hydrogenotrophic denitrification but low ph values of 7 or below could also inhibit biological reactions in abiotic reduction of nitrates using zvi it was reported that decreasing ph values in the acidic range increased nitrate reduction rates however lower ph accelerated the formation of undesired ammonium rather than nitrogen gas hu et al 2001 alowitz and scherer 2002 for biological denitrification based on zvi the factors for promoting biological reaction rapidly generating of h2 through abiotic reaction and decreasing of ammonium should be considered as a whole therefore ph control in a precise and quantitative method is crucial and warrants further study 4 2 effects of different ph control strategies on microbial communities the microbial communities and nirs nirk genes presented significant differences between stage a and stage b since the carriers were direct sources of h2 produced in this reactor the autotrophic denitrification cloud mainly occurs in the biofilms attached to the carriers additionally owing to the internal water circulation from the top to the bottom the microbial communities in the three biofilm samples were similar for both stages at stage a genera thiobacillus arenimonas and thermomonas as well as unclassified bacteria in the family comamonadaceae were the dominant bacteria in 1t 1m and 1b bacteria in these genera and family are often detected in denitrification systems for wastewater treatment adav et al 2010 liu et al 2015 in our previous studies with dna based stable isotope probing dna sip thiobacillus like and thermomonas like bacteria have been identified as the typical autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in similar systems xing et al 2017 2018 it is reasonable that the proportion of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria reduced significantly in the suspended sludge sample 1s comamonas like genus of the family comamonadaceae and arenimonas like bacteria were identified as heterotrophic and mixotrophic with dna sip respectively xing et al 2018 the proportions of unclassified comamonadaceae and arenimonas did not change significantly in 1s heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the reactor because of the low concentration of acetate added in the influent and the organics decomposed from sludge which could function as an organic carbon source at stage b it was surprising that the proportions of genera thiobacillus thermomonas and arenimonas decreased significantly in all samples 2t 2m 2b and 2s this result indicated that the typical autotrophic or mixotrophic denitrifiers in the reactor declined after co2 addition although the tn removal performance was still satisfactory the family comamonadaceae likely containing heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria wang and chu 2016 showed similar proportions in the two stages however at stage b the genus denitratisoma increased to 6 5 0 8 in three biofilm samples 2t 2m and 2b and 2 0 in the suspend sludge sample 2t the 16s rrna gene of the representative otu showed 97 similarity with denitratisoma oestradiolicum which was reported to be a heterotrophic denitrifier isolated from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant fahrbach et al 2006 species in this genus have been proven to be dominant succinate assimilating denitrifiers by dna sip saito et al 2008 and have been detected commonly as heterotrophic denitrifiers in domestic wastewater treatment ma et al 2015 xu et al 2017a overall based on currently known denitrifying bacteria it showed that autotrophic denitrifiers were weakened and heterotrophic denitrifiers were strengthened after co2 addition although the 16s rrna gene based approach is the most widely used technique for community analysis in wastewater treatment systems sanz and köchling 2007 simply studying the 16s rrna gene is not sufficient to reveal the difference in denitrifiers in this instance high throughput sequencing of functional genes nirs and nirk were also carried out in this study tables s1 s3 showed that the richness and diversity of the four samples in stage b were lower than those in stage a this trend is the same for nirs and nirk genes as well as the 16s rrna gene indicating that co2 addition is a selection factor for both microbial communities and denitrifiers comparing the heat maps in figs 4 and 5 it can been seen that both microbial community and nirs type denitrifiers varied significantly after co2 addition and the results of 16s rrna and nirs genes showed similar trends the phylogenetic tree in fig 6 showed that the nirs otus that were clustered with thiobacillus sp decreased but those in cluster ⅲ that were affiliated with rhodocyclaceae rhodocyclales bacteria increased significantly in stage b as genus denitratisoma belongs to class rhodocyclaceae and order rhodocyclales this implies that the results of nirs and 16s rrna genes were also consistent in this aspect however studies on nirs and nirk genes have some limitations due to the lack of registered sequence data in the database and most of the registered nirs and nirk sequences are retrieved from uncultured clones osaka et al 2006 in this study most of the nirs and the nirk genes were affiliated with uncultured bacteria rather than sequences from known bacteria therefore further studies are required and technological advances are expected in the future in a comparison of the microbial communities in two stages besides the proportion of denitrifiers the abundance of microbes related to carbon metabolism also changed significantly firstly the family anaerolineaceae presented low proportions in 1t 1m and 1b but high proportions in 1s and the four stage b samples most species of anaerolineaceae have been reported to have a fermentative metabolism degrading carbohydrates and proteinaceous carbon sources under anaerobic conditions liang et al 2015 mcilroy et al 2017 in the suspended sludge samples 1s and 2s anaerolineaceae like bacteria may participate in sludge decay for biofilm samples attached to the carriers the proportion of anaerolineaceae increased significantly after co2 addition indicating that the organic carbon metabolism was enhanced because of the low cod concentration supplied in the influent the biomass is unlikely to increase significantly to become the primary organic carbon source which implies that co2 probably participated in the generation of organic carbon in the reactor in addition the abundance of methylocystaceae increased to 7 4 1 3 in stage b the 16s rrna gene of the presentative otu showed 99 similarity with methylocystis hirsuta which has been reported to be a type ii methane oxidizing bacteria lindner et al 2007 the growth of methane oxidizing bacteria usually relies on methane recently it has been reported that m hirsute can also use volatile fatty acids including acetic propionic and butyric acids as the sole carbon and energy source for growth lópez et al 2018 in the current study it seems that co2 addition was responsible for the growth of methylocystis like bacteria in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification reactor however the detailed metabolism to support the growth of methylocystis like bacteria needs to be further studied however in the dominated otus none was identified as being highly similar to the acknowledged acetogens most known acetogens have been reported within the genera clostridium or acetobacterium drake et al 2008 sewell et al 2017 which were detected but not abundant in the reactor although it remains unclear if acetogenesis took place in the reactor co2 addition did induce the changes of microbes related to organic carbon metabolism especially those of the families anaerolineaceae and methylocystaceae determining how the co2 affect the organic carbon metabolism in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification system is a potential topic for further studies 4 3 implications and perspectives the results revealed that both the hcl addition and the co2 addition contributed to ph control in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification systems and resulted in good nitrogen removal performance in particular co2 addition changed the microbial communities and participated in microbial metabolisms supplying co2 in h2 based autotrophic denitrification enhanced organic carbon metabolism in the system thus promoting heterotrophic denitrification since heterotrophic denitrifiers normally grow faster than autotrophic denitrifiers the combined heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification could achieve higher nitrate removal rates however rapid growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers may imply more sludge production which mitigates the superiority of autotrophic denitrification in sludge management therefore the two strategies for ph control both have advantages and disadvantages it is worth noting that the electrons provided by h2 can be utilized either in autotrophic denitrification or to participate in carbon metabolism together with co2 for heterotrophic denitrification from this point of view similar amount of electrons are ultimately required in both cases for similar nitrate removal however electricity utilization efficiencies and rates in autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification are worth studying further moreover economic and environmental issues are crucial for prospective large scale application and co2 addition can benefit greenhouse gas reduction and lower costs by using co2 originated from industrial exhaust gas rather than pure product the emission of n2o should also be monitored to quantify the global warming potentials in addition the accuracy ph control with precise quantification of hcl and co2 addition is important to quantitatively verify their effects in h2 based autotrophic denitrification in further studies last but not least comprehensive investigation of the biological reaction mechanisms is required by applying other advanced methods and techniques 5 conclusions in this study two ph control strategies namely hcl addition and co2 addition were implemented in a h2 based autotrophic denitrification reactor the nitrogen removal performance and microbial communities were compared between the two strategies the main conclusions are as follows 1 good performances were achieved when applying both of the ph control strategies in the cead a modified zvi supported biological denitrification reactor with low accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in stable stages the highest tn removal efficiency was 91 4 0 9 for hcl addition at an hrt of 28 h and the tn removal efficiency reached 96 5 1 7 for co2 addition at an hrt of 24 h 2 high throughput sequencing revealed similar results in the three biofilm samples for each stage however the microbial communities and nirs type denitrifiers were significantly affected by co2 addition i e the abundance of thiobacillus arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas decreased and the abundance of anaerolineaceae methylocystaceae and denitratisoma increased significantly with co2 addition these results indicated that the typical autotrophic denitrifiers declined but carbon metabolism and heterotrophic denitrification were strengthened with co2 addition this study showed for the first time that co2 addition in h2 based autotrophic denitrification essentially affects the microbial communities and denitrification mechanisms the findings could help to improve optimization of h2 based autotrophic denitrification especially zvi supported autotrophic denitrification in

remove nitrate from water or wastewater lacking organic carbon sources and ph is one of its most important process parameters hcl and co2 addition are known as adequate ph control methods for practical purposes however because of h2 added co2 may participate in microbial metabolisms and affect denitrification mechanisms here a combined micro electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification cead reactor in which h2 is generated based on galvanic cell reactions between zero valent iron and carbon was optimized and continuously operated for 233 days by adding hcl or co2 to control ph in the range of 7 2 8 2 microbial communities were compared between the two ph control methods through high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna nirs and nirk genes under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 in the influent with 36 mgno3 n l when adding hcl the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency reached 91 4 0 9 with a 28 h hydraulic retention time hrt when adding co2 the tn removal efficiency was improved to 96 5 1 7 with 24 h hrt significant differences of 16s rrna and nirs genes between the two ph control stages indicated the variation of microbial communities and nirs type denitrifiers with hcl addition thiobacillus unclassified comamonadaceae arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas which were reported previously as likely autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrifiers were most dominant in the biofilms with co2 addition the biofilms became dominated by anaerolineaceae and methylocystaceae related to organic carbon metabolism denitratisoma likely heterotrophic denitrifier and uncultured bacteria tk10 and akyg587 the results suggest that the added co2 not only contributed to ph control but also participated in microbial metabolisms this study provides useful insights into microbial

heterotrophic denitrification in which microorganisms usually rely on organic carbon to obtain electron donors is widely used for removing oxidized inorganic nitrogen in water and wastewater treatment processes gan et al 2019 in some cases polluted water such as groundwater contaminated by nitrate or secondary effluent requiring advanced nitrogen removal is characterized by a low cod n ratio and therefore lacks organic carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrification rivett et al 2008 pelaz et al 2018 accordingly dosing with exogenous organic carbon such as methanol and acetate is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of denitrification however this method is unsustainable costly and may lead to the secondary pollution of organics or nitrite accumulation when the added organic carbon is excessive or insufficient park and yoo 2009 alzate marin et al 2016 autotrophic denitrification in which inorganic electron donors and carbon sources are utilized to reduce nitrate was recently

denitrification karanasios et al 2010 zero valent iron zvi supported biological denitrification xu et al 2017b and bio electrochemical denitrification ghafari et al 2008 has attracted widespread attention in our previous studies we developed an innovative process of combined micro electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification cead based on nitrate removal mechanisms similar to zvi supported biological denitrification xing et al 2016 in cead iron carbon micro electrolysis carriers mecs filled in the reactor provide h2 based on numerous galvanic cell reactions between zvi and carbon promoting the growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria h2 based autotrophic denitrification has been proven to be an effective process for nitrate removal sunger and bose 2009 karanasios et al 2010 mousavi et al 2012 however ph is one of the most important parameters affecting its performance ghafari et al 2010b mousavi et al 2012 many researchers have pointed out that the optimum ph value for hydrogenotrophic denitrification which related to the different hydrogenotrophic cultures used is in the range of 7 6 8 6 with higher ph values resulting in lowered nitrate removal lee and rittmann 2003 karanasios et al 2010 till et al 1998 reported that hydrogenotrophic denitrification was inhibited at ph of 10 or greater on the other hand in many studies on h2 based autotrophic denitrification the significant ph increases to 9 5 or even greater were reported without adequate ph control karanasios et al 2010 xing et al 2016 therefore implementing ph control for optimized bacterial growth

denitrification using phosphate buffers lee and rittmann 2003 zhang et al 2019 however phosphate buffers are only suitable for studies on a lab scale for practical purposes continuous acid supplements such as hcl and co2 have been investigated for ph control in h2 based autotrophic denitrification sakakibara and nakayama 2001 ghafari et al 2010a xia et al 2015 ghafari et al 2009 found that continuous sparging of co2 gas was difficult to control causing the ph to decrease dramatically to the range of 5 5 6 thereby inhibiting denitrification however xia et al 2015 proved that the sparging of co2 through membranes was suitable for accurate ph control and stable operation regarding ph control for h2 based autotrophic denitrification previous studies mainly focused on process performances and kinetic parameters ghafari et al 2010b tang et al 2011 xia et al 2015 because of the existence of h2 in the autotrophic denitrification system the added co2 may result in acetogenesis from its reaction with h2 marshall et al 2013 established a microbial electrosynthesis system for consuming co2 and generating acetate and h2 and they found that the acetogen acetobacterium spp dominated the active microbial population on the cathodes usher et al 2015 reported that co2 was reduced and fixed as acetate on the corrosion of steel via h2 production it is hypothesized that the added co2 may not only affect the ph value in h2 based autotrophic denitrification but also participate in carbon and nitrogen metabolism to our knowledge relevant studies on microbial communities and mechanisms in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with co2 addition are rare only xia et al 2016 reported on microbial communities in a hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactor under co2 addition however they mainly focused on the performance and model without discussing if the co2 addition affected the microbial communities a comparison of microbial communities in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with and without co2 is worth further study and the knowledge gap regarding the effect of co2 on microbial mechanisms should be considered further in the present study two ph control strategies namely hcl addition and co2 addition were implemented in the 5 73 l h2 based cead reactor we developed previously xing et al 2016 using synthetic water under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 with no3 n 36 mgno3 n l as the influent the reactor was operated continuously for 233 days under ph control under two strategies the ph ranges in stable stages were maintained between 7 2 and 8 2 microbial communities in the two ph control strategies were investigated through high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna nirs and nirk genes the purpose of the study was to investigate both the reactor performance and microbial communities in h2 based autotrophic denitrification with ph control and specifically determine whether co2 addition affects the microbial communities and microbial metabolisms the findings could help to improve the process performance by ph control and provide useful insights into microbial mechanisms of h2 based autotrophic denitrification in water and wastewater treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor structure the reactor was constructed with a plexiglass cylinder 120 cm in height and 9 cm in inner diameter as illustrated in fig 1 the influent was pumped in from the bottom with a water pump aks603nhp0800 seko co ltd italy and the effluent was discharged from the top a water bath jacket with a thermometer was installed to control the temperature in the reactor the mecs developed in our laboratory were filled in the reactor to a height of 90 cm resulting in an effective volume of 5 73 l and a filling water volume of 3 62 l as previously reported deng et al 2016 xing et al 2018 the mecs were produced with powdered iron 17 5 volume scrap iron 25 0 volume powdered activated carbon 35 0 volume passed through a 200 mesh screen three types of catalysts each of 2 5 volume adhesive x 10 0 volume and foaming agent y 5 0 volume and were roasted in an oxygen free atmosphere at 900 1000 c for 3 h the mecs possessed a diameter of 0 5 1 0 cm a specific surface area of 3 3 104 4 2 104 m2 kg and a porosity of 50 based on galvanic cell reactions which occurred between anodes zvi and cathodes activated carbon in mecs h2 was generated thus supporting the autotrophic denitrifiers the detailed mechanisms of this process are described in the supporting information fig s1 in this study to further enhance biological denitrification and improve the total nitrogen tn removal the previously reported reactor was optimized as follows first a ph control module providing either hcl or co2 was installed when adjusting the ph with diluted hcl as shown in the red box in fig 1 the acid storage tank was filled with 1 100 diluted hcl and the acid peristaltic pump was started by a timer for 1 min every 2 h to inject hcl into the reactor each time 10 ml of diluted hcl was added and the ph in the reactor changed periodically during the hcl addition cycles as shown in fig s2 a when adjusting the ph with co2 it was continuously sprayed into the reactor using a module of polypropylene hollow fiber membranes which was submerged in water at the top of the reactor as shown in the green box in fig 1 thus ph was maintained by adjusting the co2 flow rate and the ph value in the reactor could be more stable than with hcl addition as illustrated in fig s2 b second to ensure good mixing and flush generated precipitation on carriers internal circulation was added the water was pumped from the top to the bottom by a circulation pump mp 20rz xinxishan co ltd shanghai china with a circulation ratio i e circulation pump flow influent flow of 10 1 2 2 experimental operation of the reactor the reactor was inoculated with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing that was applied to an anaerobic anoxic oxic process before this study began it continuously run for approximately 8 months without ph control resulting in a ph of greater than 10 in effluents for a long time and tn removal efficiencies lower than 40 the representative results were shown in fig s3 the first day of this study was defined as the day on which ph control was started and the reactor operation was divided into two stages stage a days 1 95 in which ph was controlled by diluted hcl and stage b days 118 233 in which ph was controlled by co2 addition between days 96 and 117 the reactor was maintained at the conditions of stage a but was not monitored nine specific stages were defined with different ph control methods and hrts as listed in table 1 considering nitrogen contaminated natural water is usually organic limited rather than organic free synthetic influent containing 36 mg l no3 n with a low cod n ratio of 0 5 was prepared with tap water for simulating the actual water quality with organic limited conditions cod was prepared with ch3coona which could theoretically remove 6 3 mg l no3 n through heterotrophic denitrification according to the stoichiometric equation s5 in the supporting information the influent also contained 280 mg l nahco3 and a 1 ml l trace element solution till et al 1998 although the co2 added in stage b could also supply inorganic carbon for autotrophic denitrification thereby replacing nahco3 the same concentration of nahco3 was used in all influents for the entire 233 day operation period for the purpose of comparison the initial ph of the influent was 8 0 the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 27 1 c no oxygen was aerated into the reactor and the dissolved oxygen was maintained at 0 1 0 3 mg l because a small amount of oxygen dissolved in the influent 2 3 monitoring methods the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 by using a uv spectrophotometer 2102c unico company usa the tn was determined from the sum of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n organic nitrogen was not involved the ph and do values were determined using a digital multi parameter meter multi 3430 wtw germany at stage a the daily ph of the effluent was determined before periodic hcl addition at the same time every day 2 4 microbial analysis 2 4 1 sludge sample collection eight sludge samples were collected from the reactor for microbial community analysis four samples were collected at stage a day 50 with hcl addition three biofilm samples attached to the mecs 1t from the top area 1m from the middle sludge sampling outlet and 1b from the bottom sludge sampling outlet and one suspended sludge sample 1s from the bottom sludge sampling outlet the other four samples were collected at stage b day 233 with co2 addition three biofilm samples attached to the mecs and one suspended sludge sample 2t 2m 2b and 2s which were collected from the same positions as 1t 1m 1b and 1s respectively 2 4 2 dna extraction and pcr for each sludge sample triplicate genomic dna samples were extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals irvine ca usa the samples were pooled together to ensure replication 16s rrna genes were amplified using barcode containing universal primers 515f 806r targeting both bacteria and archaea bates et al 2010 the nirs and nirk genes which encode nitrite reductase were amplified using barcode containing primers nirs4f nirs6r liu et al 2014 and nirk1acuf nirkr3cur zhou et al 2016 respectively the amplification conditions can be found in the above references triplicate amplicons were combined and then purified for high throughput sequencing 2 4 3 high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china after pre processing 31 268 65 095 effective 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained for the eight samples for nirs and nirk 28 958 63 216 and 30 657 60 076 effective sequences were obtained respectively subsequently sequences in all samples were subsampled randomly according to the minimum sequence number the sequences were divided and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity taxonomic assignment of the sequences was performed using the silva 16s rrna database https www arb silva de and the functional gene database http fungene cme msu edu heat maps were acquired using hemi version 1 0 3 and principal component analysis pca was conducted using canoco5 the bray curtis dissimilarity and euclidean distance were employed for cluster analysis representative sequences were analysed using blast https www ncbi nlm nih gov blast phylogenetic trees were generated with the neighbour joining algorithm by using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega 6 0 2 4 4 data deposition sequences obtained through high throughput sequencing of the eight samples were deposited in the ncbi short read archive under accession numbers srr8617516 srr8617523 16s rrna srr8661666 srr8661673 nirs and srr8661744 srr8661751 nirk 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal performance with hcl addition the performance of the reactor in continuous operation for 95 days at stage a is shown in fig 2 in prior of stage a 1 without ph control the ph values in the effluents were observed to be higher than 10 for a long time then ph control strategy was implemented and the hcl dosage was adjusted frequently at stage a 1 to determine the optimal dosage resulting in ph fluctuation in the effluent 7 6 0 5 in this period during the first 10 days of stage a 1 the nitrate removal efficiency reached 88 7 4 1 but the tn removal efficiency was only 35 5 3 0 because of significant ammonium and nitrite accumulation from the end of stage a 1 the hcl dosage was maintained at 10 ml per 2 h whereby the daily effluent ph stabilized at 7 9 0 2 afterwards at the end of stage a 1 with an hrt of 32 h the nitrate removal efficiency was observed at 94 5 1 7 and the tn removal efficiency increased significantly to 85 9 4 9 indicating that tn removal increased significantly during this stage at stage a 2 when the hrt was shortened to 28 h the tn removal efficiency dropped at the beginning then recovered to 91 4 0 9 from the 51st day the sludge sampling resulted in a decrease of tn removal efficiency and the residual tn was mainly attributed to the unreacted nitrate and generated ammonium then tn removal efficiency increased again to 88 4 3 3 at the end of stage a 2 at stage a 3 when the hrt was further shortened to 20 h the nitrate and tn removal efficiencies were 94 8 1 6 and 82 7 4 1 respectively these results indicate that tn removal efficiency is more significantly affected than nitrate removal efficiency in general hcl ph control resulted in good tn removal performance under weak alkaline conditions in the reactor under a low cod n ratio of 0 5 with an hrt of 28 h the tn concentration in effluents was observed at 3 18 0 34 mg l and the nitrate and tn removal rates were calculated as 29 7 1 0 mgn l d and 28 9 0 9 mgn l d respectively at stage a 3 the highest nitrate and tn removal rates reached 41 5 0 9 mgn l d and 36 2 1 8 mgn l d respectively 3 2 nitrogen removal performance with co2 addition the ph control strategy was changed to co2 addition during days 118 233 stage b the reactor performance at stage b is shown in fig 3 at the beginning of stage b 1 we also adjusted the co2 flow rate to test the optimal dosage which led to ph instability in the effluent 7 6 0 4 from the end of stage b 1 the co2 flow rate was fixed at 2 ml min the tn removal efficiency increased to 93 8 1 6 with an hrt of 24 h at the end of stage b 1 and 95 6 1 7 with an hrt of 18 h in stage b 2 however when the hrt was shortened to 12 h the tn removal efficiency gradually decreased to 63 3 4 0 at the end of stage b 3 at the same time the ph in the effluent increased from 7 5 0 1 in stage b 2 to 7 9 0 1 in stage b 3 with the same co2 dosage to avoid the potential effects caused by ph variation the co2 flow rate at stage b 4 was increased to 3 ml min this operation recovered ph in the effluent to 7 4 0 1 in stage b 4 but the tn removal efficiency was still at 62 2 4 3 this may indicate that the reactor performance is not sensitive to ph values in the range of 7 5 8 0 therefore we increased the hrt to 24 h again and found that the tn removal efficiency returned to 96 5 1 7 in the entire co2 addition period the average nitrate removal efficiency stably reached 97 8 1 9 the tn concentration in effluents was maintained at 1 72 0 90 mg l with an hrt of 24 h the nitrate and tn removal rates were calculated as 37 0 0 3 mgn l d and 36 0 0 6 mgn l d respectively in the end of stage b 6 with the highest removal efficiency the highest nitrate and tn removal rates reached 72 3 0 9 mgn l d and 50 9 2 9 mgn l d respectively in the end of stage b 3 with an hrt of 12 h it is worth noting that residual tn in the effluent at stage b was dominated by nitrite rather than ammonium which was dominant in stage a 3 3 comparison of microbial communities between hcl and co2 addition 3 3 1 high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna the compositions of microbial communities in the eight samples were analysed by high throughput sequencing rarefaction curves and rank abundance curves of the 16s rrna gene are shown in fig s4 indicating that high throughput sequencing data effectively represented the microbial communities the community richness and diversity indices based on the 16s rrna gene are shown in table s1 in the supporting information the microbial communities at class family and genus levels are shown in fig s5 a heat map and pca are shown in fig 4 at stage a the microbial communities in 1t 1m and 1b were clustered together but those in the suspended sludge sample 1s were different from those in the three biofilm samples attached to the mecs at stage b the microbial communities of 2t 2m 2b and 2s were clustered together but differed significantly from those at stage a in 1t 1m and 1b the genus thiobacillus affiliated with the family hydrogenophilaceae was predominant accounting for 5 0 14 2 and 13 6 respectively other dominant microbes in these three samples included genera arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas as well as unclassified bacteria in the family comamonadaceae it was verified in our previous work that these microorganisms represent the dominant autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the system xing et al 2016 2018 in 1s the proportions of thiobacillus and thermomonas were significantly lower than in 1t 1m and 1b while the proportions of the genus arenimonas and family comamonadaceae were similar additionally the proportion of the family anaerolineaceae was significantly higher in 1s in the four samples at stage b the family anaerolineaceae was predominant with a proportion of 16 3 3 2 moreover uncultured bacteria tk10 unclassified bacteria in the family methylocystaceae genus denitratisoma and uncultured bacteria akyg587 which had proportions of 0 7 0 4 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 and 0 1 at stage a increased to 9 5 0 5 7 4 1 3 5 4 2 0 and 5 3 1 1 at stage b respectively the proportions of the family comamonadaceae at stage a 5 9 2 1 and stage b 3 1 0 3 showed an insignificant difference 3 3 2 high throughput sequencing of nirs and nirk the results of high throughput sequencing based on nirs and nirk were analysed to investigate denitrifiers in the reactor rarefaction curves and rank abundance curves are shown in figs s6 and s7 the richness and diversity indices based on nirs and nirk gene are shown in tables s2 and s3 the analysis indicated that most otus could not be classified into subdivision levels these otus were classified as proteobacteria at the phylum level or no rank bacteria here we discuss the results at the otu level the heat map and pca are shown in fig 5 nirs and s8 nirk respectively dominant otus with proportions higher than 2 were selected to generate phylogenetic trees as shown in fig 6 nirs and s9 nirk similar to the results with 16s rrna the nirs genes from the two stages were significantly different for example the nirs otu 380 which was clustered with uncultured bacteria and thiobacillus sp accounted for 10 7 4 1 in 1t 1m and 1b from stage a but reduced significantly in stage b the nirs otus 24 66 49 and 44 which were almost zero at stage a increased significantly to 17 7 1 0 11 7 0 7 9 6 0 7 and 8 4 1 2 respectively in 2t 2m and 2b these abundant nirs otus were clustered with uncultured bacteria and rhodocyclaceae rhodocyclales bacteria although many nirs otus were only clustered with uncultured bacteria these results indicate that the nirs type denitrifiers were significantly different between the two stages according to the sequencing analysis of nirk more than 60 of the total sequences could be classified as the nirk otu 158 indicating that this otu was the major nirk type denitrifier in the reactor other otus also showed significant differences between the two stages for example the nirk otus 155 and 75 were dominant in 1t 1m and 1b the nirk otus 2 and 21 increased significantly to 19 2 2 1 and 15 0 0 1 respectively in 2t 2m and 2b however the phylogenetic analysis revealed that most nirk otus were only clustered with uncultured bacteria 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different ph control strategies on nitrogen removal in the current study the results indicate that good performances were achieved when both of the ph control strategies were applied in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification system in stable stages the tn removal efficiency was 91 4 0 9 with hcl addition at an hrt of 28 h and it reached 96 5 1 7 with co2 addition at an hrt of 24 h with hcl or co2 addition the highest nitrate removal rates were 41 5 0 9 mgn l d and 72 3 0 9 mgn l d respectively the nitrate removal mechanisms in the current study were similar to those of zvi supported biological denitrification as shown in the supporting information i e the major reactions in the reactor are hydrogenotrophic denitrification biological reaction and ammonium generation from zvi abiotic reaction till et al 1998 in studies on zvi supported biological denitrification sunger and bose 2009 applied an influent nitrate loading of 0 029 mgn l d and achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of 95 with a long hrt of 15 6 days till et al 1998 fed 50 mg l no3 n into the influent and achieved a stable nitrate removal efficiency of 61 under an hrt of 2 33 days however 50 of the removed nitrate was converted to ammonium and the nitrate removal rate was calculated as 0 012 mgn l d the removal rates were low and limited by hydrogen generation through zvi corrosion biswas and bose 2005 by using a high biomass of 3930 100 mg mlss l in an sbr wang et al 2012 obtained a nitrate removal rate as high as 52 32 mgn l d with nitrate removal efficiency of 79 8 in a recent literature zhang et al 2019 the effect of initial nitrate concentration ph and zvi dosage on the nitrate removal rate were investigated and the results showed that three days were required to achieve complete nitrate removal under the optimal conditions 25 mg no3 n l in influents ammonium accumulation resulting in low tn removal was often reported in zvi supported biological denitrification di capua et al 2015 xie et al 2017 the treatment target of this current study is to achieve high and stable tn removal efficiencies and the results were satisfactory in addition the nitrate removal rates were better than most results obtained in comparable studies on zvi supported biological denitrification as shown in the supporting information the required h2 in the reactor was produced by galvanic cell reactions in mecs eq s2 thus nitrate removal rate could be improved by promoting electron transfer between anodes zvi and cathodes carbon xing et al 2016 in a comparison with those reported in hydrogenotrophic denitrification for example a maximum of 770 mgn l d ergas and reuss 2001 the nitrate removal rates in this study as well as the other studies on zvi supported biological denitrification were much lower this is because the h2 in the reactor was generated in situ from zvi rather than a directly supply which reduces risks associated with h2 storage and explosions therefore although biological denitrification based on zvi has the drawback of low removal rate zvi was considered environmentally friendly non toxic abundant with versatile functions as a reductant sorbent and coagulant fu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 and the zvi supported biological denitrification was easy to handle and especially suitable for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater or surface water di capua et al 2019 additionally compared with the results in the beginning of stage a 1 controlling ph stably in neutral or weakly alkaline ranges 7 5 8 0 achieved good performance with much less ammonium or nitrite accumulation karanasios et al 2010 have reported that an increase of the ph value above 8 6 could significantly decrease the nitrate removal rate in hydrogenotrophic denitrification but low ph values of 7 or below could also inhibit biological reactions in abiotic reduction of nitrates using zvi it was reported that decreasing ph values in the acidic range increased nitrate reduction rates however lower ph accelerated the formation of undesired ammonium rather than nitrogen gas hu et al 2001 alowitz and scherer 2002 for biological denitrification based on zvi the factors for promoting biological reaction rapidly generating of h2 through abiotic reaction and decreasing of ammonium should be considered as a whole therefore ph control in a precise and quantitative method is crucial and warrants further study 4 2 effects of different ph control strategies on microbial communities the microbial communities and nirs nirk genes presented significant differences between stage a and stage b since the carriers were direct sources of h2 produced in this reactor the autotrophic denitrification cloud mainly occurs in the biofilms attached to the carriers additionally owing to the internal water circulation from the top to the bottom the microbial communities in the three biofilm samples were similar for both stages at stage a genera thiobacillus arenimonas and thermomonas as well as unclassified bacteria in the family comamonadaceae were the dominant bacteria in 1t 1m and 1b bacteria in these genera and family are often detected in denitrification systems for wastewater treatment adav et al 2010 liu et al 2015 in our previous studies with dna based stable isotope probing dna sip thiobacillus like and thermomonas like bacteria have been identified as the typical autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in similar systems xing et al 2017 2018 it is reasonable that the proportion of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria reduced significantly in the suspended sludge sample 1s comamonas like genus of the family comamonadaceae and arenimonas like bacteria were identified as heterotrophic and mixotrophic with dna sip respectively xing et al 2018 the proportions of unclassified comamonadaceae and arenimonas did not change significantly in 1s heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the reactor because of the low concentration of acetate added in the influent and the organics decomposed from sludge which could function as an organic carbon source at stage b it was surprising that the proportions of genera thiobacillus thermomonas and arenimonas decreased significantly in all samples 2t 2m 2b and 2s this result indicated that the typical autotrophic or mixotrophic denitrifiers in the reactor declined after co2 addition although the tn removal performance was still satisfactory the family comamonadaceae likely containing heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria wang and chu 2016 showed similar proportions in the two stages however at stage b the genus denitratisoma increased to 6 5 0 8 in three biofilm samples 2t 2m and 2b and 2 0 in the suspend sludge sample 2t the 16s rrna gene of the representative otu showed 97 similarity with denitratisoma oestradiolicum which was reported to be a heterotrophic denitrifier isolated from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant fahrbach et al 2006 species in this genus have been proven to be dominant succinate assimilating denitrifiers by dna sip saito et al 2008 and have been detected commonly as heterotrophic denitrifiers in domestic wastewater treatment ma et al 2015 xu et al 2017a overall based on currently known denitrifying bacteria it showed that autotrophic denitrifiers were weakened and heterotrophic denitrifiers were strengthened after co2 addition although the 16s rrna gene based approach is the most widely used technique for community analysis in wastewater treatment systems sanz and köchling 2007 simply studying the 16s rrna gene is not sufficient to reveal the difference in denitrifiers in this instance high throughput sequencing of functional genes nirs and nirk were also carried out in this study tables s1 s3 showed that the richness and diversity of the four samples in stage b were lower than those in stage a this trend is the same for nirs and nirk genes as well as the 16s rrna gene indicating that co2 addition is a selection factor for both microbial communities and denitrifiers comparing the heat maps in figs 4 and 5 it can been seen that both microbial community and nirs type denitrifiers varied significantly after co2 addition and the results of 16s rrna and nirs genes showed similar trends the phylogenetic tree in fig 6 showed that the nirs otus that were clustered with thiobacillus sp decreased but those in cluster ⅲ that were affiliated with rhodocyclaceae rhodocyclales bacteria increased significantly in stage b as genus denitratisoma belongs to class rhodocyclaceae and order rhodocyclales this implies that the results of nirs and 16s rrna genes were also consistent in this aspect however studies on nirs and nirk genes have some limitations due to the lack of registered sequence data in the database and most of the registered nirs and nirk sequences are retrieved from uncultured clones osaka et al 2006 in this study most of the nirs and the nirk genes were affiliated with uncultured bacteria rather than sequences from known bacteria therefore further studies are required and technological advances are expected in the future in a comparison of the microbial communities in two stages besides the proportion of denitrifiers the abundance of microbes related to carbon metabolism also changed significantly firstly the family anaerolineaceae presented low proportions in 1t 1m and 1b but high proportions in 1s and the four stage b samples most species of anaerolineaceae have been reported to have a fermentative metabolism degrading carbohydrates and proteinaceous carbon sources under anaerobic conditions liang et al 2015 mcilroy et al 2017 in the suspended sludge samples 1s and 2s anaerolineaceae like bacteria may participate in sludge decay for biofilm samples attached to the carriers the proportion of anaerolineaceae increased significantly after co2 addition indicating that the organic carbon metabolism was enhanced because of the low cod concentration supplied in the influent the biomass is unlikely to increase significantly to become the primary organic carbon source which implies that co2 probably participated in the generation of organic carbon in the reactor in addition the abundance of methylocystaceae increased to 7 4 1 3 in stage b the 16s rrna gene of the presentative otu showed 99 similarity with methylocystis hirsuta which has been reported to be a type ii methane oxidizing bacteria lindner et al 2007 the growth of methane oxidizing bacteria usually relies on methane recently it has been reported that m hirsute can also use volatile fatty acids including acetic propionic and butyric acids as the sole carbon and energy source for growth lópez et al 2018 in the current study it seems that co2 addition was responsible for the growth of methylocystis like bacteria in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification reactor however the detailed metabolism to support the growth of methylocystis like bacteria needs to be further studied however in the dominated otus none was identified as being highly similar to the acknowledged acetogens most known acetogens have been reported within the genera clostridium or acetobacterium drake et al 2008 sewell et al 2017 which were detected but not abundant in the reactor although it remains unclear if acetogenesis took place in the reactor co2 addition did induce the changes of microbes related to organic carbon metabolism especially those of the families anaerolineaceae and methylocystaceae determining how the co2 affect the organic carbon metabolism in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification system is a potential topic for further studies 4 3 implications and perspectives the results revealed that both the hcl addition and the co2 addition contributed to ph control in the h2 based autotrophic denitrification systems and resulted in good nitrogen removal performance in particular co2 addition changed the microbial communities and participated in microbial metabolisms supplying co2 in h2 based autotrophic denitrification enhanced organic carbon metabolism in the system thus promoting heterotrophic denitrification since heterotrophic denitrifiers normally grow faster than autotrophic denitrifiers the combined heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification could achieve higher nitrate removal rates however rapid growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers may imply more sludge production which mitigates the superiority of autotrophic denitrification in sludge management therefore the two strategies for ph control both have advantages and disadvantages it is worth noting that the electrons provided by h2 can be utilized either in autotrophic denitrification or to participate in carbon metabolism together with co2 for heterotrophic denitrification from this point of view similar amount of electrons are ultimately required in both cases for similar nitrate removal however electricity utilization efficiencies and rates in autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification are worth studying further moreover economic and environmental issues are crucial for prospective large scale application and co2 addition can benefit greenhouse gas reduction and lower costs by using co2 originated from industrial exhaust gas rather than pure product the emission of n2o should also be monitored to quantify the global warming potentials in addition the accuracy ph control with precise quantification of hcl and co2 addition is important to quantitatively verify their effects in h2 based autotrophic denitrification in further studies last but not least comprehensive investigation of the biological reaction mechanisms is required by applying other advanced methods and techniques 5 conclusions in this study two ph control strategies namely hcl addition and co2 addition were implemented in a h2 based autotrophic denitrification reactor the nitrogen removal performance and microbial communities were compared between the two strategies the main conclusions are as follows 1 good performances were achieved when applying both of the ph control strategies in the cead a modified zvi supported biological denitrification reactor with low accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in stable stages the highest tn removal efficiency was 91 4 0 9 for hcl addition at an hrt of 28 h and the tn removal efficiency reached 96 5 1 7 for co2 addition at an hrt of 24 h 2 high throughput sequencing revealed similar results in the three biofilm samples for each stage however the microbial communities and nirs type denitrifiers were significantly affected by co2 addition i e the abundance of thiobacillus arenimonas limnobacter and thermomonas decreased and the

18424,the uv persulfate ps process is a promising water treatment technology and it can not only effectively degrade contaminants of emerging concern but also control formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in this study we investigated the potential and mechanisms of chloropicrin i e trichloronitromethane tcnm formation during chlorination that followed uv ps pretreatment in the presence of low concentrations of nitrite we found that when nitrite was present in the uv ps system unexpected high concentrations of tcnm were formed the formation potential of tcnm was impacted by operational conditions and water matrix components 1 high ph enhanced tcnm formation 2 high uv fluence inhibited tcnm formation and 3 organic compounds containing phenolic groups enhanced tcnm formation we discovered that electrophilic substitutions by reactive nitrogen species were favored for phenolic groups and thus more nitrite n was transformed to organic nitrogen we also found that more tcnm was generated from natural organic matter than algal organic matter during chlorination following pretreatment using uv ps accordingly more attention needs to be paid to tcnm formation if nitrite is present and the water is pretreated using uv ps when applied at upstream of chlorination for example we found that if monochloramine was used as a disinfectant downstream of the uv ps process the formation of tcnm was reduced graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloropicrin uv persulfate nitrite reactive nitrogen species phenolic group 1 introduction in 1970s trihalomethanes thms were identified and documented as a group of disinfection byproducts dbps by researchers for the first time bellar et al 1974 richardson et al 2007 rook 1974 since then nearly a thousand of organic dbps have been found in chlorinated drinking water but only thms and haloacetic acids haas have been regulated in drinking water by us and chinese governments more than 95 dbps are unregulated and thus there are many studies about the occurrence formation and toxicity of various newly found dbps including nitrogenous dbps n dbps chu et al 2014 2015 shah and mitch 2012 halophenolic dbps liu and

of the ubiquitous presence of dissolved organic nitrogen don westerhoff and mash 2002 of note n dbps are typically more cytotoxic carcinogenic and genotoxic than carbonaceous dbps c dbps muellner et

various uv aops e g uv h2o2 uv persulfate ps uv chlorine uv ps process generates sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho bu et al 2016 xie et al employed the uv ps process upstream of chlorination and observed increased formation of thms and haas and decreased formation of n dbps xie et al 2015a chu et al investigated the impact of the uv ps process on the formation of volatile dbps from chlorination chloramination of chloramphenicols cap they found the application of the uv ps process before chloramination minimizes the formation of dbps when source water was contaminated by cap chu et al 2016 the formation potentials of dbps can increase or decrease after pretreatment by the uv ps process depending on the molecular weight and structure of model precursors xie et al 2015a the impacts of halides yang et al 2014 2016 bicarbonate carbonate liu et al 2016 and nom bu et al 2016 xie et al 2015b on the performance of uv ps process have been systematically investigated in previous studies and all the water matrix resulted in series of radical chain reactions however only few studies have investigated the impacts of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 in the uv ps process because more complex radical chain reactions may occur herein we investigated the impacts of no3 no2 on dbps formation during the uv ps process and post chlorination because the impacts are not clear under most circumstances the presence of no3 no2 has little influence on the formation of dbps during disinfection nevertheless various studies have recently observed the generation of transformation products with nitro group no2 during the degradation of triclosan bisphenol a bpa estrone and sulfamethoxazole under uv irradiation in the presence of no3 ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 they found that no3 n can be transformed to organic nitrogen under uv irradiation with reactive nitrogen species rns as intermediates rns including peroxynitrite onoo nitrogen dioxide radical no2 and nitrogen oxide radical no are typically generated from photolysis of no3 no2 or reactions of reactive radicals with no3 no2 as shown from eq 1 to eq 5 mack and bolton 1999 of which no2 was reported to show a higher photo reactivity than no3 to generate rns and ho mack and bolton 1999 xu et al 2018 1 n o 2 h v n o 2 n o o 2 ho no2 no2 ho 3 so4 no2 no2 so4 2 4 n o 3 h v n o 3 n o 2 o 5 no2 ho hoono therefore the presence of no3 no2 in the uv ps process can lead to increasing concentration of don due to the simultaneous presence of uv irradiation and radicals accordingly uv light and radicals those are present in the uv ps process will significantly influence on the formation of dbps especially n dbps during the subsequent chlorination furthermore the maximum concentrations of no3 and no2 are regulated as no more than 10 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 as n respectively in drinking water by us and chinese government consequently we examined the impact of low concentrations of no3 and no2 ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 mm 0 14 0 70 mg l 1 as n on n dbps formation bpa which is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen was used as the model precursor compound to investigate the effects of no3 and no2 on n dbps formation the main objectives of this study are to 1 compare the formation of c dbps and n dbps during chlorination after pretreatment by the uv ps process in the presence or absence of no3 or no2 2 investigate the formation of c dbps and n dbps after treatment by uv uv ps and uv h2o2 in the presence of no2 3 evaluate the effect of ph uv intensity phenolic groups and type of disinfectants

experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor a low pressure mercury lamp 253 7 nm 0 26 mw cm 2 was placed in the center of the reactor and four quartz reacting tubes were fixed around the lamp si fig s1 the lamp was turned on 30 min in advance to stabilize uv light output uv fluence was calculated as 225 mj cm 2 with the corresponding uv irradiation time of 15 min the experiments were performed using 50 ml solution containing cecs 5 mg l 1 doc 1 mm ps and various concentrations of no3 and no2 the ph of the solution was buffered with 10 mm phosphate and solution ph was fixed at 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 when uv ps experiments were completed we immediately poured the solution and 20 mg l 1 disinfectant in terms of cl2 into a headspace free bottle and then transferred to the dark for 24 h at 25 c when the uv h2o2 experiments were completed since h2o2 can react with chlorine with a molar ratio of 1 1 1 mg l 1 h2o2 requires 2 09 mg l 1 cl2 residual h2o2 need to be quenched at first and then the solution as well as 20 mg l 1 disinfectant in terms of cl2 were poured to a headspace free bottle to culture in the dark for 24 h at 25 c after cultured for 24 h excess ascorbic acid was spiked to the headspace free bottle to quench the residual disinfectant all the experiments were replicated three times 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined

after 72 h exposure 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbps formation during chlorination of bpa following pretreatment with uv ps in the presence and absence of no3 no2 dbps including thms haloacetonitriles hans and tcnm were measured but only trichloromethane tcm and tcnm in the presence of no3 no2 were detected first we analyzed for dbps after the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment by the uv ps process in ultrapure water and we found 66 72 μg l 1 tcm was formed si fig s2 second we investigated the chlorination of bpa after uv ps pretreatment in ultrapure water and found the formation of tcm decreased to 30 80 μg l 1 fig 1 a the decrease of tcm concentration was because the uv ps process decomposes bpa and its products which generated less tcm precursors our experimental observations were in agreement with some previous related studies for example decreasing formation of tcm from chlorination of 2 4 di tert butylphenol was observed by wang et al after pretreatment by the uv ps process wang et al 2018 however other studies reported that the uv ps pretreatment process enhanced the formation of tcm during post chlorination of chloramphenicols chu et al 2016 therefore the impact of the uv ps process pretreatment on the formation of dbps depends on the structure of the precursors and the operational conditions third we investigated the chlorination of bpa after pretreatment by the uv ps process when no3 or no2 was present as shown in fig 1a 1 when 0 01 0 05 mm no3 was present the formation of tcm almost remained the same compared to that in ultrapure water however 2 when 0 01 0 05 mm no2 was present the formation of tcm increased to a maximum of 58 16 μg l 1 similarity as shown in fig 1b 1 no3 0 01 0 05 mm slightly impacted the formation of tcnm during the uv ps process chlorination however 2 no2 especially when no2 was more than 0 03 mm significantly enhanced the formation of tcnm during the uv ps process chlorination the production of tcnm shows the potential risks for the application of uv ps process upstream of chlorination even for low nitrite concentrations overall during the uv ps process chlorination the formation of dbps i e tcm and tcnm are slightly impacted by no3 but enhanced by no2 therefore our experimental results suggest that no2 is more reactive than no3 in terms of the radical chain reactions the reason is that no3 can hardly react with radicals while no2 generated from reactions of no2 with radicals eqs 2 and 3 is responsible for the generation of nitro group containing organics vione et al 2005 to further prove the importance of so4 and ho quenching experiments si fig s3 were conducted and the formation of tcnm were significantly inhibited since no2 plays a more important role than no3 in the uv ps system we used no2 as inorganic nitrogen source in our subsequent study 3 2 formation of dbps during chlorination of bpa with different pretreatments in the presence of no2 in this section we continued exploring and comparing dbps formation due to the chlorination of bpa after pretreatment by uv uv ps and uv h2o2 compared to the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment process uv and uv h2o2 processes pretreatment increased the formation of tcm by 36 9 and 514 9 respectively while uv ps process pretreatment decreased tcm formation by 53 8 si fig s2 on one hand this phenomenon occurs because photolysis of bpa by uv alone or oxidation of bpa by ho from the uv h2o2 process generated some intermediates that can form tcm on the other hand the oxidation of bpa by so4 from the uv ps process generated less intermediates that form tcm from post chlorination when no2 is present in water matrix no2 ranges from 0 01 to 0 05 mm we found that 1 tcnm was not detected during the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment fig 2 this is because no2 n is not precursor of chlorinated dbps 2 tcnm was not detected during the chlorination of bpa with uv pretreatment process fig 2 which is in agreement with results of some other studies using low pressure uv lamp to irradiate no2 or no3 reckhow et al 2010 shah et al 2011 the wavelength of low pressure uv lamp is typically fixed around 254 nm but the maximum absorbance band of no2 ranges between 340 and 380 nm gligorovski et al 2015 tugaoen et al 2017 therefore direct photolysis of no2 by low pressure uv lamp can hardly generate enough rns to induce the formation of tcnm 3 the formation of tcnm was enhanced by the uv h2o2 process pretreatment e g 27 44 μg l 1 tcnm was formed in the presence of 0 05 mm no2 moreover under the same no2 concentration the formation of tcnm with the uv h2o2 process pretreatment was much lower than that with the uv ps process pretreatment fig 2 the results were probably due to the fact that h2o2 has stronger oxidation ability 1 77 v in acid medium and 0 87 v in alkaline medium than inactivated ps and thus part of no2 was oxidized by h2o2 and converted to no3 it should be noted that even though the formation of tcnm during the chlorination of bpa with the uv h2o2 process pretreatment is not significant the low concentration of tcnm may still pose risk to human health because tcnm has higher cytotoxicity than tcm si table s1 plewa and wagner 2009 plewa et al 2004 3 3 effect of ph and uv fluence on the formation of tcnm during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 results on the formation of tcnm and tcm from bpa during the uv ps process and post chlorination at various ph values are presented in fig 3 a and si fig s4a accordingly higher ph typically resulted in more generation of tcnm and tcm for no2 concentration from 0 mm to 0 5 mm although the oxidation ability of ocl is weaker than that of hocl it enhances dbp formation at sufficiently high concentrations because of base catalyzed hydrolysis liang and singer 2003 similar ph dependency on formation of thms was reported in chlorination of phenols gallard and von gunten 2002 drinking water liang and singer 2003 and swimming pools hansen et al 2012 then we investigated the effect of uv fluence on the formation of tcm and tcnm during the chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment our experimental results show that 1 the impact of uv fluence on tcm formation is small si fig s4b and 2 increasing the uv fluence significantly decreased the formation of tcnm fig 3b similar tcm formation indicated that doc of the solution after treatment by the uv ps process did not change a lot and hence the obvious decrease of tcnm formation maybe attributed to the breakdown of c n bonds when the uv fluence was low e g uv fluence was fixed at 112 mj cm 2 main reactions occurred were the transformation from no2 to organic nitrogen when the uv fluence was higher e g increase of uv fluence to 225 or 450 mj cm 2 the generated organic nitrogen bonds were destroyed 3 4 mechanisms of tcnm formation during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 3 4 1 contribution of phenolic group as reported in many previous literature studies rns selectively react with compounds containing phenolic group via electrophilic substitution reactions babu et al 2012 neta et al 1988 sharpless and linden 2001 therefore we hypothesized that the two phenolic moieties in the structure of bpa can result in significant amount of tcnm formation during the chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process to test the above hypothesis we chose three compounds with phenolic moiety i e bpa phenol and tc and three compounds without phenolic moiety i e ibp ba and cbz to explore the effect of phenolic moiety on the formation of n dbps especially tcnm the model precursors are classified into three groups and their structures are listed in si table s2 among three groups group i bpa and ibp and group ii phenol and ba were classified because of their similar structures tc and cbz were classified as group iii because they can provide extra nitrogen source and have more complex structures we firstly compared the dbps formation during the chlorination of group i model precursors with the uv ps pretreatment process as shown in si fig s5a 30 79 and 234 54 μg l 1 tcm were generated from post chlorination of bpa and ibp respectively meaning that ibp and its products are readier to form tcm than bpa and its products however tcnm generated from the post chlorination of ibp was much lower than that generated from bpa around 1 10 of that generated from bpa in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm fig 4 a similarity we compared the dbps formation during the chlorination of group ii phenol and ba with the uv ps process pretreatment as shown in fig 4b and fig s5b ba is a better precursor to form tcm than phenol while more tcnm was generated from the post chlorination of phenol than ba in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm it should be noted that the difference between the formation of tcnm from phenol and ba is much smaller than that between bpa and ibp which may be because hydroxylation is easy to occur on the aromatic ring of ba due to its simple structure therefore many phenolic intermediates are generated after the uv ps process pretreatment of ba and these phenolic intermediates promoted the formation of tcnm moreover to investigate the possible impact of no2 on the formation of other n dbps we compared the n dbps formation during the chlorination of group iii tc and cbz with the uv ps pretreatment process as presented in fig 4c and si fig s5c we found that 1 the chlorination of tc and cbz without the uv ps process pretreatment results in the formation of only dcan with concentrations of 7 51 and 2 26 μg l 1 respectively 2 the chlorination of cbz with the uv ps pretreatment process in the absence of no2 also generated only dcan 6 25 μg l 1 however 3 the chlorination of tc with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence of no2 generated not only dcan 1 63 μg l 1 but also tcan 15 88 μg l 1 and tcnm 25 44 μg l 1 4 no2 has negligible impact on the formation of hans but enhanced formation of tcnm during the chlorination of tc and cbz with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm and 5 the amount of tcnm generated from tc is much higher than that from cbz further confirming that phenolic group plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 3 4 2 effect of nitrogen source as discussed above the chlorination of tc and cbz without the uv ps process pretreatment formed only one kind of n dbp i e dcan since both tc and cbz are amine compounds with amino nh2 imino nh or subamino group we hypothesized that amine compounds are the nitrogen source of hans during chlorination but not for tcnm as we know organic nitrogen is typically present in the form of amine group or nitro group therefore to verify the above mentioned hypothesis and determine the organic nitrogen source of tcnm 3 aminobenzoate to provide amino n and 4 nitrobenzoate to provide nitro n were selected as model precursors 0 01 0 05 mm in terms of nitrogen as shown in si fig s6 the chlorination of 3 aminobenzoate generated dcan solely which agrees with the chlorination of tc and cbz on the other hand chlorination of 4 nitrobenzoate only generates tcnm which is consistent with the post chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 therefore the results suggest that no2 is transformed to nitro n during the post chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment 3 4 3 proposed formation pathway of tcm and tcnm phenol is the simplest phenolic compound and a predominant byproduct of bpa oxidization by the uv ps process therefore we chose phenol as the model precursor to identify the formation pathway of tcm and tcnm during the chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence and presence of no2 according to si fig s7 1 as phenol is oxidized using the uv ps process in the absence of no2 catechol and hydroquinone are firstly generated because of hydroxylation then the oxidization of hydroquinone yields benzoquinone and the oxidation of benzoquinone by ho and so4 results in the ring opening bremner et al 2006 then chlorine reacts with the above mentioned products of phenol via electrophilic incorporation after a series of complex reactions among chlorinated intermediates tcm and haloacetic acids haas not investigated in this study are generated 2 as phenol is oxidized using the uv ps process when no2 is present the ortho and para positions of phenol are occupied by nitro group because of the oxidization by no2 niessen et al 1988 the appearance of nitrated compounds resulted in the formation of tcnm during post chlorination 3 5 comparison of dbp formation during post chlorination and post chloramination of bpa monochloramine nh2cl is the most common used alternative disinfectant for chlorine because the low reactivity between nh2cl and organic matter results in low concentration of generated tcm hua and reckhow 2007 however the presence of nitrogen in nh2cl itself may result in the formation of n dbps as shown in fig 5 the post chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment generates 30 79 μg l 1 tcm while the post chloramination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment generates only 0 59 μg l 1 tcm and 0 24 μg l 1 dcan notably the formation of dbps significantly decreased during post chloramination but the cytotoxicity of dbps slightly increased si fig s8 in addition the presence of no2 slightly impacts the formation of tcm and dcan from post chlorination chloramination while no2 enhances the formation of tcnm during the post chlorination chloramination it is notable that when 0 05 mm no2 is present in the uv ps process pretreatment 2245 04 and 171 85 μg l 1 tcnm are formed during post chlorination and post chloramination therefore using nh2cl as disinfectant efficiently reduces the formation of tcnm during the post disinfection with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 3 6 environmental implications according to our study the formation of n dbps mainly comes from chlorination of organic nitrogen apart from naturally present organic nitrogen nitro groups transformed from no2 by uv based aops are confirmed to be another important nitrogen source for n dbps because uv based aops are usually used at the upstream of chlorination in water treatment plants under the conditions of 225 mj cm 2 uv fluence 1 0 mm ps 5 0 mg c l 1 bpa and 0 05 mm no2 27 3 nitrite n was transformed to tcnm during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment we tested the role of two common types of organic matter nom and aom as examples to determine the potential risk of tcnm formation during chlorination with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 in practical applications for water purification according to si fig s9 and fig s10 we found that 1 the chlorination of nom without the uv ps process pretreatment generates 230 33 μg l 1 tcm and 2 14 μg l 1 dcan and the chlorination of aom without the uv ps process pretreatment generates 166 87 μg l 1 tcm 9 69 μg l 1 dcan and 2 00 μg l 1 tcan the results indicate that organic nitrogen in nom and aom mainly exist in the form of amine rather than nitro 2 the chlorination of nom and aom with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence of no2 generates 3 32 and 0 84 μg l 1 of tcnm respectively indicating that part of sub amino or imino groups is converted to nitro group because of the oxidation by so4 and ho 3 no2 enhances the formation of tcnm from the post chlorination of aom and nom under the same concentration of no2 more tcnm is generated from nom than aom which is because there are more phenolic groups in nom than aom and thus nom is easier to be oxidized by rns zhou et al 2016 furthermore when no2 is present we found that 1 even though the formation of dbps from the post chlorination of nom with the uv ps process pretreatment decreases the cytotoxicity of generated dbps increases because of the increased formation of n dbps especially tcnm si fig s11a 2 both formation and cytotoxicity of dbps increased during the post chlorination of aom with the uv ps process pretreatment si fig s11b overall the employment of the uv ps process entails tradeoffs when no2 exist in the source water even at low levels because of the high risks of tcnm formation in future studies our attention will be mainly focused on two aspects 1 formation of n nitrosamines e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during disinfection is a major concern because the cancer potency of ndma is around 600 times higher than that of thms shah and mitch 2012 choi and valentine 2003 observed the formation of ndma during the chlorination of drinking water in the presence of no2 and ndma was formed during irradiation of dimethylamine by sunlight in the presence of 1 mm no2 lee and yoon 2007 therefore the formation of n nitrosamines during the chlorination with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 is also a potential risk because all n nitrosamines contain nitroso groups si table s3 and rns can be generated during the process 2 the direct formation of tcnm or n nitrosamines during the uv free chlorine or uv monochloramine should be scrutinized in the presence of low concentrations of no2 for example the uv free chlorine process is proposed to replace chlorination in drinking water treatment plants of which no2 and free chlorine simultaneously exist in the uv free chlorine process therefore further investigations are still needed 4 conclusions the present study conducted a systematic investigation on the potential risk of the formation of tcnm during uv ps pretreatment in the presence of no2 and downstream chlorination and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the formation of tcnm was negligible when no3 was present in uv254 ps pretreatment while large formation of tcnm was observed when no2 was present in uv254 ps pretreatment when low levels of no2 existed in uv based pretreatments the formation of tcnm during post chlorination followed the order of uv ps uv h2o2 uv irradiation 2 the formation of tcnm was enhanced with the increase of solution ph 6 8 and was inhibited with the increase of uv fluence 112 450 mj cm 2 3 the presence of phenolic group favored the substitution of nitro group leading to the formation of tcnm nitro n in organic compounds resulted in the formation of tcnm while amino n in organic compounds resulted in the formation of hans no2 was transformed to nitro n in uv ps pretreatment 4 more tcnm were formed from nom than from aom because of larger fraction of phenolic group in nom nh2cl is a promising alternative disinfectant to decrease the formation of tcnm during uv ps pretreatment and post chlorination when low levels of no2 are present declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

18424,the uv persulfate ps process is a promising water treatment technology and it can not only effectively degrade contaminants of emerging concern but also control formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in this study we investigated the potential and mechanisms of chloropicrin i e trichloronitromethane tcnm formation during chlorination that followed uv ps pretreatment in the presence of low concentrations of nitrite we found that when nitrite was present in the uv ps system unexpected high concentrations of tcnm were formed the formation potential of tcnm was impacted by operational conditions and water matrix components 1 high ph enhanced tcnm formation 2 high uv fluence inhibited tcnm formation and 3 organic compounds containing phenolic groups enhanced tcnm formation we discovered that electrophilic substitutions by reactive nitrogen species were favored for phenolic groups and thus more nitrite n was transformed to organic nitrogen we also found that more tcnm was generated from natural organic matter than algal organic matter during chlorination following pretreatment using uv ps accordingly more attention needs to be paid to tcnm formation if nitrite is present and the water is pretreated using uv ps when applied at upstream of chlorination for example we found that if monochloramine was used as a disinfectant downstream of the uv ps process the formation of tcnm was reduced graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloropicrin uv persulfate nitrite reactive nitrogen species phenolic group 1 introduction in 1970s trihalomethanes thms

al 2007 plewa et al 2004 therefore it is critical to investigate the formation and precursors of n dbps in drinking water uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are effective water treatment technologies to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs duan et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2019 kill algae cells sun et al 2018 and control the formation of dbps chu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 among various uv aops e g uv h2o2 uv persulfate ps uv chlorine uv ps process generates sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho bu et al 2016 xie et al employed the uv ps process upstream of chlorination and observed increased formation of thms and haas and decreased formation of n dbps xie et al 2015a chu et al investigated the impact of the uv ps process on the formation of volatile dbps from chlorination chloramination of chloramphenicols cap they found the application of the uv ps process before chloramination minimizes the formation of dbps when source water was contaminated by cap chu et al 2016 the formation potentials of dbps can increase or decrease after pretreatment by the uv ps process depending on the molecular weight and structure of model precursors xie et al 2015a the impacts of halides yang et al 2014 2016 bicarbonate carbonate liu et al 2016 and nom bu et al 2016 xie et al 2015b on the performance of uv ps process have been systematically investigated in previous studies and all the water matrix resulted in series of radical chain reactions however only few studies have investigated the impacts of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 in the uv ps process because more complex radical chain reactions may occur herein we investigated the impacts of no3 no2 on dbps formation during the uv ps process and post chlorination because the impacts are not clear under most circumstances the presence of no3 no2 has little influence on the formation of dbps during disinfection nevertheless various studies have recently observed the generation of transformation products with nitro group no2 during the degradation of triclosan bisphenol a bpa estrone and sulfamethoxazole under uv irradiation in the presence of no3 ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 they found that no3 n can be transformed to organic nitrogen under uv irradiation with reactive nitrogen species rns as intermediates rns including peroxynitrite onoo nitrogen dioxide radical no2 and nitrogen oxide radical no are typically generated from photolysis of no3 no2 or reactions of reactive radicals with no3 no2 as shown from eq 1 to eq 5 mack and bolton 1999 of which no2 was reported to show a higher photo reactivity than no3 to generate rns and ho mack and bolton 1999 xu et al 2018 1 n o 2 h v n o 2 n o o 2 ho no2 no2 ho 3 so4 no2 no2 so4 2 4 n o 3 h v n o 3 n o 2 o 5 no2 ho hoono therefore the presence of no3 no2 in the uv ps process can lead to increasing concentration of don due to the simultaneous presence of uv irradiation and radicals accordingly uv light and radicals those are present in the uv ps process will significantly influence on the formation of dbps especially n dbps during the subsequent chlorination furthermore the maximum concentrations of no3 and no2 are regulated as no more than 10 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 as n respectively in drinking water by us and chinese government consequently we examined the impact of low concentrations of no3 and no2 ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 mm 0 14 0 70 mg l 1 as n on n dbps formation bpa which is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen was used as the model precursor compound to investigate the effects of no3 and no2 on n dbps formation the main objectives of this study are to 1 compare the formation of c dbps and n dbps during chlorination after pretreatment by the uv ps process in the presence or absence of no3 or no2 2 investigate the formation of c dbps and n dbps after treatment by uv uv ps and uv h2o2 in the presence of no2 3 evaluate the effect of ph uv intensity phenolic groups and type of disinfectants

experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor a low pressure mercury lamp 253 7 nm 0 26 mw cm 2 was placed in the center of the reactor and four quartz reacting tubes were fixed around the lamp si fig s1 the lamp was turned on 30 min in advance to stabilize uv light output uv fluence was calculated as 225 mj cm 2 with the corresponding uv irradiation time of 15 min the experiments were performed using 50 ml solution containing cecs 5 mg l 1 doc 1 mm ps and various concentrations of no3 and no2 the ph of the solution was buffered with 10 mm phosphate and solution ph was fixed at 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 when uv ps experiments were completed we immediately poured the solution and 20 mg l 1 disinfectant in terms of cl2 into a headspace free bottle and then transferred to the dark for 24 h at 25 c when the uv h2o2 experiments were completed since h2o2 can react with chlorine with a molar ratio of 1 1 1 mg l 1 h2o2 requires 2 09 mg l 1 cl2 residual h2o2 need to be quenched at first and then the solution as well as 20 mg l 1 disinfectant in terms of cl2 were poured to a headspace free bottle to culture in the dark for 24 h at 25 c after cultured for 24 h excess ascorbic acid was spiked to the headspace free bottle to quench the residual disinfectant all the experiments were replicated three times 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the concentrations of disinfectants chlorine and nh2cl were analyzed by a multifunctional water quality parameter analyzer dr3900 hach usa the concentrations of

after 72 h exposure 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbps formation during chlorination of bpa following pretreatment with uv ps in the presence and absence of no3 no2 dbps including thms haloacetonitriles hans and tcnm were measured but only trichloromethane tcm and tcnm in the presence of no3 no2 were detected first we analyzed for dbps after the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment by the uv ps process in ultrapure water and we found 66 72 μg l 1 tcm was formed si fig s2 second we investigated the chlorination of bpa after uv ps pretreatment in ultrapure water and found the formation of tcm decreased to 30 80 μg l 1 fig 1 a the decrease of tcm concentration was because the uv ps process decomposes bpa and its products which generated less tcm precursors our experimental observations were in agreement with some previous related studies for example decreasing formation of tcm from chlorination of 2 4 di tert butylphenol was observed by wang et al after pretreatment by the uv ps process wang et al 2018 however other studies reported that the uv ps pretreatment process enhanced the formation of tcm during post chlorination of chloramphenicols chu et al 2016 therefore the impact of the uv ps process pretreatment on the formation of dbps depends on the structure of the precursors and the operational conditions third we investigated the chlorination of bpa after pretreatment by the uv ps process when no3 or no2 was present as shown in fig 1a 1 when 0 01 0 05 mm no3 was present the formation of tcm almost remained the same compared to that in ultrapure water however 2 when 0 01 0 05 mm no2 was present the formation of tcm increased to a maximum of 58 16 μg l 1 similarity as shown in fig 1b 1 no3 0 01 0 05 mm slightly impacted the formation of tcnm during the uv ps process chlorination however 2 no2 especially when no2 was more than 0 03 mm significantly enhanced the formation of tcnm during the uv ps process chlorination the production of tcnm shows the potential risks for the application of uv ps process upstream of chlorination even for low nitrite concentrations overall during the uv ps process chlorination the formation of dbps i e tcm and tcnm are slightly impacted by no3 but enhanced by no2 therefore our experimental results suggest that no2 is more reactive than no3 in terms of the radical chain reactions the reason is that no3 can hardly react with radicals while no2 generated from reactions of no2 with radicals eqs 2 and 3 is responsible for the generation of nitro group containing organics vione et al 2005 to further prove the importance of so4 and ho quenching experiments si fig s3 were conducted and the formation of tcnm were significantly inhibited since no2 plays a more important role than no3 in the uv ps system we used no2 as inorganic nitrogen source in our subsequent study 3 2 formation of dbps during chlorination of bpa with different pretreatments in the presence of no2 in this section we continued exploring and comparing dbps formation due to the chlorination of bpa after pretreatment by uv uv ps and uv h2o2 compared to the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment process uv and uv h2o2 processes pretreatment increased the formation of tcm by 36 9 and 514 9 respectively while uv ps process pretreatment decreased tcm formation by 53 8 si fig s2 on one hand this phenomenon occurs because photolysis of bpa by uv alone or oxidation of bpa by ho from the uv h2o2 process generated some intermediates that can form tcm on the other hand the oxidation of bpa by so4 from the uv ps process generated less intermediates that form tcm from post chlorination when no2 is present in water matrix no2 ranges from 0 01 to 0 05 mm we found that 1 tcnm was not detected during the chlorination of bpa without pretreatment fig 2 this is because no2 n is not precursor of chlorinated dbps 2 tcnm was not detected during the chlorination of bpa with uv pretreatment process fig 2 which is in agreement with results of some other studies using low pressure uv lamp to irradiate no2 or no3 reckhow et al 2010 shah et al 2011 the wavelength of low pressure uv lamp is typically fixed around 254 nm but the maximum absorbance band of no2 ranges between 340 and 380 nm gligorovski et al 2015 tugaoen et al 2017 therefore direct photolysis of no2 by low pressure uv lamp can hardly generate enough rns to induce the formation of tcnm 3 the formation of tcnm was enhanced by the uv h2o2 process pretreatment e g 27 44 μg l 1 tcnm was formed in the presence of 0 05 mm no2 moreover under the same no2 concentration the formation of tcnm with the uv h2o2 process pretreatment was much lower than that with the uv ps process pretreatment fig 2 the results were probably due to the fact that h2o2 has stronger oxidation ability 1 77 v in acid medium and 0 87 v in alkaline medium than inactivated ps and thus part of no2 was oxidized by h2o2 and converted to no3 it should be noted that even though the formation of tcnm during the chlorination of bpa with the uv h2o2 process pretreatment is not significant the low concentration of tcnm may still pose risk to human health because tcnm has higher cytotoxicity than tcm si table s1 plewa and wagner 2009 plewa et al 2004 3 3 effect of ph and uv fluence on the formation of tcnm during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 results on the formation of tcnm and tcm from bpa during the uv ps process and post chlorination at various ph values are presented in fig 3 a and si fig s4a accordingly higher ph typically resulted in more generation of tcnm and tcm for no2 concentration from 0 mm to 0 5 mm although the oxidation ability of ocl is weaker than that of hocl it enhances dbp formation at sufficiently high concentrations because of base catalyzed hydrolysis liang and singer 2003 similar ph dependency on formation of thms was reported in chlorination of phenols gallard and von gunten 2002 drinking water liang and singer 2003 and swimming pools hansen et al 2012 then we investigated the effect of uv fluence on the formation of tcm and tcnm during the chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment our experimental results show that 1 the impact of uv fluence on tcm formation is small si fig s4b and 2 increasing the uv fluence significantly decreased the formation of tcnm fig 3b similar tcm formation indicated that doc of the solution after treatment by the uv ps process did not change a lot and hence the obvious decrease of tcnm formation maybe attributed to the breakdown of c n bonds when the uv fluence was low e g uv fluence was fixed at 112 mj cm 2 main reactions occurred were the transformation from no2 to organic nitrogen when the uv fluence was higher e g increase of uv fluence to 225 or 450 mj cm 2 the generated organic nitrogen bonds were destroyed 3 4 mechanisms of tcnm formation during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 3 4 1 contribution of phenolic group as reported in many previous literature studies rns selectively react with compounds containing phenolic group via electrophilic substitution reactions babu et al 2012 neta et al 1988 sharpless and linden 2001 therefore we hypothesized that the two phenolic moieties in the structure of bpa can result in significant amount of tcnm formation during the chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process to test the above hypothesis we chose three compounds with phenolic moiety i e bpa phenol and tc and three compounds without phenolic moiety i e ibp ba and cbz to explore the effect of phenolic moiety on the formation of n dbps especially tcnm the model precursors are classified into three groups and their structures are listed in si table s2 among three groups group i bpa and ibp and group ii phenol and ba were classified because of their similar structures tc and cbz were classified as group iii because they can provide extra nitrogen source and have more complex structures we firstly compared the dbps formation during the chlorination of group i model precursors with the uv ps pretreatment process as shown in si fig s5a 30 79 and 234 54 μg l 1 tcm were generated from post chlorination of bpa and ibp respectively meaning that ibp and its products are readier to form tcm than bpa and its products however tcnm generated from the post chlorination of ibp was much lower than that generated from bpa around 1 10 of that generated from bpa in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm fig 4 a similarity we compared the dbps formation during the chlorination of group ii phenol and ba with the uv ps process pretreatment as shown in fig 4b and fig s5b ba is a better precursor to form tcm than phenol while more tcnm was generated from the post chlorination of phenol than ba in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm it should be noted that the difference between the formation of tcnm from phenol and ba is much smaller than that between bpa and ibp which may be because hydroxylation is easy to occur on the aromatic ring of ba due to its simple structure therefore many phenolic intermediates are generated after the uv ps process pretreatment of ba and these phenolic intermediates promoted the formation of tcnm moreover to investigate the possible impact of no2 on the formation of other n dbps we compared the n dbps formation during the chlorination of group iii tc and cbz with the uv ps pretreatment process as presented in fig 4c and si fig s5c we found that 1 the chlorination of tc and cbz without the uv ps process pretreatment results in the formation of only dcan with concentrations of 7 51 and 2 26 μg l 1 respectively 2 the chlorination of cbz with the uv ps pretreatment process in the absence of no2 also generated only dcan 6 25 μg l 1 however 3 the chlorination of tc with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence of no2 generated not only dcan 1 63 μg l 1 but also tcan 15 88 μg l 1 and tcnm 25 44 μg l 1 4 no2 has negligible impact on the formation of hans but enhanced formation of tcnm during the chlorination of tc and cbz with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 at concentration in the range from 0 01 to 0 05 mm and 5 the amount of tcnm generated from tc is much higher than that from cbz further confirming that phenolic group plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 3 4 2 effect of nitrogen source as discussed above the chlorination of tc and cbz without the uv ps process pretreatment formed only one kind of n dbp i e dcan since both tc and cbz are amine compounds with amino nh2 imino nh or subamino group we hypothesized that amine compounds are the nitrogen source of hans during chlorination but not for tcnm as we know organic nitrogen is typically present in the form of amine group or nitro group therefore to verify the above mentioned hypothesis and determine the organic nitrogen source of tcnm 3 aminobenzoate to provide amino n and 4 nitrobenzoate to provide nitro n were selected as model precursors 0 01 0 05 mm in terms of nitrogen as shown in si fig s6 the chlorination of 3 aminobenzoate generated dcan solely which agrees with the chlorination of tc and cbz on the other hand chlorination of 4 nitrobenzoate only generates tcnm which is consistent with the post chlorination of bpa with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 therefore the results suggest that no2 is transformed to nitro n during the post chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment 3 4 3 proposed formation pathway of tcm and tcnm phenol is the simplest phenolic compound and a predominant byproduct of bpa oxidization by the uv ps process therefore we chose phenol as the model precursor to identify the formation pathway of tcm and tcnm during the chlorination with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence and presence of no2 according to si fig s7 1 as phenol is oxidized using the uv ps process in the absence of no2 catechol and hydroquinone are firstly generated because of hydroxylation then the oxidization of hydroquinone yields benzoquinone and the oxidation of benzoquinone by ho and so4 results in the ring opening bremner et al 2006 then chlorine reacts with the above mentioned products of phenol via electrophilic incorporation after a series of complex reactions among chlorinated intermediates tcm and haloacetic acids haas not investigated in this study are generated 2 as phenol is oxidized using the uv ps process when no2 is present the ortho and para positions of phenol are occupied by nitro group because of the oxidization by no2 niessen et al 1988 the appearance of nitrated compounds resulted in the formation of tcnm during post chlorination 3 5 comparison of dbp formation during post chlorination and post chloramination of bpa monochloramine nh2cl is the most common used alternative disinfectant for chlorine because the low reactivity between nh2cl and organic matter results in low concentration of generated tcm hua and reckhow 2007 however the presence of nitrogen in nh2cl itself may result in the formation of n dbps as shown in fig 5 the post chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment generates 30 79 μg l 1 tcm while the post chloramination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment generates only 0 59 μg l 1 tcm and 0 24 μg l 1 dcan notably the formation of dbps significantly decreased during post chloramination but the cytotoxicity of dbps slightly increased si fig s8 in addition the presence of no2 slightly impacts the formation of tcm and dcan from post chlorination chloramination while no2 enhances the formation of tcnm during the post chlorination chloramination it is notable that when 0 05 mm no2 is present in the uv ps process pretreatment 2245 04 and 171 85 μg l 1 tcnm are formed during post chlorination and post chloramination therefore using nh2cl as disinfectant efficiently reduces the formation of tcnm during the post disinfection with the uv ps process pretreatment in the presence of no2 3 6 environmental implications according to our study the formation of n dbps mainly comes from chlorination of organic nitrogen apart from naturally present organic nitrogen nitro groups transformed from no2 by uv based aops are confirmed to be another important nitrogen source for n dbps because uv based aops are usually used at the upstream of chlorination in water treatment plants under the conditions of 225 mj cm 2 uv fluence 1 0 mm ps 5 0 mg c l 1 bpa and 0 05 mm no2 27 3 nitrite n was transformed to tcnm during chlorination of bpa with the uv ps process pretreatment we tested the role of two common types of organic matter nom and aom as examples to determine the potential risk of tcnm formation during chlorination with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 in practical applications for water purification according to si fig s9 and fig s10 we found that 1 the chlorination of nom without the uv ps process pretreatment generates 230 33 μg l 1 tcm and 2 14 μg l 1 dcan and the chlorination of aom without the uv ps process pretreatment generates 166 87 μg l 1 tcm 9 69 μg l 1 dcan and 2 00 μg l 1 tcan the results indicate that organic nitrogen in nom and aom mainly exist in the form of amine rather than nitro 2 the chlorination of nom and aom with the uv ps process pretreatment in the absence of no2 generates 3 32 and 0 84 μg l 1 of tcnm respectively indicating that part of sub amino or imino groups is converted to nitro group because of the oxidation by so4 and ho 3 no2 enhances the formation of tcnm from the post chlorination of aom and nom under the same concentration of no2 more tcnm is generated from nom than aom which is because there are more phenolic groups in nom than aom and thus nom is easier to be oxidized by rns zhou et al 2016 furthermore when no2 is present we found that 1 even though the formation of dbps from the post chlorination of nom with the uv ps process pretreatment decreases the cytotoxicity of generated dbps increases because of the increased formation of n dbps especially tcnm si fig s11a 2 both formation and cytotoxicity of dbps increased during the post chlorination of aom with the uv ps process pretreatment si fig s11b overall the employment of the uv ps process entails tradeoffs when no2 exist in the source water even at low levels because of the high risks of tcnm formation in future studies our attention will be mainly focused on two aspects 1 formation of n nitrosamines e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during disinfection is a major concern because the cancer potency of ndma is around 600 times higher than that of thms shah and mitch 2012 choi and valentine 2003 observed the formation of ndma during the chlorination of drinking water in the presence of no2 and ndma was formed during irradiation of dimethylamine by sunlight in the presence of 1 mm no2 lee and yoon 2007 therefore the formation of n nitrosamines during the chlorination with the uv ps pretreatment process in the presence of no2 is also a potential risk because all n nitrosamines contain nitroso groups si table s3 and rns can be generated during the process 2 the direct formation of tcnm or n nitrosamines during the uv free chlorine or uv monochloramine should be scrutinized in the presence of low concentrations of no2 for example the uv free chlorine process is proposed to replace chlorination in drinking water treatment plants of which no2 and free chlorine simultaneously exist in the uv free chlorine process therefore further investigations are still needed 4 conclusions the present study conducted a systematic investigation on the potential risk of the formation of tcnm during uv ps pretreatment in the presence of no2 and downstream chlorination and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the formation of tcnm was negligible when no3 was present in uv254 ps pretreatment while large formation of tcnm was observed when no2 was present in uv254 ps pretreatment when low levels of no2 existed in uv based pretreatments the formation of tcnm during post chlorination followed the order of uv ps uv h2o2 uv irradiation 2 the formation of tcnm was enhanced with the increase of solution ph 6 8 and was inhibited with the increase of uv fluence 112 450 mj cm 2 3 the presence of phenolic group favored the substitution of nitro group leading to the formation of tcnm nitro n in organic compounds resulted in the formation of tcnm while amino n in organic compounds resulted in the formation of hans no2 was transformed to nitro n in uv ps pretreatment 4 more tcnm were formed from nom than from aom because of larger fraction of phenolic group in nom nh2cl is a promising alternative disinfectant to decrease the formation of tcnm during uv ps pretreatment and post chlorination when low levels of no2 are present declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
