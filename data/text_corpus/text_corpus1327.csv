6635,the wind forcing effects on mixing dynamics and circulation can drive important bio hydrodynamic interactions in certain regions of a hydraulically dominated river lake floodplain system poyang lake connected with the yangtze river is an example of such a system the wind forcing effects on poyang lake have not been assessed in detail in this study a hydrodynamic model and a current energy method were used to investigate the hydrodynamic pattern forced by the combination of hydraulic and wind drivers and to distinguish both forcings two prevailing wind directions nne and ssw with 3 wind speed 3 m s 5 m s and 10 m s scenarios including tracer transport and residence time were further simulated to determine the wind effects the results showed that there are distinct hydraulic dominated and wind dominated regions in the three wind dominated zones various circulation patterns were determined by the wind direction and complex geometry and current speeds were positively correlated with the wind speed magnitude regardless of wind direction however residence times responded differently to wind forcings the low speed nne wind forcing was found to be the most disadvantageous for mixing and dispersion and was prone to allowing material enrichment in the eastern sub lakes an improved understanding of ecological behaviour in local zones of poyang lake is provided to guide future water management keywords wind forcing hydrodynamic model wind dominated zone residence time poyang lake 1 introduction the aquatic ecological environment in a lake is strongly influenced by physical processes through nutrient and oxygen redistributions throughout the water column laval et al 2012 hydrodynamic behaviour plays a critical role in controlling the physical processes of mass mixing and transport in lake areas hydrodynamic behaviour is determined by complex and typically nonlinear interactions between water inflows tidal forcings wind forcings and meteorological forcings at interacting spatial and temporal scales laval et al 2012 llebot et al 2014 the effects of wind on lake circulation and mixing are potentially important in most lakes such as lake superior chen et al 2004 lake geneva razmi et al 2014 lake taihu li et al 2015a and lake tanganyika verburg and hecky 2003 the dominant forcing can also be freshwater input liu et al 1997 tidal forcing sylaios et al 2006 and so on however the forcing factor in some lake systems is not always the same single factor a number of examples can be found regarding the contemporary effects of different forcing combinations ferrarin and umgiesser 2005 used a 2d finite element model to analyse the contemporary effects of both wind and tidal forces on the hydrodynamics of cabras lagoon the results indicated that the wind was the main circulation force while the tides determined the inlet mouth discharges of the lagoon and modulated the wind driven circulation de marchis et al 2012 analysed wind and tide induced currents in the stagnone lagoon and found that wind forcings can produce strong recirculation patterns mccombs et al 2014 coupled a hydrodynamic model delft3d and a spectral wave model swan to assess the contemporary effects of both wind and wave forces on the hydrodynamics in eastern lake ontario the researchers found that the impacts of waves on circulation patterns at the basin scale are negligible although waves are dominant across the shallowest shoals and along coastlines large floodplain lakes commonly exhibit complex morphological and hydrological features large rivers and multiple connected sub basins inhomogeneous topography including islands shoals and deep channels and significant variations in water level and inundation areas these characteristics result in high spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrodynamics with the exception of wind forcings the hydrodynamic patterns in a river lake floodplain system are dominated by river input and output anderson and schwab 2011 the spatial and temporal gradients in the environment and the biogeochemical behaviour of river lake floodplain systems are the result of the interaction between forcing combinations and a particular geometry assessing the dominant physical forcing is the foundation upon which to resolve water ecological and environmental problems in different local regions therefore classifying and identifying physical forcings is necessary to understand the biogeochemical behaviour of a floodplain lake the river lake floodplain system is characterised by complex forcing combinations for varying spatial and temporal scales the relative magnitude of the forces can also vary over time due to seasonal or episodic changes in wind forcings inflows and outflows gibson et al 2006 used a daily water balance model to illustrate that the interannual water level variations in great slave lake during 1964 1998 were mainly controlled by riverine inputs to the lake from the slave river bevington et al 2017 investigated the relative contributions of three seasonally distinct hydrologic forces river flooding hurricanes and repeated cold front passages on the sediment surface vertical elevation change in the wax lake deltaic floodplain indicating that river flooding is the main driver of elevation gain and that hurricanes deliver a net elevation gain to the floodplain the net elevation loss resulting from the annual cold front passage can effectively cancel out flood elevation gain except during large river flood years additionally the dominant force may vary in different lake regions anderson and schwab 2011 used fvcom to assess the relationships between wind driven and hydraulic flows in lake st clair and the st clair river delta suggesting that distinct zones of hydraulic western and wind induced eastern currents exist in the lake poyang lake is one of ten ecological conservation areas in china and includes an internationally important wetland and the world s largest bird conservation area and habitat for migratory birds hui et al 2008 wu et al 2014a as the largest river connected floodplain lake in china poyang lake is characterised by a particularly complex hydrological regime and topography consequently the hydrodynamic structure of poyang lake exhibits large spatiotemporal variability which is responsible for the spatiotemporally heterogeneous distributions of vegetation aquatic organisms migratory birds and water environments dronova et al 2011 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2014a 2017 with the recent rapid population growth and economic development in poyang lake s watershed nitrogen and phosphorus inputs have increased zhang et al 2016 a deteriorating water quality trend was observed at the interannual scale despite the moderate water quality in poyang lake wu et al 2017 moreover cyanobacterial blooms were sometimes observed in east poyang lake during summer wu et al 2014b assessing the spatial and temporal scales of the different forcings which are the basis of material transports will aid in deeply understanding the above environmental and ecological concerns to understand the complex hydrodynamics of inflow and outflow forcings in poyang lake several studies were performed to investigate the variations in the water level inundation area flow field and transfer characteristics du et al 2018 li et al 2015b 2017a qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015a lai et al 2014 adopted a hydrodynamic model to quantify the impacts of catchment inflows and the yangtze river discharge on water level and surface area in poyang lake during the rising and falling flood stages in may and october suggesting that both factors can significantly change lake water levels yao et al 2016a quantified the contribution of the catchment and the yangtze river to seasonally low water levels based on a hydrodynamic model combined with long term hydrological observations the results showed that the contributions of the catchment and the yangtze river were approximately 70 and 30 in spring 1963 and 5 and 95 in autumn 2006 respectively the literature on the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake has focused on river lake systems where mixing and transport are largely controlled by the interaction between catchment inflows and the block or drainage effect of the yangtze river however the influence of wind on lake mixing dynamics and circulation can also be important in some regions for example yao et al 2016b found that the effects of wind on the circulation of eastern sub lakes in poyang lake were greater than the inflows and outflow or gravitational convection overall the above mentioned studies show that different seasonal and spatial water levels may result from completely different drivers in this complex river lake system previous studies have generally focused on the inflow and outflow forcings and lacked direct comparisons of inflow and outflow forcing and wind forcing contributions to the spatial and temporal distributions of flow pattern in this study a 2d hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the hydrodynamics in poyang lake forced by realistic inflow outflow and wind drivers and to further investigate the wind effects on spatial and temporal flow patterns based on a series of wind scenarios nne and ssw wind directions at wind speeds of 3 5 and 10 m s this study is the first to assess in detail the wind forcings in this hydraulically dominated floodplain there are three main objectives in this study 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of the hydrodynamics forced by a combination of hydraulic and wind forcings 2 to distinguish both forcings and determine the dominant forcing in various regions of poyang lake and 3 to quantify the effects of wind forcings on flow patterns and residence times the overall aim is to use the hydrodynamic model to reveal the physical mechanisms of the various lake regions and to elucidate the biophysical interactions in local areas affected by ecological problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river between latitudes of 28 24 and 29 46 n and longitudes of 115 49 and 116 46 e fig 1 a poyang lake spans 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west lai et al 2014 with an average depth of 8 m shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes the lake has a complex topography including narrow channels internal lakes and large areas of alluvial deltas lai et al 2014 the elevation of the lake bed generally decreases from south upstream to north downstream with a difference of 6 5 m li et al 2014 poyang lake receives water flows from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a the yangtze river discharge and catchment inflows vary considerably throughout the year with a time lag between the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september and the maximum catchment inflow april june yao et al 2016a as a result the lake fluctuates from inundated floodplains at high water levels to little more than a river at low water levels with an area varying from more than 3000 km2 to less than 1000 km2 respectively and lake levels varying by 8 18 m generally poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a water level rising period march june a high water level period july august a water level recession period september october and a low water level period november february the daily measured hydrological data include water levels of five gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan representing the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas and runoff for the five major rivers in 2006 and 2010 all hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china wind data 2 00 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 daily at xingzi from 1959 to 2008 were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration wind data 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 daily for 2010 are from the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research at xingzi the above wind data at the xingzi station were used to represent the wind forcings on poyang lake a wind rose diagram is given in fig 1c showing that the nne wind prevailed approximately 32 during 1959 2008 and the ssw wind was secondary to the nne wind as the prevailing wind in summer the results were consistent with the previous literature which showed that northerly winds prevail throughout the year at poyang lake while southerly winds are predominant in summer liu et al 2016 yin and zhang 1987 the average wind speed from 1959 to 2008 was 3 9 m s of which that of nne winds was 5 8 m s and that of ssw winds was 3 3 m s the maximum wind speed reached 24 m s wind speeds of higher than 10 m s accounted for approximately 5 2 2 hydrodynamic model mike 21 developed by the danish hydraulic institute is a widely used tool to simulate water environments in lakes estuaries bays coastal areas and seas dhi 2009 considering that the vertical stratification of poyang lake can be neglected li and yao 2015 a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was implemented based on the mike 21 flow model this hydrodynamic model is an independent portion of a combined model used in a poyang lake catchment investigation by li et al 2014 this model has been successfully applied to investigate the drought and flood events and hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake over the complex bathymetry li et al 2017a b li and yao 2015 yao et al 2016a b the model domain extends from the outlets of the five catchments to the lake outlet into the yangtze river hukou covering the maximum historical flood inundation area of 3124 km2 fig 1b the model adopts a triangular mesh of variable cell size to capture the complex lake bathymetry the cell sizes vary from 70 to 1500 m resulting in a total of 11 251 nodes and 20 450 triangular elements fig 1b the initial water levels were obtained by interpolating the observed water surface elevations at the hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations initial velocity was null throughout the domain daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers combined with runoff from the ungauged catchment area were specified as upstream input boundary conditions the runoff from the ungauged area was calculated by simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff zhang et al 2014 winds as surface forcings were assumed to be uniform over the entire domain daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream output boundary conditions the time step was set to 5 s spatially varying manning numbers were used from 50 m1 3 s in the channels to 30 m1 3 s in the marshland the horizontal eddy viscosity was determined by the smagorinsky formulation smagorinsky 1963 considering the seasonal drying and flooding of the poyang lake floodplains the flooding and drying facility in mike 21 was included in the calculation other details of the model are described in li et al 2014 based on the model calibration and validation against a variety of field observations of lake level and flow rate from 2000 to 2008 the results suggested good agreement with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 li et al 2014 in addition a comparison between depth averaged velocity from the adcp acoustic doppler current profile velocity profile observations and model simulations at the cross sections of hukou and xingzi were conducted over the wet may 2008 and dry december 2008 seasons li et al 2015b the results showed that the determination coefficient r2 varied from 0 79 to 0 84 indicating a reasonable accuracy these results indicate that the model is able to capture the variation in the water level velocity and flow in poyang lake 2 3 simulation scenarios to understand the particular hydrodynamic response in poyang lake a dry year and a wet year were simulated with realistic hydraulic and wind forcings in previous studies on poyang lake 2006 was frequently analysed as a typical dry year yao et al 2016a and 2010 as a relatively wet year during the recent years of lake recession feng et al 2012 yao et al 2018 therefore 2006 and 2010 were chosen to represent the typical dry and wet cases respectively based on the 2010 data a series of wind simulation scenarios were further performed the nne and ssw prevailing wind directions were adopted the wind speeds for each direction were set at 3 m s 5 m s and 10 m s based on the average and high speeds a total of 6 steady wind scenarios were included the wind forcing was included throughout the simulation periods 2 4 method for distinguishing hydraulic and wind forcings the hydraulic and wind forcings were distinguished by using the ratio of energy method anderson and schwab 2011 schwab et al 1989 in eq 1 σ is the ratio of energy in the time variable component of the currents to the total current energy giving a description of dominant forcing i e greater energy in the time variable component results in a higher ratio suggesting currents with wind forcing dominance 1 σ u u 2 v v 2 u 2 v 2 where u v is the computed daily current vector components of each grid driven by realistic hydraulic and wind forcing combinations and the overbar indicates time averaging of u v for the whole year based on eq 1 the σ of dry year 2006 and wet year 2010 was calculated the ultimate σ for each grid was determined by the averaged σ value of the years 2006 and 2010 then the σ distribution for the entire lake could be obtained further the σ distribution for the high water level 15 m and medium low water level 15 m periods was determined therefore the σ distribution considered both wet dry hydrologic years and high medium low water level conditions for an area with a high σ value e g close to 1 0 the area can be designated as a wind dominated zone for an area with a low σ value e g 0 5 the area can be designated as a hydraulic dominated zone anderson and schwab 2011 consequently division of the hydraulic and wind dominated zones can be achieved 2 5 tracer simulation and residence time knowledge of contaminant spatial distributions is crucial for understanding a system s behaviour patterns of nutrients and pollutants the dispersion and mixing of a passive and conservative tracer were simulated to investigate the transport effects of different wind speeds and directions an initial homogeneous concentration of 1 g m3 was selected to be introduced into the water bodies under study when simulating the transport of the tracer the tracer concentration decreases due to the effects of the convection and diffusion and the spatial and temporal distribution of the conservative tracer can be determined the tracer simulation was from 1 july to 31 december 2010 to assess the renewal capacity of the water bodies forced by various winds the residence times were further calculated based on the tracer simulation the e folding time is a widely used concept for quantifying the residence times of lakes li et al 2015b monsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 2014 that is the residence time of an element is defined as the time it takes for each element s concentration to decrease below 1 e 0 37 of its initial concentration cucco and umgiesser 2006 nguyen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 realistic spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrodynamics fig 2 shows realistic water level distributions forced by hydraulic and wind forcings during low 9 january rising 1 april high 15 july and receding 27 october water level periods in 2010 suggesting significant spatial and temporal variations during the low water level period water was mainly concentrated in the main channels and sub lakes the water level was high in the southern lake and low in the northern waterway the water level difference reached as high as 6 8 m as the water level increased the water flow first inundated the channels and floodplain on both sides of the channels the water level difference was approximately 3 4 m between the south and north and decreased with increasing water levels during the high water level period the entire lake was inundated there was no significant water level gradient when the water level receded the southern and central floodplain areas emerged first and the water level gradient became obvious again fig 3 shows the current speed distribution forced by hydraulic and wind drivers corresponding to the water level variations in 2010 during the low water level period the current speed in the channels was mostly higher than 0 3 m s and the current speed in other regions was nearly stagnant at less than 0 1 m s when the water level increased the current speed in the channels increased with a maximum of over 1 m s the regions of stagnant water became connected to the channels and the current speed increased although the magnitude was small mostly less than 0 2 m s during the high water level period the current distribution was relatively homogeneous the greatest current speed was less than 0 1 m s in the central and southern lake area and greater than 0 1 m s in the northern waterways during the receding period the current speed of the northern waterway further increased and the current distribution was similar to the distribution during the rising period overall high speed currents were mainly distributed in channels the currents of the wetlands and sub lake regions were mostly less than 0 15 m s throughout the year 3 2 distinguishing hydraulic and wind forcings fig 4 shows the averaged current energy σ distribution in 2006 and 2010 during high and medium low water level periods although the σ distribution varied during different water level periods the narrow and deep channels were obviously controlled by hydraulic forcing with σ values below 0 2 while the western shore of the central lake the eastern sub lake and southeastern sub lake were controlled by wind forcing with σ values above 0 9 water level variations had insignificant influences on the range of wind dominated zones but affected the range and extent of the channel regions controlled by hydraulic forcing when the water rose to a high level the affected domain of the hydraulic forcing extended from the narrow channels to the floodplains on both sides of the channels in particular the entire northern waterway was predominantly forced by hydraulic flow including deep channels and floodplains on both sides the other regions between the sub lakes and channel regions were influenced by the combination of hydraulic and wind forcings based on the above analysis the eastern sub lake the southeastern sub lake and the western shore of the central lake as the wind dominated zones were defined as zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively for the in depth investigation of wind forcings fig 4c 3 3 circulation patterns due to wind forcings the circulation patterns in poyang lake are shown in fig 5 after 2 days of steady 10 m s nne and ssw wind forcings the streamline distributions of the no wind condition basically paralleled the channel from south to north depending on the topography there was no significant circulation compared with the no wind condition the winds resulted in significant circulations in the eastern sub lakes zones i and ii where the circulation was clockwise for the nne wind and anticlockwise for the ssw wind with similar sizes and locations in the same region in the western nearshore area zone iii the complex geometry with several irregularly shaped islands and a meandering shoreline yielded a rich structure with multiple circulations of various sizes and locations furthermore the circulation directions were different from those in zones i and ii anticlockwise for both the nne wind and ssw wind 3 4 wind effects 1 variations in current speeds the spatially averaged current speed for each wind dominated zone was calculated as representative of the current pattern in each zone fig 6 shows the variations in spatially averaged current speeds for the three wind dominated zones the current speed was largely dependent on the wind forcings the magnitude of the current speed was positively correlated with the magnitude of the wind speed for all three zones for zone i and zone ii the average current speed was mainly less than 0 01 m s under the no wind condition and increased to 0 01 m s with a 3 m s wind and 0 02 m s with a 5 m s wind the average current reached 0 05 m s with a 10 m s wind more than 5 times the current speed under the no wind condition a similar pattern was found in zone iii the various wind directions had different effects on the magnitude of the current speed the current speed caused by the ssw wind was slightly higher than the current speed caused by the nne wind for all three zones especially during the high wind speed 10 m s period although the magnitude of the current speed is determined by the wind speed the variation patterns of the current speed are also influenced by the nearby inflows the two peak currents occurred in early july for zone i and zone ii corresponding with the timing of the nearby raohe peak inflow fig 6d in addition the wind effects decreased during peak inflow periods especially in zone iii there was an insignificant difference in current speeds between the no wind condition and low wind speed conditions 3 m s and 5 m s when the inflow discharge was higher than 4 103 m3 s compared with the wind and inflow the variations in lake level had an insignificant correlation with the variations in current speed 2 variations in tracer concentration distributions tracer simulations were performed in three wind dominated zones with an initial concentration of 1 g m3 and no tracers in the other regions figs 7 9 show the tracer concentration distributions of the three wind dominated zones on the 1st 2nd 4th 8th and 15th days after tracer release under no wind nne and ssw conditions respectively although the three zones are all dominated by wind forcings the mixing and transport characteristics for each zone are different in response to the wind directions and speeds for the eastern zone zone i under the no wind condition the variation in the tracer dispersion was from south to north and from east to west due to the near raohe river inflows with the nne wind the tracer transport from south to north was blocked and delayed the blocked and delayed effect increased with increasing wind speed due to the wind driven circulation the tracer distribution was extended to the south and enlarged in area suggesting greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity based on the clockwise circulation for the nne wind fig 5 the enlarged area in the tracer distribution was limited in the sub lake and the water exchange between zone i and the other lake area was weakened during the 3 m s and 5 m s nne wind period as a result there was no significant reduction in the average concentration magnitude for the nne wind except for the nne wind at 10 m s in contrast the ssw wind transported the tracer to the north in zone i and the tracer was quickly transported out of the sub lake and downstream suggesting different spatial and temporal distributions in tracer concentration from that of nne wind forcing the average concentration was lower when the wind speed was higher for the southeastern sub lake zone ii the tracer dispersion was hardly affected except in the outlet during the 15 days of wind forcings for the western region zone iii the tracer mixing and transport were intense under no wind condition the wind forcing slightly changed the tracer distribution the nne wind was prone to limiting the tracers within zone iii compared to the nne wind the ssw wind aided in the tracer transport and dilution 3 variations in residence times the distributions in residence times of the three wind dominated zones also showed inhomogeneity fig 10 for zone i under the no wind condition the residence times were distributed from less than 20 days at the outlet to more than 100 days inside the sub lake with the nne wind at 3 m s the residence times of most areas in zone i increased by up to 100 days although the current speed was increased by wind which accelerated the diffusion and dilution processes fig 6 the clockwise circulation enriched the tracers in the northeast figs 5 and 8 obviously the gathering effect was greater than the increased diffusion ability on average the residence time during the nne wind of 5 m s approximated that of the no wind condition but with a different spatial pattern when the nne wind reached 10 m s the residence time of most area was less than 20 days this finding indicated that the residence times vary nonlinearly for various magnitudes of nne wind for the ssw wind the residence times mostly decreased to less than 20 days and the reduced magnitude corresponded to the wind speed for zone ii the wind forcing slightly decreased the residence time however the variations in residence times were insignificant among different wind directions and speeds for zone iii the residence times for all scenarios were less than 10 days the effects of the nne and ssw winds were insignificant and indistinguishable 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in hydrodynamics and wind effects the simulation results indicated that the hydrodynamics in poyang lake is characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in channel regions the current speed was much higher than in other regions and varied significantly with the water level variations in the wetlands and sub lakes the current speed was mostly less than 0 15 m s varying insignificantly during all water level periods the gradient topography and combinations of catchment inflows yangtze river blocking effects and wind forcing are responsible for the heterogeneous characteristics of the hydrodynamics in poyang lake in both the current statistics and streamline patterns wind dominated zones zones i ii and iii are verified to exist in the hydraulics dominated lake wind forcing did not change the distribution patterns of the entire lake however wind plays a critical role in the wind dominated zones the circulations forced by the prevailing wind all occurred in the wind dominated zones the circulation is clockwise for the nne wind and anticlockwise for the ssw in the eastern sub lakes because the northern part is deep and the southern part is shallow in zones i and ii the flow direction in the shallow area is downwind and that in the deep area is upwind schoen et al 2014 the circulation along the western shore shows greater spatial variation due to the presence of several islands inflows and the physical features of shallow depths these circulation patterns of 10 m s wind are similar to those of 3 01 m s at similar prevailing wind directions ne and ssw yao et al 2016b suggesting that the current patterns do not significantly change with increasing wind speed and slightly changed direction the same rule is also indicated by razmi et al 2013 meanwhile three wind dominated zones have different response levels to wind forcings in general of the three zones the wind forcings have the maximum impact on the eastern sub lake zone i and the minimum impact on the western shore region zone iii zone i is almost lentic and unconnected with the main lake area except for during the high water level period zone iii is near the lake centre and is also affected by both the ganjiang inflows and water level fluctuations of the lake although the area is trapped by islands regarding the effects of winds on current variations current speeds were positively correlated with the magnitude of wind speed regardless of wind direction and the variation patterns were also influenced by the inflow variations inflows and wind forcings restricted each other however the response patterns of the residence times to the wind varied the residence times changed insignificantly in zone iii and slightly decreased with increasing nne and ssw wind speeds in zone ii for zone i the higher the ssw wind speed the lower the residence time but the variation in residence time was nonlinear relative to the variation in nne wind speed the nne wind of 3 m s resulted in the residence time increasing compared with the no wind condition in contrast the nne wind of 10 m s caused a reduction in the average residence time in summary residence time responded nonlinearly to the various wind speeds and directions the wind forcing effect should not be ignored and different wind speeds and directions should be discriminated when investigating the distributions and variations of water and material in these areas 4 2 implications for ecology water circulation is responsible for moving dissolved and particulate materials therefore studying circulation can aid in understanding the spatial temporal structure of biophysical interactions in the system schoen et al 2014 the residence time as a measure of water mass retention within defined boundaries can explain a range of water quality and ecological phenomena such as the variability in lake nutrients and eutrophication processes monsen et al 2002 thus far ecological environmental problems have not been serious in poyang lake but ecological problems may emerge with increasing nutrient loads from the catchment inflows and external loads from human activities such as agriculture aquaculture tourism shipping and mining wu et al 2018 the ecologically sensitive regions of poyang lake have been indicated in previous studies li et al 2015b used mike 21 to simulate the residence times of poyang lake for various water level variation periods the results indicate that eastern regions have longer residence times than other areas qi et al 2016 applied efdc to simulate the distribution of the water ages in poyang lake suggesting that the eastern regions of the lake have the highest water age zhang et al 2015b collected sixty two samples to investigate the occurrence and spatial distributions of microcystins in poyang lake and found that the eastern regions have higher microcystin concentrations the researchers also found that intracellular microcystin concentrations were positively correlated with wind speed and wind speeds seemed to be important forcing factors driving microcystin spatial distributions in poyang lake compared to other regions the eastern lake region has a higher chlorophyll a concentration based on a field sampling survey fig 11 and remote sensing images qi et al 2016 as well as a higher cyanobacteria concentration liu et al 2016 which may threaten the regional aquatic health these studies indicated that the eastern regions are more prone to the development of algal blooms than other regions of poyang lake several cyanobacterial blooms observed in recent years does occur in east poyang lake during summer wu et al 2014b the above regions are the same wind dominated zones used in this study zones i and ii characterised by low velocity and potential eutrophication this study is the first to identify wind as the dominant hydrodynamic forcing in these regions and to further predict the variations in the currents and residence times forced by various wind fields the results indicated that wind forcings significantly changed the spatial and temporal distributions of the hydrodynamic field in these zones the ssw wind and high nne wind speeds aid in water mixing and transport and the low nne wind speed was disadvantageous the wind forcing has an important role in water mixing and transport in addition to the nutrient loads and biomasses wind direction and magnitude should also be considered to be governing factors influencing the ecological environment in these wind dominated zones this work can be used to support and illustrate the variations in the ecological environment of these sensitive regions 5 model limitations there are several assumptions and simplifications of the model first the effects of wind forcings were assessed based on two directions of uniform prevailing winds with three magnitudes of wind speed however the realistic wind forcing has greater spatial and temporal variability mahrt 2011 parés sierra et al 2003 particularly wind direction variation is greater during weak wind and complex topography also influences the wind variations mahrt 2011 the transitions from one prevailing wind direction to another are associated with complex transitions in the flow field schoen et al 2014 spatial wind inhomogeneity also might affect the flow patterns podsetchine and schernewski 1999 this study aimed to assess the effects of the most frequent winds in the future spatial and temporal variation in the wind field should be explored additionally a 2d model was used to detect overall horizontal circulation patterns considering that poyang lake mixed well from a whole lake perspective however wind forcing has the greatest impact on the water surface and compensation currents are probably generated at the middle and lower layers of the water li et al 2017c for wind forcing a 2d model has a limitation in depicting the vertical circulation and capturing the velocity difference between surface and bottom layers de marchis et al 2014 which might result in differences in circulation patterns from those depicted using a 3d model anderson and schwab 2011 further investigations should perform 3d modelling to better understand the effects of spatial and temporal variations of wind forcing on flow structure when vertical diffusion becomes significant in wind dominated zones 6 conclusions the current study is the first to investigate the relationship between hydraulic and wind forcings in a floodplain river lake system poyang lake china for this purpose the hydrodynamics of poyang lake was simulated using a hydrodynamic model with realistic and hypothesised prevailing wind scenarios based on the flow field statistics the hydraulic and wind forcing regions were distinguished by a current energy method the results provide new insights into the importance of wind forcings in a hydraulically dominated river lake floodplain system the results show that poyang lake is characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneities in hydrodynamics and that the main hydrodynamic character in most lake areas is not affected by wind forcings however the circulation patterns are completely determined by wind forcings in wind dominated zones in the three wind dominated zones regardless of wind direction the current speeds were positively correlated with the magnitude of the wind speed and the tracer concentration distributions were more inhomogeneous however the residence times responded differently to the wind forcings especially in the eastern wind dominated zones compared with the no wind condition the ssw wind and high speed nne winds resulted in residence time decreases and the low speed nne wind caused residence times to increase namely in eastern lake areas prone to water mass enrichment during the low nne wind forcing the study provides interpretations of the physical mechanisms in local wind dominated zones of poyang lake and has important implications for ecological variations including the occurrence of phenomena such as harmful algal blooms the current energy method based on a hydrodynamic model provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the hydraulic and wind forcings in a floodplain system and can be

6635,the wind forcing effects on mixing dynamics and circulation can drive important bio hydrodynamic interactions in certain regions of a hydraulically dominated river lake floodplain system poyang lake connected with the yangtze river is an example of such a system the wind forcing effects on poyang lake have not been assessed in detail in this study a hydrodynamic model and a current energy method were used to investigate the hydrodynamic pattern forced by the combination of hydraulic and wind drivers and to distinguish both forcings two prevailing wind directions nne and ssw with 3 wind speed 3 m s 5 m s and 10 m s scenarios including tracer transport and residence time were further simulated to determine the wind effects the results showed that there are distinct hydraulic dominated and wind dominated regions in the three wind dominated zones various circulation patterns were determined by the wind direction and complex geometry and current speeds were positively correlated with the wind speed magnitude regardless of wind direction however residence times responded differently to wind forcings the low speed nne wind forcing was found to be the most disadvantageous for mixing and dispersion and was prone to allowing material enrichment in the eastern sub lakes an improved understanding of ecological behaviour in local zones of poyang lake is provided to guide future water management keywords wind forcing hydrodynamic model wind dominated zone residence time poyang lake 1 introduction the aquatic ecological environment in a lake is strongly influenced by physical processes through nutrient and oxygen redistributions throughout the water column laval et al 2012 hydrodynamic behaviour plays a critical role in controlling the physical processes of mass mixing and transport in lake areas hydrodynamic behaviour is determined by complex and typically nonlinear interactions between water inflows tidal forcings wind forcings and meteorological forcings at interacting spatial and temporal scales laval et al 2012 llebot et al 2014 the effects of wind on lake circulation and mixing are potentially important in most lakes such as lake superior chen et al 2004 lake geneva razmi et al 2014 lake taihu li et al 2015a and lake tanganyika verburg and hecky 2003 the dominant forcing can also be freshwater input liu et al 1997 tidal forcing sylaios et al 2006 and so on however the forcing factor in some lake systems is not always the same single factor a number of examples can be found regarding the contemporary effects of different forcing combinations ferrarin and umgiesser 2005 used a 2d finite element model to analyse the contemporary effects of both wind and tidal forces on the hydrodynamics of cabras lagoon the results indicated that the wind was the main circulation force while the tides determined the inlet mouth discharges of the lagoon and modulated the wind driven circulation de marchis et al 2012 analysed wind and tide induced currents in the stagnone lagoon and found that wind forcings can produce strong recirculation patterns mccombs et al 2014 coupled a hydrodynamic model delft3d and a spectral wave model swan to assess the contemporary effects of both wind and wave forces on the hydrodynamics in eastern lake ontario the researchers found that the impacts of waves on circulation patterns at the basin scale are negligible although waves are dominant across the shallowest shoals and along coastlines large floodplain lakes commonly exhibit complex morphological and hydrological features large rivers and multiple connected sub basins inhomogeneous topography including islands shoals and deep channels and significant variations in water level and inundation areas these characteristics result in high spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrodynamics with the exception of wind forcings the hydrodynamic patterns in a river lake floodplain system are dominated by river input and output anderson and schwab 2011 the spatial and temporal gradients in the environment and the biogeochemical behaviour of river lake floodplain systems are the result of the interaction between forcing combinations and a particular geometry assessing the dominant physical forcing is the foundation upon which to resolve water ecological and environmental problems in different local regions therefore classifying and identifying physical forcings is necessary to understand the biogeochemical behaviour of a floodplain lake the river lake floodplain system is characterised by complex forcing combinations for varying spatial and temporal scales the relative magnitude of the forces can also vary over time due to seasonal or episodic changes in wind forcings inflows and outflows gibson et al 2006 used a daily water balance model to illustrate that the interannual water level variations in great slave lake during 1964 1998 were mainly controlled by riverine inputs to the lake from the slave river bevington et al 2017 investigated the relative contributions of three seasonally distinct hydrologic forces river flooding hurricanes and repeated cold front passages on the sediment surface vertical elevation change in the wax lake deltaic floodplain indicating that river flooding is the main driver of elevation gain and that hurricanes deliver a net elevation gain to the floodplain the net elevation loss resulting from the annual cold front passage can effectively cancel out flood elevation gain except during large river flood years additionally the dominant force may vary in different lake regions anderson and schwab 2011 used fvcom to assess the relationships between wind driven and hydraulic flows in lake st clair and the st clair river delta suggesting that distinct zones of hydraulic western and wind induced eastern currents exist in the lake poyang lake is one of ten ecological conservation areas in china and includes an internationally important wetland and the world s largest bird conservation area and habitat for migratory birds hui et al 2008 wu et al 2014a as the largest river connected floodplain lake in china poyang lake is characterised by a particularly complex hydrological regime and topography consequently the hydrodynamic structure of poyang lake exhibits large spatiotemporal variability which is responsible for the spatiotemporally heterogeneous distributions of vegetation aquatic organisms migratory birds and water environments dronova et al 2011 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2014a 2017 with the recent rapid population growth and economic development in poyang lake s watershed nitrogen and phosphorus inputs have increased zhang et al 2016 a deteriorating water quality trend was observed at the interannual scale despite the moderate water quality in poyang lake wu et al 2017 moreover cyanobacterial blooms were sometimes observed in east poyang lake during summer wu et al 2014b assessing the spatial and temporal scales of the different forcings which are the basis of material transports will aid in deeply understanding the above environmental and ecological concerns to understand the complex hydrodynamics of inflow and outflow forcings in poyang lake several studies were performed to investigate the variations in the water level inundation area flow field and transfer characteristics du et al 2018 li et al 2015b 2017a qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015a lai et al 2014 adopted a hydrodynamic model to quantify the impacts of catchment inflows and the yangtze river discharge on water level and surface area in poyang lake during the rising and falling flood stages in may and october suggesting that both factors can significantly change lake water levels yao et al 2016a quantified the contribution of the catchment and the yangtze river to seasonally low water levels based on a hydrodynamic model combined with long term hydrological observations the results showed that the contributions of the catchment and the yangtze river were approximately 70 and 30 in spring 1963 and 5 and 95 in autumn 2006 respectively the literature on the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake has focused on river lake systems where mixing and transport are largely controlled by the interaction between catchment inflows and the block or drainage effect of the yangtze river however the influence of wind on lake mixing dynamics and circulation can also be important in some regions for example yao et al 2016b found that the effects of wind on the circulation of eastern sub lakes in poyang lake were greater than the inflows and outflow or gravitational convection overall the above mentioned studies show that different seasonal and spatial water levels may result from completely different drivers in this complex river lake system previous studies have generally focused on the inflow and outflow forcings and lacked direct comparisons of inflow and outflow forcing and wind forcing contributions to the spatial and temporal distributions of flow pattern in this study a 2d hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the hydrodynamics in poyang lake forced by realistic inflow outflow and wind drivers and to further investigate the wind effects on spatial and temporal flow patterns based on a series of wind scenarios nne and ssw wind directions at wind speeds of 3 5 and 10 m s this study is the first to assess in detail the wind forcings in this hydraulically dominated floodplain there are three main objectives in this study 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of the hydrodynamics forced by a combination of hydraulic and wind forcings 2 to distinguish both forcings and determine the dominant forcing in various regions of poyang lake and 3 to quantify the effects of wind forcings on flow patterns and residence times the overall aim is to use the hydrodynamic model to reveal the physical mechanisms of the various lake regions and to elucidate the biophysical interactions in local areas affected by ecological problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river between latitudes of 28 24 and 29 46 n and longitudes of 115 49 and 116 46 e fig 1 a poyang lake spans 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west lai et al 2014 with an average depth of 8 m shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes the lake has a complex topography including narrow channels internal lakes and large areas of alluvial deltas lai et al 2014 the elevation of the lake bed generally decreases from south upstream to north downstream with a difference of 6 5 m li et al 2014 poyang lake receives water flows from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a the yangtze river discharge and catchment inflows vary considerably throughout the year with a time lag between the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september and the maximum catchment inflow april june yao et al 2016a as a result the lake fluctuates from inundated floodplains at high water levels to little more than a river at low water levels with an area varying from more than 3000 km2 to less than 1000 km2 respectively and lake levels varying by 8 18 m generally poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a water level rising period march june a high water level period july august a water level recession period september october and a low water level period november february the daily measured hydrological data include water levels of five gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan representing the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas and runoff for the five major rivers in 2006 and 2010 all hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china wind data 2 00 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 daily at xingzi from 1959 to 2008 were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration wind data 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 daily for 2010 are from the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research at xingzi the above wind data at the xingzi station were used to represent the wind forcings on poyang lake a wind rose diagram is given in fig 1c showing that the nne wind prevailed approximately 32 during 1959 2008 and the ssw wind was secondary to the nne wind as the prevailing wind in summer the results were consistent with the previous literature which showed that northerly winds prevail throughout the year at poyang lake while southerly winds are predominant in summer liu et al 2016 yin and zhang 1987 the average wind speed from 1959 to 2008 was 3 9 m s of which that of nne winds was 5 8 m s and that of ssw winds was 3 3 m s the maximum wind speed reached 24 m s wind speeds of higher than 10 m s accounted for approximately 5 2 2 hydrodynamic model mike 21 developed by the danish hydraulic institute is a widely used tool to simulate water environments in lakes estuaries bays coastal areas and seas dhi 2009 considering that the vertical stratification of poyang lake can be neglected li and yao 2015 a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was implemented based on the mike 21 flow model this hydrodynamic model is an independent portion of a combined model used in a poyang lake catchment investigation by li et al 2014 this model has been successfully applied to investigate the drought and flood events and hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake over the complex bathymetry li et al 2017a b li and yao 2015 yao et al 2016a b the model domain extends from the outlets of the five catchments to the lake outlet into the yangtze river hukou covering the maximum historical flood inundation area of 3124 km2 fig 1b the model adopts a triangular mesh of variable cell size to capture the complex lake bathymetry the cell sizes vary from 70 to 1500 m resulting in a total of 11 251 nodes and 20 450 triangular elements fig 1b the initial water levels were obtained by interpolating the observed water surface elevations at the hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations initial velocity was null throughout the domain daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers combined with runoff from the ungauged catchment area were specified as upstream input boundary conditions the runoff from the ungauged area was calculated by simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff zhang et al 2014 winds as surface forcings were assumed to be uniform over the entire domain daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream output boundary conditions the time step was set to 5 s spatially varying manning numbers were used from 50 m1 3 s in the channels to 30 m1 3 s in the marshland the horizontal eddy viscosity was determined by the smagorinsky formulation smagorinsky 1963 considering the seasonal drying and flooding of the poyang lake floodplains the flooding and drying facility in mike 21 was included in the calculation other details of the model are described in li et al 2014 based on the model calibration and validation against a variety of field observations of lake level and flow rate from 2000 to 2008 the results suggested good agreement with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 li et al 2014 in addition a comparison between depth averaged velocity from the adcp acoustic doppler current profile velocity profile observations and model simulations at the cross sections of hukou and xingzi were conducted over the wet may 2008 and dry december 2008 seasons li et al 2015b the results showed that the determination coefficient r2 varied from 0 79 to 0 84 indicating a reasonable accuracy these results indicate that the model is able to capture the variation in the water level velocity and flow in poyang lake 2 3 simulation scenarios to understand the particular hydrodynamic response in poyang lake a dry year and a wet year were simulated with realistic hydraulic and wind forcings in previous studies on poyang lake 2006 was frequently analysed as a typical dry year yao et al 2016a and 2010 as a relatively wet year during the recent years of lake recession feng et al 2012 yao et al 2018 therefore 2006 and 2010 were chosen to represent the typical dry and wet cases respectively based on the 2010 data a series of wind simulation scenarios were further performed the nne and ssw prevailing wind directions were adopted the wind speeds for each direction were set at 3 m s 5 m s and 10 m s based on the average and high speeds a total of 6 steady wind scenarios were included the wind forcing was included throughout the simulation periods 2 4 method for distinguishing hydraulic and wind forcings the hydraulic and wind forcings were distinguished by using the ratio of energy method anderson and schwab 2011 schwab et al 1989 in eq 1 σ is the ratio of energy in the time variable component of the currents to the total current energy giving a description of dominant forcing i e greater energy in the time variable component results in a higher ratio suggesting currents with wind forcing dominance 1 σ u u 2 v v 2 u 2 v 2 where u v is the computed daily current vector components of each grid driven by realistic hydraulic and wind forcing combinations and the overbar indicates time averaging of u v for the whole year based on eq 1 the σ of dry year 2006 and wet year 2010 was calculated the ultimate σ for each grid was determined by the averaged σ value of the years 2006 and 2010 then the σ distribution for the entire lake could be obtained further the σ distribution for the high water level 15 m and medium low water level 15 m periods was determined therefore the σ distribution considered both wet dry hydrologic years and high medium low water level conditions for an area with a high σ value e g close to 1 0 the area can be designated as a wind dominated zone for an area with a low σ value e g 0 5 the area can be designated as a hydraulic dominated zone anderson and schwab 2011 consequently division of the hydraulic and wind dominated zones can be achieved 2 5 tracer simulation and residence time knowledge of contaminant spatial distributions is crucial for understanding a system s behaviour patterns of nutrients and pollutants the dispersion and mixing of a passive and conservative tracer were simulated to investigate the transport effects of different wind speeds and directions an initial homogeneous concentration of 1 g m3 was selected to be introduced into the water bodies under study when simulating the transport of the tracer the tracer concentration decreases due to the effects of the convection and diffusion and the spatial and temporal distribution of the conservative tracer can be determined the tracer simulation was from 1 july to 31 december 2010 to assess the renewal capacity of the water bodies forced by various winds the residence times were further calculated based on the tracer simulation the e folding time is a widely used concept for quantifying the residence times of lakes li et al 2015b monsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 2014 that is the residence time of an element is defined as the time it takes for each element s concentration to decrease below 1 e 0 37 of its initial concentration cucco and umgiesser 2006 nguyen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 realistic spatial and temporal variabilities in hydrodynamics fig 2 shows realistic water level distributions forced by hydraulic and wind forcings during low 9 january rising 1 april high 15 july and receding 27 october water level periods in 2010 suggesting significant spatial and temporal variations during the low water level period water was mainly concentrated in the main channels and sub lakes the water level was high in the southern lake and low in the northern waterway the water level difference reached as high as 6 8 m as the water level increased the water flow first inundated the channels and floodplain on both sides of the channels the water level difference was approximately 3 4 m between the south and north and decreased with increasing water levels during the high water level period the entire lake was inundated there was no significant water level gradient when the water level receded the southern and central floodplain areas emerged first and the water level gradient became obvious again fig 3 shows the current speed distribution forced by hydraulic and wind drivers corresponding to the water level variations in 2010 during the low water level period the current speed in the channels was mostly higher than 0 3 m s and the current speed in other regions was nearly stagnant at less than 0 1 m s when the water level increased the current speed in the channels increased with a maximum of over 1 m s the regions of stagnant water became connected to the channels and the current speed increased although the magnitude was small mostly less than 0 2 m s during the high water level period the current distribution was relatively homogeneous the greatest current speed was less than 0 1 m s in the central and southern lake area and greater than 0 1 m s in the northern waterways during the receding period the current speed of the northern waterway further increased and the current distribution was similar to the distribution during the rising period overall high speed currents were mainly distributed in channels the currents of the wetlands and sub lake regions were mostly less than 0 15 m s throughout the year 3 2 distinguishing hydraulic and wind forcings fig 4 shows the averaged current energy σ distribution in 2006 and 2010 during high and medium low water level periods although the σ distribution varied during different water level periods the narrow and deep channels were obviously controlled by hydraulic forcing with σ values below 0 2 while the western shore of the central lake the eastern sub lake and southeastern sub lake were controlled by wind forcing with σ values above 0 9 water level variations had insignificant influences on the range of wind dominated zones but affected the range and extent of the channel regions controlled by hydraulic forcing when the water rose to a high level the affected domain of the hydraulic forcing extended from the narrow channels to the floodplains on both sides of the channels in particular the entire northern waterway was predominantly forced by hydraulic flow including deep channels and floodplains on both sides the other regions between the sub lakes and channel regions were influenced by the combination of hydraulic and wind forcings based on the above analysis the eastern sub lake the southeastern sub lake and the western shore of the central lake as the wind dominated zones were defined as zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively for the in depth investigation of wind forcings fig 4c 3 3 circulation patterns due to wind forcings the circulation patterns in poyang lake are shown in fig 5 after 2 days of steady 10 m s nne and ssw wind forcings the streamline distributions of the no wind condition basically paralleled the channel from south to north depending on the topography there was no significant circulation compared with the no wind condition the winds resulted in significant circulations in the eastern sub lakes zones i and ii where the circulation was clockwise for the nne wind and anticlockwise for the ssw wind with similar sizes and locations in the same region in the western nearshore area zone iii the complex geometry with several irregularly shaped islands and a meandering shoreline yielded a rich structure with multiple circulations of various sizes and locations furthermore the circulation directions were different from those in zones i and ii anticlockwise for both the nne wind and ssw wind 3 4 wind effects 1 variations in current speeds the spatially averaged current speed for each wind dominated zone was calculated as representative of the current pattern in each zone fig 6 shows the variations in spatially averaged current speeds for the three wind dominated zones the current speed was largely dependent on the wind forcings the magnitude of the current speed was positively correlated with the magnitude of the wind speed for all three zones for zone i and zone ii the average current speed was mainly less than 0 01 m s under the no wind condition and increased to 0 01 m s with a 3 m s wind and 0 02 m s with a 5 m s wind the average current reached 0 05 m s with a 10 m s wind more than 5 times the current speed under the no wind condition a similar pattern was found in zone iii the various wind directions had different effects on the magnitude of the current speed the current speed caused by the ssw wind was slightly higher than the current speed caused by the nne wind for all three zones especially during the high wind speed 10 m s period although the magnitude of the current speed is determined by the wind speed the variation patterns of the current speed are also influenced by the nearby inflows the two peak currents occurred in early july for zone i and zone ii corresponding with the timing of the nearby raohe peak inflow fig 6d in addition the wind effects decreased during peak inflow periods especially in zone iii there was an insignificant difference in current speeds between the no wind condition and low wind speed conditions 3 m s and 5 m s when the inflow discharge was higher than 4 103 m3 s compared with the wind and inflow the variations in lake level had an insignificant correlation with the variations in current speed 2 variations in tracer concentration distributions tracer simulations were performed in three wind dominated zones with an initial concentration of 1 g m3 and no tracers in the other regions figs 7 9 show the tracer concentration distributions of the three wind dominated zones on the 1st 2nd 4th 8th and 15th days after tracer release under no wind nne and ssw conditions respectively although the three zones are all dominated by wind forcings the mixing and transport characteristics for each zone are different in response to the wind directions and speeds for the eastern zone zone i under the no wind condition the variation in the tracer dispersion was from south to north and from east to west due to the near raohe river inflows with the nne wind the tracer transport from south to north was blocked and delayed the blocked and delayed effect increased with increasing wind speed due to the wind driven circulation the tracer distribution was extended to the south and enlarged in area suggesting greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity based on the clockwise circulation for the nne wind fig 5 the enlarged area in the tracer distribution was limited in the sub lake and the water exchange between zone i and the other lake area was weakened during the 3 m s and 5 m s nne wind period as a result there was no significant reduction in the average concentration magnitude for the nne wind except for the nne wind at 10 m s in contrast the ssw wind transported the tracer to the north in zone i and the tracer was quickly transported out of the sub lake and downstream suggesting different spatial and temporal distributions in tracer concentration from that of nne wind forcing the average concentration was lower when the wind speed was higher for the southeastern sub lake zone ii the tracer dispersion was hardly affected except in the outlet during the 15 days of wind forcings for the western region zone iii the tracer mixing and transport were intense under no wind condition the wind forcing slightly changed the tracer distribution the nne wind was prone to limiting the tracers within zone iii compared to the nne wind the ssw wind aided in the tracer transport and dilution 3 variations in residence times the distributions in residence times of the three wind dominated zones also showed inhomogeneity fig 10 for zone i under the no wind condition the residence times were distributed from less than 20 days at the outlet to more than 100 days inside the sub lake with the nne wind at 3 m s the residence times of most areas in zone i increased by up to 100 days although the current speed was increased by wind which accelerated the diffusion and dilution processes fig 6 the clockwise circulation enriched the tracers in the northeast figs 5 and 8 obviously the gathering effect was greater than the increased diffusion ability on average the residence time during the nne wind of 5 m s approximated that of the no wind condition but with a different spatial pattern when the nne wind reached 10 m s the residence time of most area was less than 20 days this finding indicated that the residence times vary nonlinearly for various magnitudes of nne wind for the ssw wind the residence times mostly decreased to less than 20 days and the reduced magnitude corresponded to the wind speed for zone ii the wind forcing slightly decreased the residence time however the variations in residence times were insignificant among different wind directions and speeds for zone iii the residence times for all scenarios were less than 10 days the effects of the nne and ssw winds were insignificant and indistinguishable 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in hydrodynamics and wind effects the simulation results indicated that the hydrodynamics in poyang lake is characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in channel regions the current speed was much higher than in other regions and varied significantly with the water level variations in the wetlands and sub lakes the current speed was mostly less than 0 15 m s varying insignificantly during all water level periods the gradient topography and combinations of catchment inflows yangtze river blocking effects and wind forcing are responsible for the heterogeneous characteristics of the hydrodynamics in poyang lake in both the current statistics and streamline patterns wind dominated zones zones i ii and iii are verified to exist in the hydraulics dominated lake wind forcing did not change the distribution patterns of the entire lake however wind plays a critical role in the wind dominated zones the circulations forced by the prevailing wind all occurred in the wind dominated zones the circulation is clockwise for the nne wind and anticlockwise for the ssw in the eastern sub lakes because the northern part is deep and the southern part is shallow in zones i and ii the flow direction in the shallow area is downwind and that in the deep area is upwind schoen et al 2014 the circulation along the western shore shows greater spatial variation due to the presence of several islands inflows and the physical features of shallow depths these circulation patterns of 10 m s wind are similar to those of 3 01 m s at similar prevailing wind directions ne and ssw yao et al 2016b suggesting that the current patterns do not significantly change with increasing wind speed and slightly changed direction the same rule is also indicated by razmi et al 2013 meanwhile three wind dominated zones have different response levels to wind forcings in general of the three zones the wind forcings have the maximum impact on the eastern sub lake zone i and the minimum impact on the western shore region zone iii zone i is almost lentic and unconnected with the main lake area except for during the high water level period zone iii is near the lake centre and is also affected by both the ganjiang inflows and water level fluctuations of the lake although the area is trapped by islands regarding the effects of winds on current variations current speeds were positively correlated with the magnitude of wind speed regardless of wind direction and the variation patterns were also influenced by the inflow variations inflows and wind forcings restricted each other however the response patterns of the residence times to the wind varied the residence times changed insignificantly in zone iii and slightly decreased with increasing nne and ssw wind speeds in zone ii for zone i the higher the ssw wind speed the lower the residence time but the variation in residence time was nonlinear relative to the variation in nne wind speed the nne wind of 3 m s resulted in the residence time increasing compared with the no wind condition in contrast the nne wind of 10 m s caused a reduction in the average residence time in summary residence time responded nonlinearly to the various wind speeds and directions the wind forcing effect should not be ignored and different wind speeds and directions should be discriminated when investigating the distributions and variations of water and material in these areas 4 2 implications for ecology water circulation is responsible for moving dissolved and particulate materials therefore studying circulation can aid in understanding the spatial temporal structure of biophysical interactions in the system schoen et al 2014 the residence time as a measure of water mass retention within defined boundaries can explain a range of water quality and ecological phenomena such as the variability in lake nutrients and eutrophication processes monsen et al 2002 thus far ecological environmental problems have not been serious in poyang lake but ecological problems may emerge with increasing nutrient loads from the catchment inflows and external loads from human activities such as agriculture aquaculture tourism shipping and mining wu et al 2018 the ecologically sensitive regions of poyang lake have been indicated in previous studies li et al 2015b used mike 21 to simulate the residence times of poyang lake for various water level variation periods the results indicate that eastern regions have longer residence times than other areas qi et al 2016 applied efdc to simulate the distribution of the water ages in poyang lake suggesting that the eastern regions of the lake have the highest water age zhang et al 2015b collected sixty two samples to investigate the occurrence and spatial distributions of microcystins in poyang lake and found that the eastern regions have higher microcystin concentrations the researchers also found that intracellular microcystin concentrations were positively correlated with wind speed and wind speeds seemed to be important forcing factors driving microcystin spatial distributions in poyang lake compared to other regions the eastern lake region has a higher chlorophyll a concentration based on a field sampling survey fig 11 and remote sensing images qi et al 2016 as well as a higher cyanobacteria concentration liu et al 2016 which may threaten the regional aquatic health these studies indicated that the eastern regions are more prone to the development of algal blooms than other regions of poyang lake several cyanobacterial blooms observed in recent years does occur in east poyang lake during summer wu et al 2014b the above regions are the same wind dominated zones used in this study zones i and ii characterised by low velocity and potential eutrophication this study is the first to identify wind as the dominant hydrodynamic forcing in these regions and to further predict the variations in the currents and residence times forced by various wind fields the results indicated that wind forcings significantly changed the spatial and temporal distributions of the hydrodynamic field in these zones the ssw wind and high nne wind speeds aid in water mixing and transport and the low nne wind speed was disadvantageous the wind forcing has an important role in water mixing and transport in addition to the nutrient loads and biomasses wind direction and magnitude should also be considered to be governing factors influencing the ecological environment in these wind dominated zones this work can be used to support and illustrate the variations in the ecological environment of these sensitive regions 5 model limitations there are several assumptions and simplifications of the model first the effects of wind forcings were assessed based on two directions of uniform prevailing winds with three magnitudes of wind speed however the realistic wind forcing has greater spatial and temporal variability mahrt 2011 parés sierra et al 2003 particularly wind direction variation is greater during weak wind and complex topography also influences the wind variations mahrt 2011 the transitions from one prevailing wind direction to another are associated with complex transitions in the flow field schoen et al 2014 spatial wind inhomogeneity also might affect the flow patterns podsetchine and schernewski 1999 this study aimed to assess the effects of the most frequent winds in the future spatial and temporal variation in the wind field should be explored additionally a 2d model was used to detect overall horizontal circulation patterns considering that poyang lake mixed well from a whole lake perspective however wind forcing has the greatest impact on the water surface and compensation currents are probably generated at the middle and lower layers of the water li et al 2017c for wind forcing a 2d model has a limitation in depicting the vertical circulation and capturing the velocity difference between surface and bottom layers de marchis et al 2014 which might result in differences in circulation patterns from those depicted using a 3d model anderson and schwab 2011 further investigations should perform 3d modelling to better understand the effects of spatial and temporal variations of wind forcing on flow structure when vertical diffusion becomes significant in wind dominated zones 6 conclusions the current study is the first to investigate the relationship between hydraulic and wind forcings in a floodplain river lake system poyang lake china for this purpose the hydrodynamics of poyang lake was simulated using a hydrodynamic model with realistic and hypothesised prevailing wind scenarios based on the flow field statistics the hydraulic and wind forcing regions were distinguished by a current energy method the results provide new insights into the importance of wind forcings in a hydraulically dominated river lake floodplain system the results show that poyang lake is characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneities in hydrodynamics and that the main hydrodynamic character in most lake areas is not affected by wind forcings however the circulation patterns are completely determined by wind forcings in wind dominated zones in the three wind dominated zones regardless of wind direction the current speeds were positively correlated with the magnitude of the wind speed and the tracer concentration distributions were more inhomogeneous however the residence times responded differently to the wind forcings especially in the eastern wind dominated zones compared with the no wind condition the ssw wind and high speed nne winds resulted in residence time decreases and the low speed nne wind caused residence times to increase namely in eastern lake areas prone to water mass enrichment during the low nne wind forcing the study provides interpretations of the physical mechanisms in local wind dominated zones of poyang lake and has important implications for ecological variations including the occurrence of phenomena such as harmful algal blooms the current energy method based on a hydrodynamic model provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the hydraulic and wind forcings in a floodplain system and can be adapted to other similar floodplain systems conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national science foundation of china 51839011 the key research program of the

6636,owing to hydrological change and human activities increasing attention is being paid to the evolution of dependence structure of hydrological characteristics especially for non stationary multivariate frequency analysis in this study we performed a non stationary frequency analysis of annual extreme rainfall of four study regions in eastern coastal china two indexes separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from daily precipitation data recorded by four pairs of gauges in particular based on the compatibility of data sets examined by the copula equality test index series sharing similar dependence structures were merged to enrich data bases for copula modelling a moving time window of 30 years was applied to the index series for non stationarity analysis an investigation of dependence evolution was conducted by detecting trends and change points in the correlation coefficient series time dependent archimedean copulas and generalized extreme value gev distribution were employed to model the joint and marginal distributions respectively kendall s return period was employed to compute the design values of the indexes results showed an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall volume and or intensity in three of the study regions and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation finally the occurrence risk of annual extreme rainfall corresponding to different joint return periods jrps was analyzed based on the observed index series the study highlights incorporating non stationarity in multivariate hydrological analysis and merging compatible data sets to improve copula inference keywords copula equality dependence structure compatibility extreme rainfall kendall s return period non stationarity 1 introduction hydrological extreme events such as storms droughts and floods greatly affect agriculture urban construction and ecosystems frequency analysis of these extreme events is needed for the design of hydraulic infrastructures and water resources management these extreme events have varying characteristics for example characteristics of extreme rainfall are amount duration number of events in a year and inter arrival time droughts are characterized by duration severity areal extent and inter arrival time and floods are characterized by peak volume duration and inter arrival time these characteristics are usually dependent variables since the joint behavior of variables has pivotal implications in practical applications the construction of joint probability distributions is important for planning design and management of water resources and environmental systems and also it helps understand the dependence structure between variables salvadori et al 2007 copulas with the advantage of modelling the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions of variables are now becoming a standard tool for multivariate frequency analysis of rainfall storms de michele and salvadori 2003 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a kao and govindaraju 2008 rauf and zeephongsekul 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010 zhang and singh 2007 droughts de michele et al 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010a b wong et al 2010 floods favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006b salvadori and de michele 2004 zhang and singh 2006 and other hydrological events bárdossy and pegram 2009 de michele et al 2007 lee and salas 2011 zhang et al 2011 recently some studies on dependence structures have also investigated the question of reliability and accuracy of copula based modeling under non stationarity which is generally considered to be a consequence of climate change and human activities milly et al 2008 several studies have investigated non stationarity in dependence structures gu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 aissia et al 2014 chebana et al 2013 and yilmaz and perera 2014 tested the existence of trends and or change points in the dependence structures as well as in marginal distributions for detecting non stationarity aissia et al 2014 evaluated the dependence between flood characteristics by analyzing trends and change points over a moving window series of three dependence measures chebana et al 2013 evaluated the non stationarity assumption in hydrological frequency analysis using two types of non parametric trend tests and applied their multivariate extensions to multi variable and multi site flood attributes they emphasized the significance of including trends in multivariate distributions copula and margins for developing appropriate models in their non stationary flood frequency analysis bender et al 2014 used time varying parameters both in copulas and completely in margins and copulas to compare the influence of positive trends detected in the joint probability and the corresponding design values jiang et al 2015 presented a non stationary copula model incorporating time and reservoir indexes as explanatory variables in marginal and joint distributions for frequency analysis of low flows zhang et al 2015 used stationary and non stationary models to analyze flood characteristics with time climate indices and reservoir index and results showed that non stationary model better portrayed changing features of the flood process non stationarity in dependence structures especially in frequency analysis of multivariate extremes is less than well understood at present and non stationarity needs further investigation despite the importance of non stationarity in multivariate analysis some studies conclude that there is the lack of sufficiently long time series to develop a non stationary model bender et al 2014 inadequate sample sizes have been a handicap in copula applications this calls for a feasible approach to enrich the data bases to improve copula modelling as well as doing non stationary analysis recently grimaldi et al 2016 introduced the concept of compatibility which seems to be effective for determining the degree of compatibility of dependence structures between catchments and for enriching scanty data bases for the estimation of multivariate copulas compatibility was initially developed for catchment classification based on the identification of hydrologic similarity it can be used to investigate the distance and equality of dependence structures through non parametric tests based on empirical copulas and is robust against small sample sizes genest et al 2009 hence it is possible to transfer the information about dependence structure from one basin to another to improve copula modelling in this paper we investigated annual extreme rainfall volume and intensity with particularly focus on their dependence under hydrological change and human activities we did frequency analysis concerning non stationarity in margins and copulas using moving window series of indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall volume total daily precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile threshold denoted by p e and intensity maximum daily precipitation i e in four coastal regions crs in eastern china to deal with the problem of insufficient data time series of no more than 65 years the compatibility test was done and as a base data sets from two neighbouring gauges were merged to improve copula modelling based on the non stationary joint and marginal distribution derived we analyzed the occurrence risks of annual extreme rainfall i e the occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall with different joint return periods jrps in each region which was done by investigating the distribution of extreme rainfall occurrence corresponding to different jrps using the observed index series the paper is organized as follows the study area and data available are described in section 2 in section 3 we introduce the methods used including investigation of dependence non stationary multivariate distribution models and the concept of compatibility based on copulas results and discussions are reported in section 4 and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area and data china has a typical monsoon climate and its precipitation explicitly decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland and the flood season varies accordingly see fig 1 the summer monsoon produces quite uneven precipitation within the year with a large amount of rainfall concentrated in summer especially in coastal areas in general in regions south of the yangtze river the flood season usually lasts from march to august or april to september and precipitation of the top four consecutive months accounts for 50 60 of the annual precipitation for regions north of the yangtze river the flood season usually lasts from june to september with the top four consecutive months accounting for 70 80 of the annual precipitation each year from april to june the yangtze huaihe region falls under the influence of a quasi stationary front causing a long rainy period of about 20 30 days the so called plum rain period in the southeast coastal area heavy rainstorms can occur in july to october as a result of the landfall of typhoons by comparison the northern regions receive relatively less precipitation and rainfall can be more uneven the largest monthly precipitation for example may account for more than half of the annual precipitation in some cases one or two heavy rainstorms can account for most of the annual precipitation extreme rainfall in coastal areas can easily cause natural disasters like floods or water and soil erosion and threaten urban areas and agricultural production the ever changing climate and increasing human activities have added to the uncertainty of extreme rainfall and the difficulty to investigate zhang et al 2013 pointed out that the spatio temporal patterns of precipitation in china is altered and the precipitation extremes are intensifying in southern china especially in the lower yangtze river basin for frequency analysis of extreme rainfall characteristics four coastal regions located from north to south in eastern china were selected for analysis see fig 1 among them cr1 and cr2 belong to a sub humid zone and cr3 and cr4 belong to a humid zone daily precipitation series of about 55 65 years were obtained from two adjacent rainfall gauges in each region to feature the rainfall pattern information about the eight gauges and available data are shown in table 1 the data was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration two indexes were used to characterize annual extreme rainfalls the first index denoted by p e measures the total amount of extreme precipitation within each year which is defined as the total daily precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile threshold similar indexes were employed in the work of zhang et al 2013 fatichi and caporali 2009 and tebaldi et al 2006 the second index is the annual maximum daily precipitation a measure of extreme rainfall intensity denoted by i e the two indexes give an indication of the severity of annual extreme rainfall from the perspective of volume and intensity both indexes are easy to construct and helpful for understanding the probabilistic behavior of precipitation extremes to have a preliminary understanding of precipitation patterns of the regions fig 2 exhibits boxplots of the p e and i e series of the eight gauges it can be seen that there is an increasing trend of p e as the study region moves southward with the median value ranging from 230 mm to 549 mm however such a trend is not obvious for i e for example the 75th percentiles of cr3a and cr3b are smaller than that of cr2b and the 25th percentiles of cr2a cr2b cr3a and cr3b show no obvious difference cr4a and cr4b as an exception show distinctly larger i e values than do the other gauges in conclusion the volume of extreme rainfall generally varies with the latitude of location while the intensity shows no evident trend indicating that the precipitation of northern regions tends to be more concentrated within a year since the index series are annual extreme values available for limited years no more than 65 years which is scanty for copula modelling we investigated the possibility of combining data sets of two gauges to enrich the samples based on their compatibility to improve copula inference 3 methods 3 1 investigation of dependence 3 1 1 measure of dependence prior to joint distribution modelling a descriptive statistical analysis concerning the dependence of extreme rainfall volume and intensity is needed which helps obtain an initial idea about the degree of association between the dependent characteristics two commonly used coefficients viz kendall s τ n and spearman s ρ n were used for dependence measuring τ n and ρ n are both rank based correlation coefficients that are intrinsically correlated with empirical copula which makes them suitable for preliminary analysis of copula modelling genest and favre 2007 hoeffding 1948 given random variable pairs x i y i i 1 2 n kendall s τ n can be defined as 1 τ n 2 n n 1 i 1 n 1 i 1 n s g n x i x j y i y j where 2 s g n x 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 x 0 and spearman s ρ n is defined as 3 ρ n i 1 n r i r s i s i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where r i and s i denote respectively the ranks of x i and y i among series x 1 x 2 x n and y 1 y 2 y n and r s n 1 2 denotes the mean value of r i and s i 3 1 2 non stationarity tests in this study τ n and ρ n were obtained for each pair of moving window series of p e and i e and non stationarity tests were performed on the series of τ n and ρ n to investigate the dependence structure of extreme rainfall indexes various statistical tests associated with non stationarity have been developed mostly concerning trends and abrupt changes which exhibit the most common non stationary behavior in hydrological time series among the methods non parametric tests with the advantage of making few assumptions are more preferable by researchers a widely used non parametric trend test is the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis i e there exists no trend in a series at a certain significance level a test statistic formulated as 4 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 is computed where 5 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x i x j for variables that are independent and identically distributed i i d there is 6 e s 0 and 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the statistic z follows a standard normal distribution despite the simplicity and powerfulness of the mk test especially its robustness against non normally distributed variables the autocorrelation of series remains an underlying problem for it would increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis kulkarni and storch 1995 therefore in the present study the pre whitening mann kendall pwmk test developed to deal with serial dependence was employed for trend tests the reader may refer to storch 1995 and douglas et al 2000 for detailed illustration to detect the existence of change points in time series as well as in the dependence structure several approaches have been developed e g bayesian method copula based method and distribution free cumulative summation cusum tests aissia et al 2014 huang et al 2015 2017 yilmaz and perera 2014 in the present study we focused on examining the evolution of dependence coefficient series and employed a non parametric pettitt test for change point tests given a series of observations x 1 x 2 x n with corresponding ranks r 1 r 2 r n the null hypothesis h 0 that no change point exists is tested against the alternative one through a test statistic 8 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 k 1 2 n and the change point k if it exists would be located where u k gets its maximum absolute value 9 u k m a x u k the critical value of u k is a function of n for details about pettitt test the reader may refer to pettitt 1979 wijngaard et al 2003 and pohlert 2017 and related applications in hydrology domain are covered in verstraeten et al 2006 and jiang et al 2015 3 2 non stationary frequency analysis 3 2 1 time dependent copula a copula is a multivariate joint distribution with uniform margins nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 have given an introduction of the copula theory and associated practical approaches according to the theorem of sklar 1959 in bivariate cases the joint cdf f x y of a random variable pair x y equals a copula function c that is 10 f x y x y c u v c f x x f y y u v 0 1 2 where u f x x and v f y y are marginal cdfs of x and y the time dependent copulas are developed to deal with non stationarity with the copula and marginal parameters varying over the moving window series which can be expressed as 11 f x y x y c u v θ t c f x x α t f y y β t θ t where α t β t and θ t denote the time varying parameters of the marginal and joint distributions a wide range of copula families with different rules of their construction can be used to model the dependence structures of variables among which the archimedean family is generally applied in hydrology for it is easy to construct and is analytically flexible three typical archimedean copula families i e the gumbel hougaard frank and clayton families were employed in this study table 2 gives basic information of these three copulas including their time dependent expressions it is worth noting that the gumbel hougaard copula and the clayton copula separately have upper and lower tail dependence while the frank copula exhibits no tail dependence to identify a best model for the variable pairs in this study the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and the cross validation method were employed hofert et al 2017 the copula parameter can be estimated with the maximum likelihood ml method in this study we employed an improved ml method by incorporating the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl estimation genest et al 1995 which regards pseudo observations as non parametric estimation of the marginal cdfs and is more efficient in computation 3 2 2 time dependent marginal distribution marginal distributions are fitted for transforming the cdf values u i v i i 1 2 n from 0 1 2 to their original units i e to obtain the design values in this study the generalized extreme value gev distribution was applied to fit the extreme rainfall index series the gev distribution is widely used to model extreme value series and is especially suitable for block maxima or minima data sets bender et al 2014 coles 2001 kotz and nadarajah 2000 a gev distribution contains a location parameter μ a scale parameter σ and a shape parameter ξ in the non stationary framework marginal distributions are regarded as time varying with the three parameters altering as the time window shifts by year a non stationary gev distribution can be formulated as 12 g e v x t e x p 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 1 ξ t where x denotes the variable to be fitted the kolmogorov simirnov ks statistical test was used to determine whether the variable followed the fitted gev distribution 3 2 3 kendall s return period return period rp or joint return period jrp in multivariate case is adopted as a common criterion to determine the risk of extreme events like storms droughts and floods which is crucial for design purposes and sizing works by now great attention concerning rp has been focused on the well known and and or types which separately correspond to the joint probability p x x y y and p x x y y a recently applied approach for jrp computation is kendall s return period krp salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2011 also known as the secondary return period vandenberghe et al 2011 suppose μ 0 is the average inter arrival time of realizations in this study μ 1 since we use annual extreme events given a critical probability level p krp can be defined as 13 t ken μ p c u v p μ 1 p c u v p μ 1 k c p where k c is the kendall distribution function defined by 14 k c p p c u v p u v 0 1 the advantage of krp is that the dangerous super critical region r p x y r c f x x f y y p remains unchanged as the realization moves along the critical layer one may refer to salvadori et al 2011 for detailed explanations of krp including the notion defined relating to krp and practical computation algorithms applications of krp are covered in de michele et al 2013 vandenberghe et al 2011 and jiang et al 2015 3 3 copula compatibility the concept compatibility in the copula domain was first proposed by grimaldi et al 2016 to deal with the problem of catchment compatibility viz the possibility of transferring information about the dependence structure from one catchment to another practically it is measured by the similarity of copulas through a statistical equality test developed by rémillard and scaillet 2009 accordingly multivariate data sets that are compatible can be merged to enrich the sample bases grimaldi et al 2016 applied it to the discharge volume and duration series with different basin scenarios generated via a rainfall runoff model in this study we adopted the idea of compatibility for extreme rainfall index series to improve copula inference the copula equality test aims at validating the hypothesis that two dependence structures are statistically identical for practical use of this study we briefly introduce here the bivariate case of the copula equality test which was presented by rémillard and scaillet 2009 suppose we have two pairs of observation series x i c y i c i 1 2 n 1 and x i d y i d i 1 2 n 2 and the corresponding copulas c and d describing their dependence structures the hypotheses 15 h 0 c d h 1 c d are tested based on the crámer von mises cvm criterion i e the integrated square difference between c and d which is expressed as 16 s n 1 n 3 0 1 2 e n 1 n 3 2 u d u u u 1 u 2 0 1 2 where 17 e n 1 n 3 u c n 1 u d n 2 u 1 n 1 1 n 2 and c n 1 u and d n 2 u are the empirical copulas corresponding to c and d the test statistic s n 1 n 3 has a certain asymptotic behavior which is used for determining whether or not to accept the null hypothesis the p value is estimated via simulation strategy induced by a multiplier technique making it robust against small samples a detailed illustration of the test and related numerical experiments is available in rémillard and scaillet 2009 and rémillard and plante 2012 the data sets passing the equality test can then be merged to improve copula modelling specifically in this study we first combined the two annual extreme rainfall index series by year and then computed the pseudo observations of the combined series for copula modelling with randomization technique performed to remove possible ties this slightly differs from the steps presented in grimaldi et al 2016 where the pseudo observations are separately computed and then combined as each group of the two data sets used in this study is recorded by two rainfall gauges that are closely located in one cr and are similar in rainfall volume and intensity as shown in fig 2 it is reasonable to combine the original series prior to computing pseudo observations grimaldi et al 2016 also presented the method to test the validity of the merging operation which was employed in this study and will be illustrated in section 4 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 copula equality test and data merging the idea of merging the paired series sharing similar dependence structures provides a useful method to enrich the data bases for distribution fitting but can only be performed when the series are compatible prior to the compatibility test we made a primary exploration concerning the joint distribution of the p e i e series for each cr as shown by the scatter plots in fig 3 note that the two indexes were converted to variables uniformly distributed on 0 1 i e the pseudo observations since the non parametric copula estimation procedures are mainly based on pseudo observations as shown by fig 3 p e and i e are positively correlated no obvious divergence between the two paired series was observed for any of the regions the observations of cr1 and cr2 exhibited a good linear correlation and the regression lines fitted are almost overlapped and by comparison those of cr3 and cr4 are rather scattered with a slight displacement of regression lines observed in cr4 nevertheless the closeness of regression lines supports the hypothesis of similarity of dependence between the p e i e series from a perspective of linear correlation to further understand the dependence structures of variables and make an intuitive comparison of the two gauges within each region fig 4 presents the empirical copulas of the series as is shown the empirical copulas of cr1 were the most similar ones and those of cr4 were relatively distant from each other which is to some extent consistent with the linear correlation in a compatibility test it is assumed that two p e i e series share similar dependence structures and the observations can be merged for modelling comparison of empirical copulas naturally brought up the question whether the distance between the two copulas of each cr was large enough to statistically reject the hypothesis to find it out the copula equality test based on cvm criterion eq 24 was conducted at a significance level of 0 05 and results are shown in table 3 evidently all the four groups passed the test with large p values meaning that all the four pairs of p e i e series were statistically compatible for copula modelling at a 0 05 significance level which satisfied the requirement for data merging to confirm this conclusion the validity of merging operation was tested each merged series was split into two halves of subsets the pseudo observations of each subset were computed and combined then copula equality test was performed for the empirical copula of the newly merged series and the original one the steps were repeated 100 times for each cr the average p values are listed in table 3 apparently all the four crs passed the validity test 4 2 investigation of dependence evolution the evolution of dependence of the paired series provided a direct knowledge about the existence of non stationarity actually one may have two concerns regarding the data merging operation first were the dependence structures of the two paired series close enough for effective combination second would the dependence structure especially its evolution over time be altered after the data were merged i e different from that of the original series the former was verified by the copula equality and the merging validity test while the latter was checked by comparison of the correlation coefficients between the original and merged series therefore we applied a 30 year long moving window to the original and merged p e i e series in each cr and computed the corresponding τ n and ρ n coefficients fig 5 presents the evolution of τ n and ρ n for the four groups as can be seen τ n and ρ n shared patterns of almost consistent variation within each group a large variation range of the coefficients was seen in cr2 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 47 to 0 65 and ρ n ranged from 0 65 to 0 84 and cr3 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 39 to 0 56 and ρ n ranged from 0 53 to 0 75 with significant increasing or decreasing trends being observed the smallest variation range was seen in cr1 measuring no more than 0 1 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 65 to 0 75 and ρ n ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 for each two gauges within a region the dependence evolution patterns were concordant and a similar pattern was also seen for the merged series indicating that the merging operation had little influence on the dependence structures as well as their evolution in most scenarios cr1 cr2 and cr4 τ n and ρ n of the merged series were between those of the original ones meaning an equalization effect of the merging operation an exception was observed in cr3 where the correlation coefficients of the merged series were smaller than those of the original series but no significant divergence was seen investigation of the dependence evolution in the four regions led to the knowledge that intuitively the dependence of the p e i e series in the four crs could not be regarded as constant therefore statistical tests were required to explicitly detect the existence of non stationarity table 4 presents the results of non stationarity tests over the τ n and ρ n series viz the pwmk test for trend and the non parametric pettitt test for abrupt changes from table 4 the τ n and ρ n series of all the crs gave consistent results concerning the trend test for cr1 and cr2 the hypothesis that trend existed in the series was accepted results of the change point tests showed a slight difference for cr1 a change point in year 2006 was detected in the τ n series the year referred to the last year of the corresponding time window similarly hereinafter while no change point was detected in the ρ n series which was somewhat consistent with fig 5 where the difference of broken lines between τ n and ρ n series was larger in cr1 compared with that in other regions for cr2 cr3 and cr4 change points of the series were located separately in 1995 1994 and 1996 and results were consistent for the τ n and ρ n series here the consequences of the trends and change points such as hydrological change and human activities were not further explored since they were beyond the scope of this study nevertheless according to the above results all the τ n and ρ n series of the four crs exhibited a non stationary behaviors although in different forms therefore it is essential to take the non stationarity factor into consideration when conducting frequency analysis of extreme rainfall index series 4 3 distribution fitting 4 3 1 copula modeling for bivariate joint distribution to model the joint distribution of p e and i e series three copula families including gumbel hougaard frank and clayton were applied a goodness of fit gof test was performed to determine whether these copulas were applicable note here that the complete p e and i e series of each cr instead of the moving window series were used to determine the best copula model which meant the copula family remained unchanged for the p e or i e series of a certain cr while the copula parameter was time varying as the moving window shifted as described in section 3 2 1 the best copula model was determined according to the aic criterion copula family with the largest aic value and verified by the cross validation method the p values of the gof test as well as the aic values and cross validation results are presented in table 5 the copula family with a p value of gof test less than 0 05 was rejected i e the clayton family for cr1m cr2m cr4m and the gumbel hougaard family for cr3m as shown in table 5 the best copula models fitted for the four crs were separately frank gumbel hougaard clayton and frank which were supported by the results of cross validation 4 3 2 gev modeling for marginal distribution in a multivariate framework non stationarity can emerge in the dependence structure and also in the statistical attributes of the univariate variables bender et al 2014 therefore it is essential to take into account the non stationarity of marginal distributions in this study the time dependent gev model i e gev distribution with the location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters varying with the moving window eq 20 was employed to model the marginal behaviors of the p e and i e series for each cr the validity of which was validated by the kolmogorov smirnov test figs 6 and 7 illustrated the time series of the two indexes p e and i e and the time dependent series of the three parameters estimated using the 30 year moving window series concerning the spatial variation it is shown that p e had an significant increasing trend from cr1 to cr4 as well as its fluctuation while i e showed no obvious discrepancy among the four regions as shown in fig 6 both increasing and decreasing trends were observed for each region and parameter for each region there was at least one parameter that had large variation cr2 was not rich in rainfall volume but exhibited significant variation of all the three parameters fig 7 shows that similar results with cr4 had significant variation of all parameters and other regions had significant variation concerning at least one parameter to confirm the non stationarity of marginal distributions the parameter values estimated in stationary case i e using the entire record were computed and signified by the grey line in each subplot apparently the time dependent parameter values deviated from the invariant value in most of the study period when there was a large variation this indicates that substitution of the time dependent parameters with an invariant one would cause inaccuracy and unreliability for subsequent analyses therefore the non stationary gev distribution was employed for marginal distribution modeling the marginal distribution models helped transform the pseudo observations distributed on the interval 0 1 back to their original units to provide a reference for the hydrological and hydraulic design this process was performed for frequency analysis illustrated below and is not presented here for simplicity 4 4 non stationary frequency analysis with time dependent copula and gev distribution fitted to the moving window series of p e and i e to model the joint and marginal distributions the design values of the indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall events were computed based on kendall s return period krp figs 8 11 present the krp isolines of the two indexes at levels equaling 50 20 and 10 years for the four crs since the moving time windows were of a large number we present here for simplicity nine of them for each cr ranging from the year 1983 2015 referring to the last year of each moving window similarly hereinafter with an interval of four years observations within each corresponding moving window are also presented although not all the plots are presented the variation of design values over time clearly exhibits the non stationary behavior of the variables as can be seen from fig 8 the design values of both p e and i e of cr1 vary over time from the horizontal perspective of the plots the krp isolines have a leftward moving tendency indicating a decreasing trend of p e the ranging scale of the marginal values provides quantitative information about the variation of the index the maximum marginal p e values were obtained for the year 1987 measured as 394 2 mm 352 9 mm and 313 8 mm corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years respectively while the minimum marginal values were obtained in 2015 measured as 340 6 mm 303 3 mm and 270 9 mm the difference was up to around 50 mm this indicates that the total annual extreme precipitation characterized by p e was reduced at a small rate from the vertical perspective i e variation of the i e values the krp isolines moved downward first and then upward with a turning point estimated roughly in 1991 due to the limited number of plots we just analyzed here the overall variation and estimated possible turning points as the plots presented and the exact pattern of the variation of the joint distribution of the moving window series can be obtained from the complete set of plots the maximum marginal i e values obtained in 1991 were respectively 150 2 mm d 126 8 mm d and 112 9 mm d corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years the minimum values obtained in 2015 were respectively 128 5 mm d 104 4 mm d and 90 14 mm d around 20 mm d lower than the maximum the index values of observations were in support of decreasing trends the observations of p e 400 m m and i e 150 m m d for example were recorded mostly in 1987 and 1991 and gradually decreased from then and remained only one in 2015 generally the decrease of design values of p e and i e implied a mitigation of extreme rainfall in cr1 the krp isolines of cr2 as shown in fig 9 appeared to be sharper than those of cr1 cr3 and cr4 figs 8 11 it can be explained as the p e and i e series of cr2 were well correlated as presented in fig 3 b the krp isolines moved leftward before 1995 and then rightward till 2015 the marginal design p e values corresponding to krp 20 and 10 were maximum in 1983 measured as 527 4 mm and 462 4 mm respectively and those corresponding to krp 50 reached the maximum value equaling 608 8 mm in 2015 actually by 2015 the annual extreme rainfall characterized by p e was seen to reach and surpass the level of 1983 the minima of marginal p e were obtained in 1995 measured as 527 7 mm 448 6 mm and 397 mm respectively with a difference of around 80 mm from the maxima by contrast the values of i e showed a small variation when krp 50 years the marginal i e values of most moving window series fluctuated around 200 mm d with a few exceptions e g the years 1983 1987 and 1995 compared with the design i e values of cr1 and cr3 which were mostly lower than 150 mm d and the design i e values of cr4 which never exceeded 200 mm d those of cr2 were much higher indicating the possibility of more violent storm events producing larger rainfall intensity although extreme observations e g p e 400 m m and i e 150 m m d were recorded more before 1991 and less after 2007 considering that the p e series had a recently increasing tendency and the i e series was almost the largest among the four crs extreme rainfalls in cr2 was severe at present and tended to intensify which is worth considering for engineering construction the krp isolines of cr3 showed a similar pattern of variation as cr2 see fig 10 regarding the year 1995 as a turning point both values of p e and i e showed a decreasing trend first and an increasing trend thereafter meaning an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall concerning both volume and intensity the maxima of marginal p e corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years were obtained in 2015 amounting to 667 2 mm 616 3 mm and 574 6 mm respectively the minima were separately 597 7 mm 558 7 mm and 523 2 mm obtained in 1995 roughly 70 mm lower than the maxima for the i e index however an obvious variation was seen for isolines of krp 50 years maximum 143 mm d in 1983 and minimum 123 3 mm d in 1995 while isolines of the other two levels showed no significant variation nevertheless the volume and intensity of extreme rainfall in 2015 had a tendency to reach or surpass those in 1983 in addition the observations were in accordance with the pattern of variation of design values as there was an obvious reduction of extreme observations before 1995 and an augmentation thereafter as shown in fig 11 cr4 as the most humid region among the four had much more plentiful precipitation and exhibited high volume and intensity of annual extreme rainfall contrary to cr2 the krp isolines of cr4 were the most round which can be explained as the paired series were relatively not strongly correlated fig 3 d horizontally the isolines remained almost stable before the year 1999 and had moved rightward since 2003 the maximum marginal p e values were obtained in 2015 amounting to 804 1 mm 730 6 mm and 669 4 mm corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years separately the minima obtained in 1999 were measured as 705 9 mm 643 7 mm and 595 1 mm the difference from the maxima were up to nearly 100 mm which was the highest among the four regions vertically from the perspective of i e the isolines moved downward before 1999 and upward since 2003 the maximum marginal values were reached in 2015 measured as 192 mm d 170 1 mm and 152 4 mm d exceeding those of 1983 the maxima were roughly 30 mm d higher than the minima obtained in 1999 which were measured as 164 1 mm d 142 mm d and 125 2 mm d cr4 as a result had the largest ranging scale of p e and i e among the four regions and also had recently increasing trends of both the volume and intensity consistently the extreme observations i e p e 600 m m and i e 150 m m d has increased significantly since 1999 considering the above analysis cr4 also called for a particular concern to compare the variation patterns of annual extreme rainfall characteristics among the four crs we present in fig 12 the isolines of krp 20 years for all the crs together as expected the volume of extreme rainfall characterized by p e increased as the cr moved from the northern semi humid area to the southern humid area viz from cr1 to cr4 however the rainfall intensity characterized by i e varied irregularly as the cr shifted from fig 12 the i e values of cr2 were even larger than those of cr4 for many moving time windows despite that the annual precipitation of cr4 was much more abundant also the i e values of cr1 exceeded those of cr3 for a long period as can be seen the two semi humid regions cr1 and cr2 in northern china were relatively insufficient concerning the annual precipitation or volume of annual extreme rainfalls but violent extreme rainfalls even more severe than the humid regions can still happen this indicated a quite uneven distribution of precipitation i e a large amount of rainfall concentrated in a very short period which might seriously damage urban facilities and farmlands inferred from the plots cr3 located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river had the most uniformly distributed precipitation also it was noticed that the mismatching of rainfall volume and intensity was particularly significant before 2003 but had improved since 2007 the design i e values of cr4 had increased and exceeded those of cr2 a similar tendency was also observed for cr1 and cr3 still the extremely large design values of rainfall intensity for cr2 and the trend of increasing rainfall intensity for cr4 were noteworthy 4 5 analysis of occurrence risk of annual extreme rainfall on the basis of the non stationary dependence structures and marginal distributions derived the occurrence frequency of annual extreme rainfall with long or short joint return period jrp which indicates a larger or smaller risk of rainstorm can be analyzed to facilitate the computation of extreme rainfall risk for each region an investigation concerning the distribution of extreme rainfall occurrence corresponding to different jrps was conducted based on the observed index series in fig 13 the scatter plots left column present the marginal and joint cumulative distribution function cdf values where each cdf value was calculated using the temporal gev and copula models of the nearest moving widow i e the one covering the latest 30 years as is shown the distribution of the extreme rainfall of different jrps denoted by joint cdf varied as the region shifted the variance of cdf values of the four regions was separately 0 078 0 081 0 063 and 0 071 indicating that cr2 and cr3 had the largest and smallest variations of joint cdf the histogram plots right column present the frequency and probability density curves of the joint cdf values it was observed that the frequency decreased as cdf increased most of the samples concentrated within the range of cdf 0 50 concordantly samples of cr2 were least concentrated which were featured by a relatively mild density curve indicating higher possibility of extreme rainfall with long jrp samples of cr3 were the most concentrated and those of cr4 were also concentrated especially with no record observed exceeding the 0 95 threshold the above analysis means that cr2 is the most risky region while cr3 and cr4 are less risky by comparison however as shown in the scatter plots the case of extreme rainfall with only one character either volume or intensity reaching a high level is observed more frequently in cr3 and cr4 which is noteworthy 4 6 discussion according to the above analysis the design values of both the indexes of all the four regions were time varying except for cr1 with a recently decreasing trend of p e and i e which was comparatively safer all the other three regions exhibited an increasing trend of rainfall volume and or intensity in particular the maximum daily precipitation of cr2 had no significant variation but was yet large enough to form severe storms cr4 had the largest design p e values as well as the largest variation of p e comparison among the four crs highlighted the unevenly distributed precipitation in the northern areas the southern regions cr3 and cr4 were more abundant in annual precipitation and possessed large volumes of extreme rainfall while the northern regions cr1 and cr2 were measured to have larger rainfall intensity in conclusion the variation of extreme rainfall in these coastal regions was remarkable from the perspective of both volume and intensity concerning the approaches employed in this study and the related applications the following is noted merging the compatible data sets based on the copula equality test was effective for enriching the data bases and improving copula modelling the merged series generally restored the dependence structure of the original ones as well as its evolution in this study the pwmk and pettitt tests were employed for the detection of trends and change points in the coefficient series as a primary investigation of the dependence evolution given that there might be complicated factors accounting for time variation of the characteristics of multivariate hydrological series statistical tests that are more powerful and efficient for non stationarity detection e g multivariate trend and change point tests might be developed or applied if one focused on the variation patterns non stationarity in the dependence structure of the p e i e series proved to be non negligible ignoring the dependence evolution of multivariate hydrological series would lead to the lack of knowledge about trends and changes existing in the multivariate distribution patterns and cause over or under estimation of the design values associated with hydrological and hydraulic engineering moreover the two indexes used in this paper characterizing annual extreme rainfall i e p e and i e separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from the long term daily precipitation data available investigation of the two indexes provided a general understanding of the extreme rainfall patterns especially severe multi day storm events threatening urban infrastructures and farmlands actually other indexes characterizing extreme rainfall e g intensity duration and volume of storms that are meaningful are also recommended especially when high resolution precipitation data e g hourly records is available 5 conclusions in this paper we conducted a non stationary frequency analysis concerning the volume and intensity of annual extreme rainfall time dependent copulas and gev models were applied to the moving window series of two indexes derived from daily precipitation data of four coastal regions in eastern china non stationarity tests for trends and change points were performed on the correlation coefficient series to investigate the dependence evolution each pair of data sets corresponding to a coastal region was found to be compatible according to the copula equality test and was merged to enrich the data bases for copula modelling based on frequency analysis the design values of the two indexes were computed and presented by the krp isolines the variation of isolines over the moving time windows revealed an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall after the year 1995 in three of the regions the northern coastal regions are much less in rainfall volume than the southern regions but exhibit higher rainfall intensity indicating an uneven distribution of precipitation analysis of the extreme rainfall occurrence risk based on the observed index series found that cr2 has the largest risk of extreme rainfall corresponding to long jrp this study highlighted the importance of incorporating non stationarity into multivariate frequency analysis based on the investigation of dependence evolution of the characteristic series and applied the concept of copula compatibility to solve data deficiency problem in addition kendall s return period which is conceptually more practical for engineering design was employed to compute the design values of indexes associated with annual extreme rainfall given the increasing attention focused on non stationarity of multivariate dependence in hydrological investigations and the general application of copula modelling in frequency analysis the approaches employed in this study are worth considering for application in many other fields of interest e g storms droughts floods etc future efforts will be devoted to more effective statistical tests for non stationarity and more suitable and flexible models for time dependent

6636,owing to hydrological change and human activities increasing attention is being paid to the evolution of dependence structure of hydrological characteristics especially for non stationary multivariate frequency analysis in this study we performed a non stationary frequency analysis of annual extreme rainfall of four study regions in eastern coastal china two indexes separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from daily precipitation data recorded by four pairs of gauges in particular based on the compatibility of data sets examined by the copula

stationarity analysis an investigation of dependence evolution was conducted by detecting trends and change points in the correlation coefficient series time dependent archimedean copulas and generalized extreme value gev distribution were employed to model the joint and marginal distributions respectively kendall s return period was employed to compute the design values of the indexes

1 introduction hydrological extreme events such as storms droughts and floods greatly affect agriculture urban construction and ecosystems frequency analysis of these extreme events is needed for the design of hydraulic infrastructures and water resources management these extreme events have varying characteristics for example characteristics of extreme rainfall are amount duration number of events in a year and inter arrival time droughts are characterized by duration severity areal extent and inter arrival time and floods are characterized by peak volume duration and inter arrival time these characteristics are usually dependent variables since the joint behavior of variables has pivotal implications in practical applications the construction of joint probability distributions is important for planning design and management of water resources and environmental systems and also it helps understand the dependence structure between variables salvadori et al 2007 copulas with the advantage of modelling the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions of variables are now becoming a standard tool for multivariate frequency analysis of rainfall storms de michele and salvadori 2003 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a kao and govindaraju 2008 rauf and zeephongsekul 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010 zhang and singh 2007 droughts de michele et al 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010a b wong et al 2010 floods favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006b salvadori and de michele 2004 zhang and singh 2006 and other hydrological events bárdossy and pegram 2009 de michele et al 2007 lee and salas 2011 zhang et al 2011 recently some studies on dependence structures have also investigated the question of reliability and accuracy of copula based modeling under non stationarity which is generally considered to be a consequence of climate change and human activities milly et al 2008 several studies have investigated non stationarity in dependence structures gu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 aissia et al 2014 chebana et al 2013 and yilmaz and perera 2014 tested the existence of trends and or change points in the dependence structures as well as in marginal distributions for detecting non stationarity aissia et al 2014 evaluated the dependence between flood characteristics by analyzing trends and change points over a moving window series of three dependence measures chebana et al 2013 evaluated the non stationarity assumption in hydrological frequency analysis using two types of non parametric trend tests and applied their multivariate extensions to multi variable and multi site flood attributes they emphasized the significance of including trends in multivariate distributions copula and margins for developing appropriate models in their non stationary flood frequency analysis bender et al 2014 used time varying parameters both in copulas and completely in margins and copulas to compare the influence of positive trends detected in the joint probability and the corresponding design values jiang et al 2015 presented a non stationary copula model incorporating time and reservoir indexes as explanatory variables in marginal and joint distributions for frequency analysis of low flows zhang et al 2015 used stationary and non stationary models to analyze flood characteristics with time climate indices and reservoir index and results showed that non stationary model better portrayed changing features of the flood process non stationarity in dependence structures especially in frequency analysis of multivariate extremes is less than well understood at present and non stationarity needs further investigation despite the importance of non stationarity in multivariate analysis some studies conclude that there is the lack of sufficiently long time series to develop a non stationary model bender et al 2014 inadequate sample sizes have been a handicap in copula applications this calls for a feasible approach to enrich the data bases to improve copula modelling as well as doing non stationary analysis recently grimaldi et al 2016 introduced the concept of compatibility which seems to be effective for determining the degree of compatibility of dependence structures between catchments and for enriching scanty data bases for the estimation of multivariate copulas compatibility was initially developed for catchment classification based on the identification of hydrologic similarity it can be used to investigate the distance and equality of dependence structures through non parametric tests based on empirical copulas and is robust against small sample sizes genest et al 2009 hence it is possible to transfer the information about dependence structure from one basin to another to improve copula modelling in this paper we investigated annual extreme rainfall volume and intensity with particularly focus on their dependence under hydrological change and human activities we did frequency analysis concerning non stationarity in margins and copulas using moving window series of indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall volume total daily precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile threshold denoted by p e and intensity maximum daily precipitation i e in four coastal regions crs in eastern china to deal with the problem of insufficient data time series of no more than 65 years the compatibility test was done and as a base data sets from two neighbouring gauges were merged to improve copula modelling based on the non stationary joint and marginal distribution derived we analyzed the occurrence risks of annual extreme rainfall i e the occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall with different joint return periods jrps in each region which was done by investigating the distribution of extreme rainfall occurrence corresponding to different jrps using the observed index series the paper is organized as follows the study area and data available are described in section 2 in section 3 we introduce the methods used including investigation of dependence non stationary multivariate distribution models and the concept of compatibility based on copulas results and discussions are reported in section 4 and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area and data china has a typical monsoon climate and its precipitation explicitly decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland and the flood season varies accordingly see fig 1 the summer monsoon produces quite uneven precipitation within the year with a large amount of rainfall concentrated in summer especially in coastal areas in general in regions south of the yangtze river the flood season usually lasts from march to august or april to september and precipitation of the top four consecutive months accounts for 50 60 of the annual precipitation for regions north of the yangtze river the flood season usually lasts from june to september with the top four consecutive months accounting for 70 80 of the annual precipitation each year from april to june the yangtze huaihe region falls under the influence of a quasi stationary front causing a long rainy period of about 20 30 days the so called plum rain period in the southeast coastal area heavy rainstorms can occur in july to october as a result of the landfall of typhoons by comparison the northern regions receive relatively less precipitation and rainfall can be more uneven the largest monthly precipitation for example may account for more than half of the annual precipitation in some cases one or two heavy rainstorms can account for most of the annual precipitation extreme rainfall in coastal areas can easily cause natural disasters like floods or water and soil erosion and threaten urban areas and agricultural production the ever changing climate and increasing human activities have added to the uncertainty of extreme rainfall and the difficulty to investigate zhang et al 2013 pointed out that the spatio temporal patterns of precipitation in china is altered and the precipitation extremes are intensifying in southern china especially in the lower yangtze river basin for frequency analysis of extreme rainfall characteristics four coastal regions located from north to south in eastern china were selected for analysis see fig 1 among them cr1 and cr2 belong to a sub humid zone and cr3 and cr4 belong to a humid zone daily precipitation series of about 55 65 years were obtained from two adjacent rainfall gauges in each region to feature the rainfall pattern information about the eight gauges and available data are shown in table 1 the data was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration two indexes were used to characterize annual extreme rainfalls the first index denoted by p e measures the total amount of extreme precipitation within each year which is defined as the total daily precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile threshold similar indexes were employed in the work of zhang et al 2013 fatichi and caporali 2009 and tebaldi et al 2006 the second index is the annual maximum daily precipitation a measure of extreme rainfall intensity denoted by i e the two indexes give an indication of the severity of annual extreme rainfall from the perspective of volume and intensity both indexes are easy to construct and helpful for understanding the probabilistic behavior of precipitation extremes to have a preliminary understanding of precipitation patterns of the regions fig 2 exhibits boxplots of the p e and i e series of the eight gauges it can be seen that there is an increasing trend of p e as the study region moves southward with the median value ranging from 230 mm to 549 mm however such a trend is not obvious for i e for example the 75th percentiles of cr3a and cr3b are smaller than that of cr2b and the 25th percentiles of cr2a cr2b cr3a and cr3b show no obvious difference cr4a and cr4b as an exception show distinctly larger i e values than do the other gauges in conclusion the volume of extreme rainfall generally varies with the latitude of location while the intensity shows no evident trend indicating that the precipitation of northern regions tends to be more concentrated within a year since the index series are annual extreme values available for limited years no more than 65 years which is scanty for copula modelling we investigated the possibility of combining data sets of two gauges to enrich the samples based on their compatibility to improve copula inference 3 methods 3 1 investigation of dependence 3 1 1 measure of dependence prior to joint distribution modelling a descriptive statistical analysis concerning the dependence of extreme rainfall volume and intensity is needed which helps obtain an initial idea about the degree of association between the dependent characteristics two commonly used coefficients viz kendall s τ n and spearman s ρ n were used for dependence measuring τ n and ρ n are both rank based correlation coefficients that are intrinsically correlated with empirical copula which makes them suitable for preliminary analysis of copula modelling genest and favre 2007 hoeffding 1948 given random variable pairs x i y i i 1 2 n kendall s τ n can be defined as 1 τ n 2 n n 1 i 1 n 1 i 1 n s g n x i x j y i y j where 2 s g n x 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 x 0 and spearman s ρ n is defined as 3 ρ n i 1 n r i r s i s i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where r i and s i denote respectively the ranks of x i and y i among series x 1 x 2 x n and y 1 y 2 y n and r s n 1 2 denotes the mean value of r i and s i 3 1 2 non stationarity tests in this study τ n and ρ n were obtained for each pair of moving window series of p e and i e and non stationarity tests were performed on the series of τ n and ρ n to investigate the dependence structure of extreme rainfall indexes various statistical tests associated with non stationarity have been developed mostly concerning trends and abrupt changes which exhibit the most common non stationary behavior in hydrological time series among the methods non parametric tests with the advantage of making few assumptions are more preferable by researchers a widely used non parametric trend test is the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis i e there exists no trend in a series at a certain significance level a test statistic formulated as 4 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 is computed where 5 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x i x j for variables that are independent and identically distributed i i d there is 6 e s 0 and 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the statistic z follows a standard normal distribution despite the simplicity and powerfulness of the mk test especially its robustness against non normally distributed variables the autocorrelation of series remains an underlying problem for it would increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis kulkarni and storch 1995 therefore in the present study the pre whitening mann kendall pwmk test developed to deal with serial dependence was employed for trend tests the reader may refer to storch 1995 and douglas et al 2000 for detailed illustration to detect the existence of change points in time series as well as in the dependence structure several approaches have been developed e g bayesian method copula based method and distribution free cumulative summation cusum tests aissia et al 2014 huang et al 2015 2017 yilmaz and perera 2014 in the present study we focused on examining the evolution of dependence coefficient series and employed a non parametric pettitt test for change point tests given a series of observations x 1 x 2 x n with corresponding ranks r 1 r 2 r n the null hypothesis h 0 that no change point exists is tested against the alternative one through a test statistic 8 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 k 1 2 n and the change point k if it exists would be located where u k gets its maximum absolute value 9 u k m a x u k the critical value of u k is a function of n for details about pettitt test the reader may refer to pettitt 1979 wijngaard et al 2003 and pohlert 2017 and related applications in hydrology domain are covered in verstraeten et al 2006 and jiang et al 2015 3 2 non stationary frequency analysis 3 2 1 time dependent copula a copula is a multivariate joint distribution with uniform margins nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 have given an introduction of the copula theory and associated practical approaches according to the theorem of sklar 1959 in bivariate cases the joint cdf f x y of a random variable pair x y equals a copula function c that is 10 f x y x y c u v c f x x f y y u v 0 1 2 where u f x x and v f y y are marginal cdfs of x and y the time dependent copulas are developed to deal with non stationarity with the copula and marginal parameters varying over the moving window series which can be expressed as 11 f x y x y c u v θ t c f x x α t f y y β t θ t where α t β t and θ t denote the time varying parameters of the marginal and joint distributions a wide range of copula families with different rules of their construction can be used to model the dependence structures of variables among which the archimedean family is generally applied in hydrology for it is easy to construct and is analytically flexible three typical archimedean copula families i e the gumbel hougaard frank and clayton families were employed in this study table 2 gives basic information of these three copulas including their time dependent expressions it is worth noting that the gumbel hougaard copula and the clayton copula separately have upper and lower tail dependence while the frank copula exhibits no tail dependence to identify a best model for the variable pairs in this study the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and the cross validation method were employed hofert et al 2017 the copula parameter can be estimated with the maximum likelihood ml method in this study we employed an improved ml method by incorporating the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl estimation genest et al 1995 which regards pseudo observations as non parametric estimation of the marginal cdfs and is more efficient in computation 3 2 2 time dependent marginal distribution marginal distributions are fitted for transforming the cdf values u i v i i 1 2 n from 0 1 2 to their original units i e to obtain the design values in this study the generalized extreme value gev distribution was applied to fit the extreme rainfall index series the gev distribution is widely used to model extreme value series and is especially suitable for block maxima or minima data sets bender et al 2014 coles 2001 kotz and nadarajah 2000 a gev distribution contains a location parameter μ a scale parameter σ and a shape parameter ξ in the non stationary framework marginal distributions are regarded as time varying with the three parameters altering as the time window shifts by year a non stationary gev distribution can be formulated as 12 g e v x t e x p 1 ξ t x μ t σ t 1 ξ t where x denotes the variable to be fitted the kolmogorov simirnov ks statistical test was used to determine whether the variable followed the fitted gev distribution 3 2 3 kendall s return period return period rp or joint return period jrp in multivariate case is adopted as a common criterion to determine the risk of extreme events like storms droughts and floods which is crucial for design purposes and sizing works by now great attention concerning rp has been focused on the well known and and or types which separately correspond to the joint probability p x x y y and p x x y y a recently applied approach for jrp computation is kendall s return period krp salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2011 also known as the secondary return period vandenberghe et al 2011 suppose μ 0 is the average inter arrival time of realizations in this study μ 1 since we use annual extreme events given a critical probability level p krp can be defined as 13 t ken μ p c u v p μ 1 p c u v p μ 1 k c p where k c is the kendall distribution function defined by 14 k c p p c u v p u v 0 1 the advantage of krp is that the dangerous super critical region r p x y r c f x x f y y p remains unchanged as the realization moves along the critical layer one may refer to salvadori et al 2011 for detailed explanations of krp including the notion defined relating to krp and practical computation algorithms applications of krp are covered in de michele et al 2013 vandenberghe et al 2011 and jiang et al 2015 3 3 copula compatibility the concept compatibility in the copula domain was first proposed by grimaldi et al 2016 to deal with the problem of catchment compatibility viz the possibility of transferring information about the dependence structure from one catchment to another practically it is measured by the similarity of copulas through a statistical equality test developed by rémillard and scaillet 2009 accordingly multivariate data sets that are compatible can be merged to enrich the sample bases grimaldi et al 2016 applied it to the discharge volume and duration series with different basin scenarios generated via a rainfall runoff model in this study we adopted the idea of compatibility for extreme rainfall index series to improve copula inference the copula equality test aims at validating the hypothesis that two dependence structures are statistically identical for practical use of this study we briefly introduce here the bivariate case of the copula equality test which was presented by rémillard and scaillet 2009 suppose we have two pairs of observation series x i c y i c i 1 2 n 1 and x i d y i d i 1 2 n 2 and the corresponding copulas c and d describing their dependence structures the hypotheses 15 h 0 c d h 1 c d are tested based on the crámer von mises cvm criterion i e the integrated square difference between c and d which is expressed as 16 s n 1 n 3 0 1 2 e n 1 n 3 2 u d u u u 1 u 2 0 1 2 where 17 e n 1 n 3 u c n 1 u d n 2 u 1 n 1 1 n 2 and c n 1 u and d n 2 u are the empirical copulas corresponding to c and d the test statistic s n 1 n 3 has a certain asymptotic behavior which is used for determining whether or not to accept the null hypothesis the p value is estimated via simulation strategy induced by a multiplier technique making it robust against small samples a detailed illustration of the test and related numerical experiments is available in rémillard and scaillet 2009 and rémillard and plante 2012 the data sets passing the equality test can then be merged to improve copula modelling specifically in this study we first combined the two annual extreme rainfall index series by year and then computed the pseudo observations of the combined series for copula modelling with randomization technique performed to remove possible ties this slightly differs from the steps presented in grimaldi et al 2016 where the pseudo observations are separately computed and then combined as each group of the two data sets used in this study is recorded by two rainfall gauges that are closely located in one cr and are similar in rainfall volume and intensity as shown in fig 2 it is reasonable to combine the original series prior to computing pseudo observations grimaldi et al 2016 also presented the method to test the validity of the merging operation which was employed in this study and will be illustrated in section 4 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 copula equality test and data merging the idea of merging the paired series sharing similar dependence structures provides a useful method to enrich the data bases for distribution fitting but can only be performed when the series are compatible prior to the compatibility test we made a primary exploration concerning the joint distribution of the p e i e series for each cr as shown by the scatter plots in fig 3 note that the two indexes were converted to variables uniformly distributed on 0 1 i e the pseudo observations since the non parametric copula estimation procedures are mainly based on pseudo observations as shown by fig 3 p e and i e are positively correlated no obvious divergence between the two paired series was observed for any of the regions the observations of cr1 and cr2 exhibited a good linear correlation and the regression lines fitted are almost overlapped and by comparison those of cr3 and cr4 are rather scattered with a slight displacement of regression lines observed in cr4 nevertheless the closeness of regression lines supports the hypothesis of similarity of dependence between the p e i e series from a perspective of linear correlation to further understand the dependence structures of variables and make an intuitive comparison of the two gauges within each region fig 4 presents the empirical copulas of the series as is shown the empirical copulas of cr1 were the most similar ones and those of cr4 were relatively distant from each other which is to some extent consistent with the linear correlation in a compatibility test it is assumed that two p e i e series share similar dependence structures and the observations can be merged for modelling comparison of empirical copulas naturally brought up the question whether the distance between the two copulas of each cr was large enough to statistically reject the hypothesis to find it out the copula equality test based on cvm criterion eq 24 was conducted at a significance level of 0 05 and results are shown in table 3 evidently all the four groups passed the test with large p values meaning that all the four pairs of p e i e series were statistically compatible for copula modelling at a 0 05 significance level which satisfied the requirement for data merging to confirm this conclusion the validity of merging operation was tested each merged series was split into two halves of subsets the pseudo observations of each subset were computed and combined then copula equality test was performed for the empirical copula of the newly merged series and the original one the steps were repeated 100 times for each cr the average p values are listed in table 3 apparently all the four crs passed the validity test 4 2 investigation of dependence evolution the evolution of dependence of the paired series provided a direct knowledge about the existence of non stationarity actually one may have two concerns regarding the data merging operation first were the dependence structures of the two paired series close enough for effective combination second would the dependence structure especially its evolution over time be altered after the data were merged i e different from that of the original series the former was verified by the copula equality and the merging validity test while the latter was checked by comparison of the correlation coefficients between the original and merged series therefore we applied a 30 year long moving window to the original and merged p e i e series in each cr and computed the corresponding τ n and ρ n coefficients fig 5 presents the evolution of τ n and ρ n for the four groups as can be seen τ n and ρ n shared patterns of almost consistent variation within each group a large variation range of the coefficients was seen in cr2 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 47 to 0 65 and ρ n ranged from 0 65 to 0 84 and cr3 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 39 to 0 56 and ρ n ranged from 0 53 to 0 75 with significant increasing or decreasing trends being observed the smallest variation range was seen in cr1 measuring no more than 0 1 τ n of the merged series ranged from 0 65 to 0 75 and ρ n ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 for each two gauges within a region the dependence evolution patterns were concordant and a similar pattern was also seen for the merged series indicating that the merging operation had little influence on the dependence structures as well as their evolution in most scenarios cr1 cr2 and cr4 τ n and ρ n of the merged series were between those of the original ones meaning an equalization effect of the merging operation an exception was observed in cr3 where the correlation coefficients of the merged series were smaller than those of the original series but no significant divergence was seen investigation of the dependence evolution in the four regions led to the knowledge that intuitively the dependence of the p e i e series in the four crs could not be regarded as constant therefore statistical tests were required to explicitly detect the existence of non stationarity table 4 presents the results of non stationarity tests over the τ n and ρ n series viz the pwmk test for trend and the non parametric pettitt test for abrupt changes from table 4 the τ n and ρ n series of all the crs gave consistent results concerning the trend test for cr1 and cr2 the hypothesis that trend existed in the series was accepted results of the change point tests showed a slight difference for cr1 a change point in year 2006 was detected in the τ n series the year referred to the last year of the corresponding time window similarly hereinafter while no change point was detected in the ρ n series which was somewhat consistent with fig 5 where the difference of broken lines between τ n and ρ n series was larger in cr1 compared with that in other regions for cr2 cr3 and cr4 change points of the series were located separately in 1995 1994 and 1996 and results were consistent for the τ n and ρ n series here the consequences of the trends and change points such as hydrological change and human activities were not further explored since they were beyond the scope of this study nevertheless according to the above results all the τ n and ρ n series of the four crs exhibited a non stationary behaviors although in different forms therefore it is essential to take the non stationarity factor into consideration when conducting frequency analysis of extreme rainfall index series 4 3 distribution fitting 4 3 1 copula modeling for bivariate joint distribution to model the joint distribution of p e and i e series three copula families including gumbel hougaard frank and clayton were applied a goodness of fit gof test was performed to determine whether these copulas were applicable note here that the complete p e and i e series of each cr instead of the moving window series were used to determine the best copula model which meant the copula family remained unchanged for the p e or i e series of a certain cr while the copula parameter was time varying as the moving window shifted as described in section 3 2 1 the best copula model was determined according to the aic criterion copula family with the largest aic value and verified by the cross validation method the p values of the gof test as well as the aic values and cross validation results are presented in table 5 the copula family with a p value of gof test less than 0 05 was rejected i e the clayton family for cr1m cr2m cr4m and the gumbel hougaard family for cr3m as shown in table 5 the best copula models fitted for the four crs were separately frank gumbel hougaard clayton and frank which were supported by the results of cross validation 4 3 2 gev modeling for marginal distribution in a multivariate framework non stationarity can emerge in the dependence structure and also in the statistical attributes of the univariate variables bender et al 2014 therefore it is essential to take into account the non stationarity of marginal distributions in this study the time dependent gev model i e gev distribution with the location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters varying with the moving window eq 20 was employed to model the marginal behaviors of the p e and i e series for each cr the validity of which was validated by the kolmogorov smirnov test figs 6 and 7 illustrated the time series of the two indexes p e and i e and the time dependent series of the three parameters estimated using the 30 year moving window series concerning the spatial variation it is shown that p e had an significant increasing trend from cr1 to cr4 as well as its fluctuation while i e showed no obvious discrepancy among the four regions as shown in fig 6 both increasing and decreasing trends were observed for each region and parameter for each region there was at least one parameter that had large variation cr2 was not rich in rainfall volume but exhibited significant variation of all the three parameters fig 7 shows that similar results with cr4 had significant variation of all parameters and other regions had significant variation concerning at least one parameter to confirm the non stationarity of marginal distributions the parameter values estimated in stationary case i e using the entire record were computed and signified by the grey line in each subplot apparently the time dependent parameter values deviated from the invariant value in most of the study period when there was a large variation this indicates that substitution of the time dependent parameters with an invariant one would cause inaccuracy and unreliability for subsequent analyses therefore the non stationary gev distribution was employed for marginal distribution modeling the marginal distribution models helped transform the pseudo observations distributed on the interval 0 1 back to their original units to provide a reference for the hydrological and hydraulic design this process was performed for frequency analysis illustrated below and is not presented here for simplicity 4 4 non stationary frequency analysis with time dependent copula and gev distribution fitted to the moving window series of p e and i e to model the joint and marginal distributions the design values of the indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall events were computed based on kendall s return period krp figs 8 11 present the krp isolines of the two indexes at levels equaling 50 20 and 10 years for the four crs since the moving time windows were of a large number we present here for simplicity nine of them for each cr ranging from the year 1983 2015 referring to the last year of each moving window similarly hereinafter with an interval of four years observations within each corresponding moving window are also presented although not all the plots are presented the variation of design values over time clearly exhibits the non stationary behavior of the variables as can be seen from fig 8 the design values of both p e and i e of cr1 vary over time from the horizontal perspective of the plots the krp isolines have a leftward moving tendency indicating a decreasing trend of p e the ranging scale of the marginal values provides quantitative information about the variation of the index the maximum marginal p e values were obtained for the year 1987 measured as 394 2 mm 352 9 mm and 313 8 mm corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years respectively while the minimum marginal values were obtained in 2015 measured as 340 6 mm 303 3 mm and 270 9 mm the difference was up to around 50 mm this indicates that the total annual extreme precipitation characterized by p e was reduced at a small rate from the vertical perspective i e variation of the i e values the krp isolines moved downward first and then upward with a turning point estimated roughly in 1991 due to the limited number of plots we just analyzed here the overall variation and estimated possible turning points as the plots presented and the exact pattern of the variation of the joint distribution of the moving window series can be obtained from the complete set of plots the maximum marginal i e values obtained in 1991 were respectively 150 2 mm d 126 8 mm d and 112 9 mm d corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years the minimum values obtained in 2015 were respectively 128 5 mm d 104 4 mm d and 90 14 mm d around 20 mm d lower than the maximum the index values of observations were in support of decreasing trends the observations of p e 400 m m and i e 150 m m d for example were recorded mostly in 1987 and 1991 and gradually decreased from then and remained only one in 2015 generally the decrease of design values of p e and i e implied a mitigation of extreme rainfall in cr1 the krp isolines of cr2 as shown in fig 9 appeared to be sharper than those of cr1 cr3 and cr4 figs 8 11 it can be explained as the p e and i e series of cr2 were well correlated as presented in fig 3 b the krp isolines moved leftward before 1995 and then rightward till 2015 the marginal design p e values corresponding to krp 20 and 10 were maximum in 1983 measured as 527 4 mm and 462 4 mm respectively and those corresponding to krp 50 reached the maximum value equaling 608 8 mm in 2015 actually by 2015 the annual extreme rainfall characterized by p e was seen to reach and surpass the level of 1983 the minima of marginal p e were obtained in 1995 measured as 527 7 mm 448 6 mm and 397 mm respectively with a difference of around 80 mm from the maxima by contrast the values of i e showed a small variation when krp 50 years the marginal i e values of most moving window series fluctuated around 200 mm d with a few exceptions e g the years 1983 1987 and 1995 compared with the design i e values of cr1 and cr3 which were mostly lower than 150 mm d and the design i e values of cr4 which never exceeded 200 mm d those of cr2 were much higher indicating the possibility of more violent storm events producing larger rainfall intensity although extreme observations e g p e 400 m m and i e 150 m m d were recorded more before 1991 and less after 2007 considering that the p e series had a recently increasing tendency and the i e series was almost the largest among the four crs extreme rainfalls in cr2 was severe at present and tended to intensify which is worth considering for engineering construction the krp isolines of cr3 showed a similar pattern of variation as cr2 see fig 10 regarding the year 1995 as a turning point both values of p e and i e showed a decreasing trend first and an increasing trend thereafter meaning an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall concerning both volume and intensity the maxima of marginal p e corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years were obtained in 2015 amounting to 667 2 mm 616 3 mm and 574 6 mm respectively the minima were separately 597 7 mm 558 7 mm and 523 2 mm obtained in 1995 roughly 70 mm lower than the maxima for the i e index however an obvious variation was seen for isolines of krp 50 years maximum 143 mm d in 1983 and minimum 123 3 mm d in 1995 while isolines of the other two levels showed no significant variation nevertheless the volume and intensity of extreme rainfall in 2015 had a tendency to reach or surpass those in 1983 in addition the observations were in accordance with the pattern of variation of design values as there was an obvious reduction of extreme observations before 1995 and an augmentation thereafter as shown in fig 11 cr4 as the most humid region among the four had much more plentiful precipitation and exhibited high volume and intensity of annual extreme rainfall contrary to cr2 the krp isolines of cr4 were the most round which can be explained as the paired series were relatively not strongly correlated fig 3 d horizontally the isolines remained almost stable before the year 1999 and had moved rightward since 2003 the maximum marginal p e values were obtained in 2015 amounting to 804 1 mm 730 6 mm and 669 4 mm corresponding to krp 50 20 and 10 years separately the minima obtained in 1999 were measured as 705 9 mm 643 7 mm and 595 1 mm the difference from the maxima were up to nearly 100 mm which was the highest among the four regions vertically from the perspective of i e the isolines moved downward before 1999 and upward since 2003 the maximum marginal values were reached in 2015 measured as 192 mm d 170 1 mm and 152 4 mm d exceeding those of 1983 the maxima were roughly 30 mm d higher than the minima obtained in 1999 which were measured as 164 1 mm d 142 mm d and 125 2 mm d cr4 as a result had the largest ranging scale of p e and i e among the four regions and also had recently increasing trends of both the volume and intensity consistently the extreme observations i e p e 600 m m and i e 150 m m d has increased significantly since 1999 considering the above analysis cr4 also called for a particular concern to compare the variation patterns of annual extreme rainfall characteristics among the four crs we present in fig 12 the isolines of krp 20 years for all the crs together as expected the volume of extreme rainfall characterized by p e increased as the cr moved from the northern semi humid area to the southern humid area viz from cr1 to cr4 however the rainfall intensity characterized by i e varied irregularly as the cr shifted from fig 12 the i e values of cr2 were even larger than those of cr4 for many moving time windows despite that the annual precipitation of cr4 was much more abundant also the i e values of cr1 exceeded those of cr3 for a long period as can be seen the two semi humid regions cr1 and cr2 in northern china were relatively insufficient concerning the annual precipitation or volume of annual extreme rainfalls but violent extreme rainfalls even more severe than the humid regions can still happen this indicated a quite uneven distribution of precipitation i e a large amount of rainfall concentrated in a very short period which might seriously damage urban facilities and farmlands inferred from the plots cr3 located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river had the most uniformly distributed precipitation also it was noticed that the mismatching of rainfall volume and intensity was particularly significant before 2003 but had improved since 2007 the design i e values of cr4 had increased and exceeded those of cr2 a similar tendency was also observed for cr1 and cr3 still the extremely large design values of rainfall intensity for cr2 and the trend of increasing rainfall intensity for cr4 were noteworthy 4 5 analysis of occurrence risk of annual extreme rainfall on the basis of the non stationary dependence structures and marginal distributions derived the occurrence frequency of annual extreme rainfall with long or short joint return period jrp which indicates a larger or smaller risk of rainstorm can be analyzed to facilitate the computation of extreme rainfall risk for each region an investigation concerning the distribution of extreme rainfall occurrence corresponding to different jrps was conducted based on the observed index series in fig 13 the scatter plots left column present the marginal and joint cumulative distribution function cdf values where each cdf value was calculated using the temporal gev and copula models of the nearest moving widow i e the one covering the latest 30 years as is shown the distribution of the extreme rainfall of different jrps denoted by joint cdf varied as the region shifted the variance of cdf values of the four regions was separately 0 078 0 081 0 063 and 0 071 indicating that cr2 and cr3 had the largest and smallest variations of joint cdf the histogram plots right column present the frequency and probability density curves of the joint cdf values it was observed that the frequency decreased as cdf increased most of the samples concentrated within the range of cdf 0 50 concordantly samples of cr2 were least concentrated which were featured by a relatively mild density curve indicating higher possibility of extreme rainfall with long jrp samples of cr3 were the most concentrated and those of cr4 were also concentrated especially with no record observed exceeding the 0 95 threshold the above analysis means that cr2 is the most risky region while cr3 and cr4 are less risky by comparison however as shown in the scatter plots the case of extreme rainfall with only one character either volume or intensity reaching a high level is observed more frequently in cr3 and cr4 which is noteworthy 4 6 discussion according to the above analysis the design values of both the indexes of all the four regions were time varying except for cr1 with a recently decreasing trend of p e and i e which was comparatively safer all the other three regions exhibited an increasing trend of rainfall volume and or intensity in particular the maximum daily precipitation of cr2 had no significant variation but was yet large enough to form severe storms cr4 had the largest design p e values as well as the largest variation of p e comparison among the four crs highlighted the unevenly distributed precipitation in the northern areas the southern regions cr3 and cr4 were more abundant in annual precipitation and possessed large volumes of extreme rainfall while the northern regions cr1 and cr2 were measured to have larger rainfall intensity in conclusion the variation of extreme rainfall in these coastal regions was remarkable from the perspective of both volume and intensity concerning the approaches employed in this study and the related applications the following is noted merging the compatible data sets based on the copula equality test was effective for enriching the data bases and improving copula modelling the merged series generally restored the dependence structure of the original ones as well as its evolution in this study the pwmk and pettitt tests were employed for the detection of trends and change points in the coefficient series as a primary investigation of the dependence evolution given that there might be complicated factors accounting for time variation of the characteristics of multivariate hydrological series statistical tests that are more powerful and efficient for non stationarity detection e g multivariate trend and change point tests might be developed or applied if one focused on the variation patterns non stationarity in the dependence structure of the p e i e series proved to be non negligible ignoring the dependence evolution of multivariate hydrological series would lead to the lack of knowledge about trends and changes existing in the multivariate distribution patterns and cause over or under estimation of the design values associated with hydrological and hydraulic engineering moreover the two indexes used in this paper characterizing annual extreme rainfall i e p e and i e separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from the long term daily precipitation data available investigation of the two indexes provided a general understanding of the extreme rainfall patterns especially severe multi day storm events threatening urban infrastructures and farmlands actually other indexes characterizing extreme rainfall e g intensity duration and volume of storms that are meaningful are also recommended especially when high resolution precipitation data e g hourly records is available 5 conclusions in this paper we conducted a non stationary frequency analysis concerning the volume and intensity of annual extreme rainfall time dependent copulas and gev models were applied to the moving window series of two indexes derived from daily precipitation data of four coastal regions in eastern china non stationarity tests for trends and change points were performed on the correlation coefficient series to investigate the dependence evolution each pair of data sets corresponding to a coastal region was found to be compatible according to the copula equality test and was merged to enrich the data bases for copula modelling based on frequency analysis the design values of the two indexes were computed and presented by the krp isolines the variation of isolines over the moving time windows revealed an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall after the year 1995 in three of the regions the northern coastal regions are much less in rainfall volume than the southern regions but exhibit higher rainfall intensity indicating an uneven distribution of precipitation analysis of the extreme rainfall occurrence risk based on the observed index series found that cr2 has the largest risk of extreme rainfall corresponding to long jrp this study highlighted the importance of incorporating non stationarity into multivariate frequency analysis based on the investigation of dependence evolution of the characteristic series and applied the concept of copula compatibility to solve data deficiency problem in addition kendall s return period which is conceptually more practical for engineering design was employed to compute the design values of indexes associated with annual extreme rainfall given the increasing attention focused on non stationarity of multivariate dependence in hydrological investigations and the general application of copula modelling in frequency analysis the approaches employed in this study are worth considering for application in many other fields of interest e g storms droughts floods etc future efforts will be devoted to more effective statistical tests for non stationarity and more suitable and flexible models for time dependent

6637,changes in the patterns of regional economic and social development will affect regional agricultural and industrial structures thereby affecting grain cultivation patterns imbalances between the grain supply and demand will trigger interregional grain flow grain is a water intensive product and virtual water embedded in grain products flows between regions which will affect the utilization and distribution of regional water resources this study evaluated the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows by using the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem results show that grain production centers in china are being transferred to the northern regions due to the evolution of economic patterns over the past 30 years driven by the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand the virtual water flow patterns of grain shows a tendency to flow from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces results of structural equation modeling show that there is a significant causal structure between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows the study indicates that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual flow patterns consequently virtual water flows will exert great pressure on water resources in the virtual water export areas and the expansion of the virtual water export will increase the difficulty of regional water resources systems in supporting regional social and economic sustainable development and grain production thus posing a potential challenge to china s water resources and grain security keywords grain production socio economic factors water resources virtual water trade partial least squares structural equation model pls sem 1 introduction as the world s most populous country china s grain security has been the focus of world attention brown and halweil 1998 water is an important natural resources for grain production in china and the irrigated agriculture produced 70 of the total grain in china sun et al 2016 however a growing population and demand for grain coupled with the competition between different water use sectors have increased the pressure on water resources sun et al 2016 the challenge china faces is how to meet the increasing water demand of its rapid urbanization and industrial sectors without impacting agricultural water use brown and halweil 1998 china s economy has made great progress in the past 30 years but china s regional socio economic development and grain security are increasingly constrained by water scarcity changes in the patterns of regional economy and social development will affect the regional agricultural and industrial structures thereby affecting the areas of cultivated land and grain cultivation patterns with the increasing population consumption patterns and associated socio economic factors will affect the water resources system through numerous and complex pathways allan et al 1997 strayer et al 2003 odongo et al 2014 agriculture is a water intensive industry therefore the changes in grain planting distribution will have a significant impact on regional water resources there is a need to understand how socio economic factors drive regional agricultural water consumption from a socio hydrological perspective socio economic developments often change the water balance substantially and are highly relevant to understanding the changes in hydrological responses odongo et al 2014 the nature of the socio hydrological study being interdisciplinary focuses on the complex interactions between human and natural systems land use changes and water resources management efforts have altered the hydrological regime throughout history savenije et al 2014 but the increase in the scale of human interference has led to an intensification in the effects that our interventions have upon the hydrology of landscapes around the world as well as having significant impacts on societal development via co evolution with water liu et al 2015 an example of flows that socio hydrology might address is the so called virtual water trade sivapalan et al 2012 virtual water theory provides an effective tool for analyzing the impact of grain transfer on regional water resources virtual water flows vwfs refers to the hidden flow of water associated with the trade of crops or other commodities virtual water is gaining attention as an important assessment tool in water resources management it not only considers direct water use but also indirect use through the quantification of vwfs chapagain et al 2006 aldaya et al 2010 several researchers have estimated the virtual water flows embedded in the importing or exporting of agricultural products between countries or regions sun et al 2013 konar et al 2011 dang et al 2015 suweis et al 2012 built a network to describe the transfer of virtual water among countries for staple food commodities dalin et al 2014 analyzed the virtual water flow patterns and established the domestic and foreign virtual water trade network zhao et al 2015 quantified physical and virtual water flows that are associated with water stress at the provincial level in china white et al 2015 used a hydro economic model and water scarcity index to evaluate the consumption water footprint and virtual water flows in haihe river basin china zhuo et al 2016 assessed the consumptive water footprint and virtual water trade under different scenarios of the climate harvested crop area technology diet and population the current research on virtual water flow of agricultural products mostly focus on quantifying the virtual water flow of agricultural products and the impacts of virtual water flow on regional water resources sun et al 2016 for instance silva et al 2016 assessed the water footprint related to food consumption and the virtual water flows associated with international trade in the main agricultural commodities in brazil qu et al 2018 evaluated the impacts of local water scarcity risk on the global trade system from 1995 to 2009 meanwhile the driving factors of the virtual water trade have received growing attention from the researchers tamea et al 2014 analyzed the driving factors of the virtual water trade of food products by using a gravity model fracasso 2014 and fracasso et al 2016 investigated the driving factors of the bilateral virtual water trade by using an estimated gravity model then they analyzed the main determinants of the virtual water flows related with international agricultural products trade across the mediterranean basin distefano and kelly 2017 developed a multi regional input output model to estimate future water demand in different countries results showed that most countries will experience declining water availability in the future distefano et al 2018 analyzed the blue virtual water input output network by combining the structural decomposition analysis with network theory distefano and kelly 2017 indicated that the greatest driving factor of future global water scarcity was economic growth meanwhile population growth is another important driver of future water scarcity therefore it is necessary to evaluate the impacts of socio economic factors on the virtual water flows of the water intensive products such as agricultural products the gravity model is one of the most popular and successful frameworks in economics and it is usually used to study and quantify the effects of various determinants of international trade yotov et al 2016 however the relationship between grain virtual water flows and influence factors is more complex and cannot be explained by a single regression model d odorico et al 2012 indicated that using gravity model to express the influence on the virtual water trade due to different population and economic levels could not conform to the strength of virtual water communities that had been observed in the past decades the drivers of the virtual water flows are yet to be precisely identified the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem method has good performance in cause effect analysis in contrast to the common regression method therefore this study attempts to investigate the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows in china by using a structural equation modeling approach this paper first analyzed the interrelationship between the patterns of social and economic development and the pattern of grain production in china s provinces from 1950 to 2014 and discussed the effects of regional socio economic development on grain production then the paper analyzed the grain virtual water flow patterns caused by changes in the regional grain supply and demand and evaluated the impacts of virtual water flows on regional water resources finally this paper evaluated the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows based on structural equation modeling this study serves as a theoretical basis for clarifying the influence of regional economic development patterns on grain production and virtual water flows and provides a reference for grain planting planning and water resources management 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the data required for this study include socio economic indicators agricultural statistics meteorological data and water resources data for 31 provincial level administrative regions from 1997 to 2014 in mainland china the socio economic indicators data mainly include the population regional gross domestic product gdp proportion of the secondary and tertiary industry labor compensation per capita proportion of urban residents and engel s coefficient the proportion of expense on food to the consumption expense agricultural statistics data include the grain sown area grain output and per capita grain output chemical fertilizer use and irrigation water use supplementary figs s1 and s2 grains in this study are raw grains including wheat maize and rice the socio economic data and agricultural data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 1997 2015 chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1997 2015 data before 1997 were referenced from the china compendium of statistics 1949 2004 chinese national bureau of

meteorological data service center cmdc 1997 2015 total water resources and water use data were obtained from the china water resources bulletin 1997 2014 chinese ministry of water resources 1997 2015 according to the irrigation water use data in each province from the china water resources bulletin combined with the planting area and irrigation water demand of each crop the irrigation water use was distributed to each crop 2 2 methods 2 2 1 structural equation model of socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows grain production requires the extraction of water from natural water systems to supply the water consumption during crop growth along with the production process of the crop the physical form of water has been transformed into virtual water embedded in the crop the grain transfer among regions is affected by grain supply and demand namely grain production and consumption the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand which was caused by the differences in regional grain production distribution climate grain sown area production level policy technology population and consumption structure led to the grain transfer among regions the variation of regional socio economic patterns will affect the regional agricultural and industrial structure thereby affecting the grain production distribution and grain supply thus affecting the grain virtual water flows fig 1 the gravity model is intuitive flexible and based on solid theoretical foundations some researchers have used this model to study drivers of virtual water flows and achieved significant results tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 however some socio economic factors are highly correlated multicollinearity is a concern when using the common regression method some important drivers of grain virtual water flows are latent constructs which cannot be directly observed or measured such as urbanization measuring the latent constructs is challenging and estimates of the measurement error must be incorporated into models regression analysis which contains a popular trade gravity model cannot address this issue the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem with simultaneously unifying factor analyses and regressions is especially well suited for causal analysis and path analysis hair et al 2014 the pls sem method is an effective method to analyze the influences of social and economic factors on the regional grain virtual water flow to analyze the virtual water flow this paper not only considered factors such as regional grain production consumption and population but also considered the distance factor a partial least squares structural equation model pls sem is established to evaluate the impacts of regional socio economic factors on grain virtual water flows the paper uses 4 latent variables population gdp urbanization and engel s coefficient represent the socio economic system grain production latent variables represent the agricultural system grain virtual water flows latent variables represent the water system meanwhile this study refers to existing literature to establish measurement items for

grains including wheat maize and rice and the data showed that the imported grains mentioned above merely accounted for less than 2 of the national total grain output multiyear average in china cnbs 2015 domestic grains were transferred among regions and internationally imported grains had little impact on the regional transfer therefore this research did not take the imported grains into consideration 2 2 4 water stress index this paper used the water stress index wsi to reflect the regional water resources scarcity the wsi limits the availability of freshwater for human use and for the environment due to water managers issuing on water use permits hydrologic variations could deviate from the sustainability limits set by the assumed standard 20 which could be prevented by the capability to evaluate proposed hydrologic changes richter et al 2012 wsi can be calculated as follows smakhtin et al 2005 14 wsi w tu w tr w it w t 20 where wsi is the index of water stress w tu is the total volume of agricultural industrial and domestic water use m3 w tr is the total volume of water use from interprovince river m3 w it is the total volume of water use by the interbasin water transfer m3 and w t is the total amount of water resources m3 to evaluate the influence of the virtual water flow on water resources system in the grain export and import regions we have set up two scenarios one with virtual water flow of grains and the other without virtual water flow of grains that is regional grains are completely supplied locally 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of regional economic patterns and population in mainland china this paper selected the gdp gdp per capita population percentage of agricultural output in total gdp and other indicators to reflect the evolution of the socio economic patterns of 31 provinces in mainland china from 1950 to 2014 from temporal evolution characteristics the gdp growth rate of the provinces is slow from the 1950s to 1970s since the 1980s after the reform and opening up the provincial gdp has shown a rapid increasing trend at the same time from the regional development differences the gdp growth in the eastern and southern regions is higher than that in the central and western regions fig 3 from the spatial distribution patterns the gdp in the eastern and southern provinces is obviously higher than that in the western and northeastern regions the gdp per capita data shows that the changing pattern of gdp per capita is similar to that of gdp and gdp per capita also shows a clear upward trend during the study period from the regional differences the gdp per capita in beijing tianjin and the southeast region is higher while the gdp per capita of the northwest and southwest is lower the proportion of agricultural output in the total gdp of most provinces from 1950 to 2014 shows a downward trend supplementary fig s3 from the regional distribution the proportion of the agricultural output value of the gdp in the northwest northeast and southwest areas is larger than that of other regions for example the average proportion of the agricultural output value in the total gdp of heilongjiang province from 2011 to 2014 is 16 while for the same period the proportion of agricultural output value in the total gdp of zhejiang province is 5 the former is more than 3 times that of the latter the analysis of the data about changes in population shows that there are obvious changes in population in different provinces during the study period supplementary fig s4 the population of economically developed southeast coastal areas shows a trend of continuous growth such as guangdong and zhejiang in addition to the natural population growth the increase of migrant workers is the main reason for population growth in the region the population of the northwest southwest and northeast regions has shown a slow growth since the 1990s and some of them display a downward trend it can be seen that china has been going through rapid economic and population growth these years however the growth has benefited its provinces and regions quite unequally fleisher et al 2010 wu et al 2018 there is strong evidence showing that the regional inequality is associated with china s reform especially the liberalization of international trade and investment flows fu 2004 the progress of reform was uneven in terms of geographical transmission the emphasis on fdi foreign direct investment driven labor intensive processing type exports in the coastal regions has attracted relatively mobile and efficient resources from the inland regions but it has offered only limited growth linkages to those regions fu 2004 the decline of agricultural production in gdp and the increase in the share of the rural industry which was much more pronounced in coastal areas than in the interior contributed to differential economic growth that benefitted the eastern regions relative to the west and central regions cai et al 2002 3 2 variation of the grain sown area and grain output the adjustment of the regional economic structure will affect the layout of industry agriculture and other industries and further affect grain planting patterns in china the sowing area of grain in the northeast southwest and northwest provinces shows a clear upward trend during the study period 1950 2014 while the grain sowing area of most provinces in the south and east provinces show a downward trend which has been especially significant since the 1990s fig s5 the regions with declining grain output have also witnessed the rapid development of secondary and tertiary industry in the industrial structure and the rapid growth of gdp based on an analysis of regional social economic development and the spatial distribution of the sowing area of grain crops the sowing area of grain in the regions with rapid economic growth generally shows a downward trend indicating that regional industrial structure adjustment will affect regional grain planting northeast and northwest china which have relatively backward economies have gradually become the central region for china s grain production for example grain production in heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces in northeast china accounted for 23 of the total grain production from 2011 to 2014 while the gdp in the above provinces accounted for less than 9 of the total gdp of china the differences in the regional grain production and population will result in the differences of grain production per capita china s average grain production per capita in the period of 2011 2014 was 438 40 kg the grain production per capita in heilongjiang was the highest at 1537 45 kg and that of beijing was the lowest at 47 35 kg overall the grain production per capita in the southern provinces is lower than the national average while grain production per capita in most parts of northeastern and northwestern provinces is higher than the national average value supplementary fig s6 as a result grain is abundant in the northeast and northwest regions of china while grain is deficient in the south regions of china which consequently results in interregional flows of grain 3 3 variation of interregional grain virtual water flows and its impact on regional water stress since the 1990s with the change in the economic patterns grain production in the southeast and southern china continued to decline despite rapid economic growth therefore the grain supply gap in these areas was increasing and these areas gradually became the main virtual grain water import areas for example in guangdong the average amount of annual virtual water flows was 11 89 gm3 in the 1990s which increased to 35 07 gm3 during the period of 2011 2014 fig 4 to the contrary the areas of heilongjiang jilin liaoning and inner mongolia in northeast and northwest china gradually became major grain producing areas and the main virtual water export areas in china the average annual virtual water export with the grain trade in heilongjiang in the 1990s was 17 88 gm3 which increased to 52 73 gm3 during the period of 2011 2014 at a rate of 195 agriculture is a high water consumption sector and grain production consumes a large amount of water resources interregional virtual water flows change the original distribution pattern of water resources which greatly impacts the water resource system of the virtual water import and export areas the results show that virtual water flows significantly increased the water stress of the grain export areas fig 5 taking the grain export area of heilongjiang as an example in 2010 the amount of virtual blue water resources exported with grain transfer was 18 30 gm3 which accounted for 56 of the total water resources consumption in heilongjiang in the scenario without virtual water export the water stress index of heilongjiang province was 0 80 while in the scenario with virtual water export the water stress index of the province increased by 138 as the main grain export area the local water stress index in the northeast region increased by nearly 100 due to the virtual water export distefano and kelly 2017 indicated that the virtual water trade would contribute to alleviate the adverse effects of water scarcity for wealthy countries but might have little effect on low income countries white et al 2015 stated that it was reasonable to import virtual water from water abundant areas while caution was needed in importing virtual water from the water scarce areas because it would increase water resources stress the present study shows that current grain virtual water flow patterns cause contradictions in that virtual water is transported from water scarce areas to water abundant areas fracasso et al 2016 also indicated that the higher level of water endowments did not necessarily lead to a larger export of virtual water as one would expect in view of china s regional industrial structure and the distribution of cultivated land resources it is difficult to reverse the pattern of virtual water flows completely in a short time in view of the current disparity in matching water and land resources and the reality that the economic gap between the virtual water export areas and import areas is widening it is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and reduce the consumption of water resources during the grain production process agricultural production inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation play an important role in the crop yield which is an important factor in determining crop water productivity sun et al 2017 with the application of water saving irrigation technology the utilization coefficient of irrigation water has been improved in china thereby effectively guaranteeing grain production with a limited water supply on the other hand it is necessary to stabilize the existing southern areas of grain cultivation to prevent the southern grain area from shrinking so as not to bring greater pressure on the northern region subsidizing grain production can improve the enthusiasm of grain farmers and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization to alleviate the influence of virtual water flows on water resources and economies in grain export areas 3 4 structural path analysis of regional grain virtual water flows the causal structure of the proposed research model was tested using sem via smart pls version 3 0 the model has passed the reliability test convergent validity test and discriminant validity test the path coefficient s t values significance and hypothesis testing results for the structural model are tabulated in table s1 all the remaining hypotheses formulated in this research are supported the factor loading estimated parameters variance explained r2 and graphical representation of the research model are given in fig 6 as indicated the model has an appropriate predictive power for all of the dependent variables the explained variances of population urbanization engel s coefficient grain production and grain virtual water flows are 0 510 0 307 0 403 0 505 and 0 466 respectively it can be seen that population gdp urbanization and engel s coefficient have significant direct effects on grain production as hypothesized in the model among them population has a positive effect while the other three have negative effects this means that social and economic development are always accompanied by weakening grain production at the region level furthermore the influence of social and economic development on grain production is complicated due to the effects of different social economic factors having different directions the increasing gdp has negative direct effects on grain production however increasing gdp increases the population therefore gdp has an indirect positive effect on grain production there are complicated relationships among social economic factors in addition grain production has a significant direct effect on grain virtual water flows which supports hypothesis h2 according to theory of circular and accumulative causation myrdal 1957 the economic development process is not spatially produced at the same time and is spread evenly but it starts from some regions that have better conditions once these regions are developing ahead of the rest due to their initial advantage they will continue to accumulate favorable factors by the cumulative causation model then regional imbalance will be further intensified thus resulting in spatial interaction between developed and backward regions therefore there are two opposite effects the first named backwash effects are reflected in the flow of production factors from underdeveloped regions to developed regions and expands the regional economic differences the other is spread effects which are reflected in the flow of production factors from developed regions to underdeveloped regions which narrows the regional economic differences due to the function of the market mechanism the backwash effects are greater than spread effects that is market power tends to expand rather than narrow a regional gap once the gap is formed the developed regions will gain accumulated competitive advantages thus restraining the economic development of underdeveloped regions meanwhile adverse factors for economic development will accumulate continually similar to china s regional economic gap human resources capital and other production factors flow from underdeveloped regions to developed regions thus expanding the regional economic difference the scale of agricultural planting in economically developed regions such as china s south east coastal areas has been continuously compressed thus resulting in intensified grain supply shortfall and an increasing volume of the grain virtual water therefore socio economic factors such as the regional economy and population will have an important impact on the grain virtual water flow those results are basically coincident with previous studies some researchers used decomposition analysis da to explain virtual water flows and found that changes in the volume of trade were main positive drivers lenzen 2009 duarte et al 2016 in most virtual water flows gravity models the gdp and population were included as determinants of virtual water flows tamea et al 2014 fracasso 2014 fracasso et al 2016 based on the extended stirpat model zhao et al 2014 studied the driving force of the water footprint change the results showed that changes in the population size were the largest driving force additionally affluence diet structure and urbanization had also shown significant positive effects compared with those influence factors the structural equation modeling used in this paper can provide more information about the specific influence paths 3 5 effects of regional social economic patterns on the grain virtual water flows regional industrial structure would determine the scale of grain planting thus affecting grain production for example an area with agriculture as the main industry may have grain output that is greater than the area with industry and tertiary industry as the main industry and may cause grain to be transferred from the former area to the latter area the first industry accounted for more than 12 greater than the national average in the main grain virtual water export provinces including heilongjiang jilin hebei henan anhui xinjiang and so on the first industry accounted for less than 5 less than half of the national average in the main grain virtual water inflow provinces mainly including beijing tianjin shanghai guangdong and zhejiang therefore the regional industrial structure would affect agriculture especially the production scale of grain and an imbalance between the supply and demand would lead to virtual water flows among regions the influence of social and economic development on grain production is complicated due to the effects that different social economic factors have on influencing different directions this study applies the mediating effect test that was proposed by sobel et al 1982 the test results are tabulated in table 1 all remaining constructs underwent mediation effect testing it is apparent that a strong indirect causal relationship exists between the social economic factors and the grain virtual water flows the most important driver of future global water resources scarcity is economic development and the increase of water demand caused by economic growth overwhelms the realistic water savings that was achieved by increasing technological level and improvements to water efficiency distefano and kelly 2017 our study indicates that an evaluation of the impacts of socio economic factors on the regional grain virtual water flows is critical to understanding the interactions between regional industrial structure variation and virtual water flows this assessment will provide valuable information forcoordinationbetweeneconomic developmentand water resource sustainability 4 conclusions regional differences in economic and social development in china will affect agricultural and other industrial structures thereby affecting the grain planting patterns and resulting in a regional grain supply imbalance thus triggering interregional grain flows during the study period china s economic center and population gradually transferred to the eastern and southern provinces thus resulting in the decline of the grain production area in regions with rapid economic growth the grain production area showed a downward trend northeast and northwest china with their backward economies have gradually become the main regions of grain production in china driven by the regional grain supply and demand imbalance virtual water flows are more frequent and the quantity is increasing along with regional grain transfer the virtual water flow pattern of grain shows the trend of migration from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces the current virtual water flow patterns cause contradictions in that virtual water is transported from water poor areas to water rich areas and economically backward regions to economically developed regions there is a significant causal structure between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the flow pattern of grain virtual water virtual water flows between regions have changed the original distribution pattern of water resources which has a significant impact on the water resources in the water import and export regions and the virtual water flows increased the pressure of water resources in grain export areas establishing a rational trade structure among different provinces is necessary for mitigating the regional water imbalance therefore policy makers should take an integrated approach to implement economic development and the sustainable use of water resources this paper offers the possibility of understanding the interaction between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows and it will help policy makers coordinate regional economic development and water resource sustainability declaration of interests the authors

6637,changes in the patterns of regional economic and social development will affect regional agricultural and industrial structures thereby affecting grain cultivation patterns imbalances between the grain supply and demand will trigger interregional grain flow grain is a water intensive product and virtual water embedded in grain products flows between regions which will affect the utilization and distribution of regional water resources this study evaluated the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows by using the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem results show that grain production centers in china are being transferred to the northern regions due to the evolution of economic patterns over the past 30 years driven by the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand the virtual water flow patterns of grain shows a tendency to flow from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces results of structural equation modeling show that there is a significant causal structure between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows the study indicates that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual flow patterns consequently virtual water flows will exert great pressure on water resources in the virtual water export areas and the expansion of the virtual water export will increase the difficulty of regional water resources systems in supporting regional social and economic sustainable development and grain production thus posing a potential challenge to china s water resources and grain security keywords grain production socio economic factors water resources virtual water trade partial least squares structural equation model pls sem 1 introduction as the world s most populous country china s grain security has been the focus of world attention brown and halweil 1998 water is an important natural resources for grain production in china and the irrigated agriculture produced 70 of the total grain in china sun et al 2016 however a growing population and demand for grain coupled with the competition between different water use sectors have increased the pressure on water resources sun et al 2016 the challenge china faces is how to meet the increasing water demand of its rapid urbanization and industrial sectors without impacting agricultural water use brown and halweil 1998 china s economy has made great progress in the past 30 years but china s regional socio economic development and grain security are increasingly constrained by water scarcity changes in the patterns of regional economy and social development will affect the regional agricultural and industrial structures thereby affecting the areas of cultivated land and grain cultivation patterns with the increasing population consumption patterns and associated socio economic factors will affect the water resources system through numerous and complex pathways allan et al 1997 strayer et al 2003 odongo et al 2014 agriculture is a water intensive industry therefore the changes in grain planting distribution will have a significant impact on regional water resources there is a need to understand how socio economic factors drive regional agricultural water consumption from a socio hydrological perspective socio economic developments often change the water balance substantially and are highly relevant to understanding the changes in hydrological responses odongo et al 2014 the nature of the socio hydrological study being interdisciplinary focuses on the complex interactions between human and natural systems land use changes and water resources management efforts have altered the hydrological regime throughout history savenije et al 2014 but the increase in the scale of human interference has led to an intensification in the effects that our interventions have upon the hydrology of landscapes around the world as well as having significant impacts on societal development via co evolution with water liu et al 2015 an example of flows that socio hydrology might address is the so called virtual water trade sivapalan et al 2012 virtual water theory provides an effective tool for analyzing the impact of grain transfer on regional water resources virtual water flows vwfs refers to the hidden flow of water associated with the trade of crops or other commodities virtual water is gaining attention as an important assessment tool in water resources management it not only considers direct water use but also indirect use through the quantification of vwfs chapagain et al 2006 aldaya et al 2010 several researchers have estimated the virtual water flows embedded in the importing or exporting of agricultural products between countries or regions sun et al 2013 konar et al 2011 dang et al 2015 suweis et al 2012 built a network to describe the transfer of virtual water among countries for staple food commodities dalin et al 2014 analyzed the virtual water flow patterns and established the domestic and foreign virtual water trade network zhao et al 2015 quantified physical and virtual water flows that are associated with water stress at the provincial level in china white et al 2015 used a hydro economic model and water scarcity index to evaluate the consumption water footprint and virtual water flows in haihe river basin china zhuo et al 2016 assessed the consumptive water footprint and virtual water trade under different scenarios of the climate harvested crop area technology diet and population the current research on virtual water flow of agricultural products mostly focus on quantifying the virtual water flow of agricultural products and the impacts of virtual water flow on regional water resources sun et al 2016 for instance silva et al 2016 assessed the water footprint related to food consumption and the virtual water flows associated with international trade in the main agricultural commodities in brazil qu et al 2018 evaluated the impacts of local water scarcity risk on the global trade system from 1995 to 2009 meanwhile the driving factors of the virtual water trade have received growing attention from the researchers tamea et al 2014 analyzed the driving factors of the virtual water trade of food products by using a gravity model fracasso 2014 and fracasso et al 2016 investigated the driving factors of the bilateral virtual water trade by using an estimated gravity model then they analyzed the main determinants of the virtual water flows related with international agricultural products trade across the mediterranean basin distefano and kelly 2017 developed a multi regional input output model to estimate future water demand in different countries results showed that most countries will experience declining water availability in the future distefano et al 2018 analyzed the blue virtual water input output network by combining the structural decomposition analysis with network theory distefano and kelly 2017 indicated that the greatest driving factor of future global water scarcity was economic growth meanwhile population growth is another important driver of future water scarcity therefore it is necessary to evaluate the impacts of socio economic factors on the virtual water flows of the water intensive products such as agricultural products the gravity model is one of the most popular and successful frameworks in economics and it is usually used to study and quantify the effects of various determinants of international trade yotov et al 2016 however the relationship between grain virtual water flows and influence factors is more complex and cannot be explained by a single regression model d odorico et al 2012 indicated that using gravity model to express the influence on the virtual water trade due to different population and economic levels could not conform to the strength of virtual water communities that had been observed in the past decades the drivers of the virtual water flows are yet to be precisely identified the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem method has good performance in cause effect analysis in contrast to the common regression method therefore this study attempts to investigate the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows in china by using a structural equation modeling approach this paper first analyzed the interrelationship between the patterns of social and economic development and the pattern of grain production in china s provinces from 1950 to 2014 and discussed the effects of regional socio economic development on grain production then the paper analyzed the grain virtual water flow patterns caused by changes in the regional grain supply and demand and evaluated the impacts of virtual water flows on regional water resources finally this paper evaluated the impacts of socio economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows based on structural equation modeling this study serves as a theoretical basis for clarifying the influence of regional economic development patterns on grain production and virtual water flows and provides a reference for grain planting planning and water resources management 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the data required for this study include socio economic indicators agricultural statistics meteorological data and water resources data for 31 provincial level administrative regions from 1997 to 2014 in mainland china the socio economic indicators data mainly include the population regional gross domestic product gdp proportion of the secondary and tertiary industry labor compensation per capita proportion of urban residents and engel s coefficient the proportion of expense on food to the consumption expense agricultural statistics data include the grain sown area grain output and per capita grain output chemical fertilizer use and irrigation water use supplementary figs s1 and s2 grains in this study are raw grains including wheat maize and rice the socio economic data and agricultural data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 1997 2015 chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1997 2015 data before 1997 were referenced from the china compendium of statistics 1949 2004 chinese national bureau of

meteorological data service center cmdc 1997 2015 total water resources and water use data were obtained from the china water resources bulletin 1997 2014 chinese ministry of water resources 1997 2015 according to the irrigation water use data in each province from the china water resources bulletin combined with the planting area and irrigation water demand of each crop the irrigation water use was distributed to each crop 2 2 methods 2 2 1 structural equation model of socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows grain production requires the extraction of water from natural water systems to supply the water consumption during crop growth along with the production process of the crop the physical form of water has been transformed into virtual water embedded in the crop the grain transfer among regions is affected by grain supply and demand namely grain production and consumption the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand which was caused by the differences in regional grain production distribution climate grain sown area production level policy technology population and consumption structure led to the grain transfer among regions the variation of regional socio economic patterns will affect the regional agricultural and industrial structure thereby affecting the grain production distribution and grain supply thus affecting the grain virtual water flows fig 1 the gravity model is intuitive flexible and based on solid theoretical foundations some researchers have used this model to study drivers of virtual water flows and achieved significant results tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 however some socio economic factors are highly correlated multicollinearity is a concern when using the common regression method some important drivers of grain virtual water flows are latent constructs which cannot be directly observed or measured such as urbanization measuring the latent constructs is challenging and estimates of the measurement error must be incorporated into models regression analysis which contains a popular trade gravity model cannot address this issue the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem with simultaneously unifying factor analyses and regressions is especially well suited for causal analysis and path analysis hair et al 2014 the pls sem method is an effective method to analyze the influences of social and economic factors on the regional grain virtual water flow to analyze the virtual water flow this paper not only considered factors such as regional grain production consumption and population but also considered the distance factor a partial least squares structural equation model pls sem is established to evaluate the impacts of regional socio economic factors on grain virtual water flows the paper uses 4 latent variables population gdp urbanization and engel s coefficient represent the socio economic system grain production latent variables represent the agricultural system grain virtual water flows latent variables represent the water system meanwhile this study refers to existing literature to establish measurement items for all of the used constructs rural population and urban population are used to measure the population the gdp of the primary secondary and tertiary industry are used to measure the gdp the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industry labor compensation per capita and the proportion of urban residents are used to measure urbanization family engel s coefficient of rural and urban residents are used to measure engel s coefficient grain sown area grain output and per capita grain output are used to measure grain production virtual water export with the grain trade is used to measure the grain virtual water flows fig 2 this study proposes the following hypothesis theoretical basis for each hypothesis is explained in supporting information h1 1 population has a positive influence on grain production h1 2 gdp has a negative influence on grain production h1 3 urbanization has a negative influence on grain production h1 4 engel s coefficient has a negative influence on grain production h2 grain production has a positive influence on grain virtual water flows h3 1 gdp has a positive influence on population h3 2 gdp has a positive influence on urbanization h3 3 gdp has a negative

grains including wheat maize and rice and the data showed that the imported grains mentioned above merely accounted for less than 2 of the national total grain output multiyear average in china cnbs 2015 domestic grains were transferred among regions and internationally imported grains had little impact on the regional transfer therefore this research did not take the imported grains into consideration 2 2 4 water stress index this paper used the water stress index wsi to reflect the regional water resources scarcity the wsi limits the availability of freshwater for human use and for the environment due to water managers issuing on water use permits hydrologic variations could deviate from the sustainability limits set by the assumed standard 20 which could be prevented by the capability to evaluate proposed hydrologic changes richter et al 2012 wsi can be calculated as follows smakhtin et al 2005 14 wsi w tu w tr w it w t 20 where wsi is the index of water stress w tu is the total volume of agricultural industrial and domestic water use m3 w tr is the total volume of water use from interprovince river m3 w it is the total volume of water use by the interbasin water transfer m3 and w t is the total amount of water resources m3 to evaluate the influence of the virtual water flow on water resources system in the grain export and import regions we have set up two scenarios one with virtual water flow of grains and the other without virtual water flow of grains that is regional grains are completely supplied locally 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of regional economic patterns and population in mainland china this paper selected the gdp gdp per capita population percentage of agricultural output in total gdp and other indicators to reflect the evolution of the socio economic patterns of 31 provinces in mainland china from 1950 to 2014 from temporal evolution characteristics the gdp growth rate of the provinces is slow from the 1950s to 1970s since the 1980s after the reform and opening up the provincial gdp has shown a rapid increasing trend at the same time from the regional development differences the gdp growth in the eastern and southern regions is higher than that in the central and western regions fig 3 from the spatial distribution patterns the gdp in the eastern and southern provinces is obviously higher than that in the western and northeastern regions the gdp per capita data shows that the changing pattern of gdp per capita is similar to that of gdp and gdp per capita also shows a clear upward trend during the study period from the regional differences the gdp per capita in beijing tianjin and the southeast region is higher while the gdp per capita of the northwest and southwest is lower the proportion of agricultural output in the total gdp of most provinces from 1950 to 2014 shows a downward trend supplementary fig s3 from the regional distribution the proportion of the agricultural output value of the gdp in the northwest northeast and southwest areas is larger than that of other regions for example the average proportion of the agricultural output value in the total gdp of heilongjiang province from 2011 to 2014 is 16 while for the same period the proportion of agricultural output value in the total gdp of zhejiang province is 5 the former is more than 3 times that of the latter the analysis of the data about changes in population shows that there are obvious changes in population in different provinces during the study period supplementary fig s4 the population of economically developed southeast coastal areas shows a trend of continuous growth such as guangdong and zhejiang in addition to the natural population growth the increase of migrant workers is the main reason for population growth in the region the population of the northwest southwest and northeast regions has shown a slow growth since the 1990s and some of them display a downward trend it can be seen that china has been going through rapid economic and population growth these years however the growth has benefited its provinces and regions quite unequally fleisher et al 2010 wu et al 2018 there is strong evidence showing that the regional inequality is associated with china s reform especially the liberalization of international trade and investment flows fu 2004 the progress of reform was uneven in terms of geographical transmission the emphasis on fdi foreign direct investment driven labor intensive processing type exports in the coastal regions has attracted relatively mobile and efficient resources from the inland regions but it has offered only limited growth linkages to those regions fu 2004 the decline of agricultural production in gdp and the increase in the share of the rural industry which was much more pronounced in coastal areas than in the interior contributed to differential economic growth that benefitted the eastern regions relative to the west and central regions cai et al 2002 3 2 variation of the grain sown area and grain output the adjustment of the regional economic structure will affect the layout of industry agriculture and other industries and further affect grain planting patterns in china the sowing area of grain in the northeast southwest and northwest provinces shows a clear upward trend during the study period 1950 2014 while the grain sowing area of most provinces in the south and east provinces show a downward trend which has been especially significant since the 1990s fig s5 the regions with declining grain output have also witnessed the rapid development of secondary and tertiary industry in the industrial structure and the rapid growth of gdp based on an analysis of regional social economic development and the spatial distribution of the sowing area of grain crops the sowing area of grain in the regions with rapid economic growth generally shows a downward trend indicating that regional industrial structure adjustment will affect regional grain planting northeast and northwest china which have relatively backward economies have gradually become the central region for china s grain production for example grain production in heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces in northeast china accounted for 23 of the total grain production from 2011 to 2014 while the gdp in the above provinces accounted for less than 9 of the total gdp of china the differences in the regional grain production and population will result in the differences of grain production per capita china s average grain production per capita in the period of 2011 2014 was 438 40 kg the grain production per capita in heilongjiang was the highest at 1537 45 kg and that of beijing was the lowest at 47 35 kg overall the grain production per capita in the southern provinces is lower than the national average while grain production per capita in most parts of northeastern and northwestern provinces is higher than the national average value supplementary fig s6 as a result grain is abundant in the northeast and northwest regions of china while grain is deficient in the south regions of china which consequently results in interregional flows of grain 3 3 variation of interregional grain virtual water flows and its impact on regional water stress since the 1990s with the change in the economic patterns grain production in the southeast and southern china continued to decline despite rapid economic growth therefore the grain supply gap in these areas was increasing and these areas gradually became the main virtual grain water import areas for example in guangdong the average amount of annual virtual water flows was 11 89 gm3 in the 1990s which increased to 35 07 gm3 during the period of 2011 2014 fig 4 to the contrary the areas of heilongjiang jilin liaoning and inner mongolia in northeast and northwest china gradually became major grain producing areas and the main virtual water export areas in china the average annual virtual water export with the grain trade in heilongjiang in the 1990s was 17 88 gm3 which increased to 52 73 gm3 during the period of 2011 2014 at a rate of 195 agriculture is a high water consumption sector and grain production consumes a large amount of water resources interregional virtual water flows change the original distribution pattern of water resources which greatly impacts the water resource system of the virtual water import and export areas the results show that virtual water flows significantly increased the water stress of the grain export areas fig 5 taking the grain export area of heilongjiang as an example in 2010 the amount of virtual blue water resources exported with grain transfer was 18 30 gm3 which accounted for 56 of the total water resources consumption in heilongjiang in the scenario without virtual water export the water stress index of heilongjiang province was 0 80 while in the scenario with virtual water export the water stress index of the province increased by 138 as the main grain export area the local water stress index in the northeast region increased by nearly 100 due to the virtual water export distefano and kelly 2017 indicated that the virtual water trade would contribute to alleviate the adverse effects of water scarcity for wealthy countries but might have little effect on low income countries white et al 2015 stated that it was reasonable to import virtual water from water abundant areas while caution was needed in importing virtual water from the water scarce areas because it would increase water resources stress the present study shows that current grain virtual water flow patterns cause contradictions in that virtual water is transported from water scarce areas to water abundant areas fracasso et al 2016 also indicated that the higher level of water endowments did not necessarily lead to a larger export of virtual water as one would expect in view of china s regional industrial structure and the distribution of cultivated land resources it is difficult to reverse the pattern of virtual water flows completely in a short time in view of the current disparity in matching water and land resources and the reality that the economic gap between the virtual water export areas and import areas is widening it is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and reduce the consumption of water resources during the grain production process agricultural production inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation play an important role in the crop yield which is an important factor in determining crop water productivity sun et al 2017 with the application of water saving irrigation technology the utilization coefficient of irrigation water has been improved in china thereby effectively guaranteeing grain production with a limited water supply on the other hand it is necessary to stabilize the existing southern areas of grain cultivation to prevent the southern grain area from shrinking so as not to bring greater pressure on the northern region subsidizing grain production can improve the enthusiasm of grain farmers and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization to alleviate the influence of virtual water flows on water resources and economies in grain export areas 3 4 structural path analysis of regional grain virtual water flows the causal structure of the proposed research model was tested using sem via smart pls version 3 0 the model has passed the reliability test convergent validity test and discriminant validity test the path coefficient s t values significance and hypothesis testing results for the structural model are tabulated in table s1 all the remaining hypotheses formulated in this research are supported the factor loading estimated parameters variance explained r2 and graphical representation of the research model are given in fig 6 as indicated the model has an appropriate predictive power for all of the dependent variables the explained variances of population urbanization engel s coefficient grain production and grain virtual water flows are 0 510 0 307 0 403 0 505 and 0 466 respectively it can be seen that population gdp urbanization and engel s coefficient have significant direct effects on grain production as hypothesized in the model among them population has a positive effect while the other three have negative effects this means that social and economic development are always accompanied by weakening grain production at the region level furthermore the influence of social and economic development on grain production is complicated due to the effects of different social economic factors having different directions the increasing gdp has negative direct effects on grain production however increasing gdp increases the population therefore gdp has an indirect positive effect on grain production there are complicated relationships among social economic factors in addition grain production has a significant direct effect on grain virtual water flows which supports hypothesis h2 according to theory of circular and accumulative causation myrdal 1957 the economic development process is not spatially produced at the same time and is spread evenly but it starts from some regions that have better conditions once these regions are developing ahead of the rest due to their initial advantage they will continue to accumulate favorable factors by the cumulative causation model then regional imbalance will be further intensified thus resulting in spatial interaction between developed and backward regions therefore there are two opposite effects the first named backwash effects are reflected in the flow of production factors from underdeveloped regions to developed regions and expands the regional economic differences the other is spread effects which are reflected in the flow of production factors from developed regions to underdeveloped regions which narrows the regional economic differences due to the function of the market mechanism the backwash effects are greater than spread effects that is market power tends to expand rather than narrow a regional gap once the gap is formed the developed regions will gain accumulated competitive advantages thus restraining the economic development of underdeveloped regions meanwhile adverse factors for economic development will accumulate continually similar to china s regional economic gap human resources capital and other production factors flow from underdeveloped regions to developed regions thus expanding the regional economic difference the scale of agricultural planting in economically developed regions such as china s south east coastal areas has been continuously compressed thus resulting in intensified grain supply shortfall and an increasing volume of the grain virtual water therefore socio economic factors such as the regional economy and population will have an important impact on the grain virtual water flow those results are basically coincident with previous studies some researchers used decomposition analysis da to explain virtual water flows and found that changes in the volume of trade were main positive drivers lenzen 2009 duarte et al 2016 in most virtual water flows gravity models the gdp and population were included as determinants of virtual water flows tamea et al 2014 fracasso 2014 fracasso et al 2016 based on the extended stirpat model zhao et al 2014 studied the driving force of the water footprint change the results showed that changes in the population size were the largest driving force additionally affluence diet structure and urbanization had also shown significant positive effects compared with those influence factors the structural equation modeling used in this paper can provide more information about the specific influence paths 3 5 effects of regional social economic patterns on the grain virtual water flows regional industrial structure would determine the scale of grain planting thus affecting grain production for example an area with agriculture as the main industry may have grain output that is greater than the area with industry and tertiary industry as the main industry and may cause grain to be transferred from the former area to the latter area the first industry accounted for more than 12 greater than the national average in the main grain virtual water export provinces including heilongjiang jilin hebei henan anhui xinjiang and so on the first industry accounted for less than 5 less than half of the national average in the main grain virtual water inflow provinces mainly including beijing tianjin shanghai guangdong and zhejiang therefore the regional industrial structure would affect agriculture especially the production scale of grain and an imbalance between the supply and demand would lead to virtual water flows among regions the influence of social and economic development on grain production is complicated due to the effects that different social economic factors have on influencing different directions this study applies the mediating effect test that was proposed by sobel et al 1982 the test results are tabulated in table 1 all remaining constructs underwent mediation effect testing it is apparent that a strong indirect causal relationship exists between the social economic factors and the grain virtual water flows the most important driver of future global water resources scarcity is economic development and the increase of water demand caused by economic growth overwhelms the realistic water savings that was achieved by increasing technological level and improvements to water efficiency distefano and kelly 2017 our study indicates that an evaluation of the impacts of socio economic factors on the regional grain virtual water flows is critical to understanding the interactions between regional industrial structure variation and virtual water flows this assessment will provide valuable information forcoordinationbetweeneconomic developmentand water resource sustainability 4 conclusions regional differences in economic and social development in china will affect agricultural and other industrial structures thereby affecting the grain planting patterns and resulting in a regional grain supply imbalance thus triggering interregional grain flows during the study period china s economic center and population gradually transferred to the eastern and southern provinces thus resulting in the decline of the grain production area in regions with rapid economic growth the grain production area showed a downward trend northeast and northwest china with their backward economies have gradually become the main regions of grain production in china driven by the regional grain supply and demand imbalance virtual water flows are more frequent and the quantity is increasing along with regional grain transfer the virtual water flow pattern of grain shows the trend of migration from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces the current virtual water flow patterns cause contradictions in that virtual water is transported from water poor areas to water rich areas and economically backward regions to economically developed regions there is a significant causal structure between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the flow pattern of grain virtual water virtual water flows between regions have changed the original distribution pattern of water resources which has a significant impact on the water resources in the water import and export regions and the virtual water flows increased the pressure of water resources in grain export areas establishing a rational trade structure among different provinces is necessary for mitigating the regional water imbalance therefore policy makers should take an integrated approach to implement economic development and the sustainable use of water resources this paper offers the possibility of understanding the interaction between socio economic factors and grain virtual water flows and it will help policy makers coordinate regional economic development and water resource sustainability declaration of interests the authors

6638,understanding the time that water takes to traverse the vadose zone is important to quantify groundwater recharge rates and to assess the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination tritium mass balance models provide measurement driven estimates of soil water velocities yet uncertainties embedded in these groundwater recharge estimates are rarely investigated here we analyze six 15 m tritium profiles collected from thick unsaturated zones located on china s loess plateau and compare recharge rates obtained from various calculation approaches models used to estimate recharge based on unsaturated zone data include the tritium peak method and the tritium storage method models used to estimate recharge using saturated zone data include the modern groundwater method and a method that assumes groundwater is well mixed in the aquifer the tritium peak method presents reliable recharge however the recharge from the tritium storage method is two times of that from the tritium peak method the well mixed reservoir method overestimates groundwater renewal rates because the implicit assumption that groundwater is well mixed in aquifers is not realistic for potential recharge considerable uncertainties arise from precipitation tritium reconstruction while for actual recharge estimation uncertainties come from the mismatched recharge mechanism between the model assumption and local characteristics selection of appropriate tritium mass balance models is of utmost importance for recharge estimation keywords tritium based recharge model uncertainty analysis precipitation tritium reconstruction modern water percentage potential recharge 1 introduction quantifying recharge is important for understanding groundwater sustainability and pollution vulnerability böhlke and denver 1995 johnston et al 1998 currell et al 2010 pang et al 2013 han et al 2015 alikhani et al 2016 hagedorn et al 2018 tritium 3h levels in subsurface waters are measured widely to develop data driven estimates of groundwater recharge vogel et al 1974 allison and hughes 1978 małoszewski and zuber 1982 gaye and edmunds 1996 la salle et al 2001 chen et al 2006 wang et al 2008 gleeson et al 2016 however tritium based recharge estimates are often highly uncertain cartwright and morgenstern 2012 cartwright et al 2017 li and si 2018 it is therefore important to evaluate uncertainties to improve interpretations of estimated recharge rates tritium based assessments of groundwater recharge can be classified into two broad groups according to the employed subsurface waters scanlon et al 2002 the first group estimates potential recharge deep drainage bypassing the shallow and often root rich portion of the vadose zone using tritium measurements of waters within unsaturated zones i e soil water this first group includes the tritium peak method and tritium storage method table 1 the second group estimates actual recharge or aquifer renewal rates using tritium measurements from saturated zones i e groundwater this second group includes modern groundwater calculations and aquifer renewal rate calculations that assume aquifer systems are well mixed the validity of this assumption is unclear table 1 the two groups focus on partially overlapping hydrological processes the first downward soil water movements the second precipitation s transformation into groundwater via recharge critically each approach requires assumptions and applications of imperfect input data that introduce uncertainties into resulting tritium based h2o flux estimates tritium based approaches estimate recharge by comparing the tritium mass in soil water or groundwater by meteoric tritium inputs via precipitation the uncertainties in the estimated recharge rates thus arise from two aspects model input data and model assumptions scanlon 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 gallart et al 2016 model inputs include the tritium contents in precipitation and in the sampled subsurface water soil water or groundwater in general tritium contents in soil water or groundwater are determined from sampling and subsequent measurements and these uncertainties derive from analytical uncertainties morgenstern and taylor 2009 which can be reduced by enriching samples or using ultra low level liquid scintillation spectrometer for precipitation inputs time series of precipitation tritium dating from the year 1953 are needed so far the international atomic energy agency s iaea s global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations provide the longest records of precipitation tritium however most of these records are discontinuous short in length and cover the globe incompletely at the majority of locations where tritium is used to tracer soil and ground water movements precipitation tritium time series must be reconstructed methods applied to reconstruct precipitation tritium include interpolation watson 1971 celle et al 2001 and reference curve methods weiss and roether 1980 wu 1986 doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 yet reconstructed precipitation tritium time series derived from either approach can differ substantially with interpolation based methods possibly outperforming reference curve methods in some areas zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 model assumptions regarding recharge mechanisms introduce further uncertainty for tritium based models of potential recharge the tritium peak method assumes piston flow and relies on the existence of an identifiable depth at which tritium activities reach a maximum i e peak tritium in the vadose zone while the tritium storage method estimates recharge regardless of the recharge mode as for the models for actual recharge the well mixed aquifer model assumes the complete mixing of old and recently recharged groundwater within the aquifer groundwaters in aquifer systems are not well mixed assuming so is an oversimplification modern water calculations estimate the proportion of a groundwater sample that is less than 50 years old making no assumptions about the degree of mixing in the aquifer to instead focus on groundwater samples themselves a similar approach uses the calendar year 1953 as a threshold distinguishing young from old groundwater and determines the proportion of a groundwater sample derived from precipitation that fell more recently than the year 1953 jasechko 2016 to understand uncertainties related to the application of these tritium based models inter model comparisons and evaluations are necessary but have not been completed yet the reason why a different tritium based models have not been systematically compared may be the lack of reliable ground truth data for each type of calculation that is the existence of both a vadose zone tritium profile and a dataset of tritium levels in underlying groundwaters for the methods based on unsaturated zones complete tritium profiles and precipitation tritium time series data are required however unsaturated zones are relatively thin in many regions fan et al 2013 and published records demonstrating clear tritium peaks at depth remain uncommon to develop clear records of the bomb peak i e spike of high tritium associated with maximum precipitation tritium concentrations 1963 one usually must focus their study area to thick unsaturated zones with slow infiltration rates china s loess plateau meets these criteria the loess is up to 350 m thick infiltration rates are expectedly slow and water tables may be 100 m below the land surface within the loess complete tritium profiles still exist because of the thick unsaturated zone arid climate conditions and concomitant low infiltration rates lin and wei 2006 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 china s loess plateau is thus a suitable site to evaluate and juxtapose tritium reconstruction methods and uncertainties in tritium based water flux estimates in this study we analyze unusually deep soil water tritium content datasets 15 m below surface as well as some groundwater i e well water tritium data in china s loess plateau to test various approaches for groundwater recharge with them we address the following questions i what is the difference in the estimated recharge inferred from different tritium mass balance tmb models i e soil water tritium contents or groundwater tritium contents ii how should we select appropriate tmb models to evaluate groundwater recharge overall the foremost objective of this study is to analyze world class vadose zone tritium profiles from china to evaluate uncertainties in recharge arising from different tmb approaches 2 data and methodology 2 1 dataset development tritium activities of soil water and groundwater samples were measured in china s loess plateau annual volume weighted precipitation tritium contents were extracted from iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations the available precipitation data span the 1980s through the 1990s because precipitation tritium time series spanning the tritium peak in the year 1963 are critical to recharge estimation reconstructing precipitation tritium prior to the 1980s is important several sites from nearby regions with precipitation tritium records for the 1960 1970s were chosen to reconstruct precipitation tritium for years preceding the 1980s pohang korea tokyo japan irkutsk russia hong kong china and ottawa canada table 2 we sampled four 18 m soil profiles by a hollow stem auger from changwu county and qingjian county in shaanxi province during 2014 2015 fig 1 and table 3 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals soil gravimetric water contents were determined by oven drying i e heating soil samples at 105 c for 12 h soil water was extracted using cryogenic extraction method heating soil samples at 95 c for 3 h to evaporate water and freezing the vapor via a liquid nitrogen cold trap as soil tritium contents were at high enough concentrations no electrolytic enrichment was carried out for soil water before tritium measurements each water sample was mixed with a fluorescent solution hisafe 3 at a ratio of 8 12 in a 20 ml container and its tritium content was measured by an ultra low level liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 perkin elmer with a detection limit of 10 5 tritium units tu and precision of 1 tu the sampling and analyzing methods have been described in detail in a previous study zhang et al 2017 we also used data reported by lin and wei 2006 that include two 15 m profiles from pingding in shanxi province and wudan in inner mongolia in 1997 1998 the sampling sites have mean annual precipitation rates ranging from 300 600 mm spanning semiarid to sub humid climates and thus encompassing a range of hydroclimate conditions we collected groundwater tritium contents from our own sampling and literature fig 1 table 3 we sampled groundwater in one well with water level of 100 m below the land surface in changwu county in shaanxi province in 2016 the groundwater was pumped for half an hour before collection to improve the likelihood that the sample represented groundwater stored in the aquifer the pumped well water samples mix waters within the aquifer system especially where the well is perforated across a long interval next the water sample was electrolytically enriched from 500 ml to 8 ml before tritium was measured with an ultra low level scintillation counter in addition we used tritium contents in groundwater measured at wudan and pingding in 1997 1998 lin and wei 2006 and data from longchuan measured in 2015 tan et al 2016 one tritium value for one well water sample at each of wudan pingding and longchuan was collected from literature note longchuan only has groundwater sample but no soil water tritium profile the groundwater samples were collected close to soil sampling sites reducing the potential for impacts arising from spatial variability in recharge rates and precipitation tritium time series precipitation amounts were measured at china meteorology administration meteorology stations and soil water data were measured directly from the soil profiles 2 2 reconstructing precipitation tritium contents several methods are available to reconstruct precipitation tritium time series we applied the trend surface analysis method that assumes precipitation tritium contents are can be estimated by coupling geospatial data and measurements of precipitation tritium this method has been successfully applied in past zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 t t x y a t x b t y c t where ti x y is the t th year tritium content at site x y x and y refer to longitude and latitude ai bi and ci are regression parameter for the t th year the equation was fitted with volume weighted tritium data of pohang tokyo irkutsk and hong kong over the period of 1969 1976 table 2 the fitted parameters in table 4 confirm that precipitation tritium contents are well correlated with the latitudes and longitudes of nearby sites suggesting that the established equation can satisfactorily reconstruct precipitation tritium activities subsequently the regression equation was used to interpolate the annual tritium contents to the study region for the same period of 1969 1976 then linear equations were developed between the interpolated precipitation tritium contents at the target site and those at ottawa for 1969 1976 and used to extrapolate annual precipitation tritium contents to construct tritium time series spanning the ottawa precipitation tritium record 1954 2011 fig 2 a the above procedures were applied to each station in table 3 to further evaluate model reliability we compared modelled precipitation tritium contents against observations from short term precipitation tritium records at sites in the vicinity of china s loess plateau measurements in the 1980s and 1990s for baotou lanzhou xian yinchuan and zhengzhou table 2 overall the reconstructed results are reproduced satisfactory fig 2b increasing our confidence in the reconstructed precipitation tritium time series although the model performance varied across sites previous work suggests that trend surface analyses may be the optimal option for precipitation tritium time series reconstructions zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 2 3 estimating groundwater recharge both unsaturated zone and saturated zone tmb models were evaluated the models for unsaturated zones focus on soil water movement including tritium peak method and tritium storage method allison et al 1994 si and de jong 2007 when applying data from saturated zones tmb models can be used to estimate the percentage of a groundwater sample comprised of modern groundwater i e groundwater less than 50 years old gleeson et al 2016 or groundwater renewal rates equation 3 4 of table 1 la salle et al 2001 some other models are also available for recharge estimates in either unsaturated or saturated zones such as the convection dispersion equation for solute transport and lumped parameter models for groundwater age distribution cartwright et al 2017 however with hydraulic parameters related to soil properties or geology these models may introduce additional uncertainties that are greater than those arising from the reconstruction of precipitation tritium or the assumption of a recharge mechanism s instead the models in table 1 only include the amount or tritium contents of precipitation soil water and groundwater without additional parameters and highlight uncertainties from precipitation tritium reconstruction and recharge mechanism assumptions for unsaturated zones the tritium peak method calculates recharge by dividing the distance from the bottom of active root zones to peak tritium by the elapsed years and by multiplying by volumetric water contents equation 1 in table 1 depths at which soil water tritium reach a peak were determined by fitting gauss equations to the tritium depth profiles the tritium storage method indirectly estimates recharge as the ratio of tritium stored in soil profiles to the total atmospheric tritium inputs equation 2 in table 1 and it may represent both piston and preferential flows that remain within the sampled soil profile the two methods consider recharge rates as a percentage of mean annual precipitation for the saturated zones the modern groundwater calculation estimates the proportion of modern groundwater within a given water sample taken from a certain depth equation 3 in table 1 the estimated value represents actual recharge from all pathways including piston and preferential flows these estimates may also potentially include imperfections in well bore seals that allow for fast movements of surface waters down to well intakes the well mixed reservoir model la salle et al 2001 estimates the proportion of newly recharged water to the aquifer assuming complete mixing in the groundwater aquifer equation 4 in table 1 such thorough groundwater mixing is unlikely in the great majority of aquifer systems for the two models applied to saturated zones the groundwater tritium activity older than 50 years or before the earliest recharge events from bomb water is usually assumed to have a constant input activity of 10 tu la salle et al 2001 gleeson et al 2016 measurements of precipitation tritium during the early 1950s exist and suggest that most non polar precipitation had 10 tu gleeson et al 2016 here we apply 10 tu as an estimate of groundwater tritium activity before 1954 2 4 uncertainty analyses we completed two levels of uncertainty analyses the first level is a presentation of uncertainties associated with each approach used to estimate recharge e g post 1953 water calculation tritium peak method as the two unsaturated zone models employ mean values of soil water or precipitation their uncertainties were estimated by error propagation analyses through a first order perturbation analysis to the equations listed in table 1 li et al 2017 for the saturated zones the two models mainly use accumulated precipitation tritium inputs we applied the methodology reported by jasechko et al 2017 that uses the range of possible precipitation tritium activities for precipitation postdating the year 1953 this approach also assumes that at least some hydrodynamic dispersion occurs in the groundwater system by applying a 5 year running average before calculating maximum and minimum tpost 1953 values effectively smoothing peaks in the precipitation tritium input curves to a minor extent the second level is an inter model comparison to discuss the uncertainties from model inputs and recharge mechanism assumption specifically for the models applied to unsaturated zones the tritium peak method provides a reliable baseline as this approach depends less on a highly accurate precipitation tritium time series relative to the tritium storage method similarly for the saturated zones the post 1953 water percentage presents a baseline to evaluate the other models since it requires minimal assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential recharge in unsaturated zones uncertainties in potential recharge were investigated at four sites with tritium profiles changwu qingjian wudan and pingding fig 3 soil water contents vary vertically because of rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration in shallow layers mostly in active layers root water uptake and soil texture in deep layers and geologic heterogeneity wang et al 2013 for example soil water contents beneath the farmland and apple orchard in changwu fig 3a differ at depths of 5 12 m likely because of greater potential for root water uptake by apple trees at these depths zhang et al 2017 in addition temporal variations in soil water levels at a given depths is almost constant based on continuously monitoring of soil water profiles liu et al 2010 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2015b tritium profiles show clear peaks and generally reach near constant low levels at deeper depths fig 3d f at a point scale soil water movement and groundwater recharge may be approximated as piston flow although preferential flow may contribute to groundwater recharge in the study area these paths may be more likely to occur in topographical depressions with macropores and fissures or holes huang et al 2013 li et al 2017 tan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 as such these results support the occurrence of piston flow and further the applicability of the tritium peak method though the co existence of preferential flow paths cannot be ruled out equation 1 in table 1 regarding the tritium peak method recharge rates in terms of percentage of mean annual precipitation are estimated to be 4 3 1 2 and 3 6 0 9 in changwu 5 9 1 6 and 7 2 2 3 in qingjian 10 3 3 1 and 10 8 3 0 in pingding and wudan table 5 since these estimates are independent of reconstructed precipitation tritium equation 1 in table 1 they can be used as observations to explore the impact factors of recharge and to evaluate the other methods at the same site the recharge rates are similar with small variations under different land use types overall the recharge rate estimates are similar among the study sites possibly because they were all farmlands in 1963 and because more recent land use changes may not have impacted the depths that tritium levels peak small inter site recharge rate variations may be influenced by variable soil water contents arising from the different land use types and hydroclimatic conditions among the sites in contrast the tritium storage method results in recharge rates that are consistently greater than the tritium peak method exceeding the latter by a factor of two at most sites specifically the recharge rates are 7 4 1 2 and 7 3 1 0 in changwu 12 4 1 7 and 15 1 3 3 in qingjian 23 2 3 7 and 12 3 1 8 in pingding and wudan table 5 if one assumes the tritium peak method is a baseline we conclude that the tritium storage method overestimates recharge rates as the tritium storage method estimates recharge through dividing the tritium mass in soil by the atmospheric flux equation 2 in table 1 the overestimated values may be attributed to a larger soil water tritium mass or a smaller atmospheric tritium flux for the tritium storage method the most likely reason for larger soil water tritium mass is the high tritium detection limit since tritium activities below 10 5 tu are approximated as 10 5 tu the lower atmospheric tritium flux is likely to be caused by an underestimation arising from the precipitation tritium reconstruction method to evaluate the impacts on recharge estimates we carried out a sensitivity analysis of recharge rates to changing tritium detection limit from 0 to 10 5 tu or to increase in atmospheric tritium flux by 0 to 70 fig 4 replacing soil water tritium contents smaller than 10 5 tu with values from 0 to 10 5 tu the recharge rates change little for qingjian and increase slightly by 9 for changwu implying that the tritium detection limit has little impact on recharge rate estimates however increasing the atmospheric tritium flux up to 70 can decrease recharge rates by 41 as such the larger infiltration rates from tritium storage method are more likely to arise from underestimates in atmospheric tritium fluxes 3 2 actual renewal within saturated zones the modern groundwater percentage the proportion of groundwater less than 50 years in its age was calculated for four sites using the groundwater tritium in table 3 and reconstructed precipitation tritium contents as inputs of equation 3 in table 1 the modern groundwater percentage is 13 ranging 4 44 56 ranging 11 100 83 ranging 19 100 and 58 ranging 12 100 for samples collected at changwu longchuan pingding and wudan respectively table 6 with the well mixed reservoir model the relationships of groundwater renewal rate and tritium activity can be analyzed according to equation 4 in table 1 for a series of given renewal rates a series of groundwater tritium activities were calculated to develop a renewal rate tritium activity curve fig 5 these curves can be used to identify the renewal rate of different groundwater tritium contents the mean annual renewal rates differ for the three sites 0 23 1 35 and 2 72 for changwu longchuan and wudan table 6 the renewal rate in pingding groundwater sample with 43 4 tu cannot be estimated since the measured groundwater tritium activity exceeds the highest groundwater tritium content in the renewal rate tritium content curve to compare the results from the two methods we convert mean annual renewal rates to modern groundwater percentages through multiplying the mean annual renewal rates by the period from 1954 to the sampling year data are presented in table 6 consequently the indirectly estimated modern water percentages are 14 for changwu 83 for longchuan and 117 for wudan the results are much larger than those from the modern percentage method equation 3 in table 1 although the two methods i e the modern percentage method gleeson et al 2016 and the renewal rate method le gal le salle et al 2001 use the same datasets they present different results because of the assumptions associated with each approach for assumed recharge mechanism the modern percentage method represents all recharge sources since the results are for specific groundwater samples not for the whole aquifer modern water percentages tend to decrease with increasing depth below the water table demonstrating that complete mixing in aquifer systems is unlikely gleeson et al 2016 the well mixed reservoir method largely presents groundwater renewal rates for the whole aquifer based on the assumption of complete mixing la salle et al 2001 as such it is probably most relevant in thin aquifers with shallow water tables as these conditions that increase the likelihood that groundwater tritium levels are consistent throughout the aquifer tritium is measurable in groundwater despite the fact that tritium peaks in soil profiles have not reached water table fig 3 our finding is consistent with the interpretation that preferential flows bypass longer term soil storage without mixing completely with pre existing soil water brooks et al 2010 the multiple modes of recharge thus violate the assumption of well mixed reservoir model indicating assumptions linked to this method are inappropriate as for the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents the two models estimating actual recharge both use decay corrected 3h of groundwater recharged from pre and post bomb water the pre bomb water tritium before decay corrections was assumed to be 10 tu and subsequently the decay corrected tritium value was near zero as such the recharge rates from the two models are dominated by post bomb water as evaluated by the data from unsaturated zones the precipitation tritium contents were likely underestimated as such these approaches overestimate modern groundwater percentages and renewal rates according to equation 3 and 4 in table 1 the incalculable renewal rate in pingding with high groundwater tritium content is probably caused by the groundwater tritium contents renewal rates biased by the underestimated precipitation tritium contents along with potentially inappropriate assumptions embedded in the renewal rate methodology i e the assumption that the aquifer systems is well mixed la salle et al 2001 to further address the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents on recharge rates we carried out a sensitivity analysis through increasing the precipitation tritium input estimates by a factor of 1 1 to 2 i e by 10 100 for each time fig 5 by increasing precipitation tritium contents up to 100 annual mean renewal rates decrease from 0 23 to 0 11 for changwu 1 35 to 0 49 for longchuan from 2 72 to 0 81 in wudan we note that the renewal rate in pingding has values of 2 5 to 1 1 when the precipitation tritium contents increase by 30 to 100 the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents on modern water percentage are similar as those on renewal rates 4 summary although tritium mass balance based recharge estimates are currently questioned for their applicability because of decay of the 1963 tritium peak and dispersion in subsurface water they are not yet obsolete in the northern hemisphere tmb models will remain valuable for mapping the pre bomb groundwater volumes for some regions in future eastoe et al 2012 cartwright et al 2017 for example measured rainfall tritium contents in june 1963 in ottawa 5817 tu will remain above 10 tu through 2075 suggesting potential use of tmb methods for at least another decade s further tmb methods remain applicable to regions with thick unsaturated zones since some soil water tritium profiles can still capture tritium peaks smith et al 1970 edmunds and walton 1978 cook et al 1992 bertolo et al 2006 lin and wei 2006 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 in the southern hemisphere atmospheric tritium inputs from nuclear bomb testing were relatively low and these bomb peaks may have decayed to negligible levels in places however without reliable recharge rates the uncertainties in tmb models cannot be truly tested we used 15 m soil water tritium profiles and groundwater tritium measurements to explore uncertainties in tmb models that are frequently applied to unsaturated or saturated zone datasets for the models applied to unsaturated zones the tritium peak method may present reliable infiltration rates because its accuracy does not depend as strongly on accurately reconstructing precipitation tritium time series however poor characterization of precipitation tritium time series may be problematic for the tritium storage method as underestimated precipitation tritium fluxes can arise even when applying best available precipitation tritium reconstruction data and methods our results highlight the importance of using accurate precipitation tritium contents as model inputs for tmb models however despite the availability of various interpolation methods watson 1971 celle et al 2001 reference curve methods weiss and roether 1980 wu 1986 doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 and isotope enabled general circulation models weiss and roether 1980 koster et al 1989 ba and xu 2010 cauquoin et al 2015 it remains difficult to reconstruct atmospheric tritium time series the well mixed reservoir approach designed to calculate recharge rates from groundwater samples seems to be more uncertain than approaches designed for unsaturated zone tritium profiles the well mixed reservoir approach is subject to uncertainties arising from both the precipitation tritium reconstruction process and from inherent assumptions associated with mixing cartwright et al 2017 underestimates in precipitation tritium inputs serve to increase estimates of modern water percentages and renewal rates further results from these two methods are not comparable because of recharge mechanism assumptions as groundwaters stored within different portions of an aquifer system are not well mixed differences in sampling infrastructure e g deeper versus shallow wells wells with short versus long screens can yield different tritium measurements because of vertical groundwater age stratification and heterogeneous flow e g scott and richard 2015 even in areas with similar recharge mechanisms tmb models present variable results because of differences in the extensiveness of the spatial scales each sampling approach characterizes for example unsaturated zone data provide recharge estimation on point scale while groundwater data collected from many wells at varying depths may provide regional scale information scanlon et al 2002 choosing an appropriate tritium based model is thus important when applying tracer data to estimate critical zone water fluxes allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2002 our results emphasize that model selection for saturated zones should take into account precipitation tritium reconstruction approaches recharge mechanism assumptions and local hydrogeology although precipitation tritium reconstructions and recharge mechanism assumptions both introduce uncertainties comparisons of recharge rate estimates derived from different methods and sensitivity analyses show that precipitation tritium reconstructions and recharge mechanism assumptions each contribute considerable uncertainties it is thus important to improve precipitation tritium reconstruction methods for long term recharge estimations this study explored uncertainties in tritium based recharge estimations however similar problems exist in some other tracers therefore our results may be helpful more broadly to tracer based studies of groundwater recharge declaration of interest statement we declare that we have no conflict of interests acknowledgments we appreciate the data sharing infrastructure of loess plateau for providing precipitation data this study is jointly funded by the national natural science foundation of

6638,understanding the time that water takes to traverse the vadose zone is important to quantify groundwater recharge rates and to assess the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination tritium mass balance models provide measurement driven estimates of soil water velocities yet uncertainties embedded in these groundwater recharge estimates are rarely investigated here we analyze six 15 m tritium profiles collected from thick unsaturated zones located on china s loess plateau and compare recharge rates obtained from various calculation approaches models used to estimate recharge based on unsaturated zone data include the tritium peak method and the tritium storage method models used to estimate recharge using saturated zone data include the modern groundwater method and a method that assumes groundwater is well mixed in the aquifer the tritium peak method presents reliable recharge however the recharge from the tritium storage method is two times of that from the tritium peak method the well mixed reservoir method overestimates groundwater renewal rates because the implicit assumption that groundwater is well mixed in aquifers is not realistic for potential recharge considerable uncertainties arise from precipitation tritium reconstruction while for actual recharge estimation uncertainties come from the mismatched recharge mechanism between the model assumption and local characteristics selection of appropriate tritium mass balance models is of utmost importance for recharge estimation keywords tritium based recharge model uncertainty analysis precipitation tritium reconstruction modern water percentage potential recharge 1 introduction quantifying recharge is important for understanding groundwater sustainability and pollution vulnerability böhlke and denver 1995 johnston et al 1998 currell et al 2010 pang et al 2013 han et al 2015 alikhani et al 2016 hagedorn et al 2018 tritium 3h levels in subsurface waters are measured widely to develop data driven estimates of groundwater recharge vogel et al 1974 allison and hughes 1978 małoszewski and zuber 1982 gaye and edmunds 1996 la salle et al 2001 chen et al 2006 wang et al 2008 gleeson et al 2016 however tritium based recharge estimates are often highly uncertain cartwright and morgenstern 2012 cartwright et al 2017 li and si 2018 it is therefore important to evaluate uncertainties to improve interpretations of estimated recharge rates tritium based assessments of groundwater recharge can be classified into two broad groups according to the employed subsurface waters scanlon et al 2002 the first group estimates potential recharge deep drainage bypassing the shallow and often root rich portion of the vadose zone using tritium measurements of waters within unsaturated zones i e soil water this first group includes the tritium peak method and tritium storage method table 1 the second group estimates actual recharge or aquifer renewal rates using tritium measurements from saturated zones i e groundwater this second group includes modern groundwater calculations and aquifer renewal rate calculations that assume aquifer systems are well mixed the validity of this assumption is unclear table 1 the two groups focus on partially overlapping hydrological processes the first downward soil water movements the second precipitation s transformation into groundwater via recharge critically each approach requires assumptions and applications of imperfect input data that introduce uncertainties into resulting tritium based h2o flux estimates tritium based approaches estimate recharge by comparing the tritium mass in soil water or groundwater by meteoric tritium inputs via precipitation the uncertainties in the estimated recharge rates thus arise from two aspects model input data and model assumptions scanlon 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 gallart et al 2016 model inputs include the tritium contents in precipitation and in the sampled subsurface water soil water or groundwater in general tritium contents in soil water or groundwater are determined from sampling and subsequent measurements and these uncertainties derive from analytical uncertainties morgenstern and taylor 2009 which can be reduced by enriching samples or using ultra low level liquid scintillation spectrometer for precipitation inputs time series of precipitation tritium dating from the year 1953 are needed so far the international atomic energy agency s iaea s global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations provide the longest records of precipitation tritium however most of these records are discontinuous short in length and cover the globe incompletely at the majority of locations where tritium is used to tracer soil and ground water movements precipitation tritium time series must be reconstructed methods applied to reconstruct precipitation tritium include interpolation watson 1971 celle et al 2001 and reference curve methods weiss and roether 1980 wu 1986 doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 yet reconstructed precipitation tritium time series derived from either approach can differ substantially with interpolation based methods possibly outperforming reference curve methods in some areas zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 model assumptions regarding recharge mechanisms introduce further uncertainty for tritium based models of potential recharge the tritium peak method assumes piston flow and relies on the existence of an identifiable depth at which tritium activities reach a maximum i e peak tritium in the vadose zone while the tritium storage method estimates recharge regardless of the recharge mode as for the models for actual recharge the well mixed aquifer model assumes the complete mixing of old and recently recharged groundwater within the aquifer groundwaters in aquifer systems are not well mixed assuming so is an oversimplification modern water calculations estimate the proportion of a groundwater sample that is less than 50 years old making no assumptions about the degree of mixing in the aquifer to instead focus on groundwater samples themselves a similar approach uses the calendar year 1953 as a threshold distinguishing young from old groundwater and determines the proportion of a groundwater sample derived from precipitation that fell more recently than the year 1953 jasechko 2016 to understand uncertainties related to the application of these tritium based models inter model comparisons and evaluations are necessary but have not been completed yet the reason why a different tritium based models have not been systematically compared may be the lack of reliable ground truth data for each type of calculation that is the existence of both a vadose zone tritium profile and a dataset of tritium levels in underlying groundwaters for the methods based on unsaturated zones complete tritium profiles and precipitation tritium time series data are required however unsaturated zones are relatively thin in many regions fan et al 2013 and published records demonstrating clear tritium peaks at depth remain uncommon to develop clear records of the bomb peak i e spike of high tritium associated with maximum precipitation tritium concentrations 1963 one usually must focus their study area to thick unsaturated zones with slow infiltration rates china s loess plateau meets these criteria the loess is up to 350 m thick infiltration rates are expectedly slow and water tables may be 100 m below the land surface within the loess complete tritium profiles still exist because of the thick unsaturated zone arid climate conditions and concomitant low infiltration rates lin and wei 2006 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 china s loess plateau is thus a suitable site to evaluate and juxtapose tritium reconstruction methods and uncertainties in tritium based water flux estimates in this study we analyze unusually deep soil water tritium content datasets 15 m below surface as well as some groundwater i e well water tritium data in china s loess plateau to test various approaches for groundwater recharge with them we address the following questions i what is the difference in the estimated recharge inferred from different tritium mass balance tmb models i e soil water tritium contents or groundwater tritium contents ii how should we select appropriate tmb models to evaluate groundwater recharge overall the foremost objective of this study is to analyze world class vadose zone tritium profiles from china to evaluate uncertainties in recharge arising from different tmb approaches 2 data and methodology 2 1 dataset development tritium activities of soil water and groundwater samples were measured in china s loess plateau annual volume weighted precipitation tritium contents were extracted from iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations the available precipitation data span the 1980s through the 1990s because precipitation tritium time series spanning the tritium peak in the year 1963 are critical to recharge estimation reconstructing precipitation tritium prior to the 1980s is important several sites from nearby regions with precipitation tritium records for the 1960 1970s were chosen to reconstruct precipitation tritium for years preceding the 1980s pohang korea tokyo japan irkutsk russia hong kong china and ottawa canada table 2 we sampled four 18 m soil profiles by a hollow stem auger from changwu county and qingjian county in shaanxi province during 2014 2015 fig 1 and table 3 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals soil gravimetric water contents were determined by oven drying i e heating soil samples at 105 c for 12 h soil water was extracted using cryogenic extraction method heating soil samples at 95 c for 3 h to evaporate water and freezing the vapor via a liquid nitrogen cold trap as soil tritium contents were at high enough concentrations no electrolytic enrichment was carried out for soil water before tritium measurements each water sample was mixed with a fluorescent solution hisafe 3 at a ratio of 8 12 in a 20 ml container and its tritium content was measured by an ultra low level liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 perkin elmer with a detection limit of 10 5 tritium units tu and precision of 1 tu the sampling and analyzing methods have been described in detail in a previous study zhang et al 2017 we also used data reported by lin and wei 2006 that include two 15 m profiles from pingding in shanxi province and wudan in inner mongolia in 1997 1998 the sampling sites have mean annual precipitation rates ranging from 300 600 mm spanning semiarid to sub humid climates and thus encompassing a range of hydroclimate conditions we collected groundwater tritium contents from our own sampling and literature fig 1 table 3 we sampled groundwater in one well with water level of 100 m below the land surface in changwu county in shaanxi province in 2016 the groundwater was pumped for half an hour before collection to improve the likelihood that the sample represented groundwater stored in the aquifer the pumped well water samples mix waters within the aquifer system especially where the well is perforated across a long interval next the water sample was electrolytically enriched from 500 ml to 8 ml before tritium was measured with an ultra low level scintillation counter in addition we used tritium contents in groundwater measured at wudan and pingding in 1997 1998 lin and wei 2006 and data from longchuan measured in 2015 tan et al 2016 one tritium value for one well water sample at each of wudan pingding and longchuan was collected from literature note longchuan only has groundwater sample but no soil water tritium profile the groundwater samples were collected close to soil sampling sites reducing the potential for impacts arising from spatial variability in recharge rates and precipitation tritium time series precipitation amounts were measured at china meteorology administration meteorology stations and soil water data were measured directly from the soil profiles 2 2 reconstructing precipitation tritium contents several methods are available to reconstruct precipitation tritium time series we applied the trend surface analysis method that assumes precipitation tritium contents are can be estimated by coupling geospatial data and measurements of precipitation tritium this method has been successfully applied in past zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 t t x y a t x b t y c t where ti x y is the t th year tritium content at site x y x and y refer to longitude and latitude ai bi and ci are regression parameter for the t th year the equation was fitted with volume weighted tritium data of pohang tokyo irkutsk and hong kong over the period of 1969 1976 table 2 the fitted parameters in table 4 confirm that precipitation tritium contents are well correlated with the latitudes and longitudes of nearby sites suggesting that the established equation can satisfactorily reconstruct precipitation tritium activities subsequently the regression equation was used to interpolate the annual tritium contents to the study region for the same period of 1969 1976 then linear equations were developed between the interpolated precipitation tritium contents at the target site and those at ottawa for 1969 1976 and used to extrapolate annual precipitation tritium contents to construct tritium time series spanning the ottawa precipitation tritium record 1954 2011 fig 2 a the above procedures were applied to each station in table 3 to further evaluate model reliability we compared modelled precipitation tritium contents against observations from short term precipitation tritium records at sites in the vicinity of china s loess plateau measurements in the 1980s and 1990s for baotou lanzhou xian yinchuan and zhengzhou table 2 overall the reconstructed results are reproduced satisfactory fig 2b increasing our confidence in the reconstructed precipitation tritium time series although the model performance varied across sites previous work suggests that trend surface analyses may be the optimal option for precipitation tritium time series reconstructions zhai et al 2013 li and si 2018 2 3 estimating groundwater recharge both unsaturated zone and saturated zone tmb models were evaluated the models for unsaturated zones focus on soil water movement including tritium peak method and tritium storage method allison et al 1994 si and de jong 2007 when applying data from saturated zones tmb models can be used to estimate the percentage of a groundwater sample comprised of modern groundwater i e groundwater less than 50 years old gleeson et al 2016 or groundwater renewal rates equation 3 4 of table 1 la salle et al 2001 some other models are also available for recharge estimates in either unsaturated or saturated zones such as the convection dispersion equation for solute transport and lumped parameter models for groundwater age distribution cartwright et al 2017 however with hydraulic parameters related to soil properties or geology these models may introduce additional uncertainties that are greater than those arising from the reconstruction of precipitation tritium or the assumption of a recharge mechanism s instead the models in table 1 only include the amount or tritium contents of precipitation soil water and groundwater without additional parameters and highlight uncertainties from precipitation tritium reconstruction and recharge mechanism assumptions for unsaturated zones the tritium peak method calculates recharge by dividing the distance from the bottom of active root zones to peak tritium by the elapsed years and by multiplying by volumetric water contents equation 1 in table 1 depths at which soil water tritium reach a peak were determined by fitting gauss equations to the tritium depth profiles the tritium storage method indirectly estimates recharge as the ratio of tritium stored in soil profiles to the total atmospheric tritium inputs equation 2 in table 1 and it may represent both piston and preferential flows that remain within the sampled soil profile the two methods consider recharge rates as a percentage of mean annual precipitation for the saturated zones the modern groundwater calculation estimates the proportion of modern groundwater within a given water sample taken from a certain depth equation 3 in table 1 the estimated value represents actual recharge from all pathways including piston and preferential flows these estimates may also potentially include imperfections in well bore seals that allow for fast movements of surface waters down to well intakes the well mixed reservoir model la salle et al 2001 estimates the proportion of newly recharged water to the aquifer assuming complete mixing in the groundwater aquifer equation 4 in table 1 such thorough groundwater mixing is unlikely in the great majority of aquifer systems for the two models applied to saturated zones the groundwater tritium activity older than 50 years or before the earliest recharge events from bomb water is usually assumed to have a constant input activity of 10 tu la salle et al 2001 gleeson et al 2016 measurements of precipitation tritium during the early 1950s exist and suggest that most non polar precipitation had 10 tu gleeson et al 2016 here we apply 10 tu as an estimate of groundwater tritium activity before 1954 2 4 uncertainty analyses we completed two levels of uncertainty analyses the first level is a presentation of uncertainties associated with each approach used to estimate recharge e g post 1953 water calculation tritium peak method as the two unsaturated zone models employ mean values of soil water or precipitation their uncertainties were estimated by error propagation analyses through a first order perturbation analysis to the equations listed in table 1 li et al 2017 for the saturated zones the two models mainly use accumulated precipitation tritium inputs we applied the methodology reported by jasechko et al 2017 that uses the range of possible precipitation tritium activities for precipitation postdating the year 1953 this approach also assumes that at least some hydrodynamic dispersion occurs in the groundwater system by applying a 5 year running average before calculating maximum and minimum tpost 1953 values effectively smoothing peaks in the precipitation tritium input curves to a minor extent the second level is an inter model comparison to discuss the uncertainties from model inputs and recharge mechanism assumption specifically for the models applied to unsaturated zones the tritium peak method provides a reliable baseline as this approach depends less on a highly accurate precipitation tritium time series relative to the tritium storage method similarly for the saturated zones the post 1953 water percentage presents a baseline to evaluate the other models since it requires minimal assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential recharge in unsaturated zones uncertainties in potential recharge were investigated at four sites with tritium profiles changwu qingjian wudan and pingding fig 3 soil water contents vary vertically because of rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration in shallow layers mostly in active layers root water uptake and soil texture in deep layers and geologic heterogeneity wang et al 2013 for example soil water contents beneath the farmland and apple orchard in changwu fig 3a differ at depths of 5 12 m likely because of greater potential for root water uptake by apple trees at these depths zhang et al 2017 in addition temporal variations in soil water levels at a given depths is almost constant based on continuously monitoring of soil water profiles liu et al 2010 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2015b tritium profiles show clear peaks and generally reach near constant low levels at deeper depths fig 3d f at a point scale soil water movement and groundwater recharge may be approximated as piston flow although preferential flow may contribute to groundwater recharge in the study area these paths may be more likely to occur in topographical depressions with macropores and fissures or holes huang et al 2013 li et al 2017 tan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 as such these results support the occurrence of piston flow and further the applicability of the tritium peak method though the co existence of preferential flow paths cannot be ruled out equation 1 in table 1 regarding the tritium peak method recharge rates in terms of percentage of mean annual precipitation are estimated to be 4 3 1 2 and 3 6 0 9 in changwu 5 9 1 6 and 7 2 2 3 in qingjian 10 3 3 1 and 10 8 3 0 in pingding and wudan table 5 since these estimates are independent of reconstructed precipitation tritium equation 1 in table 1 they can be used as observations to explore the impact factors of recharge and to evaluate the other methods at the same site the recharge rates are similar with small variations under different land use types overall the recharge rate estimates are similar among the study sites possibly because they were all farmlands in 1963 and because more recent land use changes may not have impacted the depths that tritium levels peak small inter site recharge rate variations may be influenced by variable soil water contents arising from the different land use types and hydroclimatic conditions among the sites in contrast the tritium storage method results in recharge rates that are consistently greater than the tritium peak method exceeding the latter by a factor of two at most sites specifically the recharge rates are 7 4 1 2 and 7 3 1 0 in changwu 12 4 1 7 and 15 1 3 3 in qingjian 23 2 3 7 and 12 3 1 8 in pingding and wudan table 5 if one assumes the tritium peak method is a baseline we conclude that the tritium storage method overestimates recharge rates as the tritium storage method estimates recharge through dividing the tritium mass in soil by the atmospheric flux equation 2 in table 1 the overestimated values may be attributed to a larger soil water tritium mass or a smaller atmospheric tritium flux for the tritium storage method the most likely reason for larger soil water tritium mass is the high tritium detection limit since tritium activities below 10 5 tu are approximated as 10 5 tu the lower atmospheric tritium flux is likely to be caused by an underestimation arising from the precipitation tritium reconstruction method to evaluate the impacts on recharge estimates we carried out a sensitivity analysis of recharge rates to changing tritium detection limit from 0 to 10 5 tu or to increase in atmospheric tritium flux by 0 to 70 fig 4 replacing soil water tritium contents smaller than 10 5 tu with values from 0 to 10 5 tu the recharge rates change little for qingjian and increase slightly by 9 for changwu implying that the tritium detection limit has little impact on recharge rate estimates however increasing the atmospheric tritium flux up to 70 can decrease recharge rates by 41 as such the larger infiltration rates from tritium storage method are more likely to arise from underestimates in atmospheric tritium fluxes 3 2 actual renewal within saturated zones the modern groundwater percentage the proportion of groundwater less than 50 years in its age was calculated for four sites using the groundwater tritium in table 3 and reconstructed precipitation tritium contents as inputs of equation 3 in table 1 the modern groundwater percentage is 13 ranging 4 44 56 ranging 11 100 83 ranging 19 100 and 58 ranging 12 100 for samples collected at changwu longchuan pingding and wudan respectively table 6 with the well mixed reservoir model the relationships of groundwater renewal rate and tritium activity can be analyzed according to equation 4 in table 1 for a series of given renewal rates a series of groundwater tritium activities were calculated to develop a renewal rate tritium activity curve fig 5 these curves can be used to identify the renewal rate of different groundwater tritium contents the mean annual renewal rates differ for the three sites 0 23 1 35 and 2 72 for changwu longchuan and wudan table 6 the renewal rate in pingding groundwater sample with 43 4 tu cannot be estimated since the measured groundwater tritium activity exceeds the highest groundwater tritium content in the renewal rate tritium content curve to compare the results from the two methods we convert mean annual renewal rates to modern groundwater percentages through multiplying the mean annual renewal rates by the period from 1954 to the sampling year data are presented in table 6 consequently the indirectly estimated modern water percentages are 14 for changwu 83 for longchuan and 117 for wudan the results are much larger than those from the modern percentage method equation 3 in table 1 although the two methods i e the modern percentage method gleeson et al 2016 and the renewal rate method le gal le salle et al 2001 use the same datasets they present different results because of the assumptions associated with each approach for assumed recharge mechanism the modern percentage method represents all recharge sources since the results are for specific groundwater samples not for the whole aquifer modern water percentages tend to decrease with increasing depth below the water table demonstrating that complete mixing in aquifer systems is unlikely gleeson et al 2016 the well mixed reservoir method largely presents groundwater renewal rates for the whole aquifer based on the assumption of complete mixing la salle et al 2001 as such it is probably most relevant in thin aquifers with shallow water tables as these conditions that increase the likelihood that groundwater tritium levels are consistent throughout the aquifer tritium is measurable in groundwater despite the fact that tritium peaks in soil profiles have not reached water table fig 3 our finding is consistent with the interpretation that preferential flows bypass longer term soil storage without mixing completely with pre existing soil water brooks et al 2010 the multiple modes of recharge thus violate the assumption of well mixed reservoir model indicating assumptions linked to this method are inappropriate as for the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents the two models estimating actual recharge both use decay corrected 3h of groundwater recharged from pre and post bomb water the pre bomb water tritium before decay corrections was assumed to be 10 tu and subsequently the decay corrected tritium value was near zero as such the recharge rates from the two models are dominated by post bomb water as evaluated by the data from unsaturated zones the precipitation tritium contents were likely underestimated as such these approaches overestimate modern groundwater percentages and renewal rates according to equation 3 and 4 in table 1 the incalculable renewal rate in pingding with high groundwater tritium content is probably caused by the groundwater tritium contents renewal rates biased by the underestimated precipitation tritium contents along with potentially inappropriate assumptions embedded in the renewal rate methodology i e the assumption that the aquifer systems is well mixed la salle et al 2001 to further address the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents on recharge rates we carried out a sensitivity analysis through increasing the precipitation tritium input estimates by a factor of 1 1 to 2 i e by 10 100 for each time fig 5 by increasing precipitation tritium contents up to 100 annual mean renewal rates decrease from 0 23 to 0 11 for changwu 1 35 to 0 49 for longchuan from 2 72 to 0 81 in wudan we note that the renewal rate in pingding has values of 2 5 to 1 1 when the precipitation tritium contents increase by 30 to 100 the effects of reconstructed precipitation tritium contents on modern water percentage are similar as those on renewal rates 4 summary although tritium mass balance based recharge estimates are currently questioned for their applicability because of decay of the 1963 tritium peak and dispersion in subsurface water they are not yet obsolete in the northern hemisphere tmb models will remain valuable for mapping the pre bomb groundwater volumes for some regions in future eastoe et al 2012 cartwright et al 2017 for example measured rainfall tritium contents in june 1963 in ottawa 5817 tu will remain above 10 tu through 2075 suggesting potential use of tmb methods for at least another decade s further tmb methods remain applicable to regions with thick unsaturated zones since some soil water tritium profiles can still capture tritium peaks smith et al 1970 edmunds and walton 1978 cook et al 1992 bertolo et al 2006 lin and wei 2006 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 in the southern hemisphere atmospheric tritium inputs from nuclear bomb testing were relatively low and these bomb peaks may have decayed to negligible levels in places however without reliable recharge rates the uncertainties in tmb models cannot be truly tested we used 15 m soil water tritium profiles and groundwater tritium measurements to explore uncertainties in tmb models that are frequently applied to unsaturated or saturated zone datasets for the models applied to unsaturated zones the tritium peak method may present reliable infiltration rates because its accuracy does not depend as strongly on accurately reconstructing precipitation tritium time series however poor characterization of precipitation tritium time series may be problematic for the tritium storage method as underestimated precipitation tritium fluxes can arise even when applying best available precipitation tritium reconstruction data and methods our results highlight the importance of using accurate precipitation tritium contents as model inputs for tmb models however despite the availability of various interpolation methods watson 1971 celle et al 2001 reference curve methods weiss and roether 1980 wu 1986 doney et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 and isotope enabled general circulation models weiss and roether 1980 koster et al 1989 ba and xu 2010 cauquoin et al 2015 it remains difficult to reconstruct atmospheric tritium time series the well mixed reservoir approach designed to calculate recharge rates from groundwater samples seems to be more uncertain than approaches designed for unsaturated zone tritium profiles the well mixed reservoir approach is subject to uncertainties arising from both the precipitation tritium reconstruction process and from inherent assumptions associated with mixing cartwright et al 2017 underestimates in precipitation tritium inputs serve to increase estimates of modern water percentages and renewal rates further results from these two methods are not comparable because of recharge mechanism assumptions as groundwaters stored within different portions of an aquifer system are not well mixed differences in sampling infrastructure e g deeper versus shallow wells wells with short versus long screens can yield different tritium measurements because of vertical groundwater age stratification and heterogeneous flow e g scott and richard 2015 even in areas with similar recharge mechanisms tmb models present variable results because of differences in the extensiveness of the spatial scales each sampling approach characterizes for example unsaturated zone data provide recharge estimation on point scale while groundwater data collected from many wells at varying depths may provide regional scale information scanlon et al 2002 choosing an appropriate tritium based model is thus important when applying tracer data to estimate critical zone water fluxes allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2002 our results emphasize that model selection for saturated zones should take into account precipitation tritium reconstruction approaches recharge mechanism assumptions and local hydrogeology although precipitation tritium reconstructions and recharge mechanism assumptions both introduce uncertainties comparisons of recharge rate estimates derived from different methods and sensitivity analyses show that precipitation tritium reconstructions and recharge mechanism assumptions each contribute considerable uncertainties it is thus important to improve precipitation tritium reconstruction methods for long term recharge estimations this study explored uncertainties in tritium based recharge estimations however similar problems exist in some other tracers therefore our results may be helpful more broadly to tracer based studies of groundwater recharge declaration of interest statement we declare that we have no conflict of

6639,in this study we use polynomial chaos expansion pce to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion swi in fractured coastal aquifers fcas which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network dfn and variable density flow vdf models the dfn vdf model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures in real field applications these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model thus we perform global sensitivity analysis gsa to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs as our conceptual model we consider fractured configurations of the henry problem which is widely used to understand swi processes a finite element dfn vdf model is developed in the framework of comsol multiphysics we examine the uncertainty of several swi metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics pce is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden a new sparse pce technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost the sobol indices sis are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties the proposed gsa methodology based on pce and sis is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy it shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution the imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer marginal effects based on the pce are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on swi the findings provide a technical support for monitoring controlling and preventing swi in fcas keywords seawater intrusion fractured coastal aquifers uncertainty analysis uncertain fracture characteristics global sensitivity analysis sobol indices 1 introduction coastal aquifers cas are currently in a critical situation throughout the world these aquifers are essential sources of freshwater for more than 40 of the world s population living in coastal areas ioc unesco imo fao undp 2011 barragán and de andrés 2015 the phenomenon of seawater intrusion swi which encompasses the advancement of saline water into fresh groundwater mainly caused by excessive groundwater extraction is the first source of contamination in cas werner et al 2013 the european environment agency www eea europa eu declared swi as a major threat for many cas worldwide this phenomenon is exacerbated by the increasing demand for groundwater as a result of the increase in population and anthropogenic activity it is also amplified due to natural causes such as climate change tsunami events and sea level rise expected in the next century e g ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 the impacts of local heterogeneities of cas on the extent of swi at the scale relevant for management scenarios is well documented in the literature e g simmons et al 2001 kerrou and renard 2010 lu et al 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2014 pool et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2015 shi et al 2018 fractured geology is the most challenging form of natural heterogeneity fractures represent the preferential pathways that may enable faster swi or intensify freshwater discharge to the sea bear et al 1999 fractured coastal aquifers fcas are found globally several examples can be found in france arfib and charlier 2016 usa xu et al 2018 greece dokou and karatzas 2012 italy fidelibus et al 2011 ireland perriquet et al 2014 comte et al 2018 uk macallister et al 2018 and in the mediterranean zone where more than 25 of cas are typically karstic bakalowicz et al 2008 chen et al 2017 despite the fact that fcas are distributed throughout the world and they often contain significant groundwater resources due to their high porosity swi in these aquifers is rarely investigated and related processes are still largely unexplored and poorly understood dokou and karatzas 2012 sebben et al 2015 in the review paper of werner et al 2013 the authors suggested swi in fcas as one of the potential remaining challenging problems swi can be tackled using either the sharp interface approximation or variable density flow vdf model werner et al 2013 llopis albert et al 2016 szymkiewicz et al 2018 vdf model involves flow and mass transfer equations coupled by a mixture state equation expressing the density in terms of salt concentration this model is usually used in field applications as it is more realistic than the sharp interface approximation and has the privilege of considering the transition zone between the freshwater and saltwater known as the mixing zone flow in fractured porous media can be described using three alternative approaches i equivalent porous medium in which averaged estimations of the hydrogeological properties over a representative elementary volume are used to represent the domain dietrich et al 2005 ii dual porosity models where the domain is considered as the superposition of two continuums representing respectively rocks and fractures fahs et al 2014 jerbi et al 2017 and iii discrete fracture model in which the fractures and matrix are handled explicitly berre et al 2018 discrete fracture model is the most accurate model because fractures are considered without any simplification it is usually used for domains with a relatively small number of fractures hirthe and graf 2015 ramasomanana et al 2018 and has come into practical use in recent years however discrete fracture models require enormous computational time and memory due to the dense meshes resulting from the explicit discretization of the fractures discrete fracture network dfn in which the fractures are embedded in d 1 dimensional elements in d dimensional physical domain is an alternative approximation that reduces the overhead computations of the discrete fracture model dfn model has been successfully coupled with vdf model to simulate swi in fcas for instance grillo et al 2010 based on a single fracture configuration of henry problem showed that dfn vdf model is a valid alternative to the discrete fracture model for simulating swi dokou and karatzas 2012 developed a hybrid model based on the combination of the dfn model for main fractures and faults and the equivalent porous media model for lower order fractures to investigate swi in a fca in greece by confronting numerical simulations to chloride concentration observations they showed that the dfn model is necessary to accurately simulate swi sebben et al 2015 used the dfn vdf model to present a preliminary deterministic study on the effect of fractured heterogeneity on swi using different fractured configurations of henry problem mozafari et al 2018 developed a dfn vdf model in the finite element frame work of comsol multiphysics nevertheless the dfn vdf model requires the basic characteristics of fractures as location aperture permeability porosity etc these characteristics are subject to a large amount of uncertainties as they are often determined using model calibration procedure based on relatively insufficient historical data provided by several measurement techniques as surface electrical resistivity tomography beaujean et al 2014 borehole concentrations and head measurements multiperiod oscillatory hydraulic tests sayler et al 2018 self potential measurements macallister et al 2018 among others these uncertainties would reduce the predictive capability of the dfn vdf model and impair the reliability of swi management based on these predictions thus it is important to understand how these uncertainties could propagate in the model and lead to uncertainty in outputs this work goes a step further in the understanding of swi processes in fcas it aims to provide a preliminary investigation on the impacts of uncertainty associated to fractures characteristics on the extent of the steady state saltwater wedge simulated using the dfn vfd model in particular we investigate the effects of uncertainties on fracture network characteristics location aperture density permeability and dispersivity on several swi metrics as the length of the saltwater toe thickness of the mixing zone area of the salted zone and salinity flux penetrating to the aquifer as the underpinning conceptual model we consider the fractured henry problem suggested in sebben et al 2015 a finite element dfn vdf numerical model is implemented using comsol multiphysics software we include the boussinesq approximation in the comsol model to reduce nonlinearity and improve computational efficiency in order to quantify the variability in model outputs resulting from the uncertain parameters we use the global sensitivity analysis gsa gsa is more appropriate than local sensitivity analysis as it provides a robust and practical framework to explore the entire inputs space and to assess the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainty saltelli 2002 sudret 2008 de rocquigny 2012 gsa is a powerful approach to fully understand the complex physical processes and assess the applicability of models it is also important for risk assessment and decision making in hydrogeological applications gsa has been used to investigate saturated unsaturated flow younes et al 2013 2018 dai et al 2017 meng and li 2017 maina and guadagnini 2018 miller et al 2018 solute transport fajraoui et al 2011 2012 ciriello et al 2013 younes et al 2016 geological co2 sequestration jia et al 2016 natural convection fajraoui et al 2017 and double diffusive convection shao et al 2017 in swi gsa has been applied to study the effects of hydrodynamics parameters in homogeneous cas herckenrath et al 2011 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 rajabi et al 2015 riva et al 2015 dell oca et al 2017 rajabi et al 2015 have shown that gsa is the best suited method for uncertainty analysis of swi recently xu et al 2018 used gsa to investigate swi in a karstic ca with conduit networks to the best of our knowledge gsa has never been applied to swi in heterogeneous and or fcas different alternatives can be used to perform gsa iooss and lemaître 2015 among these alternatives in this paper we use the variance based technique with the sobol indices sis as sensitivity metrics sobol 2001 these indices are widely used because they do not assume any simplification regarding the physical model and provide the sensitivity of individual contribution from each parameter uncertainty as well as the mixed contributions sarkar and witteveen 2016 sis are usually evaluated through monte carlo methods which require a large number of simulations to cover the parameters space and as a consequence might be impractical in high cpu consuming problems as is the case for swi in fcas sudret 2008 herckenrath et al 2011 to meet the numerical challenges of monte carlo methods we use the polynomial chaos expansions pce which proceeds by expressing each model output as a linear combination of orthogonal multivariate polynomials for a specified probability measure crestaux et al 2009 konakli and sudret 2016 fajraoui et al 2017 in particular we implement the sparse pce technique developed by shao et al 2017 to allow high polynomial orders i e high accuracy with an optimized number of deterministic samples with this technique the number of terms in the pce decomposition is reduced by excluding insignificant terms the polynomial order is updated progressively until reaching a prescribed accuracy during the procedure kashyap information criterion is used to measure the relevance of pce terms shao et al 2017 the sparsity of the pce allows accurate surrogate model even if the optimal number of samples necessary for a total order expansion is not achieved once the pce is constructed for each model output the sis can be directly calculated with no extra computational cost by a post processing treatment of the pce coefficients the paper is organized as follows section 2 is for material and methods in which we present two fractured scenarios of the henry problem investigated in this study the dfn vdf model developed with comsol and the swi metrics used as model outputs section 3 is devoted to the gsa method in section 4 we validate the developed comsol model and the boussinesq approximation by comparison against exact solutions and an in house research code section 5 discusses the gsa results it includes pce construction validation of pce and uncertainties propagation a conclusion is given in section 6 2 material and methods 2 1 conceptual model fractured henry problem the conceptual model is based on the fractured henry problem suggested by sebben et al 2015 a detailed review of the henry problem and its applications can be found in fahs et al 2018 this problem deals with swi in a confined ca of depth h and length ℓ sea boundary condition constant concentration and depth dependent pressure head is imposed at the left side and constant freshwater flux q d l 2 t 1 with zero concentration is assumed at the right side two fracture configurations are investigated in our analysis the first configuration deals with a single horizontal fracture shf extending on the whole domain and located at a distance d f from the aquifer top surface fig 1 a this configuration is specifically considered to investigate the effect of uncertainty related to fracture location on the extent of saltwater wedge in the second configuration we assume a network of orthogonal fractures nof fig 1b as in sebben et al 2015 square sugar cube model with elementary size δ f distance between 2 consecutive fractures is considered as fracture network this configuration is considered since it allows for performing uncertainty analysis of the swi metrics with respect to the fracture density furthermore vertical fractures are important to investigate buoyancy effects 2 2 dfn vdf mathematical model under steady state conditions and based on boussinesq approximation the vdf model in the porous matrix is given by guevara morel et al 2015 1 q 0 2 q k m h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z 3 q c ε m d m i d c 0 4 d α l m α t m q q q α t m q i 5 ρ ρ 0 δ ρ c where q is the darcy s velocity l t 1 ρ 0 the freshwater density m l 3 g the gravitational acceleration l t 2 k m is the freshwater hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix l t 1 h the equivalent freshwater head l ρ m l 3 the density of mixture fluid and z is the elevation l c is the relative solute concentration d m the molecular diffusion coefficient l 2 t 1 ε m is the porosity of the porous matrix i the identity matrix and d is the dispersion tensor α l m l and α t m l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient of the porous matrix respectively with the dfn approach the mathematical model for fractures can be obtained by assuming 1d flow and mass transport equations along the fractures direction the resulting equations are similar to the ones in the porous matrix but with ε f k f and α l f as porosity hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity in the fractures respectively transverse dispersivity in the fracture α t f is neglected as in sebben et al 2015 the 1d flow and mass transport equations in fracture involve the thickness of the fracture e f as parameter 2 3 dfn vdf finite element model comsol multiphysics the dfn vdf simulations are performed using a finite element model developed with comsol multiphysics software package comsol is a comprehensive simulation software environment for various applications the use of comsol in applications related to hydrogeology is increasingly frequent as this software is a user friendly tool that facilitates all the modeling steps preprocessing meshing solving and post processing and allows an easy coupling of different physical processes ren et al 2017 fischer et al 2018 our comsol model is created by coupling the subsurface flow and transport of diluted species modules and by assuming concentration dependent fluid density the subsurface flow module is an extension of comsol modeling environment to applications related to fluid flow in saturated and variably saturated porous media in this module we use the darcy s flow interface the fractures are included via the dfn model by adding the fracture flow feature to the darcy s law interface the transport of diluted species module is used to solve the advection dispersion equation the boussinesq approximation is implemented by considering constant density in the fluid properties and setting a buoyancy volume force depending on the salt concentration the numerical scheme suggested by default in comsol is used to solve the system of equations the flow and transport models are solved sequentially via the segregated solver accurate solutions of the flow model can be obtained using finite volume or finite difference methods deng and wang 2017 however in comsol quadratic basis finite element functions are used for the discretization of the pressure in the flow model while the concentration in the transport model is discretized using the linear basis functions the consistent stabilization technique is used to avoid unphysical oscillations related to the discretization of the advection term this technique is often called upwinding it adds diffusion in the streamline direction triangular meshes suggested by the comsol meshing tool are used in the simulations with the dfn model the comsol meshing tool generates 2d triangular cells to represent the matrix and 1d cells to represent the fractures the fracture cells are positioned along the sides of the matrix triangular cells with the finite element modeling framework the common degrees of freedom at the triangle nodes in the matrix and at the 1d segments in the fractures are used to model the volumetric and mass fluxes between the matrix and the fractures first runs have shown that with the steady state mode comsol is bound to run into convergence difficulties to avoid this problem we used the transient mode this problem is related to the initial guesses required for the nonlinear solver that are often hard to obtain hence the steady state solutions are obtained by letting the system evolve under transient conditions until steady state 2 4 metrics design the main purpose of this study is to perform gsa in regards to certain metrics characterizing the steady state salt wedge and saltwater flux associated with swi the model inputs will be discussed later in the results section since they are dependent on the fracture configuration as model outputs we consider the following swi metrics the spatial distribution of the salt concentration it is obtained in a pattern of a 100 50 regular 2d square grid 5000 nodes length of the saltwater toe l toe the distance from sea boundary to the 0 5 isochlor on the bottom surface of the aquifer fig 2 thickness of the saltwater wedge l s the distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors on the aquifer bottom surface fig 2 average horizontal width of the mixing zone w mz the average horizontal distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors from the bottom to the top of the aquifer fig 2 the height of the inflection point z i the freshwater seawater inflection point located on the seaward boundary fig 2 below this point the seawater flows toward the land and above it the freshwater is discharged to the sea the dimensionless mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s 1 ℓ h 0 ℓ 0 h c d x d z the double integral is calculated with the grid used for the spatial distribution of salt concentration only nodes with concentration above 0 01 are considered total dimensionless flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total defined as the flux of saltwater entering the domain by advection diffusion and dispersion normalized by the freshwater flux imposed at the inland boundary q d 3 global sensitivity analysis gsa is a useful and a widespread tool that aims to quantify and evaluate the output uncertainties resulting from the uncertainties in the model inputs which could be considered singly for one parameter or coupled together several parameters in this study the variability of the model responses is quantified throughout a variance based technique using sis as sensitivity metrics on the one hand variance based sensitivity measures are of interest as they typically specify the relationship between model outputs and input parameters and on the other hand the major advantage of using sis is that they do not require any assumptions of monotonicity or linearity in the physical model the main stages of this technique are developed here more details can be found in sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2017 and le gratiet et al 2017 let us consider a mathematical model y m x delivering the outputs of a physical system that presumably depends on m uncertain input parameters x x 1 x 2 x m for further developments f xi x i and f x i 1 m f xi x i refer to their marginal probability density function pdf and the corresponding joint pdf of a given set 3 1 sobol indices the sobol decomposition of m x reads sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2017 6 m x m 0 i 1 m m i x i 1 i j m m ij x i x j m 1 2 m x 1 x m where m 0 is the expected value of m x and the integral of each summand m i 1 i 2 i s x i 1 x i 2 x i s over any of its independent variables is zero that is 7 γ x ik m i 1 i 2 i s x i 1 x i 2 x i s f x i k x i k 0 1 k s where f x i k x i k and γ x i k represent the marginal pdf and support of x i k respectively the orthogonality m i leads a unique sobol decomposition 8 e m u x u m v x v 0 where e is the mathematical expectation operator u i 1 i 2 i m 1 2 m represents the index sets and x u are the subvectors involving the components for which the indices belong to u as a result of uniqueness and orthogonality of y its total variance d is decomposed as below 9 d v a r m x u 0 d u u 0 var m u x u where d u is the partial variance expressed as below 10 d u v a r m u x u e m u 2 x u consequently the sis are naturally defined as 11 s u d u d the influence on y of each parameter considered singly is given by the first order sobol indices si defined by 12 s i d i d the total si that includes the effect of an input parameter with the contribution from other parameters is defined as follows homma and saltelli 1996 13 s i t ϑ i d u d ϑ i u i the sis can be calculated by performing monte carlo simulations this can be done using the estimates of the mean value total and partial variance of a large number of samples as explained in sudret 2008 the drawback of monte carlo simulations lies in the computational cost especially when time consuming models are investigated to circumvent this problem sudret 2008 introduced the pce for the computation of sis 3 2 polynomials chaos expansion pce each model output is expanded into a set of orthonormal multivariate polynomials of maximum degree m 14 y m x α a y α φ α x where a is a multi index α α 1 α 2 α m and y α α a are the polynomial coefficients φ α x are the base functions of vector space of polynomial functions these functions should be orthogonal in the vector space with the joint pdf f x of x as a dot product the polynomial coefficients y α are evaluated using the regression method least square technique that proceeds by minimizing an objective function representing the difference between the meta model and physical model see fajraoui et al 2017 based on the pce the mean value μ and total variance d of any model output can be calculated as follows 15 μ y 0 16 d α a 0 y α 2 then the sis of any order can be computed using the coefficients d and μ in a straightforward manner as followed 17 s i α a i 0 y α 2 d a i α a α i 0 α j i 0 and 18 s i t α a i t 0 y α 2 d a i t α a α i 0 as suggested by deman et al 2016 we also evaluate the marginal effect me to understand the relation between the important variables and the model outputs me is given by 19 e m x x i x i m 0 α a i y α φ α x i 3 3 sparse polynomial chaos expansion to minimize the number of physical model evaluations and therefore reduce the computational cost the estimation of the sobol indices could be done with a sparse pce instead of a full pce approach in other words instead of using the expression eq 14 we can only use some relevant coefficients of the pce the key idea consists in discarding the irrelevant terms in the estimated truncated pce and for this purpose several approaches have been developed blatman and sudret 2011 utilized an iterative forward backward approach based on nonintrusive regression or a truncation strategy based on hyperbolic index sets coupled with an adaptive algorithm involving a least angle regression lar meng and li 2017 modified the lar algorithm with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso lar an adaptive procedure using projections on a minimized number of bivariate basis functions has been provided by hu and youn 2011 whereas fajraoui et al 2012 worked with a fixed experimental design and retained only significant coefficients that could contribute to the model variance the approach developed in shao et al 2017 which has been implemented in this work consists in progressively increasing the degree of an initial pce until a satisfactory representation of the model responses is obtained the computation of the kashyap information criterion kic based on a bayesian model averaging is used to determine the best sparse pce for a input output sample evaluating kic is an efficient from a computational point of view and feasible alternative to directly computing the bayesian model evidence being known that this later evaluates the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model s parameter space hence it is a key term to obtain the posterior probability in the bayesian framework for more details on the bayesian sparse pce for constructing the algorithm and computing the kic readers can refer to shao et al 2017 4 validations comsol model and boussinesq approximation although comsol has great potential for modelling density driven flow problems it has rarely been used for swi thus the main purpose of this section is to validate our developed comsol model in addition as explained previously boussinesq approximation was implemented in our comsol model to improve its computational efficiency this is a popular approximation for the vdf model as it allows for reducing the computational costs and renders convergence more likely to be achieved it assumes that variations in density only give rise to buoyancy forces and have no impact on the flow field boussinesq approximation ignores density concentration dependence except in the buoyancy term this approximation is common for swi in non fractured cas guevara morel et al 2015 its validity for swi in fcas is not discussed in the literature thus another goal of this section is to investigate the validity of this approximation for such a case for this purpose we first use the new semi analytical solutions of the henry problem homogeneous aquifer developed by fahs et al 2016 we compare these solutions against two comsol models i swi comsol model based on the standard comsol approach and ii swi comsol bq based on the boussinesq approximation we investigate two test cases presented in fahs et al 2016 which deal with constant and velocity dependent dispersion tensor respectively the corresponding physical parameters are summarized in table 1 it is noteworthy that for the validation cases similar to the semi analytical solution the sea boundary is assumed at the right side of the domain the main isochlors 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 obtained with comsol models as well as the semi analytical ones are plotted in fig 3 the corresponding swi metrics are given in table 2 the comsol simulations have been performed using a mesh consisting of about 18 000 elements as is obvious from fig 3 excellent agreement is obtained between the comsol and the semi analytical results this highlights the accuracy of the developed comsol models and the related post treatment procedure applied to obtain the swi metrics it also confirms the validity of the boussinesq approximation for swi in homogenous cas for fcas analytical or semi analytical solutions do not exist we compare the developed comsol models swi comsol and swi comsol bq against an in house research code traces based on advanced space and time discretization techniques younes et al 2009 this code has been validated by comparison against several configurations of semi analytical solutions in fahs et al 2018 it has proven to be a robust tool for the simulation of swi in both homogeneous and heterogeneous domains dfn approach which is based on average properties over the fracture width is not available in traces thus the fractures are modeled by considering heterogeneity of material without reduction of the dimensionality i e fracture is a specific layer of the 2d domain with different assigned properties we considered two validation cases which are based on a single horizontal and vertical fractures respectively the horizontal fracture is located at the aquifer middle depth d f 0 5 m while the vertical fracture is located near the seaside at x 1 8 m the physical parameters are given in table 1 the mesh used in the comsol simulations involves about 50 000 elements in the in house code we use a mesh with about 70 000 elements the obtained main isochlors are given in fig 4 and the corresponding swi metrics are summarized in table 2 fig 4a shows that in the case of single horizontal fracture the high conductivity in the fracture increases the freshwater discharge to the sea and pushes the saltwater wedge toward the sea especially around the fracture in the case of vertical fracture fig 4b the high permeability in the fracture enhances the upward flow and push up the saltwater around the fracture fig 4 and table 2 show excellent agreement between comsol and traces they confirm the validity of the boussinesq approximation in the presence of fractures and highlight the accuracy of the developed comsol model it should be noted also that the comparison between the comsol model in which the fracture is considered as a line and traces in which the fracture is a 2d layer confirms the results of grillo et al 2010 about the validity of the technique based on n 1 dimensional fractures i e average properties over the fracture for the simulation of swi in fcas 5 global sensitivity analysis results and discussion the methodology used to perform gsa is described in the flowchart presented in fig 5 in this section we present the assumptions and numerical details related to the pce construction we also validate the pce meta model by comparison against physical comsol model and we present the results of the gsa based on the si s for both salinity distribution and swi metrics 5 1 the single horizontal fracture configuration shf several studies showed that under steady state condition the isotropic henry problem is governed by six dimensionless quantities which are the gravity number longitudinal and transverse peclet numbers ratio of the fresh water density to the difference between freshwater and saltwater densities froude number and the concentration of salt in seawater riva et al 2015 fahs et al 2018 uncertainty analysis related to these parameters is performed in riva et al 2015 the main goal of our work is to investigate the effect of uncertainties related to the presence of fractures thus for the shf configuration we assume that the hydraulic conductivity k f aperture e f depth d f and longitudinal dispersivity α l m of the fracture are uncertain for the matrix domain we only include the longitudinal dispersivity α l m in our analysis as this parameter is important for the exchange between fracture and matrix domain the dispersivity ratio transverse to longitudinal is set to be 0 1 other parameters are kept constant table 3 summarizes the values of the deterministic parameters as well as the range of variability of the uncertain parameters the values used in this table are similar to sebben et al 2015 we should mention that network connectivity i e how fractures are interconnected has a clear and large impact on the extent of swi however in the cases investigated in this work all the fractures are fully connected abutting and crossing fractures thus the effect of network connectivity is not considered disconnected cases are not considered because it is not obvious to find well defined parameters required for gsa to describe the connectivity also disconnected fractures can lead to discontinuous model outputs for which the pce surrogate model could not approximate the true system with an acceptable degree of accuracy 5 1 1 pce construction numerical details orders and accuracy the uncertain parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed over their ranges of variability the pces are evaluated using an experimental design consisting of 100 samples to obtain a deterministic experimental design that covers the parameter space we use the quasi monte carlo sampling technique a preliminary mesh sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure mesh independent solutions for all the simulated samples these simulations were important in order to verify that the gsa results are not affected by numerical artifacts related to the finite element discretization the mesh sensitivity analysis is performed using the most challenging numerical case that deals with the highest value of k f and lowest values of α l m α l f and e f in such a case the advection and buoyancy processes are very important and the corresponding numerical solution could be highly sensitive to the mesh size as it might suffer from unphysical oscillations or numerical diffusion a mesh independent solution is achieved for this case using a grid consisting of about 50 000 elements this mesh is used for the 100 simulations required for computing the pce expansions for each swi metric or model output the corresponding pce surrogate model is calculated using the technique described in section 3 for the salt concentration distribution multivariate output component wise pce is constructed on each node of the regular 2d square grid defined for the control points involving 5000 control points the matlab code developed by shao et al 2017 is used to compute the sparse pce to give more confidence to the sparse pce we also compute total order pce using the uqlab software marelli and sudret 2014 as five input variables are considered and 100 samples are available only third order polynomial could be reached via the total order pce expansion the corresponding optimal number of samples is 56 with the sparse technique implemented in this work higher orders can be reached even if the optimal number of samples required for full pce is not achieved sixth order pce is reached for the salt concentration distribution and all swi metrics except the width of the mixing zone for which the polynomial order is limited to five the accuracy of the resulting sparse pce surrogate model is checked by comparison against the physical comsol model in fig 6 we compare the values obtained with the sparse pce with those of dfn vdf physical model implemented with comsol for parameter inputs corresponding to the experimental design i e used for the pce construction and also for new samples some examples of the results precisely the length of saltwater toe l toe and the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer ms are plotted in fig 6 we can observe an excellent match which confirms that the pce surrogate model reproduces the physical model outputs well 5 1 2 uncertainty propagation and marginal effects me based on the pce we calculate the first and total sis which are used for uncertainty propagation we also calculate the me univariate effect to obtain a global idea about the impact of the input parameters on the model output the me of a certain parameter represents the variability of the model output to this parameter when other parameters are kept constant at their average values the gsa results for the spatial distribution of the salt concentration are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7a shows the distribution of the mean concentration based on the pce expansion at each node of the mesh used for the control points the mean value of the salt concentration is calculated as the arithmetic average of the concentrations corresponding to the 100 samples used in the experimental design which are evaluated via the pce surrogate model this figure shows that the mean concentration distribution reflects the systematic behavior of swi the isochlors are more penetrated at the bottom aquifer due to the saltwater density this confirms that the pce surrogate model mimics the full model s response we also calculate the concentration variance to evaluate how far the concentrations are spread out form their average values fig 7b as expected the variance is significant in the saltwater wedge the largest values are located near the aquifer bottom surface where the swi is usually induced by mixing processes that can be highly sensitive to the model inputs fracture characteristics and matrix dispersivity the variance is negligible near the sea side as the boundary conditions are almost deterministic and the sole acting random parameter is the longitudinal dispersivity that can affect the dispersive entering flux the sensitivity of the concertation distribution to the uncertain parameters is assessed with the maps of the total si fig 7c g the total si of α l m fig 7c shows that the uncertainty related to this parameter affects the concentration distribution at the top aquifer outside the saltwater wedge in this zone the salt transport processes are dominated by the longitudinal dispersion flux as the velocity is toward the sea and it is almost horizontal and parallel to the salt concentration gradient the zones of largest total si for k f and e f are located within the saltwater wedge toward the low isochlors fig 7d and e in this region the mass transfer is mainly related to the advection process which is related to the velocity field this later is highly depending on the fracture permeability and aperture the zone of influence of d f is also located within the saltwater wedge but toward the aquifer bottom surface and at the vicinity of the high isochlors fig 7f the influence of α l f is limited to the vicinity of the sea boundary where α l f can impact the saltwater flux to the aquifer fig 7g in the fracture advection is dominating and dispersion is negligible it is worthwhile noting that the total sis count in the overall contribution of a parameter including nonlinearities and interactions thus sis allow for ranking the parameters according to their importance it appears on fig 7 that d f kf and ef are the most influential parameters because their total si are more pronounced in the region where the salt concentration variance is maximum from the scales of fig 7 d f it is clear that kf and ef are more influential than d f fig 7c shows that the salinity distribution is weakly sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity of the matrix as in its zone of influence the variance is negligible inspection of the sensitivity of swi metrics to uncertain parameters is given in fig 8 this figure represents the bar plots of the total and first order sis of the swi metrics as mentioned previously for a further understanding of the uncertainty on swi metrics related to the imperfect knowledge of input parameters we also investigate the mes of the most relevant parameters these mes are plotted in fig 9 the large variability of the swi metrics see vertical scales in fig 9a j confirms that the mes are in agreement with the sis fig 8a shows that the uncertainty on l toe is mainly due to the effects of d f and k f with a total si of 0 54 d f is considered as the most influential parameter the me of d f and k f on l toe are given in fig 9a and 9b respectively fig 9a shows that l toe decreases with d f which is coherent with the results of sebben et al 2015 fig 9b shows that l toe increases with k f the physical interpretation of this variation is that the increase of k f heightens the potential of the fracture to constitute a preferential freshwater flow path this slow down the freshwater flow in the matrix which in turn facilitates swi and leads to the increase of the penetration length of the saltwater wedge fig 8b indicates that the variability of l s is mainly impacted by α l m this makes sense as l s measures the salinity dispersion along the aquifer bottom surface which is mainly controlled by α l m l s is even expected to increase with α l m which is confirmed from the me in fig 9c we can also notice in fig 8b the slight sensitivity of l s to d f the corresponding me fig 9d shows that this sensitivity is relatively important for deep fractures d f 0 6 the sis for w mz are given in fig 8c the width of the mixing zone is mainly controlled by the dispersive flux this is why α l m is the main parameter affecting w mz as expected increasing variation of w mz against α l m can be observed in fig 9e for z i fig 8d with a total si of 0 58 d f is the most important parameter fig 9f shows that z i decreases with d f which is in agreement with the results of sebben et al 2015 variability of z i could be also affected by the uncertainty of k f the corresponding me in fig 9g shows that z i increases with k f fig 8e depicts the sis for the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s it indicates that m s is primarily sensitive to d f si 0 62 it is also sensitive to k f me fig 9h shows that m s decreases with d f which is also consistent with the results sebben et al 2015 m s increases with k f fig 9i this behavior is related to fact that the increase of k f enhances the inland extent of the saltwater wedge as explained in the previous section finally the sis for q s total shows that this output is mainly affected by d f fig 8f as show in fig 9j q s total increases with d f in general the sis show that the uncertainty associated with α l f has no effect on the swi metrics which is logical as salt transport in the fracture is dominated by the advection processes 5 2 the network of orthogonal fractures configuration nof in this configuration our goal is to investigate the effect of uncertainty related to the fractures density on the model outputs thus we keep the same uncertain parameters as for the shf configuration but we replace d f by δ f the latter is considered here as the parameter representing the fracture density the values of the deterministic parameters and the range of variability of the uncertain inputs are given in table 3 the lowest value of δ f corresponds to a network with 13 horizontal and 26 vertical fractures these values are used to obtain the results in affordable cpu time as denser fractured configurations would require a large number of simulations to construct the pce and the comsol model in this case becomes very cpu time consuming we should mention that for this configuration we reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures if the same values would have been used as in shf configuration freshwater flow would have been so intensive that no swi would occur 5 2 1 pce construction numerical details orders and accuracy the nof configuration is more sensitive to the fractures characteristics than shf configuration the number of samples is progressively increased until obtaining accurate pces the corresponding experimental design involves 200 samples the mesh sensitivity analysis for the most challenging cases the smallest value of δ f reveals that mesh independent solution can be obtained using a grid of 70 000 elements as for the shf configuration sparse and total pce are calculated with 200 samples order 4 total pce can be obtained the optimal number of samples is 126 with the sparse technique sixth order polynomial is reached for l toe m s z i and q s total for l s and w mz orders 4 and 8 are achieved respectively fig 10 shows some comparisons between the sparse pce surrogate and comsol models and highlights the accuracy of the pce expansions a good matching is observed both for the input parameters of the experimental design and for new samples it is relevant to emphasize that this level of accuracy is acceptable to obtain good gsa results with the sis evaluated using the surrogate model 5 2 2 uncertainty propagation and marginal effects the distribution of the mean concentration based on the pce expansion is given in fig 11 a the mean pce isochlors emulate the ones obtained using the physical model fig 12 they present some discontinuous points where saltwater is pushed toward the sea due to high permeability in the fractures the spatial map of the concentration variance is plotted in fig 11b compared to the shf configuration the zone of significant variance is contracted and concentrated toward the bottom surface of the aquifer near the low mean isochlors the map of the total sis of α l m fig 11 c is quite similar to the one in the shf configuration but it echoes the presence and influence of fracture network fig 11c shows that the zone of influence of α l m falls where the concentration variance is negligible thus α l m is not an important parameter for salinity distribution sensitivity to k f and e f are both important fig 11d and e the zone of influence of k f is discontinuous and mainly located toward the sea boundary in at the bottom of the aquifer important values can be observed landward see fig 11 d but these values do not express high sensitivity as the concentration variance is negligible in this zone the sensitivity to the fractures density δ f is given in fig 11f this figure shows that uncertainty associated δ f can mainly affect the salinity distribution within the mixing zone toward the bottom surface it confirms that δ f is an influential parameter finally and in contrast to the shf configuration α l f appears to be an important parameter in the nof configuration fig 11g it affects mainly salinity distribution around the low isochlors the bar plots in fig 13 depict the total and first order sis for the swi metrics to the uncertain parameters and fig 14 gives the mes of these parameters in general fig 14 confirms the results of the sis as large variations of swi metrics can be observed with respect to the uncertain parameters fig 13a demonstrates that l toe is mainly controlled by k f and δ f the corresponding total sis are s k f t 0 52 and s δ f t 0 32 respectively fig 14a shows an increasing variation of l toe against k f as for the shf configuration this is related to the fact that the increase of k f concentrates the freshwater flow in the fractures and entails a weaker freshwater flow in the matrix as consequence the saltwater wedge expands landward and l toe increases this behavior can be understood also using the equivalent porous media model which is based on a bulk hydraulic conductivity as given in sebben et al 2015 the bulk equivalent conductivity k eq for a network of orthogonal fractures is given by 20 k eq k m k f e f δ f 1 e f k f δ f 1 eq 20 shows that k eq increases with the increase of k f the equivalent gravity number which compares the buoyancy forces to the inland freshwater flux is given by fahs et al 2018 21 n g eq k eq h ρ 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 q d the increase of k eq leads to the increase of n g eq this latter can be interpreted at constant densities and hydraulic conductivity as a decrease in the inland freshwater that opposes swi this enhances the extend of swi and leads to the increase of l toe fig 14b shows that l toe decreases with δ f in fact the increase of δ f corresponds to the reduction of the fracture density this enhances the freshwater flow in the porous matrix and pushes the saltwater wedge toward the sea the equivalent bulk hydraulic conductivity model can be also useful in explaining this variation by reasoning in the same way as for the variation of l toe against k f as it is clear from eq 20 the increase of δ f for the average value of k m k f and e f corresponds to a decrease in k eq and the related equivalent gravity number this can be interpreted as an increase of the freshwater flux that lowers the extent of swi and decreases l toe the bar plots in fig 13b and 13c indicate that as for the shf configuration α l m is the most important parameter affecting l s and w mz the corresponding sis are calculated to be 0 68 and 0 34 respectively fig 14c and d display increasing variation of l s and w mz against α l m this makes sense as l s and w mz are mainly related to the mixing processes which are controlled by α l m fig 13d shows that with s k f t 0 50 and s δ f t 0 27 k f and δ f are the most important parameters affecting z i mes in fig 14e and f indicate that z i increases with k f and decreases with δ f the reason behind these variations is the enhancement resp reduction in the saltwater wedge extent associated with the variation of k f resp δ f explained previously these results related to the variation of z i against δ f are found to be in agreement with those in sebben et al 2015 the dimensionless mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s appears to be sensitive to all uncertain parameters except α l f fig 13e the total sis with respect α l m k f e f δ f are calculated to be 0 34 0 41 0 22 and 0 27 respectively the mes show that m s decreases with δ f and increases with k f and α l m fig 14g i the variation against δ f and k f is related to the behavior of the saltwater wedge when these parameters change see above the increase of α l m pushes the saltwater wedge landward fahs et al 2018 and increases the area of the salted zone as well as the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total is mainly affected by α l m k f fig 13f the total sis of these parameters are calculated to be 0 43 and 0 42 respectively the mes fig 14j and k show that q s total increases with α l m and decreases with k f indeed q s total is advective and dispersive saltwater flux at the sea boundary the dispersive flux is proportional to α l m this explains why q s total increases with α l m the increase of k f corresponds to the decrease of the gravity number see above a lower gravity number indicates less significant effect of the buoyancy forces for which the saltwater velocity decreases and reduces the advective saltwater flux finally it is worth noting that for the nof configuration the sis for α l f are more important than for the shf configuration α l f appears to be an important parameter especially for l toe and l s in general physical consistency of the results for both shf and nof configuration provides insight on the validity of our analysis based on the pce as a meta model 6 conclusion in this work the dfn model is coupled with the vdf model to simulate swi in fcas the dfn vdf model requires the discontinuous description of the fracture characteristics which are usually uncertain thus it is essential for several practical and theoretical purposes to understand quantify how the uncertainties associated with the imperfect knowledge of the fracture characteristics can propagate through the model and introduce uncertainties into the model outputs despite the high performance of computer codes for swi models run time of these codes is still high because of the high nonlinearity dense grids required for fractures and large space and time scales associated with studied domains thus the traditional techniques for uncertainty analysis i e monte carlo simulations cannot be easily applied in this context as they require a large number of simulations to achieve reliable results to meet the computational challenges of traditional techniques we develop in this work a gsa based on the non intrusive pce in particular we apply an efficient sparse technique to construct the pce with a reduced number of model evaluations based on kashyap information criterion in the literature gsa has been recently applied to swi but previous studies are limited to homogeneous domain two configurations of the fractured henry problem dealing with a single horizontal fracture shf and a network of orthogonal fractures nof are considered as conceptual models the simulations required to construct the pce are performed using a finite element model developed in the framework of comsol software boussinesq approximation is implemented to improve the computational efficiency of the comsol model from technical point of view this work shows several novelties that are important for the simulation of swi it shows the ability of comsol to accurately simulate swi in simple and fractured aquifers it also proves that the dimension reduction of fractures in the frame of the dfn model is a valid approach to simulate swi in fcas and confirms the validity of the boussinesq approximation in such a case regarding uncertainty analysis this study presents an efficient low cost methodology to understand uncertainty propagation into swi models this methodology is generic and can be efficiently applied to real field investigations in hydrogeological applications gsa is often applied to investigate uncertainty propagation associated with hydrogeological parameters this work shows that gsa is generic and can be a valuable tool for different kinds of uncertainties the gsa results showed that for the shf configuration the uncertainty associated with the fracture hydraulic conductivity and depth is the first sources of uncertainty on the salinity distribution the spatial distributions of the sis are given as maps this represents an important feature of this study as these maps are not only important for uncertainty analysis but also provide relevant locations for measurement required for aquifer characterization fracture hydraulic conductivity and depth are also important parameters for the toe position l toe thickness of the freshwater discharge zone z i the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s and the flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total the thickness of the saltwater wedge and the width of the mixing zone are mainly controlled by the dispersion coefficient in the matrix the uncertainty related to the fracture aperture has a slight impact on the swi metrics its major effect is observed on l toe uncertainty associated with the fracture dispersion coefficient does not affect in any way the swi metrics for the nof configuration the imperfect knowledge of fracture hydraulic conductivity and density are the first source of uncertainty of the salinity distribution however it is observed that all the uncertain parameters become important for the salinity distribution in this case in contrast to the shf configuration in which the dispersion in the fracture is not important in the nof configuration the salinity distribution at the aquifer top surface is influenced by this fracture dispersivity l toe and z i are mainly controlled by the fractures density and hydraulic conductivity as for the shf configuration the width of the mixing zone is mainly affected by uncertainty associated with the dispersion coefficient in the matrix l s is also majorly affected by the dispersion coefficient in the matrix but the other uncertain parameters are also influencing it all the uncertain parameters have distributed effects on m s and q s total conflicts of interest none acknowledgments behzad ataie

6639,in this study we use polynomial chaos expansion pce to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion swi in fractured coastal aquifers fcas which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network dfn and variable density flow vdf models the dfn vdf model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures in real field applications these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model thus we perform global sensitivity analysis gsa to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs as our conceptual model we consider fractured configurations of the henry problem which is widely used to understand swi processes a finite element dfn vdf model is developed in the framework of comsol multiphysics we examine the uncertainty of several swi metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics pce is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden a new sparse pce technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost the sobol indices sis are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties the proposed gsa methodology based on pce and sis is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy it shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution the imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer marginal effects based on the pce are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on swi the findings provide a technical support for monitoring controlling and preventing swi in fcas keywords seawater intrusion fractured coastal aquifers uncertainty analysis uncertain fracture characteristics global sensitivity analysis sobol indices 1 introduction coastal aquifers cas are currently in a critical situation throughout the world these aquifers are essential sources of freshwater for more than 40 of the world s population living in coastal areas ioc unesco imo fao undp 2011 barragán and de andrés 2015 the phenomenon of seawater intrusion swi which encompasses the advancement of saline water into fresh groundwater mainly caused by excessive groundwater extraction is the first source of contamination in cas werner et al 2013 the european environment agency www eea europa eu declared swi as a major threat for many cas worldwide this phenomenon is exacerbated by the increasing demand for groundwater as a result of the increase in population and anthropogenic activity it is also amplified due to natural causes such as climate change tsunami events and sea level rise expected in the next century e g ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 the impacts of local heterogeneities of cas on the extent of swi at the scale relevant for management scenarios is well documented in the literature e g simmons et al 2001 kerrou and renard 2010 lu et al 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2014 pool et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2015 shi et al 2018 fractured geology is the most challenging form of natural heterogeneity fractures represent the preferential pathways that may enable faster swi or intensify freshwater discharge to the sea bear et al 1999 fractured coastal aquifers fcas are found globally several examples can be found in france arfib and charlier 2016 usa xu et al 2018 greece dokou and karatzas 2012 italy fidelibus et al 2011 ireland perriquet et al 2014 comte et al 2018 uk macallister et al 2018 and in the mediterranean zone where more than 25 of cas are typically karstic bakalowicz et al 2008 chen et al 2017 despite the fact that fcas are distributed throughout the world and they often contain significant groundwater resources due to their high porosity swi in these aquifers is rarely investigated and related processes are still largely unexplored and poorly understood dokou and karatzas 2012 sebben et al 2015 in the review paper of werner et al 2013 the authors suggested swi in fcas as one of the potential remaining challenging problems swi can be tackled using either the sharp interface approximation or variable density flow vdf model werner et al 2013 llopis albert et al 2016 szymkiewicz et al 2018 vdf model involves flow and mass transfer equations coupled by a mixture state equation expressing the density in terms of salt concentration this model is usually used in field applications as it is more realistic than the sharp interface approximation and has the privilege of considering the transition zone between the freshwater and saltwater known as the mixing zone flow in fractured porous media can be described using three alternative approaches i equivalent porous medium in which averaged estimations of the hydrogeological properties over a representative elementary volume are used to represent the domain dietrich et al 2005 ii dual porosity models where the domain is considered as the superposition of two continuums representing respectively rocks and fractures fahs et al 2014 jerbi et al 2017 and iii discrete fracture model in which the fractures and matrix are handled explicitly berre et al 2018 discrete fracture model is the most accurate model because fractures are considered without any simplification it is usually used for domains with a relatively small number of fractures hirthe and graf 2015 ramasomanana et al 2018 and has come into practical use in recent years however discrete fracture models require enormous computational time and memory due to the dense meshes resulting from the explicit discretization of the fractures discrete fracture network dfn in which the fractures are embedded in d 1 dimensional elements in d dimensional physical domain is an alternative approximation that reduces the overhead computations of the discrete fracture model dfn model has been successfully coupled with vdf model to simulate swi in fcas for instance grillo et al 2010 based on a single fracture configuration of henry problem showed that dfn vdf model is a valid alternative to the discrete fracture model for simulating swi dokou and karatzas 2012 developed a hybrid model based on the combination of the dfn model for main fractures and faults and the equivalent porous media model for lower order fractures to investigate swi in a fca in greece by confronting numerical simulations to chloride concentration observations they showed that the dfn model is necessary to accurately simulate swi sebben et al 2015 used the dfn vdf model to present a preliminary deterministic study on the effect of fractured heterogeneity on swi using different fractured configurations of henry problem mozafari et al 2018 developed a dfn vdf model in the finite element frame work of comsol multiphysics nevertheless the dfn vdf model requires the basic characteristics of fractures as location aperture permeability porosity etc these characteristics are subject to a large amount of uncertainties as they are often determined using model calibration procedure based on relatively insufficient historical data provided by several measurement techniques as surface electrical resistivity tomography beaujean et al 2014 borehole concentrations and head measurements multiperiod oscillatory hydraulic tests sayler et al 2018 self potential measurements macallister et al 2018 among others these uncertainties would reduce the predictive capability of the dfn vdf model and impair the reliability of swi management based on these predictions thus it is important to understand how these uncertainties could propagate in the model and lead to uncertainty in outputs this work goes a step further in the understanding of swi processes in fcas it aims to provide a preliminary investigation on the impacts of uncertainty associated to fractures characteristics on the extent of the steady state saltwater wedge simulated using the dfn vfd model in particular we investigate the effects of uncertainties on fracture network characteristics location aperture density permeability and dispersivity on several swi metrics as the length of the saltwater toe thickness of the mixing zone area of the salted zone and salinity flux penetrating to the aquifer as the underpinning conceptual model we consider the fractured henry problem suggested in sebben et al 2015 a finite element dfn vdf numerical model is implemented using comsol multiphysics software we include the boussinesq approximation in the comsol model to reduce nonlinearity and improve computational efficiency in order to quantify the variability in model outputs resulting from the uncertain parameters we use the global sensitivity analysis gsa gsa is more appropriate than local sensitivity analysis as it provides a robust and practical framework to explore the entire inputs space and to assess the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainty saltelli 2002 sudret 2008 de rocquigny 2012 gsa is a powerful approach to fully understand the complex physical processes and assess the applicability of models it is also important for risk assessment and decision making in hydrogeological applications gsa has been used to investigate saturated unsaturated flow younes et al 2013 2018 dai et al 2017 meng and li 2017 maina and guadagnini 2018 miller et al 2018 solute transport fajraoui et al 2011 2012 ciriello et al 2013 younes et al 2016 geological co2 sequestration jia et al 2016 natural convection fajraoui et al 2017 and double diffusive convection shao et al 2017 in swi gsa has been applied to study the effects of hydrodynamics parameters in homogeneous cas herckenrath et al 2011 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 rajabi et al 2015 riva et al 2015 dell oca et al 2017 rajabi et al 2015 have shown that gsa is the best suited method for uncertainty analysis of swi recently xu et al 2018 used gsa to investigate swi in a karstic ca with conduit networks to the best of our knowledge gsa has never been applied to swi in heterogeneous and or fcas different alternatives can be used to perform gsa iooss and lemaître 2015 among these alternatives in this paper we use the variance based technique with the sobol indices sis as sensitivity metrics sobol 2001 these indices are widely used because they do not assume any simplification regarding the physical model and provide the sensitivity of individual contribution from each parameter uncertainty as well as the mixed contributions sarkar and witteveen 2016 sis are usually evaluated through monte carlo methods which require a large number of simulations to cover the parameters space and as a consequence might be impractical in high cpu consuming problems as is the case for swi in fcas sudret 2008 herckenrath et al 2011 to meet the numerical challenges of monte carlo methods we use the polynomial chaos expansions pce which proceeds by expressing each model output as a linear combination of orthogonal multivariate polynomials for a specified probability measure crestaux et al 2009 konakli and sudret 2016 fajraoui et al 2017 in particular we implement the sparse pce technique developed by shao et al 2017 to allow high polynomial orders i e high accuracy with an optimized number of deterministic samples with this technique the number of terms in the pce decomposition is reduced by excluding insignificant terms the polynomial order is updated progressively until reaching a prescribed accuracy during the procedure kashyap information criterion is used to measure the relevance of pce terms shao et al 2017 the sparsity of the pce allows accurate surrogate model even if the optimal number of samples necessary for a total order expansion is not achieved once the pce is constructed for each model output the sis can be directly calculated with no extra computational cost by a post processing treatment of the pce coefficients the paper is organized as follows section 2 is for material and methods in which we present two fractured scenarios of the henry problem investigated in this study the dfn vdf model developed with comsol and the swi metrics used as model outputs section 3 is devoted to the gsa method in section 4 we validate the developed comsol model and the boussinesq approximation by comparison against exact solutions and an in house research code section 5 discusses the gsa results it includes pce construction validation of pce and uncertainties propagation a conclusion is given in section 6 2 material and methods 2 1

found in fahs et al 2018 this problem deals with swi in a confined ca of depth h and length ℓ sea boundary condition constant concentration and depth dependent pressure head is imposed at the left side and constant freshwater flux q d l 2 t 1 with zero concentration is assumed at the right side two fracture configurations are investigated in our analysis the first configuration deals with a single horizontal fracture shf extending on the whole domain and located at a distance d f from the aquifer top surface fig 1 a this configuration is specifically considered to investigate the effect of uncertainty related to fracture location on the extent of saltwater wedge in the second configuration we assume a network of orthogonal fractures nof fig 1b as in sebben et al 2015 square sugar cube model with elementary size δ f distance between 2 consecutive fractures is considered as fracture network this configuration is considered since it allows for performing uncertainty analysis of the swi metrics with respect to the fracture density furthermore vertical fractures are important to investigate buoyancy effects 2 2 dfn vdf mathematical model under steady state conditions and based on boussinesq approximation the vdf model in the porous matrix is given by guevara morel et al 2015 1 q 0 2 q k m h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z 3 q c ε m d m i d c 0 4 d α l m α t m q q q α t m q i 5 ρ ρ 0 δ ρ c where q is the darcy s velocity l t 1 ρ 0 the freshwater density m l 3 g the gravitational acceleration l t 2 k m is the freshwater hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix l t 1 h the equivalent freshwater head l ρ m l 3 the density of mixture fluid and z is the elevation l c is the relative solute concentration d m the molecular diffusion coefficient l 2 t 1 ε m is the porosity of the porous matrix i the identity matrix and d is the dispersion tensor α l m l and α t m l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient of the porous matrix respectively with the dfn approach the mathematical model for fractures can be obtained by assuming 1d flow and mass transport equations along the fractures direction the resulting equations are similar to the ones in the porous matrix but with ε f k f and α l f as porosity hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity in the fractures respectively transverse dispersivity in the fracture α t f is neglected as in sebben et al 2015 the 1d flow and mass transport equations in fracture involve the thickness of the fracture e f as parameter 2 3 dfn vdf finite element model comsol multiphysics the dfn vdf simulations are performed using a finite element model developed with comsol multiphysics software package comsol is a comprehensive simulation software environment for various applications the use of comsol in applications related to hydrogeology is increasingly frequent as this software is a user friendly tool that facilitates all the modeling steps preprocessing meshing solving and post processing and allows an easy coupling of different physical processes ren et al 2017 fischer et al 2018 our comsol model is created by coupling the subsurface flow and transport of diluted species modules and by assuming concentration dependent fluid density the subsurface flow module is an extension of comsol modeling environment to applications related to fluid flow in saturated and variably saturated porous media in this module we use the darcy s flow interface the fractures are included via the dfn model by adding the fracture flow feature to the darcy s law interface the transport of diluted species module is used to solve the advection dispersion equation the boussinesq approximation is implemented by considering constant density in the fluid properties and setting a buoyancy volume force depending on the salt concentration the numerical scheme suggested by default in comsol is used to solve the system of equations the flow and transport models are solved sequentially via the segregated solver accurate solutions of the flow model can be obtained using finite volume or finite difference methods deng and wang 2017 however in comsol quadratic basis finite element functions are used for the discretization of the pressure in the flow model while the concentration in the transport model is discretized using the linear basis functions the consistent stabilization technique is used to avoid unphysical oscillations related to the discretization of the advection term this technique is often called upwinding it adds diffusion in the streamline direction triangular meshes suggested by the comsol meshing tool are used in the simulations with the dfn model the comsol meshing tool generates 2d triangular cells to represent the matrix and 1d cells to represent the fractures the fracture cells are positioned along the sides of the matrix triangular cells with the finite element modeling framework the common degrees of freedom at the triangle nodes in the matrix and at the 1d segments in the fractures are used to model the volumetric and mass fluxes between the matrix and the fractures first runs have shown that with the steady state mode comsol is bound to run into convergence difficulties to avoid this problem we used the transient mode this problem is related to the initial guesses required for the nonlinear solver that are often hard to obtain hence the steady state solutions are obtained by letting the system evolve under transient conditions until steady state 2 4 metrics design the main purpose of this study is to perform gsa in regards to certain metrics characterizing the steady state salt wedge and saltwater flux associated with swi the model inputs will be discussed later in the results section since they are dependent on the fracture configuration as model outputs we consider the following swi metrics the spatial distribution of the salt concentration it is obtained in a pattern of a 100 50 regular 2d square grid 5000 nodes length of the saltwater toe l toe the distance from sea boundary to the 0 5 isochlor on the bottom surface of the aquifer fig 2 thickness of the saltwater wedge l s the distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors on the aquifer bottom surface fig 2 average horizontal width of the mixing zone w mz the average horizontal distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors from the bottom to the top of the aquifer fig 2 the height of the inflection point z i the freshwater seawater inflection point located on the seaward boundary fig 2 below this point the seawater flows toward the land and above it the freshwater is discharged to the sea the dimensionless mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s 1 ℓ h 0 ℓ 0 h c d x d z the double integral is calculated with the grid used for the spatial distribution of salt concentration only nodes with concentration above 0 01 are considered total dimensionless flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total defined as the flux of saltwater entering the domain by advection diffusion and dispersion normalized by the freshwater flux imposed at the inland boundary q d 3 global sensitivity analysis gsa is a useful and a widespread tool that aims to quantify and evaluate the output uncertainties resulting from the uncertainties in the model inputs which could be considered singly for one parameter or coupled together several parameters in this study the variability of the model responses is quantified throughout a variance based technique using sis as sensitivity metrics on the one hand variance based sensitivity measures are of interest as they typically specify the relationship between model outputs and input parameters and on the other hand the major advantage of using sis is that they do not require any assumptions of monotonicity or linearity in the physical model the main stages of this technique are developed here more details can be found in sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2017 and le gratiet et al 2017 let us consider a mathematical model y m x delivering the outputs of a physical system that presumably depends on m uncertain input parameters x x 1 x 2 x m for further developments f xi x i and f x i 1 m f xi x i refer to their marginal probability density function pdf and the corresponding joint pdf of a given set 3 1 sobol indices the sobol decomposition of m x reads sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2017 6 m x m 0 i 1 m m i x i 1 i j m m ij x i x j m 1 2 m x 1 x m where m 0 is the expected value of m x and the integral of each summand m i 1 i 2 i s x i 1 x i 2 x i s over any of its independent variables is zero that is 7 γ x ik m i 1 i 2 i s x i 1 x i 2 x i s f x i k x i k 0 1 k s where f x i k x i k and γ x i k represent the marginal pdf and support of x i k respectively the orthogonality m i leads a unique sobol decomposition 8 e m u x u m v x v 0 where e is the mathematical expectation operator u i 1 i 2 i m 1 2 m represents the index sets and x u are the subvectors involving the components for which the indices belong to u as a result of uniqueness and orthogonality of y its total variance d is decomposed as below 9 d v a r m x u 0 d u u 0 var m u x u where d u is the partial variance expressed as below 10 d u v a r m u x u e m u 2 x u consequently the sis are naturally defined as 11 s u d u d the influence on y of each parameter considered singly is given by the first order sobol indices si defined by 12 s i d i d the total si that includes the effect of an input parameter with the contribution from other parameters is defined as follows homma and saltelli 1996 13 s i t ϑ i d u d ϑ i u i the sis can be calculated by performing monte carlo simulations this can be done using the estimates of the mean value total and partial variance of a large number of samples as explained in sudret 2008 the drawback of monte carlo simulations lies in the computational cost especially when time consuming models are investigated to circumvent this problem sudret 2008 introduced the pce for the computation of sis 3 2 polynomials chaos expansion pce each model output is expanded into a set of orthonormal multivariate polynomials of maximum degree m 14 y m x α a y α φ α x where a is a multi index α α 1 α 2 α m and y α α a are the polynomial coefficients φ α x are the base functions of vector space of polynomial functions these functions should be orthogonal in the vector space with the joint pdf f x of x as a dot product the polynomial coefficients y α are evaluated using the regression method least square technique that proceeds by minimizing an objective function representing the difference between the meta model and physical model see fajraoui et al 2017 based on the pce the mean value μ and total variance d of any model output can be calculated as follows 15 μ y 0 16 d α a 0 y α 2 then the sis of any order can be computed using the coefficients d and μ in a straightforward manner as followed 17 s i α a i 0 y α 2 d a i α a α i 0 α j i 0 and 18 s i t α a i t 0 y α 2 d a i t α a α i 0 as suggested by deman et al 2016 we also evaluate the marginal effect me to understand the relation between the important variables and the model outputs me is given by 19 e m x x i x i m 0 α a i y α φ α x i 3 3 sparse polynomial chaos expansion to minimize the number of physical model evaluations and therefore reduce the computational cost the estimation of the sobol indices could be done with a sparse pce instead of a full pce approach in other words instead of using the expression eq 14 we can only use some relevant coefficients of the pce the key idea consists in discarding the irrelevant terms in the estimated truncated pce and for this purpose several approaches have been developed blatman and sudret 2011 utilized an iterative forward backward approach based on nonintrusive regression or a truncation strategy based on hyperbolic index sets coupled with an adaptive algorithm involving a least angle regression lar meng and li 2017 modified the lar algorithm with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso lar an adaptive procedure using projections on a minimized number of bivariate basis functions has been provided by hu and youn 2011 whereas fajraoui et al 2012 worked with a fixed experimental design and retained only significant coefficients that could contribute to the model variance the approach developed in shao et al 2017 which has been implemented in this work consists in progressively increasing the degree of an initial pce until a satisfactory representation of the model responses is obtained the computation of the kashyap information criterion kic based on a bayesian model averaging is used to determine the best sparse pce for a input output sample evaluating kic is an efficient from a computational point of view and feasible alternative to directly computing the bayesian model evidence being known that this later evaluates the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model s parameter space hence it is a key term to obtain the posterior probability in the bayesian framework for more details on the bayesian sparse pce for constructing the algorithm and computing the kic readers can refer to shao et al 2017 4 validations comsol model and boussinesq approximation although comsol has great potential for modelling density driven flow problems it has rarely been used for swi thus the main purpose of this section is to validate our developed comsol model in addition as explained previously boussinesq approximation was implemented in our comsol model to improve its computational efficiency this is a popular approximation for the vdf model as it allows for reducing the computational costs and renders convergence more likely to be achieved it assumes that variations in density only give rise to buoyancy forces and have no impact on the flow field boussinesq approximation ignores density concentration dependence except in the buoyancy term this approximation is common for swi in non fractured cas guevara morel et al 2015 its validity for swi in fcas is not discussed in the literature thus another goal of this section is to investigate the validity of this approximation for such a case for this purpose we first use the new semi analytical solutions of the henry problem homogeneous aquifer developed by fahs et al 2016 we compare these solutions against two comsol models i swi comsol model based on the standard comsol approach and ii swi comsol bq based on the boussinesq approximation we investigate two test cases presented in fahs et al 2016 which deal with constant and velocity dependent dispersion tensor respectively the corresponding physical parameters are summarized in table 1 it is noteworthy that for the validation cases similar to the semi analytical solution the sea boundary is assumed at the right side of the domain the main isochlors 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 obtained with comsol models as well as the semi analytical ones are plotted in fig 3 the corresponding swi metrics are given in table 2 the comsol simulations have been performed using a mesh consisting of about 18 000 elements as is obvious from fig 3 excellent agreement is obtained between the comsol and the semi analytical results this highlights the accuracy of the developed comsol models and the related post treatment procedure applied to obtain the swi metrics it also confirms the validity of the boussinesq approximation for swi in homogenous cas for fcas analytical or semi analytical solutions do not exist we compare the developed comsol models swi comsol and swi comsol bq against an in house research code traces based on advanced space and time discretization techniques younes et al 2009 this code has been validated by comparison against several configurations of semi analytical solutions in fahs et al 2018 it has proven to be a robust tool for the simulation of swi in both homogeneous and heterogeneous domains dfn approach which is based on average properties over the fracture width is not available in traces thus the fractures are modeled by considering heterogeneity of material without reduction of the dimensionality i e fracture is a specific layer of the 2d domain with different assigned properties we considered two validation cases which are based on a single horizontal and vertical fractures respectively the horizontal fracture is located at the aquifer middle depth d f 0 5 m while the vertical fracture is located near the seaside at x 1 8 m the physical parameters are given in table 1 the mesh used in the comsol simulations involves about 50 000 elements in the in house code we use a mesh with about 70 000 elements the obtained main isochlors are given in fig 4 and the corresponding swi metrics are summarized in table 2 fig 4a shows that in the case of single horizontal fracture the high conductivity in the fracture increases the freshwater discharge to the sea and pushes the saltwater wedge toward the sea especially around the fracture in the case of vertical fracture fig 4b the high permeability in the fracture enhances the upward flow and push up the saltwater around the fracture fig 4 and table 2 show excellent agreement between comsol and traces they confirm the validity of the boussinesq approximation in the presence of fractures and highlight the accuracy of the developed comsol model it should be noted also that the comparison between the comsol model in which the fracture is considered as a line and traces in which the fracture is a 2d layer confirms the results of grillo et al 2010 about the validity of the technique based on n 1 dimensional fractures i e average properties over the fracture for the simulation of swi in fcas 5 global sensitivity analysis results and discussion the methodology used to perform gsa is described in the flowchart presented in fig 5 in this section we present the assumptions and numerical details related to the pce construction we also validate the pce meta model by comparison against physical comsol model and we present the results of the gsa based on the si s for both salinity distribution and swi metrics 5 1 the single horizontal fracture configuration shf several studies showed that under steady state condition the isotropic henry problem is governed by six dimensionless quantities which are the gravity number longitudinal and transverse peclet numbers ratio of the fresh water density to the difference between freshwater and saltwater densities froude number and the concentration of salt in seawater riva et al 2015 fahs et al 2018 uncertainty analysis related to these parameters is performed in riva et al 2015 the main goal of our work is to investigate the effect of uncertainties related to the presence of fractures thus for the shf configuration we assume that the hydraulic conductivity k f aperture e f depth d f and longitudinal dispersivity α l m of the fracture are uncertain for the matrix domain we only include the longitudinal dispersivity α l m in our analysis as this parameter is important for the exchange between fracture and matrix domain the dispersivity ratio transverse to longitudinal is set to be 0 1 other parameters are kept constant table 3 summarizes the values of the deterministic parameters as well as the range of variability of the uncertain parameters the values used in this table are similar to sebben et al 2015 we should mention that network connectivity i e how fractures are interconnected has a clear and large impact on the extent of swi however in the cases investigated in this work all the fractures are fully connected abutting and crossing fractures thus the effect of network connectivity is not considered disconnected cases are not considered because it is not obvious to find well defined parameters required for gsa to describe the connectivity also disconnected fractures can lead to discontinuous model outputs for which the pce surrogate model could not approximate the true system with an acceptable degree of accuracy 5 1 1 pce construction numerical details orders and accuracy the uncertain parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed over their ranges of variability the pces are evaluated using an experimental design consisting of 100 samples to obtain a deterministic experimental design that covers the parameter space we use the quasi monte carlo sampling technique a preliminary mesh sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure mesh independent solutions for all the simulated samples these simulations were important in order to verify that the gsa results are not affected by numerical artifacts related to the finite element discretization the mesh sensitivity analysis is performed using the most challenging numerical case that deals with the highest value of k f and lowest values of α l m α l f and e f in such a case the advection and buoyancy processes are very important and the corresponding numerical solution could be highly sensitive to the mesh size as it might suffer from unphysical oscillations or numerical diffusion a mesh independent solution is achieved for this case using a grid consisting of about 50 000 elements this mesh is used for the 100 simulations required for computing the pce expansions for each swi metric or model output the corresponding pce surrogate model is calculated using the technique described in section 3 for the salt concentration distribution multivariate output component wise pce is constructed on each node of the regular 2d square grid defined for the control points involving 5000 control points the matlab code developed by shao et al 2017 is used to compute the sparse pce to give more confidence to the sparse pce we also compute total order pce using the uqlab software marelli and sudret 2014 as five input variables are considered and 100 samples are available only third order polynomial could be reached via the total order pce expansion the corresponding optimal number of samples is 56 with the sparse technique implemented in this work higher orders can be reached even if the optimal number of samples required for full pce is not achieved sixth order pce is reached for the salt concentration distribution and all swi metrics except the width of the mixing zone for which the polynomial order is limited to five the accuracy of the resulting sparse pce surrogate model is checked by comparison against the physical comsol model in fig 6 we compare the values obtained with the sparse pce with those of dfn vdf physical model implemented with comsol for parameter inputs corresponding to the experimental design i e used for the pce construction and also for new samples some examples of the results precisely the length of saltwater toe l toe and the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer ms are plotted in fig 6 we can observe an excellent match which confirms that the pce surrogate model reproduces the physical model outputs well 5 1 2 uncertainty propagation and marginal effects me based on the pce we calculate the first and total sis which are used for uncertainty propagation we also calculate the me univariate effect to obtain a global idea about the impact of the input parameters on the model output the me of a certain parameter represents the variability of the model output to this parameter when other parameters are kept constant at their average values the gsa results for the spatial distribution of the salt concentration are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7a shows the distribution of the mean concentration based on the pce expansion at each node of the mesh used for the control points the mean value of the salt concentration is calculated as the arithmetic average of the concentrations corresponding to the 100 samples used in the experimental design which are evaluated via the pce surrogate model this figure shows that the mean concentration distribution reflects the systematic behavior of swi the isochlors are more penetrated at the bottom aquifer due to the saltwater density this confirms that the pce surrogate model mimics the full model s response we also calculate the concentration variance to evaluate how far the concentrations are spread out form their average values fig 7b as expected the variance is significant in the saltwater wedge the largest values are located near the aquifer bottom surface where the swi is usually induced by mixing processes that can be highly sensitive to the model inputs fracture characteristics and matrix dispersivity the variance is negligible near the sea side as the boundary conditions are almost deterministic and the sole acting random parameter is the longitudinal dispersivity that can affect the dispersive entering flux the sensitivity of the concertation distribution to the uncertain parameters is assessed with the maps of the total si fig 7c g the total si of α l m fig 7c shows that the uncertainty related to this parameter affects the concentration distribution at the top aquifer outside the saltwater wedge in this zone the salt transport processes are dominated by the longitudinal dispersion flux as the velocity is toward the sea and it is almost horizontal and parallel to the salt concentration gradient the zones of largest total si for k f and e f are located within the saltwater wedge toward the low isochlors fig 7d and e in this region the mass transfer is mainly related to the advection process which is related to the velocity field this later is highly depending on the fracture permeability and aperture the zone of influence of d f is also located within the saltwater wedge but toward the aquifer bottom surface and at the vicinity of the high isochlors fig 7f the influence of α l f is limited to the vicinity of the sea boundary where α l f can impact the saltwater flux to the aquifer fig 7g in the fracture advection is dominating and dispersion is negligible it is worthwhile noting that the total sis count in the overall contribution of a parameter including nonlinearities and interactions thus sis allow for ranking the parameters according to their importance it appears on fig 7 that d f kf and ef are the most influential parameters because their total si are more pronounced in the region where the salt concentration variance is maximum from the scales of fig 7 d f it is clear that kf and ef are more influential than d f fig 7c shows that the salinity distribution is weakly sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity of the matrix as in its zone of influence the variance is negligible inspection of the sensitivity of swi metrics to uncertain parameters is given in fig 8 this figure represents the bar plots of the total and first order sis of the swi metrics as mentioned previously for a further understanding of the uncertainty on swi metrics related to the imperfect knowledge of input parameters we also investigate the mes of the most relevant parameters these mes are plotted in fig 9 the large variability of the swi metrics see vertical scales in fig 9a j confirms that the mes are in agreement with the sis fig 8a shows that the uncertainty on l toe is mainly due to the effects of d f and k f with a total si of 0 54 d f is considered as the most influential parameter the me of d f and k f on l toe are given in fig 9a and 9b respectively fig 9a shows that l toe decreases with d f which is coherent with the results of sebben et al 2015 fig 9b shows that l toe increases with k f the physical interpretation of this variation is that the increase of k f heightens the potential of the fracture to constitute a preferential freshwater flow path this slow down the freshwater flow in the matrix which in turn facilitates swi and leads to the increase of the penetration length of the saltwater wedge fig 8b indicates that the variability of l s is mainly impacted by α l m this makes sense as l s measures the salinity dispersion along the aquifer bottom surface which is mainly controlled by α l m l s is even expected to increase with α l m which is confirmed from the me in fig 9c we can also notice in fig 8b the slight sensitivity of l s to d f the corresponding me fig 9d shows that this sensitivity is relatively important for deep fractures d f 0 6 the sis for w mz are given in fig 8c the width of the mixing zone is mainly controlled by the dispersive flux this is why α l m is the main parameter affecting w mz as expected increasing variation of w mz against α l m can be observed in fig 9e for z i fig 8d with a total si of 0 58 d f is the most important parameter fig 9f shows that z i decreases with d f which is in agreement with the results of sebben et al 2015 variability of z i could be also affected by the uncertainty of k f the corresponding me in fig 9g shows that z i increases with k f fig 8e depicts the sis for the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s it indicates that m s is primarily sensitive to d f si 0 62 it is also sensitive to k f me fig 9h shows that m s decreases with d f which is also consistent with the results sebben et al 2015 m s increases with k f fig 9i this behavior is related to fact that the increase of k f enhances the inland extent of the saltwater wedge as explained in the previous section finally the sis for q s total shows that this output is mainly affected by d f fig 8f as show in fig 9j q s total increases with d f in general the sis show that the uncertainty associated with α l f has no effect on the swi metrics which is logical as salt transport in the fracture is dominated by the advection processes 5 2 the network of orthogonal fractures configuration nof in this configuration our goal is to investigate the effect of uncertainty related to the fractures density on the model outputs thus we keep the same uncertain parameters as for the shf configuration but we replace d f by δ f the latter is considered here as the parameter representing the fracture density the values of the deterministic parameters and the range of variability of the uncertain inputs are given in table 3 the lowest value of δ f corresponds to a network with 13 horizontal and 26 vertical fractures these values are used to obtain the results in affordable cpu time as denser fractured configurations would require a large number of simulations to construct the pce and the comsol model in this case becomes very cpu time consuming we should mention that for this configuration we reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures if the same values would have been used as in shf configuration freshwater flow would have been so intensive that no swi would occur 5 2 1 pce construction numerical details orders and accuracy the nof configuration is more sensitive to the fractures characteristics than shf configuration the number of samples is progressively increased until obtaining accurate pces the corresponding experimental design involves 200 samples the mesh sensitivity analysis for the most challenging cases the smallest value of δ f reveals that mesh independent solution can be obtained using a grid of 70 000 elements as for the shf configuration sparse and total pce are calculated with 200 samples order 4 total pce can be obtained the optimal number of samples is 126 with the sparse technique sixth order polynomial is reached for l toe m s z i and q s total for l s and w mz orders 4 and 8 are achieved respectively fig 10 shows some comparisons between the sparse pce surrogate and comsol models and highlights the accuracy of the pce expansions a good matching is observed both for the input parameters of the experimental design and for new samples it is relevant to emphasize that this level of accuracy is acceptable to obtain good gsa results with the sis evaluated using the surrogate model 5 2 2 uncertainty propagation and marginal effects the distribution of the mean concentration based on the pce expansion is given in fig 11 a the mean pce isochlors emulate the ones obtained using the physical model fig 12 they present some discontinuous points where saltwater is pushed toward the sea due to high permeability in the fractures the spatial map of the concentration variance is plotted in fig 11b compared to the shf configuration the zone of significant variance is contracted and concentrated toward the bottom surface of the aquifer near the low mean isochlors the map of the total sis of α l m fig 11 c is quite similar to the one in the shf configuration but it echoes the presence and influence of fracture network fig 11c shows that the zone of influence of α l m falls where the concentration variance is negligible thus α l m is not an important parameter for salinity distribution sensitivity to k f and e f are both important fig 11d and e the zone of influence of k f is discontinuous and mainly located toward the sea boundary in at the bottom of the aquifer important values can be observed landward see fig 11 d but these values do not express high sensitivity as the concentration variance is negligible in this zone the sensitivity to the fractures density δ f is given in fig 11f this figure shows that uncertainty associated δ f can mainly affect the salinity distribution within the mixing zone toward the bottom surface it confirms that δ f is an influential parameter finally and in contrast to the shf configuration α l f appears to be an important parameter in the nof configuration fig 11g it affects mainly salinity distribution around the low isochlors the bar plots in fig 13 depict the total and first order sis for the swi metrics to the uncertain parameters and fig 14 gives the mes of these parameters in general fig 14 confirms the results of the sis as large variations of swi metrics can be observed with respect to the uncertain parameters fig 13a demonstrates that l toe is mainly controlled by k f and δ f the corresponding total sis are s k f t 0 52 and s δ f t 0 32 respectively fig 14a shows an increasing variation of l toe against k f as for the shf configuration this is related to the fact that the increase of k f concentrates the freshwater flow in the fractures and entails a weaker freshwater flow in the matrix as consequence the saltwater wedge expands landward and l toe increases this behavior can be understood also using the equivalent porous media model which is based on a bulk hydraulic conductivity as given in sebben et al 2015 the bulk equivalent conductivity k eq for a network of orthogonal fractures is given by 20 k eq k m k f e f δ f 1 e f k f δ f 1 eq 20 shows that k eq increases with the increase of k f the equivalent gravity number which compares the buoyancy forces to the inland freshwater flux is given by fahs et al 2018 21 n g eq k eq h ρ 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 q d the increase of k eq leads to the increase of n g eq this latter can be interpreted at constant densities and hydraulic conductivity as a decrease in the inland freshwater that opposes swi this enhances the extend of swi and leads to the increase of l toe fig 14b shows that l toe decreases with δ f in fact the increase of δ f corresponds to the reduction of the fracture density this enhances the freshwater flow in the porous matrix and pushes the saltwater wedge toward the sea the equivalent bulk hydraulic conductivity model can be also useful in explaining this variation by reasoning in the same way as for the variation of l toe against k f as it is clear from eq 20 the increase of δ f for the average value of k m k f and e f corresponds to a decrease in k eq and the related equivalent gravity number this can be interpreted as an increase of the freshwater flux that lowers the extent of swi and decreases l toe the bar plots in fig 13b and 13c indicate that as for the shf configuration α l m is the most important parameter affecting l s and w mz the corresponding sis are calculated to be 0 68 and 0 34 respectively fig 14c and d display increasing variation of l s and w mz against α l m this makes sense as l s and w mz are mainly related to the mixing processes which are controlled by α l m fig 13d shows that with s k f t 0 50 and s δ f t 0 27 k f and δ f are the most important parameters affecting z i mes in fig 14e and f indicate that z i increases with k f and decreases with δ f the reason behind these variations is the enhancement resp reduction in the saltwater wedge extent associated with the variation of k f resp δ f explained previously these results related to the variation of z i against δ f are found to be in agreement with those in sebben et al 2015 the dimensionless mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s appears to be sensitive to all uncertain parameters except α l f fig 13e the total sis with respect α l m k f e f δ f are calculated to be 0 34 0 41 0 22 and 0 27 respectively the mes show that m s decreases with δ f and increases with k f and α l m fig 14g i the variation against δ f and k f is related to the behavior of the saltwater wedge when these parameters change see above the increase of α l m pushes the saltwater wedge landward fahs et al 2018 and increases the area of the salted zone as well as the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total is mainly affected by α l m k f fig 13f the total sis of these parameters are calculated to be 0 43 and 0 42 respectively the mes fig 14j and k show that q s total increases with α l m and decreases with k f indeed q s total is advective and dispersive saltwater flux at the sea boundary the dispersive flux is proportional to α l m this explains why q s total increases with α l m the increase of k f corresponds to the decrease of the gravity number see above a lower gravity number indicates less significant effect of the buoyancy forces for which the saltwater velocity decreases and reduces the advective saltwater flux finally it is worth noting that for the nof configuration the sis for α l f are more important than for the shf configuration α l f appears to be an important parameter especially for l toe and l s in general physical consistency of the results for both shf and nof configuration provides insight on the validity of our analysis based on the pce as a meta model 6 conclusion in this work the dfn model is coupled with the vdf model to simulate swi in fcas the dfn vdf model requires the discontinuous description of the fracture characteristics which are usually uncertain thus it is essential for several practical and theoretical purposes to understand quantify how the uncertainties associated with the imperfect knowledge of the fracture characteristics can propagate through the model and introduce uncertainties into the model outputs despite the high performance of computer codes for swi models run time of these codes is still high because of the high nonlinearity dense grids required for fractures and large space and time scales associated with studied domains thus the traditional techniques for uncertainty analysis i e monte carlo simulations cannot be easily applied in this context as they require a large number of simulations to achieve reliable results to meet the computational challenges of traditional techniques we develop in this work a gsa based on the non intrusive pce in particular we apply an efficient sparse technique to construct the pce with a reduced number of model evaluations based on kashyap information criterion in the literature gsa has been recently applied to swi but previous studies are limited to homogeneous domain two configurations of the fractured henry problem dealing with a single horizontal fracture shf and a network of orthogonal fractures nof are considered as conceptual models the simulations required to construct the pce are performed using a finite element model developed in the framework of comsol software boussinesq approximation is implemented to improve the computational efficiency of the comsol model from technical point of view this work shows several novelties that are important for the simulation of swi it shows the ability of comsol to accurately simulate swi in simple and fractured aquifers it also proves that the dimension reduction of fractures in the frame of the dfn model is a valid approach to simulate swi in fcas and confirms the validity of the boussinesq approximation in such a case regarding uncertainty analysis this study presents an efficient low cost methodology to understand uncertainty propagation into swi models this methodology is generic and can be efficiently applied to real field investigations in hydrogeological applications gsa is often applied to investigate uncertainty propagation associated with hydrogeological parameters this work shows that gsa is generic and can be a valuable tool for different kinds of uncertainties the gsa results showed that for the shf configuration the uncertainty associated with the fracture hydraulic conductivity and depth is the first sources of uncertainty on the salinity distribution the spatial distributions of the sis are given as maps this represents an important feature of this study as these maps are not only important for uncertainty analysis but also provide relevant locations for measurement required for aquifer characterization fracture hydraulic conductivity and depth are also important parameters for the toe position l toe thickness of the freshwater discharge zone z i the mass of salt persisting in the aquifer m s and the flux of saltwater entering the aquifer q s total the thickness of the saltwater wedge and the width of the mixing zone are mainly controlled by the dispersion coefficient in the matrix the uncertainty related to the fracture aperture has a slight impact on the swi metrics its major effect is observed on l toe uncertainty associated with the fracture dispersion coefficient does not affect in any way the swi metrics for the nof configuration the imperfect knowledge of fracture hydraulic conductivity and density are the first source of uncertainty of the salinity distribution however it is observed that all the uncertain parameters become important for the salinity distribution in this case in contrast to the shf configuration in which the dispersion in the fracture is not important in the nof configuration the salinity distribution at the aquifer top surface is influenced by this fracture dispersivity l toe and z i are mainly controlled by the fractures density and hydraulic conductivity as for the shf configuration the width of the mixing zone is mainly affected by uncertainty associated with the dispersion coefficient in the matrix l s is also majorly affected by the dispersion coefficient in the matrix but the other uncertain parameters are also influencing it all the uncertain parameters have distributed effects on m s and q s total conflicts of interest none acknowledgments behzad ataie
