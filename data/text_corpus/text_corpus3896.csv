19480,wastewater treatment systems receiving municipal wastewater are major dissemination nodes of antibiotic resistance genes args between anthropogenic and natural environments this study examined the fate of antibiotic resistome and class 1 3 integron integrase genes in photobioreactors that were treating municipal wastewater diluted 70 30 with lake or tap water for the algal biomass production a combined approach of metagenomic and quantitative qpcr analysis was undertaken municipal wastewater treatment in the photobioreactors led to reduced antibiotic resistome proportion number of arg subtypes and abundances of individual args in the bacterial community the args and inti1 gene abundances and relative abundances in the discharges of the photobioreactors were either comparable or lower than the respective values in the effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants the reduction of the resistome proved to be strongly related to the changes in the bacterial community composition during the wastewater treatment process as it was responding to rising ph levels caused by intense algal growth several bacterial genera e g azoarcus dechloromonas and sulfuritalea were recognized as potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types although the lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome and inti genes profile to the treatment system it proved to be considerably more beneficial for wastewater dilution than the tap water the diversity number of detected resistance types and subtypes and proportion of the antibiotic resistome the amount of plasmid borne integron integrase gene reads and the abundances and relative abundances of the majority of quantified args aada sul1 tetq tetw qnrs ermb blaoxa2 type and inti1 gene as well as the amount of multi resistance determinants were significantly lower in the discharges of photobioreactors where lake water was used to dilute wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords photobioreactors wastewater treatment antibiotic resistome integron integrase genes 1 introduction among numerous environmental social and economic problems contemporary society is facing the challenges related to energy production and waste management in this context technologies combining microalgal biomass production for various applications e g production of bioenergy fertilizers animal feed with wastewater treatment have been shown to be promising approaches reviewed by gonçalves et al 2017 guldhe et al 2017 the production of microalgal biomass requires large amounts of water and nutrients which are readily available in wastewater these systems called photobioreactors have proved to be economically feasible since algal growth enhances the removal of nutrients and reduces the amount of energy needed for wastewater oxygenation quijano et al 2017 organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous content and n p molar ratio make domestic municipal and agricultural wastewater the best fit for photobioreactors gonçalves et al 2017 although these wastewaters can contain a plethora of harmful materials such as heavy metals petroleum hydrocarbons pesticides pharmaceuticals nanomaterials and personal care products a rich and diverse indigenous microbial community is reported in systems where wastewater is not sterilized before use in photobioreactors unnithan et al 2014 it has been shown that the growth of microalgal bacterial consortium can be promoted by diluting high strength wastewaters e g agricultural or industrial wastewaters with excess nutrient concentrations with freshwater or with low nutrient wastewater guldhe et al 2017 nutrient uptake in photobioreactors is often enhanced by the co operation of microalgae and bacteria microalgae use carbon dioxide produced by bacteria during organic matter degradation and provide aerobic bacteria with oxygen produced in photosynthesis fouilland 2012 albeit competitive interactions can also occur natrah et al 2014 the use of such microalgal bacterial consortia is thought to be beneficial for wastewater treatment as it is a robust biological system that can operate under different environmental conditions and nutrient loads fouilland 2012 while the fate of major nutrients in microalgal bacterial wastewater treatment systems is quite well established reviewed by gonçalves et al 2017 guldhe et al 2017 there is considerably less information about the fate of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals rühmland et al 2015 hormones hom diaz et al 2015 nanomaterials or antibiotic resistance determinants antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs antibiotic resistance genes args in particular the emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a global health concern of the 21st century who 2014 municipal agricultural and hospital wastewaters in particular are characterized by high abundances of antibiotic resistance determinants sharma et al 2016 wastewater treatment systems have been recognized as hotspots for arbs and args acting as reservoirs horizontal gene transfer stations and dissemination nodes between anthropogenic and natural environments karkman et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 although the resistomes of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received due attention yang et al 2014 bengtsson palme et al 2016 the fate of antibiotic resistance determinants in microalgal bacterial wastewater treatment systems has remained unknown thus far the objective of this study was to evaluate the fate of args and class 1 3 integron integrase genes in photobioreactors

accession numbers 4547293 3 4547301 3 krustok et al 2015 2 4 quantitative pcr conditions and data analysis based on the metagenomic data table a 1 predominant args representing major antibiotic resistance types aada and aada9 encoding aminoglycoside resistance baca encoding bacitracin resistance ermb encoding macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance sul1 encoding sulfonamide resistance and teta tetq and tetw encoding tetracycline resistance and class 1 3 integron integrase genes inti1 inti2 inti3 were chosen as quantitative pcr qpcr targets as in most cases an incomplete set of genes encoding multidrug efflux complexes was detected from the metagenomes table a 1 they were omitted from quantification in order to confirm the absence of args that were not detected in metagenomic data qnrs gene encoding fluoroquinolone resistance and blaoxa 2 type genes encoding beta lactam resistance were also targeted using qpcr samples of initial wastewaters lake water and

factor qpcr v 2016 0 ruijter et al 2015 calculation of target gene abundance was performed through the estimation of fold difference between a sample and multiple data points from the standard curve as described previously nõlvak et al 2016 and presented as gene copy numbers per ml of analyzed water in addition all target genes were normalized against 16s rrna gene abundance reported in krustok et al 2015 to represent the relative abundance of target genes in the bacterial community of photobioreactors sporadically detected aada9 genes were summed with aada results in order to achieve a more profound estimation of aminoglycoside resistance encoded by the aada gene family the target gene reduction during the treatment process was calculated as the log removal log10 target gene abundance in influent target gene abundance in effluent 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out using statistica 10 0 program in all cases statistical significance was determined at 95 confidence level target gene abundances in the twr and lwr discharges were compared using unpaired two tailed t test pearson correlation coefficient was used to relate the target gene abundance and relative abundance dynamics in photobioreactors to the ph and chlorophyll a content statistically significant differences in target gene parameter dynamics between the twr and lwr treatments were estimated using repeated measures anova ranova the correspondence between the bacterial community structure and resistome in the photobioreactors was assessed using co inertia analysis dray et al 2003 the subset of arg types most strongly related to the bacterial community structure was selected using the random forest approach implemented in the r package boruta kursa and rudnicki 2010 relationships between arg types and bacterial genera were calculated using sparcc friedman and alm 2012 and correlation networks were visualized with cytoscape v 3 4 0 shannon et al 2003 prior to data analysis centered log ratio clr transformation was applied to the relative abundance values of args and bacterial genera data 3 results 3 1 the profile of resistome and integron integrase genes in utilized water 3 1 1 wastewater assembled contigs included 31 33 of plasmid and 0 045 0 060 of class 1 3 integron integrase sequences in the wastewater samples wwt and wwl of both experiments table 1 as much as 78 80 of the inti1 inti2 and inti3 gene reads were affiliated with plasmid sequences of these samples at the same time quantification of these genes revealed that their abundance and relative abundance in microbial community were up to an order of magnitude lower in wwl compared to wwt table 2 contrary to very similar proportions of inti reads obtained from wastewater contigs table 1 the qpcr results revealed that inti1 gene was up to 38 times more dominant with up to four orders of magnitude higher abundances as compared to inti2 and inti3 respectively table 2 based on metagenomic data both wastewater samples were characterized by similar total proportions of args in the bacterial communities 0 188 and 0 181 for wwt and wwl respectively as well as similar patterns of resistance types dominated by bacitracin multidrug and tetracycline resistance determinants fig 1 fig a 1 slightly fewer antibiotic resistance types and arg subtypes were detected from wwl when compared to wwt 14 vs 16 types and 118 vs 132 subtypes respectively from the metagenomes all args except for aada9 targeted with qpcr were present in the wastewater of both experimental setups except for aada teta and tetq lower arg abundances and relative abundances were recorded in wwl as compared to wwt table 2 sul1 ermb and tetw were the most numerous args abundances up to 106 copies ml table 2a and relative abundances of about 10 3 table 2b notably baca a very prominent gene according to metagenomic data table a 1 was detected only at low abundances with qpcr around 360 to 370 copies ml table 2a on the contrary albeit the metagenomic data did not show the presence of qnrs in the wastewater samples qpcr indicated the presence of substantial amounts 104 105 copies ml of this gene in wastewater the pattern of multidrug transporter systems in wastewater was also similar at both experimental times fig a 2 genes belonging to the resistance nodulation division rnd family of multidrug efflux transporters formed a predominant group followed by the genes encoding the major facilitator superfamily mfs of multidrug resistance pumps 3 1 2 lake water the proportions of plasmid and class 1 3 integron integrase gene sequences in assembled contigs of lw were lower compared to wwt and wwl table 1 in lw 58 64 of all detected inti gene reads were affiliated to plasmid sequences table 1 one inti1 to at least two inti2 inti3 orders of magnitude lower abundances of inti genes were detected in lw as compared to the wastewaters by qpcr analysis table 2a however lw was characterized by the highest inti1 relative abundance of all water samples table 2b the lw resistome was characterized by a slightly lower proportion of args in microbial community 0 157 and fewer resistance types 12 as compared to the wastewater samples bacitracin multidrug and trimethoprim resistance types dominated in lw fig 1 fig a 1 as a major difference from wastewater samples lw sported considerably fewer arg subtypes 49 and a very limited tetracycline resistance capacity all args targeted by qpcr except for aada9 were found in lw with sul1 and baca being the most and the least abundant respectively table 2a in general the arg abundances were in the range of 102 104 copies ml in lw which was two to three orders of magnitude lower as compared to wastewater samples table 2a in addition sul1 relative abundance was high in lw at the level of 10 2 while the rest of arg relative abundances remained inferior to wastewater samples table 2b similarly to wastewaters lw was characterized by incomplete gene combinations encoding multidrug resistance complexes table a 1 rnd family was found to be predominant followed by the atp binding cassette abc superfamily fig a 2 3 2 the effect of treatment on the fate of resistome and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors 3 2 1 the effect on resistome the results of the metagenomic analyses showed that the treatment of municipal wastewater in photobioreactors led to the reduction of resistome proportion 0 125 and 0 051 in twrs and lwrs discharge respectively in the bacterial community fig 1 the proportion of antibiotic resistance determinants in the bacterial community decreased 1 5 and 3 4 fold during the time course of twrs and lwrs respectively although present in the initial wastewater the fosfomycin kasugamycin polymyxin trimethoprim and vancomycin resistance types were not detectable in lwr discharge the fosfomycin and kasugamycin resistance types were not detectable in twrs discharge table a 1 in addition in the lwr treatment the β lactam and chloramphenicol resistance types were detected only in the lwr3 discharge table a 1 of the detected major resistance types the proportion of tetracycline resistance showed the highest reduction during the course of the treatment fig 1 the number of detected arg subtypes were reduced 3 3 and 4 9 fold during the performance of twrs and lwrs respectively the biggest difference was recorded for the numbers of β lactam mfs type multidrug transporters tetracycline and mls resistance specific subtypes table a 1 the reduction of the number of arg subtypes in lwr1 and lwr2 reactors was as high as 7 1 fold during the time course the multiresistance determinants in the parallel photobioreactors of each treatment varied greatly fig a 2 in general the proportion of genes belonging to the rnd family decreased substantially except for twr2 but still formed the most dominant family in all reactor discharges the members of the abc superfamily followed the rnd family and its proportion increased in all twrs the proportion of the mfs family decreased during both treatments but the change was significantly greater t test p 0 05 in twrs in addition lwr1 and lwr2 also showed substantially reduced rnd family proportion in reactor discharge as compared to the source water fig a 2 arg subtypes belonging to rnd family also accounted for half of the persistent gene subtypes detected in the photobioreactor discharges table a 1 but the majority of gene combinations encoding functional multidrug resistance complexes remained incomplete the qpcr results showed the reduction of both arg abundances and relative abundances in photobioreactors through the treatment process fig 2 fig a 3 due to the args profile in wwl and lw table 2 the starting abundances of args were mostly higher except for teta in twrs compared to lwrs however a substantial decrease in the abundances of most args except for sul1 and teta was recorded in twrs already by day 4 of the experiment fig 2a d g h qnrs abundance dropped below the value of loq after day 8 fig 2d the abundances of args continued to decrease throughout the treatment showing over 2 log reduction and reaching to the 1 level of the day 0 abundance in the case of blaoxa2 type tetq tetw and ermb genes in twr discharges fig 2b c g h the abundances of sul1 teta and aada genes decreased less 0 25 1 14 log reductions and reached to 56 14 and 7 levels of the day 0 abundances in twr discharges respectively fig 2a e f apart from sul1 all the abundances of targeted args remained at the level of 102 104 copies ml in twrs discharge the majority of arg abundances and relative abundances also showed continuous decrease in lwrs during the treatment fig 2cdfgh fig a 3 the abundances of the aada blaoxa2 type and sul1 genes increased during the first four days of the treatment followed by a substantial decrease fig 2abe the ranova analysis revealed significant differences in the dynamics of several arg abundances between the treatments fig 2a b e h the abundances of qnrs and tetq genes dropped quickly within the first four days and were close to or below the loq during the second half of the lwrs performance fig 2d g the abundances and relative abundances of all args except teta detectable until the end of the experiment were significantly lower in discharges of lwrs as compared to twr discharges fig 2 fig a 3 moreover a greater capacity of arg removal log removal for the majority of quantified genes was recorded in lwrs compared to twrs apart from sul1 all abundances of targeted args were at the level of 102 103 copies ml in lwr discharges opposed to twrs lwrs treatment showed more uniform capability to reduce args abundances as all targeted args reached the 6 level of day 0 abundance in lwr discharges albeit the quantification results mostly agree well with metagenomic results two notable exceptions were recorded the metagenome analysis indicated that the baca gene encoding bacitracin resistance and the aada9 gene encoding aminoglycoside resistance were very prominent in the resistomes of all input waters of both treatments and in the reactors discharges table a 1 upon qpcr quantification the baca and aada9 genes proved to be marginal in these communities aada9 abundance remained below loq in all samples except for lwrs treatment on day 4 243 copies ml and baca abundance could be quantified only from the day 0 samples of both treatments 260 copies ml 3 2 2 the effect on inti genes the abundances of inti genes were lower on day 0 in lwrs compared to twrs fig 3 their abundances and relative abundances decreased throughout the performance of the photobioreactors except for inti3 between day 0 and 4 of both treatments fig 3 fig a 3a c the abundance of inti2 dropped quickly and stayed below loq from the eighth day of the reactors performance lwrs showed a greater capacity for inti1 removal while bigger log reduction of inti3 gene was recorded in twrs fig 3 according to ranova analysis the dynamics of inti1 and inti3 genes reduction were significantly different between twr and lwr treatments fig 3a c fig a 3a c as a result the lwrs had significantly lower p 0 01 inti genes abundances and relative abundances compared to twrs in their discharges 3 6 and 2 2 of the day 0 level in twrs and lwrs respectively fig 3 fig a 3a c the analysis of metagenomes matched with the quantification results and showed a substantial decrease in the numbers of inti gene reads and their proportions in contigs in both twrs and lwrs discharges compared to the input wastewaters table 1 moreover less plasmid and plasmid borne inti gene sequences were recorded in twrs and lwrs discharges compared to the input wastewaters table 1 and greater decrease rate of the aforementioned parameters in lwrs as compared to twrs was found 3 3 the relationships between resistome and bacterial community structure as well as the levels of ph and chlorophyll a in photobioreactors a very strong co variation between the resistome proportions of arg types and bacterial community structure on genus level was determined in photobioreactors using co inertia analysis rv 0 87 p 0 001 fig a 4 numerous significant positive correlations with proportions of arg types especially multidrug mls tetracycline and vancomycin types were recorded for genera azoarcus dechloromonas and sulfuritalea fig 4 table a 3 in addition several myxobacterial genera and genus caldilinea showed strong positive correlations with rifamycin resistance type present only in twrs fig 4 table a 3 at arg subtype level most significant correlations p 0 05 were recorded for multidrug resistance genes e g acrb adej adek bpef emrb mdtb mdtc mexf ompr as well as for vanr macb rosb and oxa 17 genes within the aforementioned genera table a 4 in lwrs ph increased throughout the treatment period and reached the value 10 6 in the effluent on day 16 krustok et al 2015 statistical analysis showed that ph significantly affected the resistome quantity in the photobioreactors this parameter was negatively correlated with inti1 teta tetw blaoxa2 type and aada abundances rp 0 91 0 95 p 0 05 and strong negative correlations were revealed also with sul1 and ermb abundances rp 0 97 p 0 01 in twrs ph remained relatively stable 6 28 0 88 during the treatment krustok et al 2015 and no correlations with args or inti genes abundances were recorded the chlorophyll a concentration an indicator for algal biomass growth increased in both treatments albeit the growth was significantly faster in lwrs krustok et al 2015 significant negative relationships between chlorophyll a concentration and abundances of inti1 teta and blaoxa2 type genes rp 0 90 0 99 p 0 05 were revealed in twrs in lwrs chlorophyll a was negatively related to the abundances of inti1 sul1 teta tetq blaoxa2 type aada genes rp 0 89 0 96 p 0 05 and strong negative correlations were also revealed with tetw and ermb abundances rp 0 97 0 98 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 antibiotic resistance in used waters in this study the fate of antibiotic resistome and class 1 3 integron integrase genes during municipal wastewater treatment in photobioreactors was assessed using a combined approach of metagenomic and quantitative analyses in order to harness the strengths of both methodologies and balance out their known weaknesses yang et al 2013 li et al 2015 metagenomic analysis enabled to obtain broad profiles of resistomes while qpcr contributed to the sensitivity and quantitative capacity of the study based on metagenomic data args from major antibiotic resistance types were chosen for quantification the results showed that the spectrum of selected target genes was very similar to those reported as prevalent args in different types of wastewater treatment systems e g activated sludge as wwtps aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors and in their final effluents li et al 2015 christgen et al 2015 karkman et al 2016 similarly to most wastewater treatment facilities the input municipal wastewater was a major source of args and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors of this study as expected the wastewater resistome composition resembled swedish wwtps influents bengtsson palme et al 2016 fig a 1 while showing considerably different resistance types proportions compared to geographically distant wwtps influents yang et al 2014 one of the factors causing this difference may be the variation in medication usage practices both sources of the municipal wastewaters used in this study were less concentrated than the majority of the previous studies report evidenced by smaller resistome proportion in microbial community yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 lower numbers of detected and persistent arg subtypes yang et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 and an equal or smaller abundances of args munir et al 2011 gao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 and inti genes wang et al 2017 this difference can be partly attributed to lower wwtp loads krustok et al 2015 as compared to the aforementioned studies the obtained arg abundances rather resembled the influents of small and medium scale wwtps chen and zhang 2013 and the resistome composition e g higher proportion of multidrug and bacitracin resistance types was also similar to communities of domestic wastewater christgen et al 2015 nevertheless the wastewaters used for algal growth proved to contain significant quantities of args associated with antibiotics that are used extensively in human or veterinary medicine the results indicate that a rich and diverse resistome as well as a considerable amount of inti genes were also present in the lake water used for wastewater dilution in lwrs experiment the lake water originated from a yacht harbor krustok et al 2015 and the proportions of resistome especially multidrug resistance subtypes in the microbial community were more similar to wwtps effluents than to slightly impacted natural waters li et al 2015 heavy human impact on this lake water was also apparent in quantities of args which were comparable to wwtps effluents reported previously munir et al 2011 laht et al 2014 berglund et al 2015 in addition we found that two genes sul1 and inti1 suggested as prominent markers of anthropogenic influence gillings et al 2015 yang et al 2014 had the highest relative abundances in lake water microbial communities clearly surpassing the respective relative abundances in the used wastewaters consequently even though from nutrients aspect the lake water can be considered as diluent krustok et al 2015 it considerably affected the amount and composition of resistome and inti genes in the mixed lwrs input water lwr day 0 4 2 impact of photobioreactor treatment on antibiotic resistome our results indicate a substantial decrease of the resistome proportion as well as the number of args subtypes including persistent arg subtypes during the treatment of municipal wastewater in photobioreactors especially in lwrs the reduction rates were comparable or higher in case of lwrs than previously reported reduction rates in as wwtps yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 and anaerobic bioreactors christgen et al 2015 while closely resembling anaerobic aerobic treatment reactors utilizing domestic wastewater christgen et al 2015 the abundances of args in the photobioreactors discharges indicated that the reduction of args abundance during wastewater treatment was at the similar range 1 3 log reductions to those in many as wwtps laht et al 2014 gao et al 2012 chen and zhang 2013 mao et al 2015 oxidation ditches chen and zhang 2013 and constructed wetlands nõlvak et al 2013 but inferior to the membrane biological reactors munir et al 2011 while the reduction of resistance determinants in as wwtps laht et al 2014 gao et al 2012 mao et al 2015 and constructed wetlands fang et al 2017 is generally related to the reduction of the total bacterial load the results suggest a different resistome reduction mechanism in the photobioreactors the reduction rates of args and inti genes clearly surpassed the marginal around 0 3 logs decreases of bacterial loads indicated by the changes of 16s rrna abundances in analyzed water krustok et al 2015 lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome as well as inti genes to the treatment system that reflected in an initial increase for some of the gene abundances during the first days of the treatment the results of a previous study showed that the addition of lake water to the photobioreactors positively affected the structure of algal bacterial consortium and promoted algal growth in lwrs krustok et al 2015 this study revealed a higher reduction capacity generally by an order of magnitude of args and inti1 genes in lwrs as compared to the tap water application the results showed strong association between the reduction of resistome and changes in bacterial community composition enhanced resistome and inti1 genes reduction in lwrs can thus be largely attributed to the more pronounced shift in bacterial community composition significantly affected by elevated ph level as a result of intense algal growth during the course of treatment process krustok et al 2015 notably in the two lwrs showing highest algal growth krustok et al 2015 the resistome reduction was so substantial that the resistomes of the reactor discharges were more similar to slightly impacted environments than to the effluents of wastewater treatment systems li et al 2015 or even to the lake water used in this study the latter showcases an additional benefit of lwrs that enables to simultaneously reduce the resistome of municipal wastewaters and natural waters with a strong anthropogenic impact the co occurrence pattern between antibiotic resistance types and microbial taxa revealed by the network analysis suggested several bacterial genera e g azoarcus dechloromonas sulfuritalea to be potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types especially multidrug mls tetracycline and vancomycin resistance determinants dechloromonas and azoarcus genera have been shown as potential arg hosts in wastewaters and activated sludge guo et al 2017 in addition sulfuritalea has been shown to carry tetracycline resistance huang et al 2014 as the decrease of these relatively little studied in respect to antibiotic resistance taxa have the highest impact on the reduction of resistome in photobioreactors the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of these genera and the exact relationships with algal growth merits further research persistence of numerous arg subtypes in the systems is a well recognized problem in wastewater treatment yang et al 2014 and this proved to be a critical issue also in the photobioreactors in the present study we detected several persistent genes e g aada sul1 teta that expressed lowest log removals and were also prominent representatives of their resistance types these args have been found enriched in freshwater sediments downstream of wwtps berglund et al 2015 czekalski et al 2014 once again the lwrs proved to be more efficient than twrs in the removal of these persistent args for example sul1 that is often found in inti1 gene cassettes chen and zhang 2013 deng et al 2015 was the most persistent of the args quantified in this study yet its reduction rate in lwr treatment was either comparable to as wwtps gao et al 2012 chen and zhang 2013 or even surpassed the removal efficiencies recorded in the previously mentioned systems yang et al 2014 czekalski et al 2012 and anaerobic aerobic reactors christgen et al 2015 moreover while the relative abundances of sul1 genes have commonly remained stable or have even increased during wastewater treatment gao et al 2012 czekalski et al 2012 laht et al 2014 yang et al 2014 lwrs showed steady decrease of sul1 relative abundances in general similarly to other wastewater treatment facilities yang et al 2014 christgen et al 2015 we recorded a steady decrease in the proportion of tetracycline resistance type during the performance of photobioreactors mainly owing to good reduction efficiency of the genes tetq tetw associated with human and livestock feaces li et al 2015 however such decrease was not universal to all tetracycline arg subtypes as illustrated by high persistence of teta the reduction of aada gene a prominent and persistent representative of aminoglycoside resistance family which is often associated with inti1 and inti2 gene cassettes deng et al 2015 was more efficient in lwrs 4 3 multidrug resistance and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors the prevalence and persistence of multidrug resistant bacteria during wastewater treatment have been recognized as a serious public health concern czekalski et al 2012 similarly to conventional wwtps yang et al 2014 the amount of genetic multi resistance determinants decreased during wastewater treatment in photobioreactors however a slight rise in the proportion of multidrug resistance genes in the resistomes of photobioreactor discharges was recorded compared to the initial wastewaters a similar tendency has been reported in operationally comparable aerobic and anaerobic aerobic treatment reactors christgen et al 2015 pointing to the possibility that selection towards multi resistance might be a weakness of these types of treatment systems as multidrug efflux complexes are able to extrude a wide variety of compounds besides antibiotics e g heavy metals toxic plant metabolites and signaling molecules blanco et al 2016 their proportional increase in photobioreactors during the treatment process may be related to bacterial strategy for protection against toxic algal metabolites args especially multidrug resistance determinants are spread with mobile genetic elements e g plasmids transposons insertion sequences and integrons through horizontal gene transfer among different species this has been pointed out as the main public health hazard of wastewater treatment systems rizzo et al 2013 integron integrase genes have also been found to be enriched in sediments downstream of wwtps karkman et al 2016 in this respect the performance of photobioreactors especially lwrs is encouraging as both the amount of plasmid reads and especially the amount and proportion of integron integrase gene sequences were reduced during this treatment the most substantial reduction during wastewater treatment was recorded for plasmid borne integron integrase gene reads this refers to the reduction of the transfer risk of these natural gene capture and assembly platforms that often house multiple args in one cassette deng et al 2015 the initial water samples from the photobioreactors showed somewhat higher inti1 inti2 and inti3 gene relative abundance than detected in some wwtps influents however the reduction efficiency in photobioreactors was greater and as a result lower abundances and relative abundances of inti genes were detected in photobioreactor discharges compared to conventional wwtps wang et al 2017 4 4 methodological aspects related to the evaluation of antibiotic resistance similarly to other studies utilizing the same metagenomic data analysis pipeline yang et al 2013 2014 2016 christgen et al 2015 li et al 2015 bacitracin resistance was one of the most prominent and persistent antibiotic resistance types however the quantification of the prevalent baca gene did not confirm its high abundance in this study application of qpcr can have several well known pitfalls e g primer coverage and quality inhibition low amplification efficiency yang et al 2013 however in this case eight different primer pair combinations coupled with a rigorous assay optimization procedure were tested data not shown with no improvement in measured concentrations baca has considerably more reference sequences in the args oap reference database as compared to any other arg subtype yang et al 2016 it has been suggested that such genes may have increased detection potential compared to args with few reference sequences nesme et al 2014 so far we conclude that bacitracin resistance proportion and abundance estimation and interpretation using this workflow remain inconclusive and need further verification we did not find complete multidrug resistance efflux complexes from the metagenomic data however as illustrated by the example of the qnrs gene in this study the lack of detection in metagenomic data does not necessarily translate to the absence of a gene there is a great probability that a full multi resistance profile was not achieved with the metagenomic analysis in this study the complex problem of multi resistance coupled with technical and methodological aspects highlights the need for further in depth investigation preferably simultaneously harnessing several techniques to avoid technical bias and to give a comprehensive view on this critical subject 5 conclusions the photobioreactors proved to be at least as effective or in the case of lake water reactors even more efficient in controlling antibiotic resistance dissemination through treated municipal wastewater to natural environments as compared to conventional wwtps the reduction of resistome was strongly related to the changes in the bacterial community composition during wastewater treatment process responding to rising ph levels caused by intense algal growth bacterial genera azoarcus dechloromonas and sulfuritalea were recognized as potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types although lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome and inti genes profile to the treatment

photobioreactors wastewater treatment antibiotic resistome integron integrase genes 1 introduction among numerous environmental social and economic problems contemporary society is facing the challenges related to energy production and waste management in this context technologies combining microalgal biomass production for various applications e g production of bioenergy fertilizers animal feed with wastewater treatment have been shown to be promising approaches reviewed by gonçalves et al 2017 guldhe et al 2017 the production of microalgal biomass requires large amounts of water and nutrients which are readily available in wastewater these systems called photobioreactors have proved to be economically feasible since algal growth enhances the removal of nutrients and reduces the amount of energy needed for wastewater oxygenation quijano et al 2017 organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous content and n p molar ratio make domestic municipal and agricultural wastewater the best fit for photobioreactors gonçalves et al 2017 although these wastewaters can contain a plethora of harmful materials such as heavy metals petroleum hydrocarbons pesticides pharmaceuticals nanomaterials and personal care products a rich and diverse indigenous microbial community is reported in systems where wastewater is not sterilized before use in photobioreactors unnithan et al 2014 it has been shown that the growth of microalgal bacterial consortium can be promoted by diluting high strength wastewaters e g agricultural or industrial wastewaters with excess nutrient concentrations with freshwater or with low nutrient wastewater guldhe et al 2017 nutrient uptake in photobioreactors is often enhanced by the co operation of microalgae and bacteria microalgae use carbon dioxide produced by bacteria during organic matter degradation and provide aerobic bacteria with oxygen produced in photosynthesis fouilland 2012 albeit competitive interactions can also occur natrah et al 2014 the use of such microalgal bacterial consortia is thought to be beneficial for wastewater treatment as it is a robust biological system that can operate under different environmental conditions and nutrient loads fouilland 2012 while the fate of major nutrients in microalgal bacterial wastewater treatment systems is quite well established reviewed by gonçalves et al 2017 guldhe et

municipal agricultural and hospital wastewaters in particular are characterized by high abundances of antibiotic resistance determinants sharma et al 2016 wastewater treatment systems have been recognized as hotspots for arbs and args acting as reservoirs horizontal gene transfer stations and dissemination nodes between anthropogenic and natural environments karkman et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 although the resistomes of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received due attention yang et al 2014 bengtsson palme et al 2016 the fate of antibiotic resistance determinants in microalgal bacterial wastewater treatment systems has remained unknown thus far the objective of this study was to evaluate the fate of args and class 1 3 integron integrase genes in photobioreactors

database plasmid sequences were determined from assembled contigs with kaiju using full plasmid sequences from refseq database as references all kaiju analyses were run in greedy mode allowing up to five mismatches in addition low complexity regions of query sequences were filtered out to avoid false positive matches caused by repeating patterns minimum match length and score were left as default

resistance types aada and aada9 encoding aminoglycoside resistance baca encoding bacitracin resistance ermb encoding macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance sul1 encoding sulfonamide resistance and teta tetq and tetw encoding tetracycline resistance and class 1 3 integron integrase genes inti1 inti2 inti3 were chosen as quantitative pcr qpcr targets as in most cases an incomplete set of genes encoding multidrug efflux complexes was detected from the metagenomes table a 1 they were omitted from quantification in order to confirm the absence of args that were not detected in metagenomic data qnrs gene encoding fluoroquinolone resistance and blaoxa 2 type genes encoding beta lactam resistance were also targeted using qpcr samples of initial wastewaters lake water and photobioreactor samples from day 0 4 8 12 and 16 were analyzed the qpcr assays were performed on rotorgene q applying rotorgene series software v 2 0 2 qiagen stock solutions of plasmids or synthetic double stranded dna fragments containing the target sequence eurofins mwg operon ebersberg germany were used to create serially diluted standard curves ranging from 6 to 108 copies for each target

factor qpcr v 2016 0 ruijter et al 2015 calculation of target gene abundance was performed through the estimation of fold difference between a sample and multiple data points from the standard curve as described previously nõlvak et al 2016 and presented as gene copy numbers per ml of analyzed water in addition all target genes were normalized against 16s rrna gene abundance reported in krustok et al 2015 to represent the relative abundance of target genes in the bacterial community of photobioreactors sporadically detected aada9 genes were summed with aada results in order to achieve a more profound estimation of aminoglycoside resistance encoded by the aada gene family the target gene reduction during the treatment process was calculated as the log removal log10 target gene abundance in influent target gene abundance in effluent 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out using statistica 10 0 program in all cases statistical significance was determined at 95 confidence level target gene abundances in the twr and lwr discharges were compared using unpaired two tailed t test pearson correlation coefficient was used to relate the target gene abundance and relative abundance dynamics in photobioreactors to the ph and chlorophyll a content statistically significant differences in target gene parameter dynamics between the twr and lwr treatments were estimated using repeated measures anova ranova the correspondence between the bacterial community structure and resistome in the photobioreactors was assessed using co inertia analysis dray et al 2003 the subset of arg types most strongly related to the bacterial community structure was selected using the random forest approach implemented in the r package boruta kursa and rudnicki 2010 relationships between arg types and bacterial genera were calculated using sparcc friedman and alm 2012 and correlation networks were visualized with cytoscape v 3 4 0 shannon et al 2003 prior to data analysis centered log ratio clr transformation was applied to the relative abundance values of args and bacterial genera data 3 results 3 1 the profile of resistome and integron integrase genes in utilized water 3 1 1 wastewater assembled contigs included 31 33 of plasmid and 0 045 0 060 of class 1 3 integron integrase sequences in the wastewater samples wwt and wwl of both experiments table 1 as much as 78 80 of the inti1 inti2 and inti3 gene reads were affiliated with plasmid sequences of these samples at the same time quantification of these genes revealed that their abundance and relative abundance in microbial community were up to an order of magnitude lower in wwl compared to wwt table 2 contrary to very similar proportions of inti reads obtained from wastewater contigs table 1 the qpcr results revealed that inti1 gene was up to 38 times more dominant with up to four orders of magnitude higher abundances as compared to inti2 and inti3 respectively table 2 based on metagenomic data both wastewater samples were characterized by similar total proportions of args in the bacterial communities 0 188 and 0 181 for wwt and wwl respectively as well as similar patterns of resistance types dominated by bacitracin multidrug and tetracycline resistance determinants fig 1 fig a 1 slightly fewer antibiotic resistance types and arg subtypes were detected from wwl when compared to wwt 14 vs 16 types and 118 vs 132 subtypes respectively from the metagenomes all args except for aada9 targeted with qpcr were present in the wastewater of both experimental setups except for aada teta and tetq lower arg abundances and relative abundances were recorded in wwl as compared to wwt table 2 sul1 ermb and tetw were the most numerous args abundances up to 106 copies ml table 2a and relative abundances of about 10 3 table 2b notably baca a very prominent gene according to metagenomic data table a 1 was detected only at low abundances with qpcr around 360 to 370 copies ml table 2a on the contrary albeit the metagenomic data did not show the presence of qnrs in the wastewater samples qpcr indicated the presence of substantial amounts 104 105 copies ml of this gene in wastewater the pattern of multidrug transporter systems in wastewater was also similar at both experimental times fig a 2 genes belonging to the resistance nodulation division rnd family of multidrug efflux transporters formed a predominant group followed by the genes encoding the major facilitator superfamily mfs of multidrug resistance pumps 3 1 2 lake water the proportions of plasmid and class 1 3 integron integrase gene sequences in assembled contigs of lw were lower compared to wwt and wwl table 1 in lw 58 64 of all detected inti gene reads were affiliated to plasmid sequences table 1 one inti1 to at least two inti2 inti3 orders of magnitude lower abundances of inti genes were detected in lw as compared to the wastewaters by qpcr analysis table 2a however lw was characterized by the highest inti1 relative abundance of all water samples table 2b the lw resistome was characterized by a slightly lower proportion of args in microbial community 0 157 and fewer resistance types 12 as compared to the wastewater samples bacitracin multidrug and trimethoprim resistance types dominated in lw fig 1 fig a 1 as a major difference from wastewater samples lw sported considerably fewer arg subtypes 49 and a very limited tetracycline resistance capacity all args targeted by qpcr except for aada9 were found in lw with sul1 and baca being the most and the least abundant respectively table 2a in general the arg abundances were in the range of 102 104 copies ml in lw which was two to three orders of magnitude lower as compared to wastewater samples table 2a in addition sul1 relative abundance was high in lw at the level of 10 2 while the rest of arg relative abundances remained inferior to wastewater samples table 2b similarly to wastewaters lw was characterized by incomplete gene combinations encoding multidrug resistance complexes table a 1 rnd family was found to be predominant followed by the atp binding cassette abc superfamily fig a 2 3 2 the effect of treatment on the fate of resistome and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors 3 2 1 the effect on resistome the results of the metagenomic analyses showed that the treatment of municipal wastewater in photobioreactors led to the reduction of resistome proportion 0 125 and 0 051 in twrs and lwrs discharge respectively in the bacterial community fig 1 the proportion of antibiotic resistance determinants in the bacterial community decreased 1 5 and 3 4 fold during the time course of twrs and lwrs respectively although present in the initial wastewater the fosfomycin kasugamycin polymyxin trimethoprim and vancomycin resistance types were not detectable in lwr discharge the fosfomycin and kasugamycin resistance types were not detectable in twrs discharge table a 1 in addition in the lwr treatment the β lactam and chloramphenicol resistance types were detected only in the lwr3 discharge table a 1 of the detected major resistance types the proportion of tetracycline resistance showed the highest reduction during the course of the treatment fig 1 the number of detected arg subtypes were reduced 3 3 and 4 9 fold during the performance of twrs and lwrs respectively the biggest difference was recorded for the numbers of β lactam mfs type multidrug transporters tetracycline and mls resistance specific subtypes table a 1 the reduction of the number of arg subtypes in lwr1 and lwr2 reactors was as high as 7 1 fold during the time course the multiresistance determinants in the parallel photobioreactors of each treatment varied greatly fig a 2 in general the proportion of genes belonging to the rnd family decreased substantially except for twr2 but still formed the most dominant family in all reactor discharges the members of the abc superfamily followed the rnd family and its proportion increased in all twrs the proportion of the mfs family decreased during both treatments but the change was significantly greater t test p 0 05 in twrs in addition lwr1 and lwr2 also showed substantially reduced rnd family proportion in reactor discharge as compared to the source water fig a 2 arg subtypes belonging to rnd family also accounted for half of the persistent gene subtypes detected in the photobioreactor discharges table a 1 but the majority of gene combinations encoding functional multidrug resistance complexes remained incomplete the qpcr results showed the reduction of both arg abundances and relative abundances in photobioreactors through the treatment process fig 2 fig a 3 due to the args profile in wwl and lw table 2 the starting abundances of args were mostly higher except for teta in twrs compared to lwrs however a substantial decrease in the abundances of most args except for sul1 and teta was recorded in twrs already by day 4 of the experiment fig 2a d g h qnrs abundance dropped below the value of loq after day 8 fig 2d the abundances of args continued to decrease throughout the treatment showing over 2 log reduction and reaching to the 1 level of the day 0 abundance in the case of blaoxa2 type tetq tetw and ermb genes in twr discharges fig 2b c g h the abundances of sul1 teta and aada genes decreased less 0 25 1 14 log reductions and reached to 56 14 and 7 levels of the day 0 abundances in twr discharges respectively fig 2a e f apart from sul1 all the abundances of targeted args remained at the level of 102 104 copies ml in twrs discharge the majority of arg abundances and relative abundances also showed continuous decrease in lwrs during the treatment fig 2cdfgh fig a 3 the abundances of the aada blaoxa2 type and sul1 genes increased during the first four days of the treatment followed by a substantial decrease fig 2abe the ranova analysis revealed significant differences in the dynamics of several arg abundances between the treatments fig 2a b e h the abundances of qnrs and tetq genes dropped quickly within the first four days and were close to or below the loq during the second half of the lwrs performance fig 2d g the abundances and relative abundances of all args except teta detectable until the end of the experiment were significantly lower in discharges of lwrs as compared to twr discharges fig 2 fig a 3 moreover a greater capacity of arg removal log removal for the majority of quantified genes was recorded in lwrs compared to twrs apart from sul1 all abundances of targeted args were at the level of 102 103 copies ml in lwr discharges opposed to twrs lwrs treatment showed more uniform capability to reduce args abundances as all targeted args reached the 6 level of day 0 abundance in lwr discharges albeit the quantification results mostly agree well with metagenomic results two notable exceptions were recorded the metagenome analysis indicated that the baca gene encoding bacitracin resistance and the aada9 gene encoding aminoglycoside resistance were very prominent in the resistomes of all input waters of both treatments and in the reactors discharges table a 1 upon qpcr quantification the baca and aada9 genes proved to be marginal in these communities aada9 abundance remained below loq in all samples except for lwrs treatment on day 4 243 copies ml and baca abundance could be quantified only from the day 0 samples of both treatments 260 copies ml 3 2 2 the effect on inti genes the abundances of inti genes were lower on day 0 in lwrs compared to twrs fig 3 their abundances and relative abundances decreased throughout the performance of the photobioreactors except for inti3 between day 0 and 4 of both treatments fig 3 fig a 3a c the abundance of inti2 dropped quickly and stayed below loq from the eighth day of the reactors performance lwrs showed a greater capacity for inti1 removal while bigger log reduction of inti3 gene was recorded in twrs fig 3 according to ranova analysis the dynamics of inti1 and inti3 genes reduction were significantly different between twr and lwr treatments fig 3a c fig a 3a c as a result the lwrs had significantly lower p 0 01 inti genes abundances and relative abundances compared to twrs in their discharges 3 6 and 2 2 of the day 0 level in twrs and lwrs respectively fig 3 fig a 3a c the analysis of metagenomes matched with the quantification results and showed a substantial decrease in the numbers of inti gene reads and their proportions in contigs in both twrs and lwrs discharges compared to the input wastewaters table 1 moreover less plasmid and plasmid borne inti gene sequences were recorded in twrs and lwrs discharges compared to the input wastewaters table 1 and greater decrease rate of the aforementioned parameters in lwrs as compared to twrs was found 3 3 the relationships between resistome and bacterial community structure as well as the levels of ph and chlorophyll a in photobioreactors a very strong co variation between the resistome proportions of arg types and bacterial community structure on genus level was determined in photobioreactors using co inertia analysis rv 0 87 p 0 001 fig a 4 numerous significant positive correlations with proportions of arg types especially multidrug mls tetracycline and vancomycin types were recorded for genera azoarcus dechloromonas and sulfuritalea fig 4 table a 3 in addition several myxobacterial genera and genus caldilinea showed strong positive correlations with rifamycin resistance type present only in twrs fig 4 table a 3 at arg subtype level most significant correlations p 0 05 were recorded for multidrug resistance genes e g acrb adej adek bpef emrb mdtb mdtc mexf ompr as well as for vanr macb rosb and oxa 17 genes within the aforementioned genera table a 4 in lwrs ph increased throughout the treatment period and reached the value 10 6 in the effluent on day 16 krustok et al 2015 statistical analysis showed that ph significantly affected the resistome quantity in the photobioreactors this parameter was negatively correlated with inti1 teta tetw blaoxa2 type and aada abundances rp 0 91 0 95 p 0 05 and strong negative correlations were revealed also with sul1 and ermb abundances rp 0 97 p 0 01 in twrs ph remained relatively stable 6 28 0 88 during the treatment krustok et al 2015 and no correlations with args or inti genes abundances were recorded the chlorophyll a concentration an indicator for algal biomass growth increased in both treatments albeit the growth was significantly faster in lwrs krustok et al 2015 significant negative relationships between chlorophyll a concentration and abundances of inti1 teta and blaoxa2 type genes rp 0 90 0 99 p 0 05 were revealed in twrs in lwrs chlorophyll a was negatively related to the abundances of inti1 sul1 teta tetq blaoxa2 type aada genes rp 0 89 0 96 p 0 05 and strong negative correlations were also revealed with tetw and ermb abundances rp 0 97 0 98 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 antibiotic resistance in used waters in this study the fate of antibiotic resistome and class 1 3 integron integrase genes during municipal wastewater treatment in photobioreactors was assessed using a combined approach of metagenomic and quantitative analyses in order to harness the strengths of both methodologies and balance out their known weaknesses yang et al 2013 li et al 2015 metagenomic analysis enabled to obtain broad profiles of resistomes while qpcr contributed to the sensitivity and quantitative capacity of the study based on metagenomic data args from major antibiotic resistance types were chosen for quantification the results showed that the spectrum of selected target genes was very similar to those reported as prevalent args in different types of wastewater treatment systems e g activated sludge as wwtps aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors and in their final effluents li et al 2015 christgen et al 2015 karkman et al 2016 similarly to most wastewater treatment facilities the input municipal wastewater was a major source of args and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors of this study as expected the wastewater resistome composition resembled swedish wwtps influents bengtsson palme et al 2016 fig a 1 while showing considerably different resistance types proportions compared to geographically distant wwtps influents yang et al 2014 one of the factors causing this difference may be the variation in medication usage practices both sources of the municipal wastewaters used in this study were less concentrated than the majority of the previous studies report evidenced by smaller resistome proportion in microbial community yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 lower numbers of detected and persistent arg subtypes yang et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 and an equal or smaller abundances of args munir et al 2011 gao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 and inti genes wang et al 2017 this difference can be partly attributed to lower wwtp loads krustok et al 2015 as compared to the aforementioned studies the obtained arg abundances rather resembled the influents of small and medium scale wwtps chen and zhang 2013 and the resistome composition e g higher proportion of multidrug and bacitracin resistance types was also similar to communities of domestic wastewater christgen et al 2015 nevertheless the wastewaters used for algal growth proved to contain significant quantities of args associated with antibiotics that are used extensively in human or veterinary medicine the results indicate that a rich and diverse resistome as well as a considerable amount of inti genes were also present in the lake water used for wastewater dilution in lwrs experiment the lake water originated from a yacht harbor krustok et al 2015 and the proportions of resistome especially multidrug resistance subtypes in the microbial community were more similar to wwtps effluents than to slightly impacted natural waters li et al 2015 heavy human impact on this lake water was also apparent in quantities of args which were comparable to wwtps effluents reported previously munir et al 2011 laht et al 2014 berglund et al 2015 in addition we found that two genes sul1 and inti1 suggested as prominent markers of anthropogenic influence gillings et al 2015 yang et al 2014 had the highest relative abundances in lake water microbial communities clearly surpassing the respective relative abundances in the used wastewaters consequently even though from nutrients aspect the lake water can be considered as diluent krustok et al 2015 it considerably affected the amount and composition of resistome and inti genes in the mixed lwrs input water lwr day 0 4 2 impact of photobioreactor treatment on antibiotic resistome our results indicate a substantial decrease of the resistome proportion as well as the number of args subtypes including persistent arg subtypes during the treatment of municipal wastewater in photobioreactors especially in lwrs the reduction rates were comparable or higher in case of lwrs than previously reported reduction rates in as wwtps yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 and anaerobic bioreactors christgen et al 2015 while closely resembling anaerobic aerobic treatment reactors utilizing domestic wastewater christgen et al 2015 the abundances of args in the photobioreactors discharges indicated that the reduction of args abundance during wastewater treatment was at the similar range 1 3 log reductions to those in many as wwtps laht et al 2014 gao et al 2012 chen and zhang 2013 mao et al 2015 oxidation ditches chen and zhang 2013 and constructed wetlands nõlvak et al 2013 but inferior to the membrane biological reactors munir et al 2011 while the reduction of resistance determinants in as wwtps laht et al 2014 gao et al 2012 mao et al 2015 and constructed wetlands fang et al 2017 is generally related to the reduction of the total bacterial load the results suggest a different resistome reduction mechanism in the photobioreactors the reduction rates of args and inti genes clearly surpassed the marginal around 0 3 logs decreases of bacterial loads indicated by the changes of 16s rrna abundances in analyzed water krustok et al 2015 lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome as well as inti genes to the treatment system that reflected in an initial increase for some of the gene abundances during the first days of the treatment the results of a previous study showed that the addition of lake water to the photobioreactors positively affected the structure of algal bacterial consortium and promoted algal growth in lwrs krustok et al 2015 this study revealed a higher reduction capacity generally by an order of magnitude of args and inti1 genes in lwrs as compared to the tap water application the results showed strong association between the reduction of resistome and changes in bacterial community composition enhanced resistome and inti1 genes reduction in lwrs can thus be largely attributed to the more pronounced shift in bacterial community composition significantly affected by elevated ph level as a result of intense algal growth during the course of treatment process krustok et al 2015 notably in the two lwrs showing highest algal growth krustok et al 2015 the resistome reduction was so substantial that the resistomes of the reactor discharges were more similar to slightly impacted environments than to the effluents of wastewater treatment systems li et al 2015 or even to the lake water used in this study the latter showcases an additional benefit of lwrs that enables to simultaneously reduce the resistome of municipal wastewaters and natural waters with a strong anthropogenic impact the co occurrence pattern between antibiotic resistance types and microbial taxa revealed by the network analysis suggested several bacterial genera e g azoarcus dechloromonas sulfuritalea to be potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types especially multidrug mls tetracycline and vancomycin resistance determinants dechloromonas and azoarcus genera have been shown as potential arg hosts in wastewaters and activated sludge guo et al 2017 in addition sulfuritalea has been shown to carry tetracycline resistance huang et al 2014 as the decrease of these relatively little studied in respect to antibiotic resistance taxa have the highest impact on the reduction of resistome in photobioreactors the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of these genera and the exact relationships with algal growth merits further research persistence of numerous arg subtypes in the systems is a well recognized problem in wastewater treatment yang et al 2014 and this proved to be a critical issue also in the photobioreactors in the present study we detected several persistent genes e g aada sul1 teta that expressed lowest log removals and were also prominent representatives of their resistance types these args have been found enriched in freshwater sediments downstream of wwtps berglund et al 2015 czekalski et al 2014 once again the lwrs proved to be more efficient than twrs in the removal of these persistent args for example sul1 that is often found in inti1 gene cassettes chen and zhang 2013 deng et al 2015 was the most persistent of the args quantified in this study yet its reduction rate in lwr treatment was either comparable to as wwtps gao et al 2012 chen and zhang 2013 or even surpassed the removal efficiencies recorded in the previously mentioned systems yang et al 2014 czekalski et al 2012 and anaerobic aerobic reactors christgen et al 2015 moreover while the relative abundances of sul1 genes have commonly remained stable or have even increased during wastewater treatment gao et al 2012 czekalski et al 2012 laht et al 2014 yang et al 2014 lwrs showed steady decrease of sul1 relative abundances in general similarly to other wastewater treatment facilities yang et al 2014 christgen et al 2015 we recorded a steady decrease in the proportion of tetracycline resistance type during the performance of photobioreactors mainly owing to good reduction efficiency of the genes tetq tetw associated with human and livestock feaces li et al 2015 however such decrease was not universal to all tetracycline arg subtypes as illustrated by high persistence of teta the reduction of aada gene a prominent and persistent representative of aminoglycoside resistance family which is often associated with inti1 and inti2 gene cassettes deng et al 2015 was more efficient in lwrs 4 3 multidrug resistance and integron integrase genes in photobioreactors the prevalence and persistence of multidrug resistant bacteria during wastewater treatment have been recognized as a serious public health concern czekalski et al 2012 similarly to conventional wwtps yang et al 2014 the amount of genetic multi resistance determinants decreased during wastewater treatment in photobioreactors however a slight rise in the proportion of multidrug resistance genes in the resistomes of photobioreactor discharges was recorded compared to the initial wastewaters a similar tendency has been reported in operationally comparable aerobic and anaerobic aerobic treatment reactors christgen et al 2015 pointing to the possibility that selection towards multi resistance might be a weakness of these types of treatment systems as multidrug efflux complexes are able to extrude a wide variety of compounds besides antibiotics e g heavy metals toxic plant metabolites and signaling molecules blanco et al 2016 their proportional increase in photobioreactors during the treatment process may be related to bacterial strategy for protection against toxic algal metabolites args especially multidrug resistance determinants are spread with mobile genetic elements e g plasmids transposons insertion sequences and integrons through horizontal gene transfer among different species this has been pointed out as the main public health hazard of wastewater treatment systems rizzo et al 2013 integron integrase genes have also been found to be enriched in sediments downstream of wwtps karkman et al 2016 in this respect the performance of photobioreactors especially lwrs is encouraging as both the amount of plasmid reads and especially the amount and proportion of integron integrase gene sequences were reduced during this treatment the most substantial reduction during wastewater treatment was recorded for plasmid borne integron integrase gene reads this refers to the reduction of the transfer risk of these natural gene capture and assembly platforms that often house multiple args in one cassette deng et al 2015 the initial water samples from the photobioreactors showed somewhat higher inti1 inti2 and inti3 gene relative abundance than detected in some wwtps influents however the reduction efficiency in photobioreactors was greater and as a result lower abundances and relative abundances of inti genes were detected in photobioreactor discharges compared to conventional wwtps wang et al 2017 4 4 methodological aspects related to the evaluation of antibiotic resistance similarly to other studies utilizing the same metagenomic data analysis pipeline yang et al 2013 2014 2016 christgen et al 2015 li et al 2015 bacitracin resistance was one of the most prominent and persistent antibiotic resistance types however the quantification of the prevalent baca gene did not confirm its high abundance in this study application of qpcr can have several well known pitfalls e g primer coverage and quality inhibition low amplification efficiency yang et al 2013 however in this case eight different primer pair combinations coupled with a rigorous assay optimization procedure were tested data not shown with no improvement in measured concentrations baca has considerably more reference sequences in the args oap reference database as compared to any other arg subtype yang et al 2016 it has been suggested that such genes may have increased detection potential compared to args with few reference sequences nesme et al 2014 so far we conclude that bacitracin resistance proportion and abundance estimation and interpretation using this workflow remain inconclusive and need further verification we did not find complete multidrug resistance efflux complexes from the metagenomic data however as illustrated by the example of the qnrs gene in this study the lack of detection in metagenomic data does not necessarily translate to the absence of a gene there is a great probability that a full multi resistance profile was not achieved with the metagenomic analysis in this study the complex problem of multi resistance coupled with technical and methodological aspects highlights the need for further in depth investigation preferably simultaneously harnessing several techniques to avoid technical bias and to give a comprehensive view on this critical subject 5 conclusions the photobioreactors proved to be at least as effective or in the case of lake water reactors even more efficient in controlling antibiotic resistance dissemination through treated municipal wastewater to natural environments as compared to conventional wwtps the reduction of resistome was strongly related to the changes in the bacterial community composition during wastewater treatment process responding to rising ph levels caused by intense algal growth bacterial genera azoarcus dechloromonas and sulfuritalea were recognized as potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types although lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome and inti genes profile to the treatment system it proved to be considerably more beneficial for wastewater dilution than tap water acknowledgment this study was supported by the estonian ministry of education and research grant iut2 16 and

19481,nitrogen fate and transport through contaminated groundwater systems where n is both ubiquitous and commonly limits pollutant attenuation must be re evaluated given evidence for new potential microbial n pathways we addressed this by measuring the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic n din nh4 no2 and no3 and n functional gene abundances amoa nirk nirs hsza from 20 to 38 wells across an nh4 hydrocarbon and so4 2 contaminated aquifer in situ n attenuation was confirmed on three sampling dates 0 6 12 months by the decreased din 4300 40 μm and increased δ15n din 5 33 over the flow path however the assumption of negligible n attenuation within the plume was complicated by the presence of alternative electron acceptors so4 2 fe3 both oxidizing and reducing functional genes and n oxides within this anoxic zone active plume n cycling was corroborated using an no2 dual isotope based model which found the fastest 10 day no2 turnover within the n and electron donor rich central plume findings suggest that n cycling is not always o2 limited within chemically complex contaminated aquifers though this cycling may recycle the n species rather than attenuate n graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminated groundwater stable isotopes nitrite chemolithotrophic n cycling biodegradation nitrate dual isotopes 1 introduction pressure to clean up contaminated groundwater resources is increasing along with demand on water resources however the multiple groundwater pollutants found associated with industrial sites present a complex problem as contaminant interactions can alter expected attenuation rates meckenstock et al 2015 the fact that n is both an ubiquitous groundwater pollutant from agriculture sewage coke ash and a regulator of the biological activity that drives natural attenuation of e g hydrocarbons makes accurate assessment of in situ n reaction rates fundamental to the development of viable remediation plans kleinsteuber et al 2012 standard remediation models assume that nutrient c n p s rich plumes drive complete o2 consumption effectively immobilizing n as nh4 this confines n attenuation to a narrow fringe where o2 diffusing back from oxygenated downgradient water leads to the autotrophic nitrification of nh3 to no2 nh3 oxidation and no3 no2 oxidation and enables heterotrophic reduction of no3 to n2 with no2 and n2o as intermediates christensen et al 2001 rivett et al 2008 however this understanding is increasingly challenged by evidence for both divergent biological n oxidation and reduction pathways and that they can be driven by alternative electron donors and acceptors burgin and hamilton 2007 jones et al 2017 jørgensen et al 2009 yang et al 2012 potential confounding processes include anaerobic nh4 oxidation anammox autotrophic conversion of no2 and nh4 to n2 which can attenuate n without c consumption or antecedent no3 production kartal et al 2013 moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 and the heterotrophic dissimilatory reduction of no3 to nh4 dnra henson et al 2017 the latter effectively switches no3 reduction from a removal to a recycling process chemolithotrophic n cycling may also be favored in the absence of o2 and labile c baker et al 2012 henson et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 chemodenitrification reduces no3 to n2 by oxidizing fe2 to fe3 or s2 to so4 2 buchwald et al 2016 coby et al 2011 jørgensen et al 2009 vaclavkova et al 2014 or to nh4 by oxidizing s2 to so4 2 burgin and hamilton 2008 hayakawa et al 2013 oxidation of nh4 to n2 no2 or no3 by anammox can also co occur with fe3 reduction crowe et al 2012 ding et al 2014 beyond directly driving process s and fe availability may also regulate partitioning between denitrification no3 reduced to n2 and dnra no3 reduced to nh4 cheng et al 2016 plummer et al 2015 these chemolithotrophic processes are potentially of major importance in hydrocarbon contaminated sites where sharp redox gradients can alter the bioavailability of the geologic fe and mn in the sediment matrix cozzarelli et al 2001 ziegler et al 2015 so although new evidence for anammox in nh4 plumes is important moore et al 2011 robertson et al 2012 smith et al 2015 the balance of possible anoxic n pathways in contaminated groundwater is unknown this paucity of information on groundwater n cycling is in part due to the difficulty measuring them which can require costly 15n additions and or ex situ experiments natural abundance stable isotope measurements could present a powerful yet relatively inexpensive means of assessing groundwater n transformations this approach is based on the knowledge that the isotopic composition of n species are predictably affected by biological and chemical reactions eq 1 1 c c 0 r r 0 α 1 where the proportion of the initial n pool c c0 is related to the parallel change in the pool s isotopic composition r r0 by a process specific fractionation factor α although dnra α values are unknown the established no3 no2 and nh4 fractionation during oxidation v reduction is sufficient to constrain n pathways bourbonnais et al 2015 wells et al 2016 we hypothesized that the abundant electron acceptors and donors found in groundwater underlying industrial sites would create diverse microbial pathways for n attenuation this hypothesis was tested using patterns in the n and o stable isotope composition of the inorganic n din species no2 no3 and nh4 to identify spatial and temporal variations in n cycling across a contaminant plume and comparing these findings to the presence of relevant redox species and functional genes 2 materials methods 2 1 site description work was conducted in contaminated groundwater underlying a 100 year old industrial site in leuna germany fig 1 the

nitrite isotope model iterative solutions to the non steady state model developed by buchwald and casciotti 2013 were used to parameterize the speed and drivers of no2 turnover this approach is based on known rates of abiotic equilibration between o no2 and o h2o and biological fractionation of o and n this model was used to estimate the relative importance of no2 production nh3 oxidation ao and no2 reduction nr and removal no2 oxidation no and reduction nd processes across the sampled wells and over time as well as the age of no2 see supplemental material c for details briefly equations were solved sequentially for first no2 production and second no2 removal using the established ε values for ao nr no and nd summarised in buchwald and casciotti 2013 and martin and casciotti 2016 these solutions were fitted iteratively to the measured δ15n no2 and δ18o no2 values this produced best fit estimates of the relative importance of each pathway affecting no2 accumulation the first two sets of equations generated the δ18o no2 value that would have been created solely by the biological fractionation occurring in the well any difference between this biological value δ18ono2 b and the measured value δ18ono2 would have been caused by gradual equilibration with the surrounding water allowing the mean age of the no2 pool to be approximated for each well eq 2 2 δ 18 o n o 2 δ 18 o n o 2 b δ 18 o n o 2 e q e k t δ 18 o n o 2 e q where δ18ono2 eq is the value calculated for complete equilibration between the o no2 and the measured o h2o this equation can then be solved for time t

spatial and temporal patterns chemical distributions across the site broadly fitted the standard redox based model s2 in the central nh4 plume fe2 and fe3 in the fringe and no3 downgradient fig 2 christensen et al 2001 meckenstock et al 2015 so4 2 replacing o2 as the primary electron acceptor across the site also fits expectations for hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater baedecker et al 1993 eganhouse et al 1993 knöller et al 2008 however there were two clear aberrations from the expected redox gradient 1 the high so4 2 and no3 in some plume wells and 2 the low redox zone around the downgradient b wells the high so4 2 concentrations at the west of the plume have been attributed to a legacy point source tischer et al 2013 high nh4 mtbe and s2 in the b wells likewise fit with reports of a localized contaminant source fig 2 however the elevated plume no3 was unexpected there are no reported no3 inputs to the site and the measured δ18o no3 range rules out fertilizer contamination which has δ18o no3 values 20 and δ15n no3 values of 0 minet et al 2017 this leaves in situ production from the large nh4 pool as the most likely source of plume no3 which is supported by the similarity between the δ15n signatures of the nh4 and no3 pools in these locations figs 4 and 5 together with the plume so4 2 and patches of hydrocarbon contamination around the central nh4 plume fig 2 these points highlight the inherent difficulty in extracting useful n process information from industrial groundwater sites the multiple distinct contaminant sources can both mask redox driven attenuation dynamics and create unexpected biogeochemical hotspots where electron donor and acceptor sources overlap δ15n din spatial patterns isoscapes can provide a useful first step towards untangling biologically driven n cycling within this chemically complex setting fig 3 wells et al 2016 this approach is based on the knowledge that n recycling nitrification dnra redistribute 15n between the nh4 and no3 pools but do not significantly affect din or δ15n din as no product is removed from the system only fractionation caused during attenuation denitrification anammox increases δ15n din above the δ15n source value δ15n0 here reasonably identified as a1 and a2 the presence of these two n anomalies no3 in the source plume and nh4 downgradient is acknowledged but their isotopic similarity to the main nh4 source combined with the downgradient location for b minimizes any effect on the δ15n din isoscapes the increase in δ15n din values relative to δ15n0 over the flow path therefore demonstrates that in situ n attenuation occurs between the plume and the downgradient wells and that this attenuation broadly persists over time fig 3 while the relatively narrow plume δ15n din range might suggest negligible attenuation in this zone the fact that no3 and nh4 are transported at different speeds through saturated mediums due primarily to nh4 sorption make it difficult to draw a clear spatial connection between high δ15n din values and attenuation hotspots or coldspots yet notably these isoscapes broadly fit expectations for n attenuation in an o2 limited system no3 increased with eh then dropped as δ15n din increased bottcher et al 1990 otero et al 2009 the fact that δ15n din drops back to 5 farther downgradient where din is lowest indicates that the downgradient n pool originates from in situ n mineralization as there are no biological processes that can decrease δ15n din values in nh4 or no3 dominated systems möbius 2013 the apparent shift towards natural n sources suggests that plume din is attenuated within 500 m the value of the isoscapes for tracking broad biogeochemical dynamics is demonstrated by the fact that the δ15n din shifts between sampling dates coincided with increased eh within the plume and fringe table 1 these shifts were reflected in both declining reduced species fe2 and s2 and anoxic process gene abundances hsza nirk nirs although fine scale hydrologic models would be needed to identify the exact driver of these temporal changes we note that comparable fluctuations in n gene copy numbers and δ15n values were reported in other monthly seasonal scale groundwater measurements likewise without substantial din shifts fackrell et al 2016 otero et al 2009 yagi et al 2010 fluctuations in hydrologic tracers δ18o h2o conductivity reflect an unconfined system affected by fairly minimal recharge seasonality supplemental material b here the relatively small magnitude of seasonal btex and mtbe shifts table 1 contextualize possible seasonal hydrologic shifts as these compounds are degrading at a negligible rate in this site martienssen et al 2006 the picture of on going yet fluctuating n attenuation across the contaminated site established with the δ15n din dataset indicates that predicting long term n fate will require more detailed information to determine the functional impact of the observed changes 4 2 nitrogen transformations multiple lines of evidence are needed to determine the mechanism and extent to which nh4 oxidation led to n attenuation heaton et al 2005 the inverse relationship between nh4 and δ15n nh4 broadly confirmed that plume nh4 was oxidized rather than adsorption or assimilation as neither substantially affects δ15n nh4 gooddy et al 2014 meckenstock et al 2015 robertson et al 2012 the breakdown of the rayleigh relationship eq 1 between δ15n nh4 and nh4 that occurs at the lowest concentrations fig 4 occurs when local biological reactions which will be more strongly expressed in isotope signatures at low concentrations outpace the rate of hydrologic mixing of these small nh4 pools wells et al 2016 however δ15n nh4 alone is a poor pathway indicator as both anammox and nitrification cause similar δ15n nh4 fractionation brunner et al 2013 casciotti et al 2003 nitrate s two isotopes provide a more robust indicator of n oxidation v reduction dynamics especially in combination with δ15n nh4 data granger and wankel 2016 nh3 oxidation produces no3 with δ15n values depleted relative to the residual nh4 product δ15n source δ15n casciotti et al 2003 and δ18o values defined by the δ18o composition of incorporated h2o δ18o 8 supplemental material b and o2 23 fig 5 casciotti et al 2007 fang et al 2012 therefore the consistent enrichment of δ15n no3 relative to both δ15n nh4 in the same well by 16 and established δ15n0 values combined with δ18o no3 value consistently above the possible oxidation range fig 5 shows that than one process is acting on the no3 pool across the site the interpretation that multiple co occurring and potentially interdependent processes affect site no3 is corroborated by the relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 denitrification causes a 1 2 no3 reduction coupled to s2 reduction frey et al 2014 or 1 1 c or fe2 oxidation coupled no3 reduction buchwald et al 2016 kritee et al 2012 δ18o δ15n enrichment of the residual no3 pool co occurring oxidation either nitrification or anammox shifts this relationship granger and wankel 2016 meaning that environments housing variable oxidation reduction rates produce the type of noisy δ18o δ15n relationship observed here fig 5 this scenario is supported by the relatively even distribution of both oxidizing and reducing n functional genes across the aquifer although the relatively elevated no3 isotope values are best explained by dominance of reduction over the probable oxidation pathways granger and wankel 2016 despite the lack of o2 the presence and isotopic composition of plume no3 is best explained by some degree of in situ n oxidation this is because while no3 dual isotopes indicate that the pool is broadly reduction regulated they do not correlate to concentrations or distance in the way that would be produced by progressive reduction of an no3 point source wells et al 2013 specifically there is neither a rayleigh relationship eq 1 between the change in no3 and δ15n no3 nor a progressive increase δ18o δ15n ratio with distance from the plume highest no3 figs 3 and 5 thus the plume no3 is more accurately attributed to either undetected aerobic microsites kalvelage et al 2011 meckenstock et al 2015 or anammox oxidizing nh4 to no3 or no2 instead of n2 clark et al 2008 moore et al 2011 robertson et al 2012 wells et al 2016 yang et al 2012 both possibilities could be at play here as microsites are impossible to rule out at the sampled scale and hsza was present across the site over time the dominance of so4 2 reducing microbes within the site s plume tischer et al 2013 could provide an additional pathway as these microbes can simultaneously oxidize n siegert et al 2013 while there are multiple reasonable explanations for in situ no3 production the apparent accumulation of this no3 within the plume where redox conditions would dictate rapid removal is noteworthy this accumulation suggests that plume n removal is also limited along the reduction pathway potentially due the poor quality of the available electron donors like btex cunningham et al 2001 and mtbe martienssen et al 2006 no2 provides a potentially powerful albeit underutilized tool for further untangling these co occurring groundwater n transformations this is based on its reactivity position as an intermediate in all biotic n pathways and the predictable abiotic equilibration between o no2 and o h2o its reactivity means that no2 is close to detection limits in most environments thus observations of no2 accumulation similar to those observed in the plume here have variously been attributed to 1 a toxicity effect inhibiting no2 oxidation bristow et al 2015 venterea et al 2015 2 a paucity of electron donors slowing no2 reduction hardison et al 2015 and 3 dnra balk et al 2015 kalvelage et al 2011 here the ubiquity of genes associated with both no2 production amoa hsza and removal nirk nirs hsza shows that all three mechanisms were biologically possible throughout the site because both nh3 oxidation to no2 and no2 oxidation to no3 cause δ18o no2 to decrease below its predicted equilibrium value knöller et al 2011 wells et al 2016 only relatively high rates of no2 reduction whether to n2o n2 or theoretically nh4 could create the high oct 2013 and mar 2014 δ18o no2 values to n2o brunner et al 2013 casciotti et al 2007 martin and casciotti 2016 fig 6 as with the other indicators no2 isotope values do shift towards an oxidation dominated range over time fig 6 however while these no2 dynamics corroborate no3 and functional gene evidence for n oxidation and reduction they seem to contradict the inference of negligible plume n attenuation from the δ15n din isoscapes this is because unlike no3 the small no2 pool size and rapid turnover months of no2 means that this discrepancy cannot be fully explained by hydrologic transport of heavy species down gradient as a mechanism for reduction without attenuation dnra could explain this apparent n cycling without n attenuation in the anoxic plume the possibility of dnra under the different contaminant mixtures represented across the plume here is unknown but there is proof that it occurs in aquifers anoxic microsites henson et al 2017 however this possibility seems less likely here in light of findings from estuarine environments that dnra only dominants no3 reduction when there is an excess of electron donors e g s2 fe2 c relative to no3 hardison et al 2015 plummer et al 2015 here the mean electron donor no3 molar ratio was 2 although two plume wells did have the 20 ratios associated with dnra dominated systems hardison et al 2015 evidence for some type of n recycling processes here highlights the need for more high precision investigations into the dnra denitrification balance in chemical rich o2 limited systems the turnover time information from no2 isotopes provided an alternative avenue for addressing this knowledge gap by further parameterizing plume n cycling using no2 isotope data to predict turnover times is a relatively new possibility and is based on the knowledge that o no2 equilibration with the surrounding o h2o is predictably determined by ph and temperature buchwald and casciotti 2013 the age of no2 at each sampled well could thus be approximated by first solving for the relative fraction of nh3 oxidation no3 reduction no2 oxidation and no2 reduction and second comparing the resultant biology driven δ18o no2 values with both the calculated equilibrium δ18o no2 and measured δ18o no2 values fig 6 despite inherent uncertainties variable fractionation factors lack of steady state conditions the best fit outputs broadly confirmed the expected redox driven spatial patterns both oxidizing processes were relatively less important in the most contaminated highest din zones p 0 05 supplemental material c the fraction of no2 oxidation and nh3 oxidation also increased over time fitting well with the other lines evidence presented here using these outputs to estimate well no2 residence times produced values ranging from 1 fast turnover to 200 slow turnover days supplemental material c surprisingly both the shortest and longest residence times occurred within the plume no2 in the central plume wells high nh4 so4 2 and no3 had residence times of 10 days while no2 in the adjacent hydrocarbon rich electron acceptor poor wells had residence times 100 days while these approximated variations in n turnover rates are reasonable given the uneven distribution of both electron acceptors and hydrocarbons that could inhibit microbial activity fig 3 they reveal an unexpected degree of heterogeneity of both the processes and rates of n turnover within anoxic contaminant plumes these first measurements of no2 dual isotopes outside of the marine environment demonstrate their potential to untangle n cycling in the heterogeneous environments that stymie effective use standard no3 isotope based assessments the confirmation of the active anoxic n turnover that arose from the multiple chemical isotopic and biological indicators compiled here was unexpected given the expectation for plume n cycling to be both o2 and toxicity limited jin et al 2013 roberts et al 2014 future work should focus on quantitatively linking these anoxic no2 isotope dynamics with the use of specific electron donors and receptors evidence for n turnover without either molecular o2 or labile organic c also suggests that local electron acceptor and or donor shortages in chemically complex contaminated aquifers may promote the chemolithotrophic n cycling previously only observed in oligotrophic aquifers heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 5 conclusions here the combined δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 patterns from multiple wells across a multi contaminant aquifer confirmed the presence of natural nh4 attenuation which would not have been evident based solely on measurements of one of these n forms however the presence of n oxides functional genes for n oxidation and oxidized fe and s forms within the anoxic central plume suggested that n turnover is not isolated to the plume fringe this suggestion was corroborated by no2 dual isotope patterns which confirmed that n is actively reduced and oxidized across the entire site mean turnover times between 1 and 200 days while fine scale multi level sampling would help tease apart exactly how and when plume n cycling occurs the above findings demonstrate the capacity of isotopic indicators to add critical functional information into even standard monitored natural attenuation protocols future work should focus on quantifying the significance of the anoxic chemolithotrophic n turnover suggested by the dissolved n

19481,nitrogen fate and transport through contaminated groundwater systems where n is both ubiquitous and commonly limits pollutant attenuation must be re evaluated given evidence for new potential microbial n pathways we addressed this by measuring the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic n din nh4 no2 and no3 and n functional gene abundances amoa nirk nirs hsza from 20 to 38 wells across an nh4 hydrocarbon and so4 2 contaminated aquifer in situ n attenuation was confirmed on three sampling dates 0 6 12 months by the decreased din 4300 40 μm and increased δ15n din 5 33 over the flow path however the assumption of negligible n attenuation within the plume was complicated by the presence of alternative electron acceptors so4 2 fe3 both oxidizing and reducing functional genes and n oxides within this anoxic zone active plume n cycling was corroborated using an no2 dual isotope based model which found the fastest 10 day no2 turnover within the n and electron donor rich central plume findings suggest that n cycling is not always o2 limited within chemically complex contaminated aquifers though this cycling may recycle the n species rather than attenuate n graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminated groundwater stable isotopes nitrite chemolithotrophic n cycling biodegradation nitrate dual isotopes 1 introduction pressure to clean up contaminated groundwater resources is increasing along with demand on water resources however the multiple groundwater pollutants found associated with industrial sites present a complex problem as contaminant interactions can alter expected attenuation rates meckenstock et al 2015 the fact that n is both an ubiquitous groundwater pollutant from agriculture sewage coke ash and a regulator of the biological activity that drives natural attenuation of e g hydrocarbons makes accurate assessment of in situ n reaction rates fundamental to the development of viable remediation plans kleinsteuber et al 2012 standard remediation models assume that nutrient c n p s rich plumes drive complete o2 consumption effectively immobilizing n as nh4 this confines n attenuation to a narrow fringe where o2 diffusing back from oxygenated downgradient water leads to the autotrophic nitrification of nh3 to no2 nh3 oxidation and no3 no2 oxidation and enables heterotrophic reduction of no3 to n2 with no2 and n2o as intermediates christensen et al 2001 rivett et al 2008 however this understanding is increasingly challenged by evidence for both divergent biological n oxidation and reduction pathways and that they can be driven by alternative electron donors and acceptors burgin and hamilton 2007 jones et al 2017 jørgensen et al 2009 yang et al 2012 potential confounding processes include anaerobic nh4 oxidation anammox autotrophic conversion of no2 and nh4 to n2 which can attenuate n without c consumption or antecedent no3 production kartal et al 2013 moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 and the heterotrophic dissimilatory reduction of no3 to nh4 dnra henson et al 2017 the latter effectively switches no3 reduction from a removal to a recycling process chemolithotrophic n cycling may also be favored in the absence of o2 and labile c baker et al 2012 henson et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 chemodenitrification reduces no3 to n2 by oxidizing fe2 to fe3 or s2 to so4 2 buchwald et al 2016 coby et

fe3 reduction crowe et al 2012 ding et al 2014 beyond directly driving process s and fe availability may also regulate partitioning between denitrification no3 reduced to n2 and dnra no3 reduced to nh4 cheng et al 2016 plummer et al 2015 these chemolithotrophic processes are potentially of major importance in hydrocarbon contaminated sites where sharp redox gradients can alter the bioavailability of the geologic fe and mn in the sediment matrix cozzarelli et al 2001 ziegler et al 2015 so although new evidence for anammox in nh4 plumes is important moore et al 2011 robertson et al 2012 smith et al 2015 the balance of possible anoxic n pathways in contaminated groundwater is unknown this paucity of information on groundwater n cycling is in part due to the difficulty measuring them which can require costly 15n additions and or ex situ experiments natural abundance stable isotope measurements could present a powerful yet relatively inexpensive means of assessing groundwater n transformations this approach is based on the knowledge that the isotopic composition of n species are predictably affected by biological and chemical reactions eq 1 1 c c 0 r r 0 α 1 where the proportion of the initial n pool c c0 is related to the parallel change in the pool s isotopic composition r r0 by a process specific fractionation factor α although dnra α values are unknown the established no3 no2 and nh4 fractionation during oxidation v reduction is sufficient to constrain n pathways bourbonnais et al 2015 wells et al 2016 we hypothesized that the abundant electron acceptors and donors found in groundwater underlying industrial sites would create diverse microbial pathways for n attenuation this hypothesis was tested using patterns in the n and o stable isotope composition of the inorganic n din species no2 no3 and nh4 to identify spatial and temporal variations in n cycling across a contaminant plume and comparing these findings to the presence of relevant redox species and functional genes 2 materials methods 2 1 site description work was conducted in contaminated groundwater underlying a 100 year old industrial site in leuna germany fig 1 the

nitrite isotope model iterative solutions to the non steady state model developed by buchwald and casciotti 2013 were used to parameterize the speed and drivers of no2 turnover this approach is based on known rates of abiotic equilibration between o no2 and o h2o and biological fractionation of o and n this model was used to estimate the relative importance of no2 production nh3 oxidation ao and no2 reduction nr and removal no2 oxidation no and reduction nd processes across the sampled wells and over time as well as the age of no2 see supplemental material c for details briefly equations were solved sequentially for first no2 production and second no2 removal using the established ε values for ao nr no and nd summarised in buchwald and casciotti 2013 and martin and casciotti 2016 these solutions were fitted iteratively to the measured δ15n no2 and δ18o no2 values this produced best fit estimates of the relative importance of each pathway affecting no2 accumulation the first two sets of equations generated the δ18o no2 value that would have been created solely by the biological fractionation occurring in the well any difference between this biological value δ18ono2 b and the measured value δ18ono2 would have been caused by gradual equilibration with the surrounding water allowing the mean age of the no2 pool to be approximated for each well eq 2 2 δ 18 o n o 2 δ 18 o n o

spatial and temporal patterns chemical distributions across the site broadly fitted the standard redox based model s2 in the central nh4 plume fe2 and fe3 in the fringe and no3 downgradient fig 2 christensen et al 2001 meckenstock et al 2015 so4 2 replacing o2 as the primary electron acceptor across the site also fits expectations for hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater baedecker et al 1993 eganhouse et al 1993 knöller et al 2008 however there were two clear aberrations from the expected redox gradient 1 the high so4 2 and no3 in some plume wells and 2 the low redox zone around the downgradient b wells the high so4 2 concentrations at the west of the plume have been attributed to a legacy point source tischer et al 2013 high nh4 mtbe and s2 in the b wells likewise fit with reports of a localized contaminant source fig 2 however the elevated plume no3 was unexpected there are no reported no3 inputs to the site and the measured δ18o no3 range rules out fertilizer contamination which has δ18o no3 values 20 and δ15n no3 values of 0 minet et al 2017 this leaves in situ production from the large nh4 pool as the most likely source of plume no3 which is supported by the similarity between the δ15n signatures of the nh4 and no3 pools in these locations figs 4 and 5 together with the plume so4 2 and patches of hydrocarbon contamination around the central nh4 plume fig 2 these points highlight the inherent difficulty in extracting useful n process information from industrial groundwater sites the multiple distinct contaminant sources can both mask redox driven attenuation dynamics and create unexpected biogeochemical hotspots where electron donor and acceptor sources overlap δ15n din spatial patterns isoscapes can provide a useful first step towards untangling biologically driven n cycling within this chemically complex setting fig 3 wells et al 2016 this approach is based on the knowledge that n recycling nitrification dnra redistribute 15n between the nh4 and no3 pools but do not significantly affect din or δ15n din as no product is removed from the system only fractionation caused during attenuation denitrification anammox increases δ15n din above the δ15n source value δ15n0 here reasonably identified as a1 and a2 the presence of these two n anomalies no3 in the source plume and nh4 downgradient is acknowledged but their isotopic similarity to the main nh4 source combined with the downgradient location for b minimizes any effect on the δ15n din isoscapes the increase in δ15n din values relative to δ15n0 over the flow path therefore demonstrates that in situ n attenuation occurs between the plume and the downgradient wells and that this attenuation broadly persists over time fig 3 while the relatively narrow plume δ15n din range might suggest negligible attenuation in this zone the fact that no3 and nh4 are transported at different speeds through saturated mediums due primarily to nh4 sorption make it difficult to draw a clear spatial connection between high δ15n din values and attenuation hotspots or coldspots yet notably these isoscapes broadly fit expectations for n attenuation in an o2 limited system no3 increased with eh then dropped as δ15n din increased bottcher et al 1990 otero et al 2009 the fact that δ15n din drops back to 5 farther downgradient where din is lowest indicates that the downgradient n pool originates from in situ n mineralization as there are no biological processes that can decrease δ15n din values in nh4 or no3 dominated systems möbius 2013 the apparent shift towards natural n sources suggests that plume din is attenuated within 500 m the value of the isoscapes for tracking broad biogeochemical dynamics is demonstrated by the fact that the δ15n din shifts between sampling dates coincided with increased eh within the plume and fringe table 1 these shifts were reflected in both declining reduced species fe2 and s2 and anoxic process gene abundances hsza nirk nirs although fine scale hydrologic models would be needed to identify the exact driver of these temporal changes we note that comparable fluctuations in n gene copy numbers and δ15n values were reported in other monthly seasonal scale groundwater measurements likewise without substantial din shifts fackrell et al 2016 otero et al 2009 yagi et al 2010 fluctuations in hydrologic tracers δ18o h2o conductivity reflect an unconfined system affected by fairly minimal recharge seasonality supplemental material b here the relatively small magnitude of seasonal btex and mtbe shifts table 1 contextualize possible seasonal hydrologic shifts as these compounds are degrading at a negligible rate in this site martienssen et al 2006 the picture of on going yet fluctuating n attenuation across the contaminated site established with the δ15n din dataset indicates that predicting long term n fate will require more detailed information to determine the functional impact of the observed changes 4 2 nitrogen transformations multiple lines of evidence are needed to determine the mechanism and extent to which nh4 oxidation led to n attenuation heaton et al 2005 the inverse relationship between nh4 and δ15n nh4 broadly confirmed that plume nh4 was oxidized rather than adsorption or assimilation as neither substantially affects δ15n nh4 gooddy et al 2014 meckenstock et al 2015 robertson et al 2012 the breakdown of the rayleigh relationship eq 1 between δ15n nh4 and nh4 that occurs at the lowest concentrations fig 4 occurs when local biological reactions which will be more strongly expressed in isotope signatures at low concentrations outpace the rate of hydrologic mixing of these small nh4 pools wells et al 2016 however δ15n nh4 alone is a poor pathway indicator as both anammox and nitrification cause similar δ15n nh4 fractionation brunner et al 2013 casciotti et al 2003 nitrate s two isotopes provide a more robust indicator of n oxidation v reduction dynamics especially in combination with δ15n nh4 data granger and wankel 2016 nh3 oxidation produces no3 with δ15n values depleted relative to the residual nh4 product δ15n source δ15n casciotti et al 2003 and δ18o values defined by the δ18o composition of incorporated h2o δ18o 8 supplemental material b and o2 23 fig 5 casciotti et al 2007 fang et al 2012 therefore the consistent enrichment of δ15n no3 relative to both δ15n nh4 in the same well by 16 and established δ15n0 values combined with δ18o no3 value consistently above the possible oxidation range fig 5 shows that than one process is acting on the no3 pool across the site the interpretation that multiple co occurring and potentially interdependent processes affect site no3 is corroborated by the relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 denitrification causes a 1 2 no3 reduction coupled to s2 reduction frey et al 2014 or 1 1 c or fe2 oxidation coupled no3 reduction buchwald et al 2016 kritee et al 2012 δ18o δ15n enrichment of the residual no3 pool co occurring oxidation either nitrification or anammox shifts this relationship granger and wankel 2016 meaning that environments housing variable oxidation reduction rates produce the type of noisy δ18o δ15n relationship observed here fig 5 this scenario is supported by the relatively even distribution of both oxidizing and reducing n functional genes across the aquifer although the relatively elevated no3 isotope values are best explained by dominance of reduction over the probable oxidation pathways granger and wankel 2016 despite the lack of o2 the presence and isotopic composition of plume no3 is best explained by some degree of in situ n oxidation this is because while no3 dual isotopes indicate that the pool is broadly reduction regulated they do not correlate to concentrations or distance in the way that would be produced by progressive reduction of an no3 point source wells et al 2013 specifically there is neither a rayleigh relationship eq 1 between the change in no3 and δ15n no3 nor a progressive increase δ18o δ15n ratio with distance from the plume highest no3 figs 3 and 5 thus the plume no3 is more accurately attributed to either undetected aerobic microsites kalvelage et al 2011 meckenstock et al 2015 or anammox oxidizing nh4 to no3 or no2 instead of n2 clark et al 2008 moore et al 2011 robertson et al 2012 wells et al 2016 yang et al 2012 both possibilities could be at play here as microsites are impossible to rule out at the sampled scale and hsza was present across the site over time the dominance of so4 2 reducing microbes within the site s plume tischer et al 2013 could provide an additional pathway as these microbes can simultaneously oxidize n siegert et al 2013 while there are multiple reasonable explanations for in situ no3 production the apparent accumulation of this no3 within the plume where redox conditions would dictate rapid removal is noteworthy this accumulation suggests that plume n removal is also limited along the reduction pathway potentially due the poor quality of the available electron donors like btex cunningham et al 2001 and mtbe martienssen et al 2006 no2 provides a potentially powerful albeit underutilized tool for further untangling these co occurring groundwater n transformations this is based on its reactivity position as an intermediate in all biotic n pathways and the predictable abiotic equilibration between o no2 and o h2o its reactivity means that no2 is close to detection limits in most environments thus observations of no2 accumulation similar to those observed in the plume here have variously been attributed to 1 a toxicity effect inhibiting no2 oxidation bristow et al 2015 venterea et al 2015 2 a paucity of electron donors slowing no2 reduction hardison et al 2015 and 3 dnra balk et al 2015 kalvelage et al 2011 here the ubiquity of genes associated with both no2 production amoa hsza and removal nirk nirs hsza shows that all three mechanisms were biologically possible throughout the site because both nh3 oxidation to no2 and no2 oxidation to no3 cause δ18o no2 to decrease below its predicted equilibrium value knöller et al 2011 wells et al 2016 only relatively high rates of no2 reduction whether to n2o n2 or theoretically nh4 could create the high oct 2013 and mar 2014 δ18o no2 values to n2o brunner et al 2013 casciotti et al 2007 martin and casciotti 2016 fig 6 as with the other indicators no2 isotope values do shift towards an oxidation dominated range over time fig 6 however while these no2 dynamics corroborate no3 and functional gene evidence for n oxidation and reduction they seem to contradict the inference of negligible plume n attenuation from the δ15n din isoscapes this is because unlike no3 the small no2 pool size and rapid turnover months of no2 means that this discrepancy cannot be fully explained by hydrologic transport of heavy species down gradient as a mechanism for reduction without attenuation dnra could explain this apparent n cycling without n attenuation in the anoxic plume the possibility of dnra under the different contaminant mixtures represented across the plume here is unknown but there is proof that it occurs in aquifers anoxic microsites henson et al 2017 however this possibility seems less likely here in light of findings from estuarine environments that dnra only dominants no3 reduction when there is an excess of electron donors e g s2 fe2 c relative to no3 hardison et al 2015 plummer et al 2015 here the mean electron donor no3 molar ratio was 2 although two plume wells did have the 20 ratios associated with dnra dominated systems hardison et al 2015 evidence for some type of n recycling processes here highlights the need for more high precision investigations into the dnra denitrification balance in chemical rich o2 limited systems the turnover time information from no2 isotopes provided an alternative avenue for addressing this knowledge gap by further parameterizing plume n cycling using no2 isotope data to predict turnover times is a relatively new possibility and is based on the knowledge that o no2 equilibration with the surrounding o h2o is predictably determined by ph and temperature buchwald and casciotti 2013 the age of no2 at each sampled well could thus be approximated by first solving for the relative fraction of nh3 oxidation no3 reduction no2 oxidation and no2 reduction and second comparing the resultant biology driven δ18o no2 values with both the calculated equilibrium δ18o no2 and measured δ18o no2 values fig 6 despite inherent uncertainties variable fractionation factors lack of steady state conditions the best fit outputs broadly confirmed the expected redox driven spatial patterns both oxidizing processes were relatively less important in the most contaminated highest din zones p 0 05 supplemental material c the fraction of no2 oxidation and nh3 oxidation also increased over time fitting well with the other lines evidence presented here using these outputs to estimate well no2 residence times produced values ranging from 1 fast turnover to 200 slow turnover days supplemental material c surprisingly both the shortest and longest residence times occurred within the plume no2 in the central plume wells high nh4 so4 2 and no3 had residence times of 10 days while no2 in the adjacent hydrocarbon rich electron acceptor poor wells had residence times 100 days while these approximated variations in n turnover rates are reasonable given the uneven distribution of both electron acceptors and hydrocarbons that could inhibit microbial activity fig 3 they reveal an unexpected degree of heterogeneity of both the processes and rates of n turnover within anoxic contaminant plumes these first measurements of no2 dual isotopes outside of the marine environment demonstrate their potential to untangle n cycling in the heterogeneous environments that stymie effective use standard no3 isotope based assessments the confirmation of the active anoxic n turnover that arose from the multiple chemical isotopic and biological indicators compiled here was unexpected given the expectation for plume n cycling to be both o2 and toxicity limited jin et al 2013 roberts et al 2014 future work should focus on quantitatively linking these anoxic no2 isotope dynamics with the use of specific electron donors and receptors evidence for n turnover without either molecular o2 or labile organic c also suggests that local electron acceptor and or donor shortages in chemically complex contaminated aquifers may promote the chemolithotrophic n cycling previously only observed in oligotrophic aquifers heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 5 conclusions here the combined δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 patterns from multiple wells across a multi contaminant aquifer confirmed the presence of natural nh4 attenuation which would not have been evident based solely on measurements of one of these n forms however the presence of n oxides functional genes for n oxidation and oxidized fe and s forms within the anoxic central plume suggested that n turnover is not isolated to the plume fringe this suggestion was corroborated by no2 dual isotope patterns which confirmed that n is actively reduced and oxidized across the entire site mean turnover times between 1 and 200 days while fine scale multi level sampling would help tease apart exactly how and when plume n cycling occurs the above findings demonstrate the capacity of isotopic indicators to add critical functional information into even standard monitored natural attenuation protocols future work should focus on quantifying the significance of the anoxic chemolithotrophic n turnover suggested by the dissolved n isotope data by evaluating the functional genes and substrate turnover in hydrocarbon plume sediments across a range geologic matrices acknowledgements research was funded by the european community s

key laboratory for emerging organic contaminants control state key joint laboratory of environmental simulation and pollution control tsinghua university beijing 100084 china corresponding author prediction of micropollutant abatements by catalytic ozonation is critical for its process design and optimization in water treatment in this study a chemical kinetic model based on ozone o3 and hydroxyl radical oh rate constants k o3 and k oh and o3 and oh exposures is proposed for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation several micropollutants with k o3 ranging from 0 15 to 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 were spiked in water matrices deionized water and surface water and then treated by ozonation alone and homogeneous catalytic ozonation with varying transition metals ti2 co2 ni2 zn2 cu2 mn2 fe2 and fe3 the addition of the varying catalysts enhanced the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition to different extent consequently for the same applied o3 doses higher oh exposures can generally be obtained at the expense of lower o3 exposures during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone the changes in o3 and oh exposures did not considerably influence the abatement of micropollutants with high and moderate o3 reactivities diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate whose abatement efficiencies were generally 90 during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid clofibric acid and ibuprofen were less effectively abated during ozonation 40 60 abatement and the addition of the varying catalysts could enhance their absolute abatement efficiencies to various extent 0 10 in the deionized water and 0 22 in the surface water during catalytic ozonation despite the differing catalytic mechanisms of the varying transition metals the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by catalytic ozonation could be satisfactorily predicted by the chemical kinetic model using the o3 and oh rate constants of the micropollutants reported in literature and the o3 and oh exposures determined during the treatment processes these results demonstrate that the chemical kinetic model can provide a useful tool for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process emerging contaminant ozonation pharmaceutical water treatment 1 introduction the increasing worldwide

moreover numerous micropollutants often coexist in the water matrix and may result in additive or even synergistic effects which render their mixtures dangerously potent petrie et al 2015 schwarzenbach et al 2006 ternes and joss 2006 to protect ecosystems and human health effective technologies are needed to sufficiently abate micropollutants ideally to below detection limits during water and wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 klavarioti et al 2009 lee et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation has been intensively tested as a potential technology for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment huber et al 2003 huber et al 2005 rosal et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during ozonation micropollutants can be abated by oxidation with ozone o3 and or hydroxyl radicals oh generated from o3 decomposition with water constituents e g dissolved organic matter dom in the water matrix von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with compounds containing electron rich moieties such as phenols olefins deprotonated amines and reduced sulfur groups in contrast oh is a less selective oxidant and can rapidly oxidize almost all types of organic moieties at diffusion controlled rates 108 109 m 1 s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 many studies have shown that micropollutants with electron rich moieties can usually be efficiently eliminated by primarily o3 oxidation in a variety of water matrices e g natural water and wastewater during conventional ozonation gerrity et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 hubner et al 2015 kovalova et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 however ozone resistant micropollutants which can only be oxidized by oh during conventional ozonation are usually less effectively abated due to the low oh yield from o3 decomposition in real water matrices note that the oh yield is defined as moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed and reported in the range of 13 41 during conventional ozonation of natural water groundwater and surface water and municipal wastewater lee et

added during ozonation i e catalytic ozonation to enhance o3 transformation to oh kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 legube and leitner 1999 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 when transition metal ions are used i e homogeneous catalytic ozonation they may react directly with o3 to produce oh in addition they may interact with organics such as humic substances in the water matrix to promote o3 transformation to oh when solid catalysts e g metal oxides and metals on supports are used i e heterogeneous catalytic ozonation o3 may be decomposed at the catalyst surface and or react with organics adsorbed on the catalyst surface to produce oh due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh higher abatement efficiencies can often be obtained for ozone resistant micropollutants during catalytic ozonation compared to conventional ozonation kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 prediction of the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants is critical for practical applications of catalytic ozonation processes in water and wastewater treatment due to the vast number of micropollutants coexisting in the water matrix many of which have no established analytical methods yet it is impractical and cost prohibitive to measure the abatement efficiencies of various micropollutants individually however while many studies have demonstrated the superiority of catalytic ozonation for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 no models have been developed for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation this problem can be probably attributed to the complex mechanisms of catalytic ozonation which have not been fully understood nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 indeed numerous catalysts have been tested in catalytic ozonation and different or even contradictory catalytic effects and mechanisms have been reported kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 due to the differing catalytic mechanisms of varying catalysts generalized prediction of micropollutant abatements by catalytic ozonation is challenging notably recent studies have shown that the abatement of micropollutants by conventional ozonation and ozone based aops such as o3 h2o2 and the electro peroxone e peroxone process can be satisfactorily predicted using a chemical kinetic model eq 1 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 wang et al 2018 1 l n p p 0 k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t where ko3 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant p with o3 and oh respectively o 3 d t and o h are the o3 and oh exposures which are defined as the time integrated concentration of o3 and oh over a given reaction period elovitz and von gunten 1999 over the past decades the o3 and oh rate constants for a great number of micropollutants have been measured von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition the o3 and oh exposures can be readily measured for example by following the decay of o3 and a oh probe typically p chlorobenzoic acid p cba during water treatment processes elovitz and von gunten 1999 therefore this model can provide a relatively easy and convenient way to estimate the abatement levels of many micropollutants by ozone based processes lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 considering that catalytic ozonation is in nature also an ozone based aop where o3 and oh play a major role for micropollutant abatement nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 it is interesting to evaluate whether similar models can be applied in catalytic ozonation this may offer a practical way to predict micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation with varying catalysts even if the reaction mechanisms e g the catalytic mechanisms of o3 transformation to oh are not well understood the main objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the chemical kinetic model eq 1 for the prediction of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation as a first step homogeneous catalytic ozonation of micropollutants with varying transition metal ions was investigated in this study compared with heterogeneous catalytic ozonation the mechanisms of homogeneous catalytic ozonation are relatively simpler involving no adsorption effects that can complicate the catalytic mechanisms significantly therefore the chemical kinetic model can be directly applied in homogeneous catalytic ozonation without the need of correction for the adsorption effect in this study several model micropollutants with varying reactivities with o3 ko3 ranging from 0 15 to 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 were spiked in a deionized water and a surface water the waters were then treated by conventional ozonation and homogeneous catalytic ozonation with varying transition metal ions mn2 co2 fe2 fe3 ni2 ti2 zn2 or cu2 the effects of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh and micropollutant abatement were evaluated systematically based on the o3 and oh exposures observed during the treatment the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants were predicted using the chemical kinetic model 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water sample diclofenac gemfibrozil bezafibrate 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d clofibric acid ibuprofen and p cba with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as micropollutant model compounds the properties of these compounds are listed in table 1 according to their second order rate constants with o3 these compounds

generator ol80f dst ozone services canada concentrated ozone stock solutions were then prepared by continuously bubbling the ozone containg oxygen gas through milli q water that was cooled in an ice bath a surface water was collected from a reservoir in the suburban area of beijing after collection the surface water was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and stored inside polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe bottles in a refrigerator 4 c before it was used within 1 week for ozonation and catalytic ozonation experiments the main water quality parameters of the selected surface water are summarized in table 2 the background concentrations of micropollutants in the surface water were very low generally 1 μg l to facilitate the measurement of micropollutant concentrations during water treatment small volumes of micropollutant stock solutions were spiked into the water to achieve an initial concentration of 400 μg l for each micropollutants note that this concentration is considerably higher than environmentally relevant concentrations of micropollutants in natural water and is almost the upper limits of micropollutant concentrations in hospital wastewater kovalova et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the high concentration was used mainly to avoid the need of pretreatment of samples for analysis e g pre concentration of micropollutant by solid phase extraction that may increase the uncertainty in in micropollutant analysis in addition 100 μg l of p cba was spiked as a oh probe in the waters p cba is essentially unreactive with o3 k o3 0 15 m 1 s 1 and does not complex with transition metals pines and reckhow 2002 therefore p cba is commonly used as a oh probe to evaluate the oxidation power of oh in catalytic ozonation processes nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 pines and reckhow 2002 2 2 ozonation and catalytic ozonation treatment two sets of ozonation and catalytic ozonation treatment were conducted in a distilled water and in the selected surface water respectively approximately 250 ml of the waters was added in an acrylic column reactor 6 cm inner diameter 14 cm height placed in a 15 c water bath for catalytic ozonation experiments 6 μm transition metal ion mn2 co2 fe2 fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 or ti2 was then added in the waters followed by dosing appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions to initiate the oxidation treatment for ozonation treatment only ozone stock solution was dosed in the waters the applied ozone doses were 1 mg l for the distilled water and 3 mg l for the surface water sufficiently long reaction time was then allowed for complete o3 depletion during each batch experiment the distilled water was buffered with phosphate at ph of 7 34 and the surface water had a ph of 7 63 during the experiments the ph in both the distilled water and the surface water was stable 0 1 fluctuations duplicates were conducted for each experiment and the standard deviations are shown as error bars

2013 2 o h d t l n p c b a 0 p c b a t k o h p c b a to evaluate the oh yield from o3 decomposition during ozonation and catalytic ozonation additional experiments were conducted by adding 20 mm t buoh to the water samples prior to each oxidative treatment this large excess of t buoh can quench practically all the oh formed in the systems nothe et al 2009 the reaction of t buoh with oh leads to the formation of formaldehyde whose yield can be measured spectrophotometrically by the hantzsch method nash 1953 the oh yield is twice the formaldehyde yield during the t buoh assay nothe et al 2009 tekle rottering et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic ozonation in synthetic solutions 3 1 1 effect of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh initially ozonation and catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in buffered deionized water as shown in fig 1 a o3 depletion exhibited a two phase kinetics during all processes a rapid initial decrease followed by a slower pseudo first order kinetics depletion during ozonation alone in the absence of catalysts 56 of the dosed ozone 1 mg l was quickly consumed in the first 2 min the first sampling point see table 3 the rapid ozone depletion in the first phase which is commonly referred to as the instantaneous o3 demand iod buffle et al 2006 can be probably attributed to the fast reaction of o3 with ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive compounds diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate spiked in the deionized water however as these fast reacting compounds were largely transformed in the first phase see fig 2 a c the rate of o3 decrease became considerably smaller during the second phase of ozonation the addition of the various transition metal ions accelerated ozone depletion in deionized water to different extent which increased in the order of ti2 co2 ni2 zn2 cu2 fe3 mn2 fe2 fig 1a compared with ozonation alone ozone consumption in the first phase was increased slightly or moderately during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in addition the rate of o3 depletion during the second phase was enhanced by a factor of 1 1 1 6 compared to ozonation alone see table 3 consequently for the same applied ozone dose 1 mg l complete ozone depletion was attained within shorter reaction time during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts 25 40 min compared to ozonation alone 60 min ozone exposures measured from the area under ozone decay curves are shown for the different processes in fig 1a inset due to the faster ozone decay kinetics lower overall o3 exposures were obtained when complete ozone depletion was attained during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone see table 3 the concentration of p cba decreased generally in parallel with decreasing o3 concentration during the different processes fig 1b p cba is essentially unreactive with o3 k 0 15 m 1 s 1 and therefore is oxidized almost exclusively by oh k 5 109 m 1 s 1 during ozone based processes von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during ozonation alone some oh can be quickly generated from the reactions of o3 with electron rich moieties of ozone reactive compounds e g the deprotonated amine group of diclofenac and the activated aromatic system of gemfibrozil von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently a quick decrease of p cba concentration was observed within the first 2 min during the processes however after these electron rich moieties were quickly consumed oh could only be generated from the reaction of o3 with oh k 70 m 1 s 1 which occurs slowly at the tested ph 7 34 von gunten 2003 therefore the rate of p cba abatement became smaller as ozonation proceeded in comparison the rate of p cba abatement was enhanced by a factor of 1 2 2 5 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts see table 3 these observations indicate that the transformation of o3 to oh is accelerated by the transition metals which in turn accelerates p cba abatement during catalytic ozonation oh exposures over the reaction period back calculated from the abatement efficiencies of p cba eq 2 are shown in fig 1b inset for the different processes compared with ozonation alone oh exposures increased more rapidly during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts however due to the faster o3 depletion kinetics shorter duration of oh oxidation could be maintained during catalytic ozonation than during ozonation alone when the same o3 doses are applied in the two processes therefore the overall oh exposures obtained at complete ozone depletion were generally similar or only moderately increased 23 increase during catalytic ozonation of the synthetic solution compared to ozonation alone see table 3 these observations suggest that the addition of catalysts can substantially enhance the kinetics but to a lesser extent the yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition in the synthetic solution similar findings have been reported in some studies on the conventional peroxone process whereby hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is added during ozonation lee et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the oh yield moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed determined by the t buoh assays during ozonation and catalytic ozonation are summarized in table 3 during ozonation 0 20 moles of oh were generated from the decomposition of 1 mole o3 in the deionized water in comparison the oh yield was increased to 0 21 0 28 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts these data indicate that for the same applied ozone doses 5 40 more oh could be produced in the deionized water during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone 3 1 2 effect of catalysts on micropollutant abatement the above results indicate that due to their differing catalytic activities and reaction mechanisms with o3 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 legube and leitner 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 the various transition metals tested in this study can induce different changes in the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition as o3 and oh are the main oxidants for micropollutant abatements during catalytic ozonation nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 these catalysts resulted in different effects on micropollutant abatement fig 2 as shown in fig 2a c micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with o3 diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were quickly abated 70 90 abatements within the first 2 min during all processes regardless of the presence of catalysts when complete ozone depletion was attained ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac and gemfibrozil were almost completely eliminated 95 abatement by all processes fig 2a and b in addition moderately ozone reactive micropollutant bezafibrate were also effectively abated 87 abatement by both ozonation and catalytic ozonation fig 2c nevertheless due to the significant decrease of o3 concentration after 2 min fig 1a as well as the competitions of ozone reactive transformation products formed during micropollutant abatement von sonntag and von gunten 2012 complete abatement of bezafibrate was not achieved at the end of the treatments fig 2c compared with the two previous groups ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were abated at considerably lower rates during the treatment processes fig 2d f moreover their final abatement efficiencies at complete ozone depletion 40 60 were also significantly lower than the two previous groups generally 90 notably while the addition of the varying catalysts evidently accelerated the abatement kinetics of ozone resistant micropollutants this approach did not considerably enhance their final abatement efficiencies at complete ozone depletion 10 increase compared to ozonation alone these observations can be probably attributed to the fact that although the catalysts accelerated the kinetics of o3 transformation to oh they just slightly or moderately enhanced the oh yield and exposure in the deionized water see table 3 3 1 3 prediction of micropollutant abatement using chemical kinetic model by integrating and rearranging eq 1 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant as a function of the value of ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt can be expressed as eq 3 3 a b a t e m e n t 1 e k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t 100 based on the o3 and oh exposures determined for ozonation and catalytic ozonation table 3 the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants are predicted using eq 3 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 3 in general the abatement efficiency of micropollutants during both conventional ozonation and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts can be reasonably predicted by the model r2 0 927 0 951 syx 5 78 8 15 it is noted that the abatement efficiencies of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate seem to be somewhat overestimated by the model i e the data points deviated downward from the linear line see fig 3 these deviations can be probably attributed to several possible reasons a incomplete mixing of aqueous ozone to the entire water in batch reactors which will result in less effective micropollutant abatement than expected and b the overestimation of o3 exposures from the ozone decay curves obtained in batch reactors see previous discussion of fig 1a buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 due to the fast reactions of o3 with ozone reactive compounds e g diclofenac and gemfibrozil in the synthetic solution ozone depletion occurs very rapidly in the first milliseconds after ozone stock solutions are dosed into water matrix buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 however the time resolutions for ozone measurement in batch reactors is limited as a result ozone exposure during the initial rapid ozone decay phase i e the iod phase would be somewhat overestimated in the batch systems buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 this would in turn result in overestimation of the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants especially those with moderate o3 reactivity buffle et al 2006 lee and von gunten 2016 zucker et al 2016 by using more advanced experimental systems such as quench or stopped flow systems that allow ozone measurement with higher time resolutions e g 5 500 milliseconds o3 exposures can be more accurately measured to better predict micropollutant abatement buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 alternatively by assuming that the iod phase occurs immediately after o3 addition t 0 s and extrapolating the pseudo first order regression curves determined in the second phase to the y axis for o3 exposure integration see si fig s1 the overestimation of o3 exposure as well as gemfibrozil and bezafibrate abatements could be mitigated to a certain degree see si fig s2 kwon et al 2017 interestingly the results shown in fig 3 demonstrate that despite the differing catalytic mechanisms of the various catalysts which have not been fully understood yet kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by catalytic ozonation with these catalysts can be satisfactorily predicted using the chemical kinetic model r2 0 927 0 951 syx 5 78 8 15 this finding highlights that the model can circumvent the obstacle caused by the insufficient understanding of catalytic mechanisms and offer a practical tool for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation 3 2 catalytic ozonation in surface water to evaluate the applicability of the model in real water treatment catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in a surface water in real water matrix dissolved organic matter dom are usually the major sink of o3 and oh while the micropollutants are oxidized in competition von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition the background constituents in the water matrix e g humic substances may interact with transition metals and thus considerably change their catalytic mechanisms ma and graham 1999 nawrocki 2013 paillard et al 2008 therefore the reaction mechanisms of catalytic ozonation in real water matrix are even more complicated than in synthetic solutions nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 3 2 1 effect of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh similar to what has been observed in the deionized water the addition of the varying catalysts enhanced the kinetics of o3 depletion in the surface water for an applied ozone dose of 3 mg l complete ozone depletion took 25 min during ozonation alone but only 8 20 min during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts fig 1c in addition it seems that for a specific catalyst with the exception of ni2 the rate of ozone depletion was more significantly enhanced in the surface water than in the deionized water see table 3 the most significant differences are observed for co2 and ti2 which only marginally accelerated o3 depletion in the deionized water fig 1a but considerably accelerated o3 depletion in the surface water fig 1c these observations suggest that the transition metals especially co2 and ti2 and the background constituents of the surface water have a positive combined effect that can enhance o3 decomposition consistently many previous studies have reported that the presence of dom humic substances or carboxylic acids can enhance the catalytic effects of some transition metals e g mn2 fe2 and cu2 during homogeneous catalytic ozonation beltran et al 2005 ma and graham 1999 pines and reckhow 2002 xiao et al 2008 for example pines and reckhow 2002 reported that while the direct reaction of co2 with o3 is very slowly k 8 m 1 s 1 the complexes of co2 and oxalic acid such as co c2o4 2 can considerably accelerate o3 decomposition k 4000 m 1 s 1 due to the accelerated o3 depletion considerably lower overall o3 exposures were obtained during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone table 3 corresponding to the accelerated o3 depletion the concentration of p cba also decreased more rapidly during catalytic ozonation than during ozonation alone fig 1d during ozonation alone p cba is oxidized by oh generated mainly from o3 decomposition with dom in the surface water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the faster p cba decrease during catalytic ozonation suggests that the transformation of o3 to oh in the surface water is accelerated in the presence of transition metals in addition the final abatement efficiency of p cba at complete ozone depletion was also enhanced by 3 18 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone as a result higher overall oh exposures were obtained during catalytic ozonation than ozonation alone when the same o3 doses were applied during the processes fig 1d inset consistently t buoh assays show that the oh yield was increased from 0 27 for ozonation alone to 0 28 0 43 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts see table 3 compared with the results observed in the deionized water table 3 the addition of the catalysts especially co2 and ti2 more significantly enhanced the oh yield from o3 decomposition in the surface water this is with the exception of ni2 and zn2 which increased the oh yield more pronouncedly in the deionized water than in the surface water these observations suggest that the interaction of transition metals with water matrix constituents are very complex nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 for most catalysts tested in this study there is a synergistic effect between the catalysts and the surface water matrix that can enhance o3 transformation to oh 3 2 2 effect of catalysts on micropollutant abatement the abatement of micropollutants in the surface water during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation are shown in fig 2g l in general the results are similar to what have been observed in the deionized water see fig 2a f specifically ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were similarly abated during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts fig 2g i in contrast the kinetics and final abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were enhanced to varied extent due to the addition of the varying catalysts fig 2j l among the three ozone resistant micropollutants the abatement efficiency of ibuprofen was enhanced most significantly during catalytic ozonation this observation can be probably attributed to the higher oh rate constants of ibuprofen than the other two micropollutants see table 1 compared with the results observed in the synthetic solution fig 2d f the addition of transition metals except ni2 and zn2 enhanced the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants more pronouncedly in the surface water fig 2j l these observations are consistent with the previous finding that the addition of catalysts enhanced the oh yield and oh exposures more significantly in the surface water than in the deionized water table 3 3 2 3 prediction of micropollutant abatement using chemical kinetic model fig 4 shows that the abatement efficiencies of the micropollutants in the surface water by catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts can be reasonably predicted using the chemical kinetic model r2 0 910 0 932 syx 5 95 7 48 as has been observed in the synthetic solution fig 3 this finding confirms that the chemical kinetic model can be used to predict micropollutant abatement in real water matrix by homogeneous catalytic ozonation besides predicting micropollutant abatement efficiencies the chemical kinetic model can provide some insight into the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation as reported in table 3 the addition of transition metals decreased the overall o3 exposure but increases in the overall oh exposures during catalytic ozonation of the surface water compared to ozonation alone these changes then resulted in different effects on the abatement of micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities fig 2g l for micropollutants with high and moderate o3 reactivities they were similarly abated during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation regardless of the presence of catalysts however the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were enhanced to some extent during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone these differences suggest that micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities are abated via different mechanisms during the treatment processes according to eq 3 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant can be quickly increased from 0 to 86 5 as its ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value is increased from 0 to 2 see fig 5 however further increasing the abatement efficiency even slightly especially beyond 90 will require significant increases in the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value based on the o3 and oh exposures obtained at complete ozone depletion during ozonation and catalytic ozonation of the surface water table 3 and the o3 and oh rate constants of the micropollutants table 1 the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value for each micropollutant is calculated and shown in fig 6 for ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac and gemfibrozil the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value is essentially composed of ko3 o3 dt during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation fig 6a and b these data indicate that they are abated exclusively by o3 oxidation during all process regardless of the presence of catalysts for moderately ozone reactive micropollutants bezafibrate ko3 o3 dt also dominates the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value for all processes fig 6c which suggests that bezafibrate is primarily abated by o3 oxidation in contrast k oh oh dt constitutes the predominant fraction of the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value of ozone resistant 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen and the relative importance of k oh oh dt increased due to the addition of catalysts fig 6d f these observations indicate that ozone resistant micropollutants are predominantly abated by oh oxidation during all processes and the contribution from oh oxidation increased due to the addition of transition metals due to their high o3 rate constants the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for diclofenac and gemfibrozil during all processes are significantly higher than the value 4 6 that is required to abate the micropollutant to below the detection limit 99 abatement in addition the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for moderately ozone reactive bezafibrate are also generally higher than 3 7 for all processes where 97 abatement can be obtained according to eq 3 therefore although there are significant decrease in the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for these micropollutants during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone calculations using eq 3 predict that their final abatement efficiency will not be affected see fig 6a c in contrast although the addition of the varying catalysts increased the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values of 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen only slightly by 0 00 0 12 0 00 0 18 and 0 05 0 49 respectively see table 3 the model predicts that their abatement efficiency can be increased by 0 6 0 7 and 3 17 see fig 6d f in general the model predicted results agree well with the experimental observations and reasonably explain the reasons why the addition of the catalysts induced different changes in the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities 3 3 practical implications ozonation has been widely used for water disinfection and or oxidative treatment for many years von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with the increasing concerns of micropollutants the use of ozonation for micropollutant abatement has attracted considerable attention recently however a number of studies have shown that with the typical ozone doses applied in water treatment conventional ozonation often cannot sufficiently abate ozone resistant micropollutants in water and wastewater gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2003 yao et al 2017 2018 currently adding h2o2 to enhance o3 transformation to oh i e the conventional peroxone process is the most common practice to enhance ozone resistant micropollutants von sonntag and von gunten 2012 nevertheless h2o2 is a relative expensive chemical 1 2 1 5 usd kg h2o2 wang 2018 yao et al 2018 moreover the application of the conventional peroxone is often limited by the potential risks associated with the transportation and storage of concentrated h2o2 stocks von gunten 2018 wang 2018 therefore adding catalysts to enhance o3 transformation to oh during ozonation catalytic ozonation has been considered an possible alternative to enhance ozone resistant micropollutants although several problems have yet to be solved prior to its large scale applications for example e g leaching of toxic elements separation and deactivation of the catalysts nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 von gunten 2018 the results of this study indicate that despite the complex reaction mechanisms of catalytic ozonation the abatement efficiencies of various micropollutants can be reasonably predicted using the chemical kinetic model based on the o3 and oh exposures determined during the processes and the o3 and oh rate constants reported in literature the good correlations between the model predicted and experimentally measured results suggest that the micropollutants tested in this study do not form complexes with the transition metals which would otherwise considerably change their o3 and oh rate constants beltran et al 2005 pines and reckhow 2002 and thus cause failure of the chemical kinetic model this inference may be applied to most micropollutants during catalytic ozonation of real water matrix indeed considering that the concentrations of micropollutants are typically several orders of magnitude lower than that of dom in real water matrix transition metals are expected to complex predominantly with dom rather than with micropollutants under typical reaction conditions of homogeneous catalytic ozonation ma and graham 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 pines and reckhow 2002 therefore the chemical kinetic model may be used to predict the abatement of most micropollutants in real water matrix by homogeneous catalytic ozonation during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation with solid catalysts o3 and oh are also the main oxidants that are responsible for micropollutant abatement kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 legube and leitner 1999 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 in addition the catalyst induced enhancement of o3 transformation to oh is considered the main mechanism for enhanced abatement of ozone resistant compounds in most cases this information suggests that similar chemical kinetic models may be employed to predict micropollutant abatement by heterogeneous catalytic ozonation however adsorption can play an important role for micropollutant abatement during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation especially when catalysts with high adsorption capacity e g activated carbon are used therefore the effect of adsorption has to be taken into account when developing models for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 4 conclusions the results of this study confirm the applicability of the chemical kinetic model for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation due to their different catalytic mechanisms the varying transition metals tested in this study enhanced the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition to differing extent during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone therefore these catalysts resulted in different effects on micropollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation in general micropollutants with high and moderate reactivities with o3 diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were similarly abated during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in contrast the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were enhanced to various extent during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone overall the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants during homogeneous catalytic ozonation could be reasonably predicted by the chemical kinetic model based on the o3 and oh rate constants reported for the micropollutants and the o3 and oh exposures observed

key laboratory for emerging organic contaminants control state key joint laboratory of environmental simulation and pollution control tsinghua university beijing 100084 china corresponding author prediction of micropollutant abatements by catalytic ozonation is critical for its process design and optimization in water treatment in this study a chemical kinetic model based on ozone o3 and hydroxyl radical oh rate constants k o3 and k oh and o3 and oh exposures is proposed for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation several micropollutants with k o3 ranging from 0 15 to 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 were spiked in water matrices deionized water and surface water and then treated by ozonation alone and homogeneous catalytic ozonation with varying transition metals ti2 co2 ni2 zn2 cu2 mn2 fe2 and fe3 the addition of the varying catalysts enhanced the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition to different extent consequently for the same applied o3 doses higher oh exposures can generally be obtained at the expense of lower o3 exposures during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone the changes in o3 and oh exposures did not considerably influence the abatement of micropollutants with high and moderate o3 reactivities diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate whose abatement efficiencies were generally 90 during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid clofibric acid and ibuprofen were less effectively abated during ozonation 40 60 abatement and the addition of the varying catalysts could enhance their absolute abatement efficiencies to various extent 0 10 in the deionized water and 0 22 in the surface water during catalytic ozonation despite the differing catalytic mechanisms of the varying transition metals the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by catalytic ozonation could be satisfactorily predicted by the chemical kinetic model using the o3 and oh rate constants of the micropollutants reported in literature and the o3 and oh exposures determined during the treatment processes these results demonstrate that the chemical kinetic model can provide a useful tool for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by

ozonation micropollutants can be abated by oxidation with ozone o3 and or hydroxyl radicals oh generated from o3 decomposition with water constituents e g dissolved organic matter dom in the water matrix von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with compounds containing electron rich moieties such as phenols olefins deprotonated amines and reduced sulfur groups in contrast oh is a less selective oxidant and can rapidly oxidize almost all types of organic moieties at diffusion controlled rates 108 109 m 1 s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 many studies have shown that micropollutants with electron rich moieties can usually be efficiently eliminated by primarily o3 oxidation in a variety of water matrices e g natural water and wastewater

which can only be oxidized by oh during conventional ozonation are usually less effectively abated due to the low oh yield from o3 decomposition in real water matrices note that the oh yield is defined as moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed and reported in the range of 13 41 during conventional ozonation of natural water groundwater and surface water and municipal wastewater lee et

promote o3 transformation to oh when solid catalysts e g metal oxides and metals on supports are used i e heterogeneous catalytic ozonation o3 may be decomposed at the catalyst surface and or react with organics adsorbed on the catalyst surface to produce oh due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh higher abatement efficiencies can often be obtained for ozone resistant micropollutants during catalytic ozonation compared to conventional ozonation kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 prediction of the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants is critical for practical applications of catalytic ozonation processes in water and wastewater treatment due to the vast number of micropollutants coexisting in the water matrix many of which have no established analytical methods yet it is impractical and cost prohibitive to measure the abatement efficiencies of various micropollutants individually however while many studies have demonstrated the superiority of catalytic ozonation for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 no models have been developed for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation this problem can be probably attributed to the complex mechanisms of catalytic ozonation which have not been fully understood nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 indeed numerous catalysts have been tested in catalytic ozonation and different or even contradictory catalytic effects and mechanisms have been reported kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 due to the differing catalytic mechanisms of varying catalysts generalized prediction of micropollutant abatements by catalytic ozonation is challenging notably recent studies have shown that the abatement of micropollutants by conventional ozonation and ozone based aops such as o3 h2o2 and the electro peroxone e peroxone process can be satisfactorily predicted using a chemical kinetic model eq 1 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 wang et al 2018 1 l n p p 0 k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t where ko3 and k oh are the second order rate constant for the reaction of micropollutant p with o3 and oh respectively o 3 d t and o h are the o3 and oh exposures which are defined as the time integrated concentration of o3 and oh over a given reaction period elovitz and von gunten 1999 over the past decades the o3 and oh rate constants for a great number of micropollutants have been measured von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition the o3 and oh exposures can be readily measured for example by following the decay of o3 and a oh probe typically p chlorobenzoic acid p cba during water treatment processes elovitz and von gunten 1999 therefore this model can provide a relatively easy and convenient way to estimate the abatement levels of many micropollutants by ozone based processes lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 considering that catalytic ozonation is in nature also an ozone based aop where o3 and oh play a major role for micropollutant abatement nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 it is interesting to evaluate whether similar models can be applied in catalytic ozonation this may offer a practical way to predict micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation with varying catalysts even if the reaction mechanisms e g the catalytic mechanisms of o3 transformation to oh are not well understood the main objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the chemical kinetic model eq 1 for the prediction of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation as a first step homogeneous catalytic ozonation of micropollutants with varying transition metal ions was investigated in this study compared with heterogeneous catalytic ozonation the mechanisms of homogeneous catalytic ozonation are relatively simpler involving no adsorption effects that can complicate the catalytic mechanisms significantly therefore the chemical kinetic model can be directly applied in homogeneous catalytic ozonation without the need of correction for the adsorption effect in this study several model micropollutants with varying reactivities with o3 ko3 ranging from 0 15 to 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 were spiked in a deionized water and a surface water the waters were then treated by conventional ozonation and homogeneous catalytic ozonation with varying transition metal ions mn2 co2 fe2 fe3 ni2 ti2 zn2 or cu2 the effects of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh and micropollutant abatement were evaluated systematically based on the o3 and oh exposures observed during the treatment the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants were predicted using the chemical

generator ol80f dst ozone services canada concentrated ozone stock solutions were then prepared by continuously bubbling the ozone containg oxygen gas through milli q water that was cooled in an ice bath a surface water was collected from a reservoir in the suburban area of beijing after collection the surface water was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and stored inside polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe bottles in a refrigerator 4 c before it was used within 1 week for ozonation and catalytic ozonation experiments the main water quality parameters of the selected surface water are summarized in table 2 the background concentrations of micropollutants in the surface water were very low generally 1 μg l to facilitate the measurement of micropollutant concentrations during water treatment small volumes of micropollutant stock solutions were spiked into the water to achieve an initial concentration of 400 μg l for each micropollutants note that this concentration is considerably higher than environmentally relevant concentrations of micropollutants in natural water and is almost the upper limits of micropollutant concentrations in hospital wastewater kovalova et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the high concentration was used mainly to avoid the need of pretreatment of samples for analysis e g pre concentration of micropollutant by solid phase extraction that may increase the uncertainty in in micropollutant analysis in addition 100 μg l of p cba was spiked as a oh probe in the waters p cba is essentially unreactive with o3 k o3 0 15 m 1 s 1 and does not complex with transition metals pines and reckhow 2002 therefore p cba is commonly used as a oh probe to evaluate the oxidation power of oh in catalytic ozonation processes nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 pines and reckhow 2002 2 2 ozonation and catalytic ozonation treatment two sets of ozonation and catalytic ozonation treatment were conducted in a distilled water and in the selected surface water respectively approximately 250 ml of the waters was added in an acrylic column reactor 6 cm inner diameter 14 cm height placed in a 15 c water bath for catalytic ozonation experiments 6 μm transition metal ion mn2 co2 fe2 fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 or ti2 was then added in the waters followed by dosing appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions to initiate the oxidation treatment for ozonation treatment only ozone stock solution was dosed in the waters the applied ozone doses were 1 mg l for the distilled water and 3 mg l for the surface water sufficiently long reaction time was then allowed for complete o3 depletion during each batch experiment the distilled water was buffered with phosphate at ph of 7 34 and the surface water had a ph of 7 63 during the experiments the ph in both the distilled water and the surface water was stable 0 1 fluctuations duplicates were conducted for each experiment and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 3 analytical methods samples were taken from the reactor using a syringe at predetermined reaction times ozone concentration was measured with the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981

2013 2 o h d t l n p c b a 0 p c b a t k o h p c b a to evaluate the oh yield from o3 decomposition during ozonation and catalytic ozonation additional experiments were conducted by adding 20 mm t buoh to the water samples prior to each oxidative treatment this large excess of t buoh can quench practically all the oh formed in the systems nothe et al 2009 the reaction of t buoh with oh leads to the formation of formaldehyde whose yield can be measured spectrophotometrically by the hantzsch method nash 1953 the oh yield is twice the formaldehyde yield during the t buoh assay nothe et al 2009 tekle rottering et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic ozonation in synthetic solutions 3 1 1 effect of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh initially ozonation and catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in buffered deionized water as shown in fig 1 a o3 depletion exhibited a two phase kinetics during all processes a rapid initial decrease followed by a slower pseudo first order kinetics depletion during ozonation alone in the absence of catalysts 56 of the dosed ozone 1 mg l was quickly consumed in the first 2 min the first sampling point see table 3 the rapid ozone depletion in the first phase which is commonly referred to as the instantaneous o3 demand iod buffle et al 2006 can be probably attributed to the fast reaction of o3 with ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive compounds diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate spiked in the deionized water however as these fast reacting compounds were largely transformed in the first phase see fig 2 a c the rate of o3 decrease became considerably smaller during the second phase of ozonation the addition of the various transition metal ions accelerated ozone depletion in deionized water to different extent which increased in the order of ti2 co2 ni2 zn2 cu2 fe3 mn2 fe2 fig 1a compared with ozonation alone ozone consumption in the first phase was increased slightly or moderately during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in addition the rate of o3 depletion during the second phase was enhanced by a factor of 1 1 1 6 compared to ozonation alone see table 3 consequently for the same applied ozone dose 1 mg l complete ozone depletion was attained within shorter reaction time during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts 25 40 min compared to ozonation alone 60 min ozone exposures measured from the area under ozone decay curves are shown for the different processes in fig 1a inset due to the faster ozone decay kinetics lower overall o3 exposures were obtained when complete ozone depletion was attained during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone see table 3 the concentration of p cba decreased generally in parallel with decreasing o3 concentration during the different processes fig 1b p cba is essentially unreactive with o3 k 0 15 m 1 s 1 and therefore is oxidized almost exclusively by oh k 5 109 m 1 s 1 during ozone based processes von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during ozonation alone some oh can be quickly generated from the reactions of o3 with electron rich moieties of ozone reactive compounds e g the deprotonated amine group of diclofenac and the activated aromatic system of gemfibrozil von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently a quick decrease of p cba concentration was observed within the first 2 min during the processes however after these electron rich moieties were quickly consumed oh could only be generated from the reaction of o3 with oh k 70 m 1 s 1 which occurs slowly at the tested ph 7 34 von gunten 2003 therefore the rate of p cba abatement became smaller as ozonation proceeded in comparison the rate of p cba abatement was enhanced by a factor of 1 2 2 5 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts see table 3 these observations indicate that the transformation of o3 to oh is accelerated by the transition metals which in turn accelerates p cba abatement during catalytic ozonation oh exposures over the reaction period back calculated from the abatement efficiencies of p cba eq 2 are shown in fig 1b inset for the different processes compared with ozonation alone oh exposures increased more rapidly during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts however due to the faster o3 depletion kinetics shorter duration of oh oxidation could be maintained during catalytic ozonation than during ozonation alone when the same o3 doses are applied in the two processes therefore the overall oh exposures obtained at complete ozone depletion were generally similar or only moderately increased 23 increase during catalytic ozonation of the synthetic solution compared to ozonation alone see table 3 these observations suggest that the addition of catalysts can substantially enhance the kinetics but to a lesser extent the yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition in the synthetic solution similar findings have been reported in some studies on the conventional peroxone process whereby hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is added during ozonation lee et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the oh yield moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed determined by the t buoh assays during ozonation and catalytic ozonation are summarized in table 3 during ozonation 0 20 moles of oh were generated from the decomposition of 1 mole o3 in the deionized water in comparison the oh yield was increased to 0 21 0 28 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts these data indicate that for the same applied ozone doses 5 40 more oh could be produced in the deionized water during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone 3 1 2 effect of catalysts on micropollutant abatement the above results indicate that due to their differing catalytic activities and reaction mechanisms with o3 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 legube and leitner 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 the various transition metals tested in this study can induce different changes in the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition as o3 and oh are the main oxidants for micropollutant abatements during catalytic ozonation nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 these catalysts resulted in different effects on micropollutant abatement fig 2 as shown in fig 2a c micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with o3 diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were quickly abated 70 90 abatements within the first 2 min during all processes regardless of the presence of catalysts when complete ozone depletion was attained ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac and gemfibrozil were almost completely eliminated 95 abatement by all processes fig 2a and b in addition moderately ozone reactive micropollutant bezafibrate were also effectively abated 87 abatement by both ozonation and catalytic ozonation fig 2c nevertheless due to the significant decrease of o3 concentration after 2 min fig 1a as well as the competitions of ozone reactive transformation products formed during micropollutant abatement von sonntag and von gunten 2012 complete abatement of bezafibrate was not achieved at the end of the treatments fig 2c compared with the two previous groups ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were abated at considerably lower rates during the treatment processes fig 2d f moreover their final abatement efficiencies at complete ozone depletion 40 60 were also significantly lower than the two previous groups generally 90 notably while the addition of the varying catalysts evidently accelerated the abatement kinetics of ozone resistant micropollutants this approach did not considerably enhance their final abatement efficiencies at complete ozone depletion 10 increase compared to ozonation alone these observations can be probably attributed to the fact that although the catalysts accelerated the kinetics of o3 transformation to oh they just slightly or moderately enhanced the oh yield and exposure in the deionized water see table 3 3 1 3 prediction of micropollutant abatement using chemical kinetic model by integrating and rearranging eq 1 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant as a function of the value of ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt can be expressed as eq 3 3 a b a t e m e n t 1 e k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t 100 based on the o3 and oh exposures determined for ozonation and catalytic ozonation table 3 the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants are predicted using eq 3 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 3 in general the abatement efficiency of micropollutants during both conventional ozonation and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts can be reasonably predicted by the model r2 0 927 0 951 syx 5 78 8 15 it is noted that the abatement efficiencies of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate seem to be somewhat overestimated by the model i e the data points deviated downward from the linear line see fig 3 these deviations can be probably attributed to several possible reasons a incomplete mixing of aqueous ozone to the entire water in batch reactors which will result in less effective micropollutant abatement than expected and b the overestimation of o3 exposures from the ozone decay curves obtained in batch reactors see previous discussion of fig 1a buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 due to the fast reactions of o3 with ozone reactive compounds e g diclofenac and gemfibrozil in the synthetic solution ozone depletion occurs very rapidly in the first milliseconds after ozone stock solutions are dosed into water matrix buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 however the time resolutions for ozone measurement in batch reactors is limited as a result ozone exposure during the initial rapid ozone decay phase i e the iod phase would be somewhat overestimated in the batch systems buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 this would in turn result in overestimation of the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants especially those with moderate o3 reactivity buffle et al 2006 lee and von gunten 2016 zucker et al 2016 by using more advanced experimental systems such as quench or stopped flow systems that allow ozone measurement with higher time resolutions e g 5 500 milliseconds o3 exposures can be more accurately measured to better predict micropollutant abatement buffle et al 2006 zucker et al 2016 alternatively by assuming that the iod phase occurs immediately after o3 addition t 0 s and extrapolating the pseudo first order regression curves determined in the second phase to the y axis for o3 exposure integration see si fig s1 the overestimation of o3 exposure as well as gemfibrozil and bezafibrate abatements could be mitigated to a certain degree see si fig s2 kwon et al 2017 interestingly the results shown in fig 3 demonstrate that despite the differing catalytic mechanisms of the various catalysts which have not been fully understood yet kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by catalytic ozonation with these catalysts can be satisfactorily predicted using the chemical kinetic model r2 0 927 0 951 syx 5 78 8 15 this finding highlights that the model can circumvent the obstacle caused by the insufficient understanding of catalytic mechanisms and offer a practical tool for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation 3 2 catalytic ozonation in surface water to evaluate the applicability of the model in real water treatment catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in a surface water in real water matrix dissolved organic matter dom are usually the major sink of o3 and oh while the micropollutants are oxidized in competition von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition the background constituents in the water matrix e g humic substances may interact with transition metals and thus considerably change their catalytic mechanisms ma and graham 1999 nawrocki 2013 paillard et al 2008 therefore the reaction mechanisms of catalytic ozonation in real water matrix are even more complicated than in synthetic solutions nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 3 2 1 effect of catalysts on o3 transformation to oh similar to what has been observed in the deionized water the addition of the varying catalysts enhanced the kinetics of o3 depletion in the surface water for an applied ozone dose of 3 mg l complete ozone depletion took 25 min during ozonation alone but only 8 20 min during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts fig 1c in addition it seems that for a specific catalyst with the exception of ni2 the rate of ozone depletion was more significantly enhanced in the surface water than in the deionized water see table 3 the most significant differences are observed for co2 and ti2 which only marginally accelerated o3 depletion in the deionized water fig 1a but considerably accelerated o3 depletion in the surface water fig 1c these observations suggest that the transition metals especially co2 and ti2 and the background constituents of the surface water have a positive combined effect that can enhance o3 decomposition consistently many previous studies have reported that the presence of dom humic substances or carboxylic acids can enhance the catalytic effects of some transition metals e g mn2 fe2 and cu2 during homogeneous catalytic ozonation beltran et al 2005 ma and graham 1999 pines and reckhow 2002 xiao et al 2008 for example pines and reckhow 2002 reported that while the direct reaction of co2 with o3 is very slowly k 8 m 1 s 1 the complexes of co2 and oxalic acid such as co c2o4 2 can considerably accelerate o3 decomposition k 4000 m 1 s 1 due to the accelerated o3 depletion considerably lower overall o3 exposures were obtained during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone table 3 corresponding to the accelerated o3 depletion the concentration of p cba also decreased more rapidly during catalytic ozonation than during ozonation alone fig 1d during ozonation alone p cba is oxidized by oh generated mainly from o3 decomposition with dom in the surface water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the faster p cba decrease during catalytic ozonation suggests that the transformation of o3 to oh in the surface water is accelerated in the presence of transition metals in addition the final abatement efficiency of p cba at complete ozone depletion was also enhanced by 3 18 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone as a result higher overall oh exposures were obtained during catalytic ozonation than ozonation alone when the same o3 doses were applied during the processes fig 1d inset consistently t buoh assays show that the oh yield was increased from 0 27 for ozonation alone to 0 28 0 43 during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts see table 3 compared with the results observed in the deionized water table 3 the addition of the catalysts especially co2 and ti2 more significantly enhanced the oh yield from o3 decomposition in the surface water this is with the exception of ni2 and zn2 which increased the oh yield more pronouncedly in the deionized water than in the surface water these observations suggest that the interaction of transition metals with water matrix constituents are very complex nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 for most catalysts tested in this study there is a synergistic effect between the catalysts and the surface water matrix that can enhance o3 transformation to oh 3 2 2 effect of catalysts on micropollutant abatement the abatement of micropollutants in the surface water during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation are shown in fig 2g l in general the results are similar to what have been observed in the deionized water see fig 2a f specifically ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were similarly abated during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts fig 2g i in contrast the kinetics and final abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were enhanced to varied extent due to the addition of the varying catalysts fig 2j l among the three ozone resistant micropollutants the abatement efficiency of ibuprofen was enhanced most significantly during catalytic ozonation this observation can be probably attributed to the higher oh rate constants of ibuprofen than the other two micropollutants see table 1 compared with the results observed in the synthetic solution fig 2d f the addition of transition metals except ni2 and zn2 enhanced the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants more pronouncedly in the surface water fig 2j l these observations are consistent with the previous finding that the addition of catalysts enhanced the oh yield and oh exposures more significantly in the surface water than in the deionized water table 3 3 2 3 prediction of micropollutant abatement using chemical kinetic model fig 4 shows that the abatement efficiencies of the micropollutants in the surface water by catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts can be reasonably predicted using the chemical kinetic model r2 0 910 0 932 syx 5 95 7 48 as has been observed in the synthetic solution fig 3 this finding confirms that the chemical kinetic model can be used to predict micropollutant abatement in real water matrix by homogeneous catalytic ozonation besides predicting micropollutant abatement efficiencies the chemical kinetic model can provide some insight into the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement by catalytic ozonation as reported in table 3 the addition of transition metals decreased the overall o3 exposure but increases in the overall oh exposures during catalytic ozonation of the surface water compared to ozonation alone these changes then resulted in different effects on the abatement of micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities fig 2g l for micropollutants with high and moderate o3 reactivities they were similarly abated during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation regardless of the presence of catalysts however the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were enhanced to some extent during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone these differences suggest that micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities are abated via different mechanisms during the treatment processes according to eq 3 the abatement efficiency of a micropollutant can be quickly increased from 0 to 86 5 as its ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value is increased from 0 to 2 see fig 5 however further increasing the abatement efficiency even slightly especially beyond 90 will require significant increases in the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value based on the o3 and oh exposures obtained at complete ozone depletion during ozonation and catalytic ozonation of the surface water table 3 and the o3 and oh rate constants of the micropollutants table 1 the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value for each micropollutant is calculated and shown in fig 6 for ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac and gemfibrozil the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value is essentially composed of ko3 o3 dt during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation fig 6a and b these data indicate that they are abated exclusively by o3 oxidation during all process regardless of the presence of catalysts for moderately ozone reactive micropollutants bezafibrate ko3 o3 dt also dominates the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value for all processes fig 6c which suggests that bezafibrate is primarily abated by o3 oxidation in contrast k oh oh dt constitutes the predominant fraction of the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt value of ozone resistant 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen and the relative importance of k oh oh dt increased due to the addition of catalysts fig 6d f these observations indicate that ozone resistant micropollutants are predominantly abated by oh oxidation during all processes and the contribution from oh oxidation increased due to the addition of transition metals due to their high o3 rate constants the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for diclofenac and gemfibrozil during all processes are significantly higher than the value 4 6 that is required to abate the micropollutant to below the detection limit 99 abatement in addition the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for moderately ozone reactive bezafibrate are also generally higher than 3 7 for all processes where 97 abatement can be obtained according to eq 3 therefore although there are significant decrease in the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values for these micropollutants during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone calculations using eq 3 predict that their final abatement efficiency will not be affected see fig 6a c in contrast although the addition of the varying catalysts increased the ko3 o3 dt k oh oh dt values of 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen only slightly by 0 00 0 12 0 00 0 18 and 0 05 0 49 respectively see table 3 the model predicts that their abatement efficiency can be increased by 0 6 0 7 and 3 17 see fig 6d f in general the model predicted results agree well with the experimental observations and reasonably explain the reasons why the addition of the catalysts induced different changes in the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants with differing o3 reactivities 3 3 practical implications ozonation has been widely used for water disinfection and or oxidative treatment for many years von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with the increasing concerns of micropollutants the use of ozonation for micropollutant abatement has attracted considerable attention recently however a number of studies have shown that with the typical ozone doses applied in water treatment conventional ozonation often cannot sufficiently abate ozone resistant micropollutants in water and wastewater gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2003 yao et al 2017 2018 currently adding h2o2 to enhance o3 transformation to oh i e the conventional peroxone process is the most common practice to enhance ozone resistant micropollutants von sonntag and von gunten 2012 nevertheless h2o2 is a relative expensive chemical 1 2 1 5 usd kg h2o2 wang 2018 yao et al 2018 moreover the application of the conventional peroxone is often limited by the potential risks associated with the transportation and storage of concentrated h2o2 stocks von gunten 2018 wang 2018 therefore adding catalysts to enhance o3 transformation to oh during ozonation catalytic ozonation has been considered an possible alternative to enhance ozone resistant micropollutants although several problems have yet to be solved prior to its large scale applications for example e g leaching of toxic elements separation and deactivation of the catalysts nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 von gunten 2018 the results of this study indicate that despite the complex reaction mechanisms of catalytic ozonation the abatement efficiencies of various micropollutants can be reasonably predicted using the chemical kinetic model based on the o3 and oh exposures determined during the processes and the o3 and oh rate constants reported in literature the good correlations between the model predicted and experimentally measured results suggest that the micropollutants tested in this study do not form complexes with the transition metals which would otherwise considerably change their o3 and oh rate constants beltran et al 2005 pines and reckhow 2002 and thus cause failure of the chemical kinetic model this inference may be applied to most micropollutants during catalytic ozonation of real water matrix indeed considering that the concentrations of micropollutants are typically several orders of magnitude lower than that of dom in real water matrix transition metals are expected to complex predominantly with dom rather than with micropollutants under typical reaction conditions of homogeneous catalytic ozonation ma and graham 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 pines and reckhow 2002 therefore the chemical kinetic model may be used to predict the abatement of most micropollutants in real water matrix by homogeneous catalytic ozonation during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation with solid catalysts o3 and oh are also the main oxidants that are responsible for micropollutant abatement kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 legube and leitner 1999 nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 in addition the catalyst induced enhancement of o3 transformation to oh is considered the main mechanism for enhanced abatement of ozone resistant compounds in most cases this information suggests that similar chemical kinetic models may be employed to predict micropollutant abatement by heterogeneous catalytic ozonation however adsorption can play an important role for micropollutant abatement during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation especially when catalysts with high adsorption capacity e g activated carbon are used therefore the effect of adsorption has to be taken into account when developing models for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 4 conclusions the results of this study confirm the applicability of the chemical kinetic model for generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation due to their different catalytic mechanisms the varying transition metals tested in this study enhanced the kinetics and yield of oh formation from o3 decomposition to differing extent during catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone therefore these catalysts resulted in different effects on micropollutant abatement during catalytic ozonation in general micropollutants with high and moderate reactivities with o3 diclofenac gemfibrozil and bezafibrate were similarly abated during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts in contrast the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants 2 4 d clofibric acid and ibuprofen were enhanced to various extent during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone overall the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants during homogeneous catalytic ozonation could be reasonably predicted by the chemical kinetic model based on the o3 and oh rate constants reported for the micropollutants and the o3 and oh exposures observed

electrical power sources such as solar and wind power can be potentially used to make the mes a more green and sustainable technology for co2 conversion ammam et al 2016 liu et al 2015 however the widespread utilization of these renewable energy sources is limited by their fluctuating and intermittent characteristic gao et al 2017 nevin et al 2010 no strategy to directly convert co2 to value added chemicals and biofuels in mes process without an external power supply electron sources has yet been proposed salinity gradient energy as a remarkable green energy can be directly converted into

or desalination brine and low salinity effluents from wastewater treatment logan and elimelech 2012 or waste heat and thermolytic streams cusick et al 2012 however this energy source has not been effectively captured and stored yip et al 2016 capturing this energy will require the development of efficient energy conversion technologies recently one hybrid microbial electrochemical technology

carboxylic acids and alcohols without external power supply which has never been reported before in this study we investigated for the first time the feasibility of mrec for co2 to acetate acetate is an important biosynthetic precursor for a wide variety commodity chemicals and higher value biofuels syntheses jourdin et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the key operating parameters such as flow rate of synthetic seawater and river water co2 feeding rate and salinity ratio were investigated furthermore the wastewater treatment efficiency in the anode chamber of mrec was also evaluated by integrated red and mes system salinity gradient energy and waste biomass energy in wastewater were captured into liquid chemicals the mrec is not only a novel method for simultaneous production of biofuels and wastewater treatment but also offers a potential platform technology for salinity gradient energy harvesting and storage and co2 sequestration 2 materials and methods 2 1 organism source and culture conditions sporomusa ovata dsm 2662 as one of the most efficient species for mes was obtained from the deutsche sammlung mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsmz initially s ovata was routinely maintained in the growth medium dsmz 311 omitting betaine fructose casitone and resazurin under h2 co2 80 20 atmosphere subsequently s ovata was pre cultured for three generations in modified phosphate buffer enhanced medium see supplementary information under h2 co2 80 20 atmosphere the pre cultivated cultures were used as inoculum source for the subsequent experiments all the experiments were performed at 30 c the growth of s ovata was determined by measuring optical density od at 600 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometry spectronic 20d thermo scientific denmark 2 2 setup and operation of mrec reactor the mrec was composed of anode chamber red units and cathode chamber fig 1 the anode electrode was a carbon fiber brush 5 0 cm diameter 5 0 cm length mill rose usa which was heated to 450 c for 30 min in a muffle furnace before use the cathode was a 4 cm 4 cm ti mesh with coated pt c 5 mg cm 2 connected with 1 mm diameter ti wire the reference electrode was an ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs she which was placed 0 5 cm away from the cathode electrode to measure the cathode potential the anode and cathode chambers were separated by one red stack the working volume of anode and cathode chamber was 100 and 80 ml respectively the red stack comprised five cell pairs with a cell pair area of 3 3 cm2 each consisting of an anion exchange membrane aem ami 7001 membrane international nj and a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 membrane international nj with alternately high concentration nacl solution as synthetic seawater hc and low concentration nacl solution as synthetic fresh water lc flowing in between cusick et al 2012 kim and logan 2011 hc and lc solutions were 35 g l 1 and 0 35 g l 1 nacl respectively the flow rate of hc and lc solutions was 0 5 ml min 1 expect otherwise mentioned the voltage across one external resistor r 10 ω was recorded every 30 min using a digital multimeter model 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa electrical current was calculated by ohm s low i u r the anode electrode was pre acclimated in microbial fuel cell as described previously li et al 2017 the anolyte was domestic wastewater collected from primary clarifier at lyngby wastewater treatment plant copenhagen denmark amended with sodium acetate 1 2 g cod l 1 to avoid anode performance limitation which could reduce the cathode reaction performance the anode chamber was operated at continuous feed mode watson et al 2015 li et al 2017a with flow rate of 50 ml d 1 the organic loading rate was 0 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 while the cathode chamber was operated in batch mode the catholyte was circulated over a recirculation bottle of 250 ml with a peristaltic pump at 10 ml min 1 the catholyte was modified phosphate buffer enhanced medium with varied phosphate concentration as shown in supplementary information table s1 the total volume of catholyte was 200 ml prior to each batch experiment the anode and cathode chambers and recirculation bottles were purged with n2 for 30 min the cultures of s ovata 10 ml grown on h2 co2 80 20 were injected in the cathode chamber and then the cathode chamber was continuously bubbled through a diffuser with 100 co2 pumped by peristaltic pump in order to prevent contamination by other microbes the cathode chamber diffuser and recirculation bottle connected with cathode chamber were sterilized by autoclave before use the effluent gas from the cathode chamber was collected in a gas bag different co2 flow rates were used to investigate their effect on electron recovery and performance of the co2 conversion process the co2 flow rates were chosen based on literature and pre test all experiments were conducted in batch mode at 30 c and were repeated at least in triplicate all removed catholyte during sampling 3 ml sample was replaced with an equal amount of medium 2 3 analytical methods and calculations the concentration and composition of products in the cathode chamber of the mrec were determined by gas chromatography gc 2010 shimadzu as described previously bassani et al 2015 the samples were obtained from the reactor and through 0 22 μm filter if not analyzed immediately the filtered samples were stored at 20 c in vials to prevent the loss of volatile compounds the effluent gases of cathode chamber were analyzed by gc tcd mgc 82 12 microlab a s denmark according to previous described bassani et al 2015 the ph of samples were monitored by using a ph meter phm 210 ph meter radiometer denmark chemical oxygen demand cod was measured according to the apha standard method analysis of variance anova was used as the data assessing method since the salinity gradient contributed the major part of energy generation the energy consumption in the mrec system was mainly confined to the pumping system the electrical energy consumption was measured using a sparometer type nzr230 s l energitekinik denmark coulombic efficiency ce in anode compartment was calculated

3 results and discussion 3 1 the feasibility of mrec for co2 conversion the evolution of acetate production in the cathode chamber of mrec is shown in fig 2 a the acetate concentration increased gradually over time and reached 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 7 33 0 36 mm after 6 days with production rate of 151 7 7 5 mmol m 2 d 1 ethanol was also detected but the maximum concentration was much lower 39 1 8 5 mg l 1 than that of acetate fig 2b to confirm that the salinity gradient energy was the main driving force to the microbial electrosynthesis process a serious of control experiments were carried out in which current open circuit s ovata salinity gradient and exoelectrogenic microorganisms were systematically omitted fig 2a and b no acetate and ethanol were detected under the conditions of open circuit without inoculation of s ovata and no salinity gradient control experiment conditions shown in fig s2 only 85 6 11 9 mg l 1 of acetate was detected without exoelectrogenic microorganisms in anode the control experiments also proved that the acetate in anode chamber didn t diffuse to cathode chamber the growth of s ovata was observed for all these conditions fig s1 cell yields and growth rates were higher in mrec than that of control experiments these results highlight the ability of mrec to convert co2 to acetate and ethanol by using salinity gradient energy the mechanism behind co2 reduction at the cathode using s ovata as biocatalyst could follow the wood ljungdahl pathway same as conventional biological co2 reduction ammam et al 2016 blanchet et al 2015 there was a steady generation of current 2 7 0 1 ma over time with the cathode potential of 0 680 0 025 v fig 2c and d during the co2 reduction process the current was higher than that without inoculation of s ovata this behavior indicated that the injection of s ovata can enhance the flow of electrons at the cathode thereby leading to the increase of current however the mechanism of this increased electron acceptance ability of the cathode containing the s ovata still needs to be elucidated after 5 5 days the current of mrec began to drop fig 2c the maximum concentration of acetate and ethanol can be obtained at day 6 fig 2a and b the cod removal efficiency in anode chamber reached 85 26 0 88 and the ph of anodic effluent was stable at 6 8 0 2 on the basis of cod removal and current generation the coulombic efficiency was 37 82 0 98 this low coulombic efficiency could be due to the cod of wastewater also could be removed by the nonexoelectrogenic microorganisms in wastewater the total recovery of electrons in acetate and ethanol was 89 15 6 51 of which 75 94 3 73 electrons were recovered in acetate which is close to that of the mes systems using s ovata as biocatalyst 71 93 aryal et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 the rest of electrons might be attributed to the biomass production e g the growth of bacterium or other products e g h2 the above results demonstrated that mrec could be an alternative approach for conversion of co2 to value added chemicals and wastewater treatment as previously reported blanchet et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the acetate could be synthesized through two routes route 1 and 2 using s ovata as inoculum in mes process the route 1 mainly occurred in mes with biofilm on cathode where microbial cells gain electrons from electrode and convert co2 to acetate or other chemical rabaey and rozendal 2010 in another route route 2 electrons were transfer from the cathode to s ovata via molecular h2 which can be in situ generated and thereby facilitating the rate and yield of acetate generation blanchet et al 2015 in this study no significant h2 was detected in the effluent gases from the cathode chamber however micro h2 bubbles were observed on the surface of cathode in addition 33 ml h2 was collected in the without inoculation of s ovata mrec with low production rate 0 23 ml h 1 fig s2 the solubility of h2 is very low at the experimental conditions 0 002 g l 1 water patil et al 2015 in situ h2 production with low production rate could lead to supersaturation which can drive efficient gas transfer to the liquid and enhance the participation of planktonic s ovata furthermore the h2 can also be consumed to support further conversion of acetate to ethanol the above results supported that the h2 route route 2 was playing a key role in the mrec process this observation is in agreement with the previous mes study blanchet et al 2015 route 1 2co2 8h 8e ch3cooh 2h2o route 2 2h 2e h2 2co2 4h2 ch3cooh 2h2o the bioconversion of co2 to chemicals is strongly dependent on ph jourdin et al 2015 xiang et al 2017 due to the consumption of co2 and protons at cathode the ph of catholyte would increase to over 7 if no extra ph control was applied marshall et al 2013 however it was observed here that the constant addition of co2 and phosphate enhanced medium prevented the ph exceeding 7 within 6 days fig s3 after 6 days with the proton consumption during the synthesis process the catholyte ph started to slowly increase despite the phosphate buffer e g the ph increased to 7 65 at day 7 furthermore the cathode potential became less negative from 0 680 0 025 to 0 392 0 028 v and the current decreased significantly from 2 7 0 1 to 0 81 0 09 ma at day 7 the less negative cathode potential and low current led to the stop of h2 production which resulted in stagnation of the acetate concentration after 6 days 3 2 effect of synthetic seawater hc and freshwater lc flow rate acetate and ethanol production were evaluated in batch mode under different flow rates of hc and lc fig 3 a the concentration of acetate via flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 of the high and low saline solution was 3 3 fold higher than that of 0 1 ml min 1 the increase in acetate production with the hc and lc flow rate from 0 5 to 1 ml min 1 was smaller than that obtained when increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 further increase to 1 5 ml min 1 there was no significant improvement of acetate production the maximum current of the mrec was observed at the beginning of every batch experiment and then it decreased to relatively low level fig 3b however the current gradually increased after 12 h along with growth of s ovata following inoculation and then it became stable this steady current could be increased by increasing the hc and lc flow rate within a certain range for example when the flow rate was increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 the current level increased significantly from 1 1 0 09 to 2 7 0 1 ma further increase the flow rate to 1 5 ml min 1 led only to a slight increase from 2 7 0 1 to 2 9 0 1 ma in the current even though the increase of current is beneficial to the microbial capturing of co2 the electron recovery in acetate has slight decreased from 89 15 6 51 at 0 5 ml min 1 to 87 69 5 23 at 1 5 ml min 1 the ethanol concentration has slightly increase from 39 1 8 5 to 56 2 7 2 mg l 1 with the increasing of hc and lc flow rate fig 3a since the pumping contributed the major electrical energy consumption during mrec operation a low hc and lc flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 with high production performance is preferred for future commercial application 3 3 effect of co2 flow rate the co2 as the substrate of acetate production in mes its flow rate could affect the acetate production rate marshall et al 2013 patil et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 the acetate production rates increased with the increasing of co2 flow rate in a certain range at the low co2 flow rate of 280 ml d 1 12 5 mmol c d 1 the maximum acetate concentration was 236 7 28 3 mg l 1 with production rate of 82 2 9 8 mmol m 2 d 1 at increased co2 flow rates 550 and 1100 ml d 1 the acetate concentration was stabilized at maximum value 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 a similar trend was also observed in a previous study where the co2 flow rates over a certain level 500 and 700 ml d 1 had no substantial effect on the acetate concentration in mes patil et al 2015 the consumption rate of co2 was also significantly influenced by the flow rate of co2 a maximum average co2 consumption rate of 516 ml d 1 23 04 mmol c d 1 was reached at the flow rate of 550 ml d 1 24 55 mmol c d 1 the increase of acetate production and co2 consumption rates with increasing of co2 flow rate could be due to increased co2 supply meanwhile the increasing of co2 flow rate can led to acidification of the medium which is favorable for co2 reduction in the metabolic pathways of s ovata when the co2 flow rate was increased further 1100 ml d 1 acetate production and co2 consumption did not change further therefore 550 ml d 1 was considered as the optimum co2 flow rate in mrec process interestingly co2 flow rates had no obvious influence on the current generation 2 7 0 1 ma and the concentration of ethanol it is important to stress here again that above values are based on the average during all the triplicates experiments based on carbon balance only 2 47 0 12 of supplied co2 was found to be converted to acetate and ethanol besides consumption for bacterial growth co2 could also be dissolved in medium and ionized into co3 2 or hco3 ions jin et al 2017 further analyses of the products in addition to acetate and ethanol were beyond the scope of this study further strategies for improving the co2 consumption rate and conversion efficiency are thus required in future studies for accelerating the commercial application furthermore inorganic carbon e g bicarbonate could also be used as feedstock for acetate production in the microbial electrosynthesis processes patil et al 2015 and it could even replace the phosphate buffer and thereby reducing the cost of media 80 media cost reduction labelle and may 2017 3 4 effect of buffer concentration in cathode the medium has a direct impact on the biosynthetic capability of bacteria in mes ammam et al 2016 phosphate enhanced medium could enhance the acetate production in s ovata electrosynthesis process liu et al 2015 first phosphate buffer can prevent medium ph change in cathode that may be benefit for the growth of s ovata secondly the addition of phosphate buffer can increase the conductivity of the medium which will decrease the resistance of medium and promote electron transfer to investigate the effect of phosphate buffer concentration on the performance of co2 conversion in mrec we examined five different concentrations of phosphate buffer enhanced medium without changing other medium component table s1 the acetate concentration increased by 15 4 fold from 28 6 5 9 to 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 with the increasing of phosphate concentration from 0 to 50 mm fig 5 compared with the 0 and 25 mm phosphate the buffer capacity of 50 mm phosphate prevented ph increase fig s4 this implies that enhanced cathode performance in mrec is attributed to the use of phosphate buffer enhanced medium when the phosphate buffer concentration was increased to 100 mm the acetate concentration increased to 477 5 33 2 mg l 1 the highest electron recovery of 94 4 3 9 was obtained at 100 mm of phosphate buffer however when the buffer concentration was further increased to 200 mm the growth of s ovata was inhibited and the acetate concentration decreased to 365 7 24 3 mg l 1 these results demonstrated the feasibility to enhance the rate of microbial electrosynthesis by modification of medium using 50 mm phosphate buffer phosphate buffer with high concentration would help for the mass transport of protons and stabilize the medium ph during microbial electrosynthesis process 3 5 effect of salinity gradient three salinity gradients at fixed solutions flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 and fixed co2 flow rate 550 ml d 1 were chosen to test their effects on the performance of mrec fig 6 salinity gradient of 100 hc 35 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl representative of seawater and river water and salinity gradient of 200 hc 70 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl and 300 hc 105 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl were the three salinity gradients levels used for the investigation as shown in fig 6a the acetate production ranged from 439 8 21 5 salinity gradient 100 to 467 4 28 7 mg l 1 salinity gradient 300 the maximum current slightly increased from 2 7 0 1 to 3 2 0 1 ma with the increasing of salinity gradient from 100 to 300 fig 6b comparatively the cathode potential was stable at nearly the same level approx 0 680 0 025 v at different salinity gradients this result could explain the insignificant change in acetate and ethanol production at varied salinity gradients the electron recovery over 85 was also insignificantly influenced by the salinity gradient the results demonstrated that the salinity gradients range from 100 to 300 with fixed lc solution at 0 35 mg l 1 have no significant influence on the co2 conversion to acetate and ethanol in the mrec 3 6 wastewater treatment and coulombic efficiency the cod removal from the domestic wastewater in the anode chamber of mrec were not affected substantially by the hc and lc solutions flow rate co2 flow rate phosphate concentration and salinity gradient see table s3 however the columbic efficiency increased with hc and lc flow rate 0 1 1 5 ml min 1 from 37 82 0 98 to 39 54 0 67 furthermore the columbic efficiency increased from 36 29 0 97 to 39 92 0 93 with phosphate concentration increasing from 25 to 200 mm there were no significant changes with different co2 flow rate 280 1100 ml d 1 and salinity gradients 100 300 the columbic efficiency of mrec was lower than that of mec 89 1 6 1 and microbial reverse electrodialysis methanogenesis cell 74 81 for biosynthesis process luo et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 which could be due to the occurrence of other processes in the system e g anaerobic digestion beside the above mentioned parameters the ph of effluent was maintained at 6 5 7 1 as results of continuous flow of wastewater into anode chamber which excludes possible inhibition of anodic microorganisms by non optimal ph kim and logan 2011 on the basis above the mrec could achieve wastewater treatment in addition to chemicals production 3 7 significance and perspectives this work for the first time outlined the applicability of the mrec for the conversion of co2 to acetate and ethanol which integrated the strengths of salinity gradient energy capture device i e red and bacterium based biocatalysts ammam et al 2016 and blanchet et al 2015 also reported that the s ovata can convert co2 to acetate and ethanol in mes system compared to electrical driven mes although the production efficiency is low see table 1 the mrec replaced electricity energy from power grid with renewable salinity gradient energy to directly drive the acetate and ethanol production form co2 due to the fact that mixed microbial sources have some advantages over pure cultures such as no need of sterile conditions no risk of strain degradation and with higher production yield mixed cultures have been widely studied in mes systems jourdin et al 2015 patil et al 2015 thus mixed cultures could also be used in the mrec system in the future for the conversion of co2 to valuable products in addition to acetate and ethanol production the mrec could also be used to produce a variety of value added chemicals upon the choice of biocatalysts for the synthesis furthermore the mrec could also be a potential method for wastewater treatment through the anode chamber although post treatment might be needed even though this study used acetate sodium amended domestic wastewater for proof of concept the mrec could use various kinds of organics such as municipal wastewaters and fermentation wastewaters as substrate in the anode chamber of mrec watson et al 2015 hidayat et al 2017 economic viability is always the key challenge for new technology with respect to practical application economic analysis on acetate production in mes has been recently reported christodoulou et al 2017 christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 in the mrec the costs include operating and capital costs the capital costs of mrec are approx 1030 m 3 in denmark zhang and angelidaki 2016 the operating costs would be the electrical energy consumption for pumping and reagent costs our lab scale system consumed electrical energy of 0 426 0 462 kwh d 1 25 27 kwh g acetate for pumping system in order to make mrec more economical future examinations on mrec will need to focus on the systems upscaling based on previous economic analysis of acetate production in mes and practical implementation the mrec would be economical if the acetate production reach up to 685 790 g m 2 d 1 jourdin et al 2015 2016 furthermore in next generation designs we are also targeting higher efficiencies through improvement of peripheral limitations such as co2 mass transport in the electrolyte reactor structure and cathode material aryal et al 2017a tremblay et al 2017 the energy efficiency of mrec could be improved by reducing the red stack resistance since the commercial red stack has a lower stack resistance than the lab scale red luo et al 2014 the energy efficiency of mrec for conversion of co2 to acetate could be improved by using commercial red stack 4 conclusions the salinity gradient energy enabled effective current to drive the conversion of co2 into value added chemicals in cathode chamber of mrec high cod removal 91 15 0 96 in the anode chamber was also obtained which may enable effective wastewater treatment in addition to bioproduction the mrec process was mainly affected by the medium buffer capability and salinity gradient high acetate and ethanol concentration of 477 5 33 2 and 46 2 8 2 mg l 1 were obtained with production rate of 165 79 11 52 and 25 11 4 46 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively all these features indicated that mrec is a promising approach for co2 reduction moreover the outcomes of this work also pave the way for conversion of co2 and storage of salinity gradient energy the mrec system will establish a starting point for conversion of co2 to valuable chemicals and biofuels by using renewable energy salinity gradient energy as driving source acknowledgments the authors

19483,biological conversion of co2 to value added chemicals and biofuels has emerged as an attractive strategy to address the energy and environmental concerns caused by the over reliance on fossil fuels in this study an innovative microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cell mrec which combines the strengths of reverse electrodialysis red and microbial electrosynthesis technology platforms was developed to achieve efficient co2 to value chemicals bioconversion by using the salinity gradient energy as driven energy sources in the mrec maximum acetate and ethanol concentrations

indicates that 94 4 3 9 of the electrons derived from wastewater and salinity gradient were recovered in acetate and ethanol this work for the first time proved the potential of innovative mrec

costs of mes should be further reduced in order to be economically competitive and environmentally sustainable christodoulou et al 2017 christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 in this context renewable electrical power sources such as solar and wind power can be potentially used to make the mes a more green and sustainable technology for co2 conversion ammam et al 2016 liu et al 2015 however the widespread utilization of these renewable energy sources is limited by their fluctuating and intermittent characteristic gao et al 2017 nevin et al 2010 no strategy to directly convert co2 to value added chemicals and biofuels in mes process without an external power supply electron sources has yet been proposed salinity gradient energy as a remarkable green energy can be directly converted into electrical power by using reverse electrodialysis stack red ramon et al 2011 in addition salinity gradient energy is abundant and found in various environments such as in the seawater and river water or desalination brine and low salinity effluents from wastewater treatment logan and elimelech 2012 or waste heat and thermolytic streams cusick et al 2012 however this energy source has not been effectively captured and stored yip et al 2016 capturing this energy will require the development of efficient energy conversion technologies recently one hybrid microbial electrochemical technology named microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cell mrec which replace external power supply with red to drive the production of h2 cusick et al 2012 kim and logan 2011 zhu et al 2014 ch4 luo et al 2014 and h2o2 labelle and may 2017 has been reported in this context mrec could be a cost effective and efficient platform technology for conversion of co2 to other valuable chemicals e g carboxylic acids and alcohols without external power supply which has never been reported before in this study we investigated for the first time the feasibility of mrec for co2 to acetate acetate is an important biosynthetic precursor for a wide variety commodity chemicals and higher value biofuels syntheses jourdin et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the key operating parameters such as flow rate of synthetic seawater and river water co2 feeding rate and salinity ratio were investigated furthermore the wastewater treatment efficiency in the anode chamber of mrec was also evaluated by integrated red and mes system salinity gradient energy and waste biomass energy in wastewater were captured into liquid chemicals the mrec is not only a novel method for simultaneous production of biofuels and wastewater treatment but also offers a potential platform technology for salinity gradient energy harvesting and storage and co2 sequestration 2 materials and methods 2 1 organism source and culture conditions sporomusa ovata dsm 2662 as one of the most efficient species for mes was obtained from the deutsche sammlung mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsmz initially s ovata was routinely maintained in the growth medium dsmz 311 omitting betaine fructose casitone and resazurin under h2 co2 80 20 atmosphere subsequently s ovata was pre cultured for three generations in modified phosphate buffer enhanced medium see supplementary information under h2 co2 80 20 atmosphere the pre cultivated cultures were used as inoculum source for the subsequent experiments all the experiments were performed at 30 c the growth of s ovata was determined by measuring optical density od at 600 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometry spectronic 20d thermo scientific denmark 2 2 setup and operation of mrec reactor the mrec was composed of anode chamber red units and cathode chamber fig 1 the anode electrode was a carbon fiber brush 5 0 cm diameter 5 0 cm length mill rose usa which was heated to 450 c for 30 min in a muffle furnace before use the cathode was a 4 cm 4 cm ti mesh with coated pt c 5 mg cm 2 connected with 1 mm diameter ti wire the reference electrode was an ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs she which was placed 0 5 cm away from the cathode electrode to measure the cathode potential the anode and cathode chambers were separated by one red stack the working volume of anode and cathode chamber was 100 and 80 ml respectively the red stack comprised five cell pairs with a cell pair area of 3 3 cm2 each consisting of an anion exchange membrane aem ami 7001 membrane international nj and a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 membrane international nj with alternately high concentration nacl solution as synthetic seawater hc and low concentration nacl solution as synthetic fresh water lc flowing in between cusick et al 2012 kim and logan 2011 hc and lc solutions were 35 g l 1 and 0 35 g l 1 nacl respectively the flow rate of hc and lc solutions was 0 5 ml min 1 expect otherwise mentioned the voltage across one external resistor r 10 ω was recorded every 30 min using a digital multimeter model 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa electrical current was calculated by ohm s low i u r the anode electrode was pre acclimated in microbial fuel cell as described previously li et al 2017 the anolyte was domestic wastewater collected from primary clarifier at lyngby wastewater treatment plant copenhagen denmark amended with sodium acetate 1 2 g cod l 1 to avoid anode performance limitation which could reduce the cathode reaction performance the anode chamber was operated at continuous feed mode watson et al 2015 li et al 2017a with flow rate of 50 ml d 1 the organic loading rate was 0 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 while the cathode chamber was operated in batch mode the catholyte was circulated over a recirculation bottle of 250 ml with a peristaltic pump at 10 ml min 1 the catholyte was modified phosphate buffer enhanced medium with varied phosphate concentration as shown in supplementary information table s1 the total volume of catholyte was 200 ml prior to each batch experiment the anode and cathode chambers and recirculation bottles were purged with n2 for 30 min the cultures of s ovata 10 ml grown on h2 co2 80 20 were injected in the cathode chamber and then the cathode chamber was continuously bubbled through a diffuser with 100 co2 pumped by peristaltic pump in order to prevent contamination by other microbes the cathode chamber diffuser and recirculation bottle connected with cathode chamber were sterilized by autoclave before use the effluent gas from the cathode chamber was collected in a gas bag different co2 flow rates were used to investigate their effect on electron recovery and performance of the co2 conversion process the co2 flow rates were chosen based on literature and pre test all experiments were conducted in batch mode at 30 c and were repeated at least in triplicate all removed catholyte during sampling 3 ml sample was replaced with an equal amount of medium 2 3 analytical methods and calculations the concentration and composition of products in the cathode chamber of the mrec were determined by gas chromatography gc 2010 shimadzu as described previously bassani et al 2015 the samples were obtained from the reactor and through 0 22 μm filter if not analyzed immediately the filtered samples were stored at 20 c in vials to prevent the loss of volatile compounds the effluent gases of cathode chamber were analyzed by gc tcd mgc 82 12 microlab a s denmark according to previous described bassani et al 2015 the ph of samples were monitored by using a ph meter phm 210 ph meter radiometer denmark chemical oxygen demand cod was measured according to the apha standard method analysis of variance anova was used as the data assessing method since the salinity gradient contributed the major part of energy generation the energy consumption in the mrec system was mainly confined to the pumping system the electrical energy consumption was measured using a sparometer type nzr230 s l energitekinik denmark coulombic efficiency ce in anode compartment was calculated

3 results and discussion 3 1 the feasibility of mrec for co2 conversion the evolution of acetate production in the cathode chamber of mrec is shown in fig 2 a the acetate concentration increased gradually over time and reached 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 7 33 0 36 mm after 6 days with production rate of 151 7 7 5 mmol m 2 d 1 ethanol was also detected but the maximum concentration was much lower 39 1 8 5 mg l 1 than that of acetate fig 2b to confirm that the salinity gradient energy was the main driving force to the microbial electrosynthesis process a serious of control experiments were carried out in which current open circuit s ovata salinity gradient and exoelectrogenic microorganisms were systematically omitted fig 2a and b no acetate and ethanol were detected under the conditions of open circuit without inoculation of s ovata and no salinity gradient control experiment conditions shown in fig s2 only 85 6 11 9 mg l 1 of acetate was detected without exoelectrogenic microorganisms in anode the control experiments also proved that the acetate in anode chamber didn t diffuse to cathode chamber the growth of s ovata was observed for all these conditions fig s1 cell yields and growth rates were higher in mrec than that of control experiments these results highlight the ability of mrec to convert co2 to acetate and ethanol by using salinity gradient energy the mechanism behind co2 reduction at the cathode using s ovata as biocatalyst could follow the wood ljungdahl pathway same as conventional biological co2 reduction ammam et al 2016 blanchet et al 2015 there was a steady generation of current 2 7 0 1 ma over time with the cathode potential of 0 680 0 025 v fig 2c and d during the co2 reduction process the current was higher than that without inoculation of s ovata this behavior indicated that the injection of s ovata can enhance the flow of electrons at the cathode thereby leading to the increase of current however the mechanism of this increased electron acceptance ability of the cathode containing the s ovata still needs to be elucidated after 5 5 days the current of mrec began to drop fig 2c the maximum concentration of acetate and ethanol can be obtained at day 6 fig 2a and b the cod removal efficiency in anode chamber reached 85 26 0 88 and the ph of anodic effluent was stable at 6 8 0 2 on the basis of cod removal and current generation the coulombic efficiency was 37 82 0 98 this low coulombic efficiency could be due to the cod of wastewater also could be removed by the nonexoelectrogenic microorganisms in wastewater the total recovery of electrons in acetate and ethanol was 89 15 6 51 of which 75 94 3 73 electrons were recovered in acetate which is close to that of the mes systems using s ovata as biocatalyst 71 93 aryal et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 the rest of electrons might be attributed to the biomass production e g the growth of bacterium or other products e g h2 the above results demonstrated that mrec could be an alternative approach for conversion of co2 to value added chemicals and wastewater treatment as previously reported blanchet et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the acetate could be synthesized through two routes route 1 and 2 using s ovata as inoculum in mes process the route 1 mainly occurred in mes with biofilm on cathode where microbial cells gain electrons from electrode and convert co2 to acetate or other chemical rabaey and rozendal 2010 in another route route 2 electrons were transfer from the cathode to s ovata via molecular h2 which can be in situ generated and thereby facilitating the rate and yield of acetate generation blanchet et al 2015 in this study no significant h2 was detected in the effluent gases from the cathode chamber however micro h2 bubbles were observed on the surface of cathode in addition 33 ml h2 was collected in the without inoculation of s ovata mrec with low production rate 0 23 ml h 1 fig s2 the solubility of h2 is very low at the experimental conditions 0 002 g l 1 water patil et al 2015 in situ h2 production with low production rate could lead to supersaturation which can drive efficient gas transfer to the liquid and enhance the participation of planktonic s ovata furthermore the h2 can also be consumed to support further conversion of acetate to ethanol the above results supported that the h2 route route 2 was playing a key role in the mrec process this observation is in agreement with the previous mes study blanchet et al 2015 route 1 2co2 8h 8e ch3cooh 2h2o route 2 2h 2e h2 2co2 4h2 ch3cooh 2h2o the bioconversion of co2 to chemicals is strongly dependent on ph jourdin et al 2015 xiang et al 2017 due to the consumption of co2 and protons at cathode the ph of catholyte would increase to over 7 if no extra ph control was applied marshall et al 2013 however it was observed here that the constant addition of co2 and phosphate enhanced medium prevented the ph exceeding 7 within 6 days fig s3 after 6 days with the proton consumption during the synthesis process the catholyte ph started to slowly increase despite the phosphate buffer e g the ph increased to 7 65 at day 7 furthermore the cathode potential became less negative from 0 680 0 025 to 0 392 0 028 v and the current decreased significantly from 2 7 0 1 to 0 81 0 09 ma at day 7 the less negative cathode potential and low current led to the stop of h2 production which resulted in stagnation of the acetate concentration after 6 days 3 2 effect of synthetic seawater hc and freshwater lc flow rate acetate and ethanol production were evaluated in batch mode under different flow rates of hc and lc fig 3 a the concentration of acetate via flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 of the high and low saline solution was 3 3 fold higher than that of 0 1 ml min 1 the increase in acetate production with the hc and lc flow rate from 0 5 to 1 ml min 1 was smaller than that obtained when increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 further increase to 1 5 ml min 1 there was no significant improvement of acetate production the maximum current of the mrec was observed at the beginning of every batch experiment and then it decreased to relatively low level fig 3b however the current gradually increased after 12 h along with growth of s ovata following inoculation and then it became stable this steady current could be increased by increasing the hc and lc flow rate within a certain range for example when the flow rate was increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 the current level increased significantly from 1 1 0 09 to 2 7 0 1 ma further increase the flow rate to 1 5 ml min 1 led only to a slight increase from 2 7 0 1 to 2 9 0 1 ma in the current even though the increase of current is beneficial to the microbial capturing of co2 the electron recovery in acetate has slight decreased from 89 15 6 51 at 0 5 ml min 1 to 87 69 5 23 at 1 5 ml min 1 the ethanol concentration has slightly increase from 39 1 8 5 to 56 2 7 2 mg l 1 with the increasing of hc and lc flow rate fig 3a since the pumping contributed the major electrical energy consumption during mrec operation a low hc and lc flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 with high production performance is preferred for future commercial application 3 3 effect of co2 flow rate the co2 as the substrate of acetate production in mes its flow rate could affect the acetate production rate marshall et al 2013 patil et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 the acetate production rates increased with the increasing of co2 flow rate in a certain range at the low co2 flow rate of 280 ml d 1 12 5 mmol c d 1 the maximum acetate concentration was 236 7 28 3 mg l 1 with production rate of 82 2 9 8 mmol m 2 d 1 at increased co2 flow rates 550 and 1100 ml d 1 the acetate concentration was stabilized at maximum value 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 a similar trend was also observed in a previous study where the co2 flow rates over a certain level 500 and 700 ml d 1 had no substantial effect on the acetate concentration in mes patil et al 2015 the consumption rate of co2 was also significantly influenced by the flow rate of co2 a maximum average co2 consumption rate of 516 ml d 1 23 04 mmol c d 1 was reached at the flow rate of 550 ml d 1 24 55 mmol c d 1 the increase of acetate production and co2 consumption rates with increasing of co2 flow rate could be due to increased co2 supply meanwhile the increasing of co2 flow rate can led to acidification of the medium which is favorable for co2 reduction in the metabolic pathways of s ovata when the co2 flow rate was increased further 1100 ml d 1 acetate production and co2 consumption did not change further therefore 550 ml d 1 was considered as the optimum co2 flow rate in mrec process interestingly co2 flow rates had no obvious influence on the current generation 2 7 0 1 ma and the concentration of ethanol it is important to stress here again that above values are based on the average during all the triplicates experiments based on carbon balance only 2 47 0 12 of supplied co2 was found to be converted to acetate and ethanol besides consumption for bacterial growth co2 could also be dissolved in medium and ionized into co3 2 or hco3 ions jin et al 2017 further analyses of the products in addition to acetate and ethanol were beyond the scope of this study further strategies for improving the co2 consumption rate and conversion efficiency are thus required in future studies for accelerating the commercial application furthermore inorganic carbon e g bicarbonate could also be used as feedstock for acetate production in the microbial electrosynthesis processes patil et al 2015 and it could even replace the phosphate buffer and thereby reducing the cost of media 80 media cost reduction labelle and may 2017 3 4 effect of buffer concentration in cathode the medium has a direct impact on the biosynthetic capability of bacteria in mes ammam et al 2016 phosphate enhanced medium could enhance the acetate production in s ovata electrosynthesis process liu et al 2015 first phosphate buffer can prevent medium ph change in cathode that may be benefit for the growth of s ovata secondly the addition of phosphate buffer can increase the conductivity of the medium which will decrease the resistance of medium and promote electron transfer to investigate the effect of phosphate buffer concentration on the performance of co2 conversion in mrec we examined five different concentrations of phosphate buffer enhanced medium without changing other medium component table s1 the acetate concentration increased by 15 4 fold from 28 6 5 9 to 439 8 21 5 mg l 1 with the increasing of phosphate concentration from 0 to 50 mm fig 5 compared with the 0 and 25 mm phosphate the buffer capacity of 50 mm phosphate prevented ph increase fig s4 this implies that enhanced cathode performance in mrec is attributed to the use of phosphate buffer enhanced medium when the phosphate buffer concentration was increased to 100 mm the acetate concentration increased to 477 5 33 2 mg l 1 the highest electron recovery of 94 4 3 9 was obtained at 100 mm of phosphate buffer however when the buffer concentration was further increased to 200 mm the growth of s ovata was inhibited and the acetate concentration decreased to 365 7 24 3 mg l 1 these results demonstrated the feasibility to enhance the rate of microbial electrosynthesis by modification of medium using 50 mm phosphate buffer phosphate buffer with high concentration would help for the mass transport of protons and stabilize the medium ph during microbial electrosynthesis process 3 5 effect of salinity gradient three salinity gradients at fixed solutions flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 and fixed co2 flow rate 550 ml d 1 were chosen to test their effects on the performance of mrec fig 6 salinity gradient of 100 hc 35 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl representative of seawater and river water and salinity gradient of 200 hc 70 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl and 300 hc 105 g l 1 nacl lc 0 35 g l 1 nacl were the three salinity gradients levels used for the investigation as shown in fig 6a the acetate production ranged from 439 8 21 5 salinity gradient 100 to 467 4 28 7 mg l 1 salinity gradient 300 the maximum current slightly increased from 2 7 0 1 to 3 2 0 1 ma with the increasing of salinity gradient from 100 to 300 fig 6b comparatively the cathode potential was stable at nearly the same level approx 0 680 0 025 v at different salinity gradients this result could explain the insignificant change in acetate and ethanol production at varied salinity gradients the electron recovery over 85 was also insignificantly influenced by the salinity gradient the results demonstrated that the salinity gradients range from 100 to 300 with fixed lc solution at 0 35 mg l 1 have no significant influence on the co2 conversion to acetate and ethanol in the mrec 3 6 wastewater treatment and coulombic efficiency the cod removal from the domestic wastewater in the anode chamber of mrec were not affected substantially by the hc and lc solutions flow rate co2 flow rate phosphate concentration and salinity gradient see table s3 however the columbic efficiency increased with hc and lc flow rate 0 1 1 5 ml min 1 from 37 82 0 98 to 39 54 0 67 furthermore the columbic efficiency increased from 36 29 0 97 to 39 92 0 93 with phosphate concentration increasing from 25 to 200 mm there were no significant changes with different co2 flow rate 280 1100 ml d 1 and salinity gradients 100 300 the columbic efficiency of mrec was lower than that of mec 89 1 6 1 and microbial reverse electrodialysis methanogenesis cell 74 81 for biosynthesis process luo et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 which could be due to the occurrence of other processes in the system e g anaerobic digestion beside the above mentioned parameters the ph of effluent was maintained at 6 5 7 1 as results of continuous flow of wastewater into anode chamber which excludes possible inhibition of anodic microorganisms by non optimal ph kim and logan 2011 on the basis above the mrec could achieve wastewater treatment in addition to chemicals production 3 7 significance and perspectives this work for the first time outlined the applicability of the mrec for the conversion of co2 to acetate and ethanol which integrated the strengths of salinity gradient energy capture device i e red and bacterium based biocatalysts ammam et al 2016 and blanchet et al 2015 also reported that the s ovata can convert co2 to acetate and ethanol in mes system compared to electrical driven mes although the production efficiency is low see table 1 the mrec replaced electricity energy from power grid with renewable salinity gradient energy to directly drive the acetate and ethanol production form co2 due to the fact that mixed microbial sources have some advantages over pure cultures such as no need of sterile conditions no risk of strain degradation and with higher production yield mixed cultures have been widely studied in mes systems jourdin et al 2015 patil et al 2015 thus mixed cultures could also be used in the mrec system in the future for the conversion of co2 to valuable products in addition to acetate and ethanol production the mrec could also be used to produce a variety of value added chemicals upon the choice of biocatalysts for the synthesis furthermore the mrec could also be a potential method for wastewater treatment through the anode chamber although post treatment might be needed even though this study used acetate sodium amended domestic wastewater for proof of concept the mrec could use various kinds of organics such as municipal wastewaters and fermentation wastewaters as substrate in the anode chamber of mrec watson et al 2015 hidayat et al 2017 economic viability is always the key challenge for new technology with respect to practical application economic analysis on acetate production in mes has been recently reported christodoulou et al 2017 christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 in the mrec the costs include operating and capital costs the capital costs of mrec are approx 1030 m 3 in denmark zhang and angelidaki 2016 the operating costs would be the electrical energy consumption for pumping and reagent costs our lab scale system consumed electrical energy of 0 426 0 462 kwh d 1 25 27 kwh g acetate for pumping system in order to make mrec more economical future examinations on mrec will need to focus on the systems upscaling based on previous economic analysis of acetate production in mes and practical implementation the mrec would be economical if the acetate production reach up to 685 790 g m 2 d 1 jourdin et al 2015 2016 furthermore in next generation designs we are also targeting higher efficiencies through improvement of peripheral limitations such as co2 mass transport in the electrolyte reactor structure and cathode material aryal et al 2017a tremblay et al 2017 the energy efficiency of mrec could be improved by reducing the red stack resistance since the commercial red stack has a lower stack resistance than the lab scale red luo et al 2014 the energy efficiency of mrec for conversion of co2 to acetate could be improved by using commercial red stack 4 conclusions the salinity gradient energy enabled effective current to drive the conversion of co2 into value added chemicals in cathode chamber of mrec high cod removal 91 15 0 96 in the anode chamber was also obtained which may enable effective wastewater treatment in addition to bioproduction the mrec process was mainly affected by the medium buffer capability and salinity gradient high acetate and ethanol concentration of 477 5 33 2 and 46 2 8 2 mg l 1 were obtained with production rate of 165 79 11 52 and 25 11 4 46 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively all these features indicated that mrec is a promising approach for co2 reduction moreover the outcomes of this work also pave the way for conversion of co2 and storage of salinity gradient energy the mrec system will establish a starting point for conversion of co2 to valuable chemicals and biofuels by using renewable energy salinity gradient energy as driving source acknowledgments the authors

metabolites this is the first study to investigate the effect of the conventional coagulant polyaluminium ferric chloride pafc on removal of oscillatoria sp and the behavior of oscillatoria sp cells in sludges formed from different dosages of pafc control optimum and overdose system during storage was also studied oscillatoria sp cells can be removed efficiently by coagulation of pafc the adverse environmental stresses of sludge such as lack of light and anoxic environment decrease cell viability and induce the increase of superoxide dismutase activity sod and malondialdehyde content mda in oscillatoria sp cells during the first 4 days because oscillatoria sp can adapt to the low light and hypoxic circumstances in sludge gradually the cells regrow with prolonged storage time compared to planktonic microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii regrowth of oscillatoria sp during storage may present a bigger threat even though microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will be damaged and release toxic compounds growth rates of algae in coagulated systems were lower than that in control system because of the restriction of flocs it is worth noting that the chlorophyll a level was increased by a factor of 3 5 in the optimal dose system and worse the overdose system increased by a factor of 6 in chlorophyll a after 8 d storage due to the benefit of higher fe levels concentrations of extracellular geosmin and cylindrospermopsin also increased during storage especially after 4 d and varied in the following sequence for a given storage duration control system overdose system optimum system overall due to decrease of sod and mda in oscillatoria sp cells after 4 d storage algae cells regrew rapidly especially in overdose system hence sludge should be treated within 4 d and excess pafc dosing should be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords oscillatoria sp pafc geosmin cylindrospermopsin sludge storage 1 introduction due to the effects of eutrophication and global climate change the blooming of harmful cyanobacteria is becoming exacerbated which can directly cause deterioration in the quality of drinking water through the production of toxic and odorous metabolites yang et al 2008 schindler et al 2012 oscillatoria a genus of benthic filamentous cyanobacterium has been reported increasingly since the early 1990s and can form dense surface blooms especially under eutrophic and calm stratified conditions watkinson et al 2005 for example it was found that 95 of algae present in a 2015 algal bloom in a reservoir in songkhla southern thailand was oscillatoria sp thammasane and kaosol 2016 oscillatoria can release a part of intracellular 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib geosmin gsm and cyanotoxins into water during growth phase wu and juttner 1988 2 mib and gsm are semi volatile compounds that can impart earthy musty taste and odor to water at very low odor threshold concentrations 2 mib and gsm are detectable by consumers at approximately 10 ng l newcombe and dixon 2006 which can engender a deterioration in the environmental amenity more directly and quickly by causing disgust among consumers than by poisoning through ingestion of cyanotoxins hence the threshold limit value of the odor compound in drinking water is 10 ng l in china mh and sac 2006 and less than 3 threshold odor numbers in the us usepa 2012 oscillatoria can also release cyanotoxins such as microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsin cyn into the surrounding water who 2008 mcs are the most widespread of the cyanobacterial toxins

animal morbidity merel et al 2013 moreira et al 2013 the malodorous materials can decrease water quality meanwhile it is hard to remove them by the conventional drinking water treatment processes including chlorine disinfection newcombe and dixon 2006 the traditional coagulation process is also inefficient at removing toxins sun et al 2012 2013 fortunately a large proportion of the taste and odor compounds and toxins are contained in the healthy oscillatoria cells newcombe 2009 wert et al 2014 hence efficient removal of intact oscillatoria cells without causing the release of additional taste and odor compounds and toxins is the most effective way of ensuring the safety of drinking water coagulation is usually the most effective unit operation for removing cyanobacterial cells in typical drinking water treatment plants chow et al 1999 because oscillatoria is one of the most notorious cyanobacteria like microcystis the removal of oscillatoria has attracted attention and there have been several relevant studies recently mohamed 2016 studied the effect of al2 so4 3 a common coagulant on removal of oscillatoria in a drinking water treatment plant and found that al2 so4 3 was ineffective for complete removal of oscillatoria furthermore thammasane and kaosol 2016 investigated the removal efficiency for alum polyaluminium chloride pacl combined pacl alum and combined pacl ferric chloride on oscillatoria by jar testing their results showed that the maximum removals of turbidity 97 14 and chlorophyll a 99 67 can be achieved from the combined pacl alum treatment dosage ratio 3 1 or 60 20 mg l pafc is known to be the most popular conventional coagulant in drinking water treatment plants as it combines the advantages of polyaluminium chloride and polyferric chloride such as strong capacity for adsorption bridging and a wide range of ph adaptation yet there has been no research on the use of pafc to remove oscillatoria in addition it is notable that the risk of additional toxin release may be created or enhanced due to chemical or mechanical stress suffered by cell membranes during coagulation processes although unicellular microcystis can be efficiently removed by coagulation without causing additional release of intracellular toxins according to our previous studies sun et al 2012 li et al 2015 there may be some differences for the multicellular filamentous oscillatoria li et al 2018 studied the effect of pafc on multicellular filamentous cylindrospermopsis raciborskii during coagulation and found that although cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells can be removed intact under optimum coagulation conditions higher dosages of pafc 10 mg l triggered additional cyn release to the best of our knowledge there is no study relating the release of taste and odor compounds and toxins during coagulation of oscillatoria after the coagulation and sedimentation processes the filamentous oscillatoria can be held in a solid phase namely the drinking water sludge which has a volume equivalent to 4 7 of the total drinking water produced razali et al 2007 sun et al 2015 unfortunately in many countries especially in developing countries such as china and india most of the drinking water sludge is discharged into drainage systems or surrounding natural waters directly without any treatment or disposed of as waste to a landfill after being dewatered yang et al 2006 ahmad et al 2016 according to our previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 even though the microcystis aeruginosa cells remained basically intact in pafc sludge after 10 d storage some of the intracellular mcs began to be released after 4 d storage for cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the cells in pafc sludge would lyse after 6 d storage li et al 2018 compared with the behaviors of planktonic microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the benthic oscillatoria cells in sludge may behave differently what is the behavior of oscillatoria cells in sludge and will high levels of toxins or odor taste compounds be released into the surrounding waters and cause secondary pollution up to now no study of oscillatoria cells in the flocs sludge during the storage processes has been related hence the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the optimum dosage of pafc coagulant for efficiently removing oscillatoria and the effect of coagulation on oscillatoria sp cells 2 to analyze the impact of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells condition and the release of odor toxin metabolites during floc storage and 3 to evaluate the response mechanisms of oscillatoria during the floc storage process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 oscillatoria sp culture oscillatoria sp fachb 528 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was used as the model alga in this study this strain was grown in bg11 medium with a light dark cycle 12 h 12 h and constant temperature 25 c under 2000 lux illumination the algae were routinely sub cultured to maintain growth within the late exponential phase for experiments 2 1 2 raw water experiments were performed with water from queshan reservoir an important drinking water source in jinan china raw water was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane shanghai mili membrane separation technology co china to remove natural algae and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the raw water were ph 8 46 turbidity 1 26 ntu chemical oxygen demand mn 14 4 mg l dissolved oxygen 8 84 mg l ammonia nitrogen 0 18 mg l total nitrogen 2 2 mg l total phosphorus 0 03 mg l alkalinity 131 9 mg l al 87 5 μg l and fe 54 3 μg l respectively 2 1 3 chemicals pafc was purchased from gongyi yongxing biochemical materials co china the main parameters of the pafc were relative density 1 25 20 c alumina content 8 10 iron oxide content 1 2 and basicity 65 90 the pafc stock solution was prepared at 5 g l ph 4 44 2 2 coagulation experiments oscillatoria sp culture 105 cells ml was mixed with raw water to achieve a final cell density of 104 cells ml to simulate a maximum algal density without algal clumps for this study based on empirical values from conventional water treatment 16 experimental systems were designed according to an orthogonal test scheme to optimize the coagulant dosage and rapid slow mixing velocities a six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china was used to perform coagulation optimization experiments at room temperature 25 1 c each 1 l sample was dosed with pafc stock solution to achieve a predetermined concentration of coagulant when the rapid mixing began after coagulation samples were settled for 30 min under quiescent conditions to obtain the flocs formed into sludge and supernatants the removal efficiency in each system was measured through od680 the absorbance at 680 nm a measure of cell density with a uv 2450 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan after removing 930 ml of supernatant 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge remained for a control without coagulation the sample 1 l was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and the cells were then re suspended into the raw water to make up 70 ml forming a coagulant free sludge all cyanobacteria containing sludge samples were then housed in an incubator at 25 c under 2000 lux illumination with the 12 h 12 h light dark cycle for up to 8 d the sludge samples were drawn every two days for analysis throughout the storage period 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 cell enumeration as oscillatoria sp cells can assemble to form a filamentous structure the cells are difficult to count and measure with a haemocytometer in this study an inverted fluorescence microscope and plankton counting chamber were used to measure filament length and total particles the inverted fluorescence microscope was used to determine the length of a filament and the average length of cells measure cell length randomly 10 times and hence computes the mean length from which the counting error was estimated to be 20 the information on total filament length and average cell length was combined to give the cell concentration the oscillatoria sp cultures also required screening through a 100 μm mesh screen in order to prevent clogging of the flow cell which means only filaments 100 μm in length were used to conduct the testing wert et al 2014 the counting conditions and corresponding od680 are given in table s1 the results shown in table s1 were calculated as in the following formula number of cells total filament length average cell length cell density cells l 5 104 number of cells the standard curve between od680 and number of cells was followed number of cells 35347 od 680 37 312 r2 0 9991 2 3 2 chlorophyll a content analysis chlorophyll a contents of the sludges during storage were investigated every two days as follows 4 ml of sludge was sampled and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was discarded and 4 ml of 99 9 methanol was added to the centrifuge tube mixed well and stored in darkness at 45 c for 24 h the optical densities of the extracts at 652 4 665 2 and 750 nm were determined using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan and the content of chlorophyll a was calculated according to the following equation lichtenthaler 1987 chlorophyll a μg ml 16 72 a 665 2 9 16 a 652 4 absorbences at 652 4 and 665 2 nm were corrected for turbidity by subtracting absorbance at 750 nm 2 3 3 chlorophyll a autofluorescence analysis to explore the change of cell viability during the sludge storage period chlorophyll a autofluorescence of the flocs was observed using a fluorescence microscope te2000 nikon japan fitted with filters including exciter filter ex510 560 dichroic mirror dm575 and barrier filter ba590 the red emission spectra were captured using a ccd camera li et al 2015 2 3 4 scanning electron microscope sem analysis to directly assess the surface information and morphology of oscillatoria sp cells during the storage sem analysis was conducted according to the method of xu et al 2016 the treated samples were examined with an sem s 4100 hitachi japan at 3 kv 2 3 5 cell membrane permeability ph value and turbidity analysis the variations in cell membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage were measured according to our previous method xu et al 2017 the ph and turbidity of the dewatering water separated from sludge samples by centrifugation 4000 rpm for 5 min were measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c lei ci china and a 1900c turbidimeter hach co shanghai china respectively 2 3 6 physiological indicators sludge samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to collect algal cells then cells were re suspended with phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 and homogenized by an ultrasonic cell pulverizer jy92 2d xinzhi co china under ice bath cooling with total time of 10 min 600 w ultrasonic time 2 s rest time 8 s after that the homogenate was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min and the cell free enzyme supernatant was maintained at 20 c for further use meng et al 2015 intracellular protein was determined following the bradford method bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as the standard malondialdehyde mda content was measured by a colorimetric method shiu and lee 2005 superoxide dismutase sod activity was measured according to the method of beauchamp and fridovich 1971 mda and sod results are expressed in units of nmol mgprot and u mgprot respectively 2 3 7 extracellular odor and toxin analysis the changes in extracellular odor 2 mib and gsm and toxin mcs and cyn component concentrations in the sludge samples during storage were investigated sludge samples were drawn every two days and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min the centrate was filtered through 0 45 μm mili ca membranes for 2 mib and gsm measurement 25 ml filtered samples were firstly pre concentrated using solid phase micro extraction manual devices supelco usa yuan et al 2013 the adsorbed compounds were then thermally desorbed from the solid phase micro extraction fiber directly into the injection port of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and quantitatively analyzed using selected ion monitoring mode yuan et al 2013 the concentrations of extracellular cyn and mcs were determined using a beacon cylindrospermopsin elisa kit beacon analytical systems maine usa and a beacon microcystin elisa kit beacon analytical systems maine usa the method used for the measurement of cyn and mcs by elisa was based on the methods of mohamed and al sheri 2013 and sun et al 2012 respectively 2 3 8 floc properties during the coagulation process a mastersizer 2000 malvern uk a laser diffraction instrument was used to monitor dynamic floc size size measurements of flocs were taken every 30 s during the process of coagulation and the results were recorded automatically by computer the size data were expressed as equivalent volumetric diameters and the floc size was characterized by the median volumetric diameter d 50 the fractal dimension d f of flocs was measured on the mastersizer 2000 using a small angle laser light scattering method with a 632 8 nm laser light beam lin et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation optimization experiments and effect of shear on oscillatoria sp cells the efficiencies of oscillatoria sp cell removal under different coagulation conditions are given in table 1 it can be seen that compared to the effect of rapid slow mixing velocity the effect of coagulant dosage on removal efficiency is more drastic the removal of algal cells increased markedly when the coagulant dosage increased from 2 5 to 5 mg l and the removal efficiency stayed nearly at the same level with increase in the pafc dosage from 5 to 7 5 mg l however the removal efficiency showed a sharp decrease when the dosage of pafc rose to 10 mg l table 1 usually the negatively charged oscillatoria sp could be effectively removed by positively charged pafc through charge neutralization whereas excess cationic charges will result in charge reversal and thus reduce the removal efficiency gonzalez torres et al 2014 furthermore it can be seen that system 6 with a removal efficiency of nearly 100 manifested the optimum coagulation conditions 5 0 mg l pafc dose 200 rpm rapid mixing velocity 0 5 min rapid mixing time 80 rpm slow mixing velocity and 30 min slow mixing time table 1 mixing which aims to disperse coagulants quickly and form flocs perfectly is an important part of the conventional water treatment process yet the shear stress may induce lysis of the oscillatoria sp cells to identify the effect of shear on oscillatoria sp cells the oscillatoria sp cells were stirred under the aforementioned optimum coagulation conditions without coagulant to avoid the dual effect of chemical treatment and shear on oscillatoria sp cells after stirring the extracellular cyn concentration was measured and the result was 11 6 0 3 μg l which was similar to the result of extracellular cyn before stirring 11 58 0 2 μg l these results show that no intracellular cyn was released after stirring and the pressure imparted by optimal stirring had a negligible impact on the integrity of the cells 3 2 effects of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during floc storage even though the optimum dosage of pafc to remove oscillatoria sp was 5 mg l the pafc dosage may be larger than 5 mg l in the drinking water treatment plant to effectively remove all types of pollutant from raw water hence the effects of overdosing pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during storage were also studied the stirring conditions in the overdosed system were the same as in the optimum system which has a relatively high removal efficiency of oscillatoria sp cells 85 0 21 under 10 mg l pafc the cell viability of oscillatoria sp in flocs represents the risk of oscillatoria sp cells regrowing when the sludge is discharged into the natural environment hence the effect of pafc with different dosages 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l as the control optimum and overdose system respectively on the viability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage was investigated chlorophyll a autofluorescence was used as a measure of cell viability fig 1 it can be seen that the cell viabilities were similar in the control system and the coagulated systems after 0 d storage as shown in fig 1 a 0 b 0 and c 0 which means that coagulation had no immediate effect on cell viability it was also found that although the cell viability decreased gradually in all three systems after 2 d storage the cells maintained a certain viability even after 8 d storage furthermore it is worth noting that the flocs became loose after 4 d storage in both the optimum and overdose systems figure s1 signifying that deflocculation of oscillatoria sp filaments had occurred the variations in chlorophyll a content were observed in order to analyze the condition of oscillatoria sp cells from days 0 2 4 6 and 8 in the three systems and the results are shown in fig 2 a it is interesting to note that the content of chlorophyll a increased with prolonged storage time in all three systems especially after 6 d storage and chlorophyll a content varied in the following sequence for a given storage duration control system overdose system optimum system according to the results of chlorophyll a autofluorescence analysis fig 1 the single cell viability was reduced however the content of chlorophyll a rose during storage which means that the oscillatoria sp cells grew during storage especially after 6 d due to the limitations imposed by the sludge environment the growth rates of algal cells in the optimum and overdose systems were lower than that in the control system because the flocs became loose after 6 d storage fig 1 the proliferation of cells was increased considerably in optimum and overdose systems usually ferric acts as a cofactor on a variety of enzymes and has an obvious promotive effect on microalgal growth rueter and petersen 1987 as a basic element involved in synthesizing chlorophyll a and promoting inorganic salt adsorption iron has shown a significant effect on growth of oscillatoria sp cells he 2012 found that the optimum dosage of fe3 to promote oscillatoria sp growth was 0 516 2 581 mg l according to our previous study xu et al 2016 the concentration of fe was 80 7 7 4 μg l in the sludge after addition of 15 mg l pafc therefore the fe level should be below 80 7 7 4 μg l in the current study because the maximum pafc dosage used was 10 mg l the increase in fe concentration will be beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells hence the content of chlorophyll a was higher in the overdosed system for the same storage duration the al concentration would be 240 2 15 1 μg l if 15 mg l pafc was added according to our previous study xu et al 2016 therefore the al level in the present study should be below 240 2 15 1 μg l according to the u s environmental protection agency us epa gostomski 1990 gensemer and playle 1999 total al concentrations ranging from 460 μg l to 6480 μg l will be toxic to freshwater algae which suggests that the al level in our study would have no effect on the cells to verify the variations in chlorophyll a content concentrations of intracellular protein were measured during the storage period as shown in fig 2 b the results were similar to those for chlorophyll a further verifying the results above sem analysis is a visual method that images a sample in the process producing signals that contain information about the sample s surface topography composition and other properties thiberge et al 2004 to verify the integrity of algal cells during storage the samples in the three systems were subjected to sem analysis as shown in fig 2 c no differences were observed after storage of any of the three systems and the cells remained intact after 6 d 3 3 proposed mechanisms involved in the action of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during floc storage although the chlorophyll a levels in the three systems increased during storage the cell viabilities declined after 4 d implying that external stimuli possibly from the surrounding pafc coagulation sludge such as chemical stimulation lack of light or anoxic environment affect oscillatoria sp cells during storage to test the effect of external stimuli on cells during storage their physiological characteristics were investigated sod an enzyme that scavenges reactive oxygen species ros can defend against cellular ros as an antioxidative defense mechanism to help cells cope with oxidative stress changes in sod activity was used to analyze the level of cellular oxidative damage myouga et al 2008 the results in fig 3 a demonstrate that sod activity in the three systems increased in the first 4 days and then declined this suggests that due to the adverse environmental stresses sod activity went up during the first 4 days however the algal cells adapted to the adverse environmental stresses with prolonged storage time resulting in the decrease of sod activity furthermore it was found that the sod level in the control system was higher than that in the optimum and overdose systems which may be due to the protection afforded by the presence of flocs xu et al 2016 mda as the decomposition product of membrane lipid peroxidation has been utilized frequently as a biomarker for cellular oxidative damage cai et al 2009 from fig 3 b it can be seen that mda content in all of the three systems underwent a cumulative increase over the first 4 days and then stabilised or slightly dropped with prolonged storage time this supports the results of sod activity in fig 3 a due to the protection offered by the sludge environment xu et al 2016 the level of mda in the control system was higher than those in the optimum and overdose systems furthermore it is notable that the mda content in the optimum system was lower than that in overdose system throughout the storage period to confirm these mda results membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage was also measured fig 3 c these results show that the level of cell membrane permeability in the three systems increased after 6 d storage and the cell membrane permeability varied in the following sequence given the same storage duration control system overdose system optimum system because of the higher fe concentration which is beneficial to cell growth in the overdose system the cell membrane permeability or mda content in the overdose system should be lower than that in the optimum system however the opposite result was observed in fig 3 b and c which may be due to differing floc properties such as floc size and density produced by different doses of pafc to evaluate this hypothesis the characteristics of the flocs during coagulation were measured and the results are given in fig 3 d the initial median diameter d 50 in the control system was about 90 μm and grew rapidly once pafc was dosed pafc flocs in the optimum system grew rapidly during the first 10 min and then remained stable and the final d 50 value of the flocs was about 370 μm in contrast the flocs in the overdose system gradually grew to become much larger about 440 μm than those in the optimum system in addition the fractal structure of flocs was analyzed through the measurement of fractal dimension d f which could be obtained by the exponential relation between mass and particle size rieker et al 2000 and could indicate the development of aggregate structure during the formation of flocs cao et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 d the fractal dimensions of pafc flocs in the optimum and overdose systems were 2 38 and 2 69 respectively bridgeman et al 2008 reported that higher d f values indicate more compact structures while flocs with lower d f values are looser and more open therefore our results demonstrate that pafc flocs in the overdosed system were more compact than pafc flocs in the optimum system hence the higher cell membrane permeability and mda content in the overdose system may be due to the higher floc size and density which was not beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells based on the above discussion due to the adverse environmental stresses an excess of ros may be produced in oscillatoria sp cells during the first several days in the three systems because sod was the first line of resistance against ros sod activity was then induced in response to the oxidative stress over the first 4 days resulting in the increases of mda content and cell membrane permeability thereafter benthic oscillatoria sp cells adapted to the sludge environment the sod activity in cells declined and mda content stabilised or dropped slightly after 4 8 days storage in the three systems because of the protection afforded by the flocs the increases of sod activity and mda content in the cells that had been coagulated were lower than for uncoagulated cells even though the higher level of fe may be beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells in the overdose system the higher floc size and density which was not conducive to cell growth may result in the higher sod activity and mda content in oscillatoria sp cells in comparison to the optimum system 3 4 effects of oscillatoria sp cells on water quality of dewatering water during floc storage as shown in fig 4 a the ph values were 7 82 0 06 7 68 0 07 and 7 54 0 02 in the control optimum and overdose systems respectively after 0 d storage the decline in the ph value after coagulation in the optimum and overdose systems may be due to the hydrolysis of fe3 and al3 during coagulation li et al 2015 and hence the ph decreased more in the overdose system because of the higher pafc dosage it was then observed that the ph of the sludge increased slowly over the first 4 days and then decreased cyanobacteria are usually alkaliphiles brock 1973 and the intracellular ph of cyanobacteria has been reported to be higher than the external ph by up to 0 5 1 0 ph units when the external ph was about 7 0 giraldez ruiz et al 1997 hence the increase of ph during the first 4 days may be due to the secretion of the intracellular substances to protect oscillatoria sp cells against the external stress the gradual decline in the ph value after 4 d storage in the three systems may be due to the further hydrolysis of residual fe3 and al3 xu et al 2017 due to the coagulation effect the turbidities in the supernatants varied in the following sequence after 0 d storage control system optimum system overdose system fig 4 b furthermore because of the proliferation of cells the deflocculation of oscillatoria sp filaments and the secretion of the intracellular matter turbidity gradually rose with increasing storage time it is notable that the turbidity was arranged in the following sequence after 6 d storage control system overdose system optimum system which is in line with the variations of chlorophyll a in the sludges oscillatoria sp cells can usually produce and release odor compounds such as gsm and 2 mib the occurrence of the taste and odor compounds such as gsm and 2 mib will affect the organoleptic quality of the drinking water zoschke et al 2012 hence the variations in extracellular gsm and 2 mib during storage are important to understand although 2 mib was not detected in this study gsm was detected in all samples except those after 0 d storage for which the gsm concentration was below the limit of detection due to the low cell densities and gsm concentrations control samples using oscillatoria sp cells showed that an uncapped bottle resulted in negligible loss of gsm due to volatilization compared to a tightly capped bottle which is similar to the finding of wert et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 4 c the concentration of gsm increased with prolonged storage and the level in the control system was clearly higher than in the optimum and overdose systems there may be two reasons for this 1 the faster growth rate of oscillatoria sp cells in the control system compared to the optimum and overdose systems produced and released more gsm huang et al 2007 and or 2 the adsorption of gsm by al and fe hydrolysates in the optimum and overdose systems reduced the extracellular gsm concentrations wang et al 2018 furthermore it was found that the level of gsm in the overdose system was higher than that in the optimum system after 4 d storage which suggests that although more gsm could be adsorbed following the higher dose of pafc in the overdose system the faster proliferation and higher cell membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells could still produce and release more gsm aside from releasing odor compounds oscillatoria sp cells can also produce toxic metabolites such as mcs and cyn which pose threats to the safety of drinking water supplies extracellular mcs and cyn during storage were therefore assessed in the three systems despite extracellular mcs not being detected the changes in extracellular cyn were significant in the three systems after 8 d storage as can be seen in fig 4 d extracellular cyn content kept increasing in the three systems and the level of extracellular cyn after 4 d storage followed the sequence control system overdose system optimum system the higher level of extracellular cyn in the control system may also be due to the higher cell density in that system and adsorption on pafc flocs in the optimum and overdose systems which is in line with the results for extracellular gsm the extracellular cyn concentration in the optimum system was lower than that in overdose system also similar to the results for extracellular gsm which implies that despite the stronger adsorption of cyn in the overdose system the higher cell density and membrane permeability can still liberate more cyn 3 5 comparison between the behaviors of oscillatoria sp and microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii during sludge storage like microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii oscillatoria sp is one of the most notorious cyanobacteria and also commonly exists in drinking water sources after the processes of pafc coagulation and sedimentation the oscillatoria sp microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will be partitioned into the drinking water sludge and their behaviors during storage are presented in table 2 according to our previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 although the microcystis aeruginosa cells remained basically intact after 10 d storage the cell viability was low and some of the intracellular mcs began to be released after 4 d storage for cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the cells would lyse after 6 d storage li et al 2018 the different behaviours of microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells during storage were mostly due to their differences in physiology and morphology in flocs unicellular microcystis aeruginosa could be enveloped by coagulant which can protect cells against the virulent attack from without whereas cylindrospermopsis raciborskii with its long filaments was difficult for the coagulant to completely envelope and thus prone to suffering oxidative damage li et al 2018 however even though the adverse environmental stresses had some detrimental effects on oscillatoria sp cells during the first several days in this study the oscillatoria sp cells can still grow during storage this can be explained by the fact that microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are planktonic algae which need plenty of sunlight and oxygen whilst oscillatoria sp is a benthic cyanobacterium which can grow in low light and hypoxic conditions hence oscillatoria sp can grow in pafc sludge that lacks light and oxygen pei et al 2017 because the microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will release intracellular toxins after 4 d storage any sludge that contains those species should be treated or disposed of within 4 d compared with microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the oscillatoria sp in sludge can grow after 4 d storage and release odor and toxins when the sludge is discharged into the environment causing great harm to the surrounding waters to control the risks arising from oscillatoria sp cells in sludge it would be better to kill or degrade them during the drinking water treatment process for example we can use a photocatalyst such as nitrogen doped titanium dioxide which has remarkable photocatalytic activity and can degrade organics such as microcystin lr under visible light yang et al 2010 sacco et al 2012 4 conclusions this study showed that oscillatoria sp cells can be effectively removed by conventional pafc coagulation the optimum coagulation conditions for removing oscillatoria sp cells 104 cells ml are 5 0 mg l pafc dose 200 rpm rapid mixing velocity 0 5 min rapid mixing time 80 rpm slow mixing velocity and 30 min slow mixing time even though the cell viability of oscillatoria sp cells decreased during storage due to the low light and hypoxic conditions in sludge the benthic oscillatoria sp cells can gradually adapt to this circumstance and grow rapidly after 6 d storage the growth rates of oscillatoria sp in coagulated systems were lower than that in the control system furthermore the content of chlorophyll a increased by factors of 3 5 and 6 in the optimum and overdose systems respectively after 8 d storage correspondingly extracellular gsm and cyn levels also increased during storage especially after 4 d and the increment in the overdose system was higher than that in the optimum system these findings indicate that pafc dosage should be controlled and the sludge should be treated within 4 days to prevent regrowth of oscillatoria sp cells the results of this study will be helpful for better understanding and optimizing oscillatoria sp coagulation risk and sludge safety management in drinking water treatment and supply acknowledgements this

19484,benthic oscillatoria sp may form dense surface blooms especially under eutrophic and calm conditions which poses a threat to drinking water safety because it can produce toxic and odorous metabolites this is the first study to investigate the effect of the conventional coagulant polyaluminium ferric chloride pafc on removal of oscillatoria sp and the behavior of oscillatoria sp cells in sludges formed from different dosages of pafc control optimum and overdose system during storage was also studied oscillatoria sp cells can be removed efficiently by coagulation of pafc the adverse environmental stresses of sludge such as lack of light and anoxic environment decrease cell viability and induce the increase of superoxide dismutase activity sod and malondialdehyde content mda in oscillatoria sp cells during the first 4 days because oscillatoria sp can adapt to the low light and hypoxic circumstances in sludge gradually the cells regrow with prolonged storage time compared to planktonic microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii regrowth of oscillatoria sp during storage may present a bigger threat even though microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will be damaged and release toxic compounds growth rates of algae in coagulated systems were lower than that in control system because of the restriction of flocs it is worth noting that the chlorophyll a level was increased by a factor of 3 5 in the optimal dose system and worse the overdose system increased by a factor of 6 in chlorophyll a after 8 d storage due to the benefit of higher fe levels concentrations of extracellular geosmin and cylindrospermopsin also increased during storage especially after 4 d and varied in the following sequence for a given storage duration control system overdose system optimum system overall due to decrease of sod and mda in oscillatoria sp cells after 4 d storage algae cells regrew rapidly especially in overdose system hence sludge should be treated within 4 d and excess pafc dosing should be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords oscillatoria sp pafc geosmin cylindrospermopsin sludge storage 1 introduction due to the effects of eutrophication and global climate change the blooming of harmful cyanobacteria is becoming exacerbated which can directly cause deterioration in the quality of drinking water through the production of toxic and odorous metabolites yang et al 2008 schindler et al 2012 oscillatoria a genus of benthic filamentous cyanobacterium has been reported increasingly since the early 1990s and can form dense surface blooms especially under eutrophic and calm stratified conditions watkinson et al 2005 for example it was found that 95 of algae present in a 2015 algal bloom in a reservoir in songkhla southern thailand was oscillatoria sp thammasane and kaosol 2016 oscillatoria can release a part of intracellular 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib geosmin gsm and cyanotoxins into water during growth phase wu and juttner 1988 2 mib and gsm are semi volatile compounds that can impart earthy musty taste and odor to water at very low odor threshold concentrations 2 mib and gsm are detectable by consumers at approximately 10 ng l newcombe and dixon 2006 which can engender a deterioration in the environmental amenity more directly and quickly by causing disgust among consumers than by poisoning through ingestion of cyanotoxins hence the threshold limit value of the odor compound in drinking water is 10 ng l in china mh and sac 2006 and less than 3 threshold odor numbers in the us usepa 2012 oscillatoria can also release cyanotoxins such as microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsin cyn into the surrounding water who 2008 mcs are the most widespread of the cyanobacterial toxins and present serious health risks for human population mackintosh et al 1990 codd et al 2005 cyn is a hepatotoxic alkaloid with high genotoxicity and cytotoxicity associated with cases of human and animal morbidity merel et al 2013 moreira et al 2013 the malodorous materials can decrease water quality meanwhile it is hard to remove them by the conventional drinking water treatment processes including chlorine disinfection newcombe and dixon 2006 the traditional coagulation process is also inefficient at removing toxins sun et al 2012 2013 fortunately a large proportion of the taste and odor compounds and toxins are contained in the healthy oscillatoria cells newcombe 2009 wert et al 2014 hence efficient removal of intact oscillatoria cells without causing the release of additional taste and odor compounds and toxins is the most effective way of ensuring the safety of drinking water coagulation is usually the most effective unit operation for removing cyanobacterial cells in typical drinking water treatment plants chow et al 1999 because oscillatoria is one of the most notorious cyanobacteria like microcystis the removal of oscillatoria has attracted attention and there have been several relevant studies recently mohamed 2016 studied the effect of al2 so4 3 a common coagulant on removal of oscillatoria in a drinking water treatment plant and found that al2 so4 3 was ineffective for complete removal of oscillatoria furthermore thammasane and kaosol 2016 investigated the removal efficiency for alum polyaluminium chloride pacl combined pacl alum and combined pacl ferric chloride on oscillatoria by jar testing their results showed that the maximum removals of turbidity 97 14 and chlorophyll a 99 67 can be achieved from the combined pacl alum treatment dosage ratio 3 1 or 60 20 mg l pafc is known to be the most popular conventional coagulant in drinking water treatment plants as it combines the advantages of polyaluminium chloride and polyferric chloride such as strong capacity for adsorption bridging and a wide range of ph adaptation yet there has been no research on the use of pafc to remove oscillatoria in addition it is notable that the risk of additional toxin release may be created or enhanced due to chemical or mechanical stress suffered by cell membranes during coagulation processes although unicellular microcystis can be efficiently removed by coagulation without causing additional release of intracellular toxins according to our previous studies sun et al 2012 li et al 2015 there may be some differences for the multicellular filamentous oscillatoria li et al 2018 studied the effect of pafc on multicellular filamentous cylindrospermopsis raciborskii during coagulation and found that although cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells can be removed intact under optimum coagulation conditions higher dosages of pafc 10 mg l triggered additional cyn release to the best of our knowledge there is no study relating the release of taste and odor compounds and toxins during coagulation of oscillatoria after the coagulation and sedimentation processes the filamentous oscillatoria can be held in a solid phase namely the drinking water sludge which has a volume equivalent to 4 7 of the total drinking water produced razali et al 2007 sun et al 2015 unfortunately in many countries especially in developing countries such as china and india most of the drinking water sludge is discharged into drainage systems or surrounding natural waters directly without any treatment or disposed of as waste to a landfill after being dewatered yang et al 2006 ahmad et al 2016 according to our previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 even though the microcystis aeruginosa cells remained basically intact in pafc sludge after 10 d storage some of the intracellular mcs began to be released after 4 d storage for cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the cells in pafc sludge would lyse after 6 d storage li et al 2018 compared with the behaviors of planktonic microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the benthic oscillatoria cells in sludge may behave differently what is the behavior of oscillatoria cells in sludge and will high levels of toxins or odor taste compounds be released into the surrounding waters and cause secondary pollution up to now no study of oscillatoria cells in the flocs sludge during the storage processes has been related hence the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the optimum dosage of pafc coagulant for efficiently removing oscillatoria and the effect of coagulation on oscillatoria sp cells 2 to analyze the impact of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells condition and the release of odor toxin metabolites during floc storage and 3 to evaluate the response mechanisms of oscillatoria during the floc storage process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 oscillatoria sp culture oscillatoria sp fachb 528 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was used as the model alga in this study this strain was grown in bg11 medium with a light dark cycle 12 h 12 h and constant temperature 25 c under 2000 lux illumination the algae were routinely sub cultured to maintain growth within the late exponential phase for experiments 2 1 2 raw water experiments were performed with water from queshan reservoir an important drinking water source in jinan china raw water was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane shanghai mili membrane separation technology co china to remove natural algae and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the raw water were ph 8 46 turbidity 1 26 ntu chemical oxygen demand mn 14 4 mg l dissolved oxygen 8 84 mg l ammonia nitrogen 0 18 mg l total nitrogen 2 2 mg l total phosphorus

relative density 1 25 20 c alumina content 8 10 iron oxide content 1 2 and basicity 65 90 the pafc stock solution was prepared at 5 g l ph 4 44 2 2 coagulation experiments oscillatoria sp culture 105 cells ml was mixed with raw water to achieve a final cell density of 104 cells ml to simulate a maximum algal density without algal clumps for this study based on empirical values from conventional water treatment 16 experimental systems were designed according to an orthogonal test scheme to optimize the coagulant dosage and rapid slow mixing velocities a six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china was used to perform coagulation optimization experiments at room temperature 25 1 c each 1 l sample was dosed with pafc stock solution to achieve a predetermined concentration of coagulant when the rapid mixing began after coagulation samples were settled for 30 min under quiescent conditions to obtain the flocs formed into sludge and supernatants the removal efficiency in each system was measured through od680 the absorbance at 680 nm a measure of cell density with a uv 2450 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan after removing 930 ml of supernatant 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge remained for a control without coagulation the sample 1 l was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and the cells were then re suspended into the raw water to make up 70 ml forming a coagulant free sludge all cyanobacteria containing sludge samples were then housed in an incubator at 25 c under 2000 lux illumination with the 12 h 12 h light dark cycle for up to 8 d the sludge samples were drawn every two days for analysis throughout the storage period 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 cell enumeration as oscillatoria sp cells can assemble to form a filamentous structure the cells are difficult to count and measure with a haemocytometer in this study an inverted fluorescence microscope and plankton counting chamber were used to measure filament length and total particles the inverted fluorescence microscope was used to determine the length of a filament and the average length of cells measure cell length randomly 10 times and hence computes the mean length from which the counting error was estimated to be 20 the information on total filament length and average cell length was combined to give the cell concentration the oscillatoria sp cultures also required screening through a 100 μm mesh screen in order to prevent clogging of the flow cell which means only filaments 100 μm in length were used to conduct the testing wert et al 2014 the counting conditions and corresponding od680 are given in table s1 the results shown in table s1 were calculated as in the following formula number of cells total filament length average cell length cell density cells l 5 104 number of cells the standard curve between od680 and number of cells was followed number of cells 35347 od 680 37 312 r2 0 9991 2 3 2 chlorophyll a content analysis chlorophyll a contents of the sludges during storage were investigated every two days as follows 4 ml of sludge was sampled and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was discarded and 4 ml of 99 9 methanol was added to the centrifuge tube mixed well and stored in darkness at 45 c for 24 h the optical densities of the extracts at 652 4 665 2 and 750 nm were determined using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan and the content of chlorophyll a was calculated according to the following equation lichtenthaler 1987 chlorophyll a μg ml 16 72 a 665 2 9 16 a 652 4 absorbences at 652 4 and 665 2 nm were corrected for turbidity by subtracting absorbance at 750 nm 2 3 3 chlorophyll a autofluorescence analysis to explore the change of cell viability during the sludge storage period chlorophyll a autofluorescence of the flocs was observed using a fluorescence microscope te2000 nikon japan fitted with filters including exciter filter ex510 560 dichroic mirror dm575 and barrier filter ba590 the red emission spectra were captured using a ccd camera li et al 2015 2 3 4 scanning electron microscope sem analysis to directly assess the surface information and morphology of oscillatoria sp cells during the storage sem analysis was conducted according to the method of xu et al 2016 the treated samples were examined with an sem s 4100 hitachi japan at 3 kv 2 3 5 cell membrane permeability ph value and turbidity analysis the variations in cell membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage were measured according to our previous method xu et al 2017 the ph and turbidity of the dewatering water separated from sludge samples by centrifugation 4000 rpm for 5 min were measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c lei ci china and a 1900c turbidimeter hach co shanghai china respectively 2 3 6 physiological indicators sludge samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to collect algal cells then cells were re suspended with phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 and homogenized by an ultrasonic cell pulverizer jy92 2d xinzhi co china under ice bath cooling with total time of 10 min 600 w ultrasonic time 2 s rest time 8 s after that the homogenate was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min and the cell free enzyme supernatant was maintained at 20 c for further use meng et al 2015 intracellular protein was determined following the bradford method bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as the standard malondialdehyde mda content was measured by a colorimetric method shiu and lee 2005 superoxide dismutase sod activity was measured according to the method of beauchamp and fridovich 1971 mda and sod results are expressed in units of nmol mgprot and u mgprot respectively 2 3 7 extracellular odor and toxin analysis the changes in extracellular odor 2 mib and gsm and toxin mcs and cyn component concentrations in the sludge samples during storage were investigated sludge samples were drawn every two days and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min the centrate was filtered through 0 45 μm mili ca membranes for 2 mib and gsm measurement 25 ml filtered samples were firstly pre concentrated using solid phase micro extraction manual devices supelco usa yuan et al 2013 the adsorbed compounds were then thermally desorbed from the solid phase micro extraction fiber directly into the injection port of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and quantitatively analyzed using selected ion monitoring mode yuan et al 2013 the concentrations of extracellular cyn and mcs were determined using a beacon cylindrospermopsin elisa kit beacon analytical systems maine usa and a beacon microcystin elisa kit beacon analytical systems maine usa the method used for the measurement of cyn and mcs by elisa was based on the methods of mohamed and al sheri 2013 and sun et al 2012 respectively 2 3 8 floc properties during the coagulation process a mastersizer 2000 malvern uk a laser diffraction instrument was used to monitor dynamic floc size size measurements of flocs were taken every 30 s during the process of coagulation and the results were recorded automatically by computer the size data were expressed as equivalent volumetric diameters and the floc size was characterized by the median volumetric diameter d 50 the fractal dimension d f of flocs was measured on the mastersizer 2000 using a small angle laser light scattering method with a 632 8 nm laser light beam lin et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation optimization experiments and effect of shear on oscillatoria sp cells the efficiencies of oscillatoria sp cell removal under different coagulation conditions are given in table 1 it can be seen that compared to the effect of rapid slow mixing velocity the effect of coagulant dosage on removal efficiency is more drastic the removal of algal cells increased markedly when the coagulant dosage increased from 2 5 to 5 mg l and the removal efficiency stayed nearly at the same level with increase in the pafc dosage from 5 to 7 5 mg l however the removal efficiency showed a sharp decrease when the dosage of pafc rose to 10 mg l table 1 usually the negatively charged oscillatoria sp could be effectively removed by positively charged pafc through charge neutralization whereas excess cationic charges will result in charge reversal and thus reduce the removal efficiency gonzalez torres et al 2014 furthermore it can be seen that system 6 with a removal efficiency of nearly 100 manifested the optimum coagulation conditions 5 0 mg l pafc dose 200 rpm rapid mixing velocity 0 5 min rapid mixing time 80 rpm slow mixing velocity and 30 min slow mixing time table 1 mixing which aims to disperse coagulants quickly and form flocs perfectly is an important part of the conventional water treatment process yet the shear stress may induce lysis of the oscillatoria sp cells to identify the effect of shear on oscillatoria sp cells the oscillatoria sp cells were stirred under the aforementioned optimum coagulation conditions without coagulant to avoid the dual effect of chemical treatment and shear on oscillatoria sp cells after stirring the extracellular cyn concentration was measured and the result was 11 6 0 3 μg l which was similar to the result of extracellular cyn before stirring 11 58 0 2 μg l these results show that no intracellular cyn was released after stirring and the pressure imparted by optimal stirring had a negligible impact on the integrity of the cells 3 2 effects of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during floc storage even though the optimum dosage of pafc to remove oscillatoria sp was 5 mg l the pafc dosage may be larger than 5 mg l in the drinking water treatment plant to effectively remove all types of pollutant from raw water hence the effects of overdosing pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during storage were also studied the stirring conditions in the overdosed system were the same as in the optimum system which has a relatively high removal efficiency of oscillatoria sp cells 85 0 21 under 10 mg l pafc the cell viability of oscillatoria sp in flocs represents the risk of oscillatoria sp cells regrowing when the sludge is discharged into the natural environment hence the effect of pafc with different dosages 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l as the control optimum and overdose system respectively on the viability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage was investigated chlorophyll a autofluorescence was used as a measure of cell viability fig 1 it can be seen that the cell viabilities were similar in the control system and the coagulated systems after 0 d storage as shown in fig 1 a 0 b 0 and c 0 which means that coagulation had no immediate effect on cell viability it was also found that although the cell viability decreased gradually in all three systems after 2 d storage the cells maintained a certain viability even after 8 d storage furthermore it is worth noting that the flocs became loose after 4 d storage in both the optimum and overdose systems figure s1 signifying that deflocculation of oscillatoria sp filaments had occurred the variations in chlorophyll a content were observed in order to analyze the condition of oscillatoria sp cells from days 0 2 4 6 and 8 in the three systems and the results are shown in fig 2 a it is interesting to note that the content of chlorophyll a increased with prolonged storage time in all three systems especially after 6 d storage and chlorophyll a content varied in the following sequence for a given storage duration control system overdose system optimum system according to the results of chlorophyll a autofluorescence analysis fig 1 the single cell viability was reduced however the content of chlorophyll a rose during storage which means that the oscillatoria sp cells grew during storage especially after 6 d due to the limitations imposed by the sludge environment the growth rates of algal cells in the optimum and overdose systems were lower than that in the control system because the flocs became loose after 6 d storage fig 1 the proliferation of cells was increased considerably in optimum and overdose systems usually ferric acts as a cofactor on a variety of enzymes and has an obvious promotive effect on microalgal growth rueter and petersen 1987 as a basic element involved in synthesizing chlorophyll a and promoting inorganic salt adsorption iron has shown a significant effect on growth of oscillatoria sp cells he 2012 found that the optimum dosage of fe3 to promote oscillatoria sp growth was 0 516 2 581 mg l according to our previous study xu et al 2016 the concentration of fe was 80 7 7 4 μg l in the sludge after addition of 15 mg l pafc therefore the fe level should be below 80 7 7 4 μg l in the current study because the maximum pafc dosage used was 10 mg l the increase in fe concentration will be beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells hence the content of chlorophyll a was higher in the overdosed system for the same storage duration the al concentration would be 240 2 15 1 μg l if 15 mg l pafc was added according to our previous study xu et al 2016 therefore the al level in the present study should be below 240 2 15 1 μg l according to the u s environmental protection agency us epa gostomski 1990 gensemer and playle 1999 total al concentrations ranging from 460 μg l to 6480 μg l will be toxic to freshwater algae which suggests that the al level in our study would have no effect on the cells to verify the variations in chlorophyll a content concentrations of intracellular protein were measured during the storage period as shown in fig 2 b the results were similar to those for chlorophyll a further verifying the results above sem analysis is a visual method that images a sample in the process producing signals that contain information about the sample s surface topography composition and other properties thiberge et al 2004 to verify the integrity of algal cells during storage the samples in the three systems were subjected to sem analysis as shown in fig 2 c no differences were observed after storage of any of the three systems and the cells remained intact after 6 d 3 3 proposed mechanisms involved in the action of pafc on oscillatoria sp cells during floc storage although the chlorophyll a levels in the three systems increased during storage the cell viabilities declined after 4 d implying that external stimuli possibly from the surrounding pafc coagulation sludge such as chemical stimulation lack of light or anoxic environment affect oscillatoria sp cells during storage to test the effect of external stimuli on cells during storage their physiological characteristics were investigated sod an enzyme that scavenges reactive oxygen species ros can defend against cellular ros as an antioxidative defense mechanism to help cells cope with oxidative stress changes in sod activity was used to analyze the level of cellular oxidative damage myouga et al 2008 the results in fig 3 a demonstrate that sod activity in the three systems increased in the first 4 days and then declined this suggests that due to the adverse environmental stresses sod activity went up during the first 4 days however the algal cells adapted to the adverse environmental stresses with prolonged storage time resulting in the decrease of sod activity furthermore it was found that the sod level in the control system was higher than that in the optimum and overdose systems which may be due to the protection afforded by the presence of flocs xu et al 2016 mda as the decomposition product of membrane lipid peroxidation has been utilized frequently as a biomarker for cellular oxidative damage cai et al 2009 from fig 3 b it can be seen that mda content in all of the three systems underwent a cumulative increase over the first 4 days and then stabilised or slightly dropped with prolonged storage time this supports the results of sod activity in fig 3 a due to the protection offered by the sludge environment xu et al 2016 the level of mda in the control system was higher than those in the optimum and overdose systems furthermore it is notable that the mda content in the optimum system was lower than that in overdose system throughout the storage period to confirm these mda results membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells during storage was also measured fig 3 c these results show that the level of cell membrane permeability in the three systems increased after 6 d storage and the cell membrane permeability varied in the following sequence given the same storage duration control system overdose system optimum system because of the higher fe concentration which is beneficial to cell growth in the overdose system the cell membrane permeability or mda content in the overdose system should be lower than that in the optimum system however the opposite result was observed in fig 3 b and c which may be due to differing floc properties such as floc size and density produced by different doses of pafc to evaluate this hypothesis the characteristics of the flocs during coagulation were measured and the results are given in fig 3 d the initial median diameter d 50 in the control system was about 90 μm and grew rapidly once pafc was dosed pafc flocs in the optimum system grew rapidly during the first 10 min and then remained stable and the final d 50 value of the flocs was about 370 μm in contrast the flocs in the overdose system gradually grew to become much larger about 440 μm than those in the optimum system in addition the fractal structure of flocs was analyzed through the measurement of fractal dimension d f which could be obtained by the exponential relation between mass and particle size rieker et al 2000 and could indicate the development of aggregate structure during the formation of flocs cao et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 d the fractal dimensions of pafc flocs in the optimum and overdose systems were 2 38 and 2 69 respectively bridgeman et al 2008 reported that higher d f values indicate more compact structures while flocs with lower d f values are looser and more open therefore our results demonstrate that pafc flocs in the overdosed system were more compact than pafc flocs in the optimum system hence the higher cell membrane permeability and mda content in the overdose system may be due to the higher floc size and density which was not beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells based on the above discussion due to the adverse environmental stresses an excess of ros may be produced in oscillatoria sp cells during the first several days in the three systems because sod was the first line of resistance against ros sod activity was then induced in response to the oxidative stress over the first 4 days resulting in the increases of mda content and cell membrane permeability thereafter benthic oscillatoria sp cells adapted to the sludge environment the sod activity in cells declined and mda content stabilised or dropped slightly after 4 8 days storage in the three systems because of the protection afforded by the flocs the increases of sod activity and mda content in the cells that had been coagulated were lower than for uncoagulated cells even though the higher level of fe may be beneficial to the growth of oscillatoria sp cells in the overdose system the higher floc size and density which was not conducive to cell growth may result in the higher sod activity and mda content in oscillatoria sp cells in comparison to the optimum system 3 4 effects of oscillatoria sp cells on water quality of dewatering water during floc storage as shown in fig 4 a the ph values were 7 82 0 06 7 68 0 07 and 7 54 0 02 in the control optimum and overdose systems respectively after 0 d storage the decline in the ph value after coagulation in the optimum and overdose systems may be due to the hydrolysis of fe3 and al3 during coagulation li et al 2015 and hence the ph decreased more in the overdose system because of the higher pafc dosage it was then observed that the ph of the sludge increased slowly over the first 4 days and then decreased cyanobacteria are usually alkaliphiles brock 1973 and the intracellular ph of cyanobacteria has been reported to be higher than the external ph by up to 0 5 1 0 ph units when the external ph was about 7 0 giraldez ruiz et al 1997 hence the increase of ph during the first 4 days may be due to the secretion of the intracellular substances to protect oscillatoria sp cells against the external stress the gradual decline in the ph value after 4 d storage in the three systems may be due to the further hydrolysis of residual fe3 and al3 xu et al 2017 due to the coagulation effect the turbidities in the supernatants varied in the following sequence after 0 d storage control system optimum system overdose system fig 4 b furthermore because of the proliferation of cells the deflocculation of oscillatoria sp filaments and the secretion of the intracellular matter turbidity gradually rose with increasing storage time it is notable that the turbidity was arranged in the following sequence after 6 d storage control system overdose system optimum system which is in line with the variations of chlorophyll a in the sludges oscillatoria sp cells can usually produce and release odor compounds such as gsm and 2 mib the occurrence of the taste and odor compounds such as gsm and 2 mib will affect the organoleptic quality of the drinking water zoschke et al 2012 hence the variations in extracellular gsm and 2 mib during storage are important to understand although 2 mib was not detected in this study gsm was detected in all samples except those after 0 d storage for which the gsm concentration was below the limit of detection due to the low cell densities and gsm concentrations control samples using oscillatoria sp cells showed that an uncapped bottle resulted in negligible loss of gsm due to volatilization compared to a tightly capped bottle which is similar to the finding of wert et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 4 c the concentration of gsm increased with prolonged storage and the level in the control system was clearly higher than in the optimum and overdose systems there may be two reasons for this 1 the faster growth rate of oscillatoria sp cells in the control system compared to the optimum and overdose systems produced and released more gsm huang et al 2007 and or 2 the adsorption of gsm by al and fe hydrolysates in the optimum and overdose systems reduced the extracellular gsm concentrations wang et al 2018 furthermore it was found that the level of gsm in the overdose system was higher than that in the optimum system after 4 d storage which suggests that although more gsm could be adsorbed following the higher dose of pafc in the overdose system the faster proliferation and higher cell membrane permeability of oscillatoria sp cells could still produce and release more gsm aside from releasing odor compounds oscillatoria sp cells can also produce toxic metabolites such as mcs and cyn which pose threats to the safety of drinking water supplies extracellular mcs and cyn during storage were therefore assessed in the three systems despite extracellular mcs not being detected the changes in extracellular cyn were significant in the three systems after 8 d storage as can be seen in fig 4 d extracellular cyn content kept increasing in the three systems and the level of extracellular cyn after 4 d storage followed the sequence control system overdose system optimum system the higher level of extracellular cyn in the control system may also be due to the higher cell density in that system and adsorption on pafc flocs in the optimum and overdose systems which is in line with the results for extracellular gsm the extracellular cyn concentration in the optimum system was lower than that in overdose system also similar to the results for extracellular gsm which implies that despite the stronger adsorption of cyn in the overdose system the higher cell density and membrane permeability can still liberate more cyn 3 5 comparison between the behaviors of oscillatoria sp and microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii during sludge storage like microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii oscillatoria sp is one of the most notorious cyanobacteria and also commonly exists in drinking water sources after the processes of pafc coagulation and sedimentation the oscillatoria sp microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will be partitioned into the drinking water sludge and their behaviors during storage are presented in table 2 according to our previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 although the microcystis aeruginosa cells remained basically intact after 10 d storage the cell viability was low and some of the intracellular mcs began to be released after 4 d storage for cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the cells would lyse after 6 d storage li et al 2018 the different behaviours of microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells during storage were mostly due to their differences in physiology and morphology in flocs unicellular microcystis aeruginosa could be enveloped by coagulant which can protect cells against the virulent attack from without whereas cylindrospermopsis raciborskii with its long filaments was difficult for the coagulant to completely envelope and thus prone to suffering oxidative damage li et al 2018 however even though the adverse environmental stresses had some detrimental effects on oscillatoria sp cells during the first several days in this study the oscillatoria sp cells can still grow during storage this can be explained by the fact that microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are planktonic algae which need plenty of sunlight and oxygen whilst oscillatoria sp is a benthic cyanobacterium which can grow in low light and hypoxic conditions hence oscillatoria sp can grow in pafc sludge that lacks light and oxygen pei et al 2017 because the microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will release intracellular toxins after 4 d storage any sludge that contains those species should be treated or disposed of within 4 d compared with microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii the oscillatoria sp in sludge can grow after 4 d storage and release odor and toxins when the sludge is discharged into the environment causing great harm to the surrounding waters to control the risks arising from oscillatoria sp cells in sludge it would be better to kill or degrade them during the drinking water treatment process for example we can use a photocatalyst such as nitrogen doped titanium dioxide which has remarkable photocatalytic activity and can degrade organics such as microcystin lr under visible light yang et al 2010 sacco et al 2012 4 conclusions this study showed that oscillatoria sp cells can be effectively removed by conventional pafc coagulation the optimum coagulation conditions for removing oscillatoria sp cells 104 cells ml are 5 0 mg l pafc dose 200 rpm rapid mixing velocity 0 5 min rapid mixing time 80 rpm slow mixing velocity and 30 min slow mixing time even though the cell viability of oscillatoria sp cells decreased during storage due to the low light and hypoxic conditions in sludge the benthic oscillatoria sp cells can gradually adapt to this circumstance and grow rapidly after 6 d storage the growth rates of oscillatoria sp in coagulated systems were lower than that in the control system furthermore the content of chlorophyll a increased by factors of 3 5 and 6 in the optimum and overdose systems respectively after 8 d storage correspondingly extracellular gsm and cyn levels also increased during storage especially after 4 d and the increment in the overdose system was higher than that in the optimum system these findings indicate that pafc dosage should be controlled and the sludge should be treated within 4 days to prevent regrowth of oscillatoria sp cells the results of this study will be helpful for better understanding and optimizing oscillatoria sp coagulation risk and sludge safety management in drinking water treatment and supply acknowledgements this
