17540,machine learning modeling techniques have emerged as a potential means for predicting algal blooms in this study synthetic spatio temporal water quality data for a river section were generated with a 3d water quality model and used to investigate the capability of a convolutional neural network cnn for predicting harmful cyanobacterial blooms the cnn model displayed a reasonable capacity for short term predictions of cyanobacteria microcystis biomass in the nowcasting of microcystis the cnn performance had a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 87 an increase in the forecast lead time resulted in a decrease in the prediction accuracy reducing the nse from 0 87 to 0 58 as the spatial observation density increased from 20 to 100 of the input image grids the cnn prediction nse had improved from 0 70 to 0 84 adding noise to the data resulted in accuracy deterioration but even at the noise amplitude of 10 the accuracy was acceptable for some applications with nse 0 76 visualization of the cnn results characterized its performance variations across the studied river reach overall this study successfully demonstrated the capability of the cnn model for cyanobacterial bloom prediction using high temporal frequency images graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords convolutional neural network efdc synthetic data microcystis prediction 1 introduction predicting water quality changes is a challenging issue in environmental research due to the complexity and uncertainty of biochemical processes in natural waters beck et al 2012 summers et al 1993 in particular the accurate prediction of algal dynamics is complicated due to substantial uncertainties associated with growth nutrient uptake grazing and photosynthesis among other factors li et al 2013 xie et al 2012 with the rapid development of computational power numerous efforts have been made to transition water quality models from lumped steady state models to three dimensional dynamic models wang et al 2015 especially models have been improved continuously for algae related predictions clark and jaworski 1972 utilized a one dimensional dynamic estuary model to predict algae concentrations however the one dimensional approach ignored significant physical phenomena such as substantial vertical differences additionally the prediction accuracy was hampered by the use of the simplified equations that averaged the vertical and lateral variations ulanowicz 1976 later studies developed two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to consider longitudinal and vertical advection martin 1988 applied a two dimensional water quality model coupled with hydrodynamic algorithms to predict algal dynamics however the two dimensional model had limited applicability to water bodies with pronounced lateral differences recently with the improvement in computational capability three dimensional hydrodynamic models have been actively utilized to predict algal concentrations wu and xu 2011 and kim et al 2017 predicted algal blooms with reasonable accuracy by applying the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc although this model has been developed for predicting algal bloom trends when sufficient observed data is available the prediction of the algal dynamics still requires improvements interactions among the major processes uncertainty in the kinetic rate parameter values and complexity of the three dimensional hydrodynamic simulation hinder the efficient application of the model for forecasting algal blooms li et al 2013 xie et al 2012 data driven models have been spotlighted as an alternative approach to estimating water quality parameters by reflecting the underlying features of water constituent dynamics teles et al 2006 effectively implemented a time series forecasting of cyanobacteria using artificial neural networks ann cho et al 2011 successfully predicted arsenic concentrations in groundwater using anns and park et al 2015 showed satisfactory performance of support vector machines svm in chlorophyll a predictions conventional data driven models with relatively low dimensional data such as the time series of point measured constituents have shown reasonable accuracy however such models contain a large number of internal units internal parameters and prohibitively high training times for accurate predictions using high dimensional data such as multi dimensional imagery that have become an essential output of modern monitoring programs w√≥jcik and kurdziel 2019 deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks cnns appear to be suitable to process the multi dimensional imagery for classification and regression tasks because cnns can use the high dimensional images as inputs and extract sophisticated features in the imagery data thus radically increasing the explanatory and predictive capacity of the neural network chen et al 2016 yu et al 2017 therefore cnns can be utilized to estimate algal concentrations with multi dimensional data pyo et al 2019 has introduced a cnn regression with hyperspectral imagery for estimating cyanobacteria biomass the applicability of cnns can be expanded to the prediction tasks when images are available with high temporal frequency poliyapram et al 2019 to date cnn predictions for algal blooms have been rarely implemented because it is challenging to obtain imagery data with high temporal frequency from airborne platforms or satellites due to high costs and variable weather conditions yang et al 2010 nevertheless the algal prediction performance of the cnn model can be evaluated using synthetic datasets obtained as outputs of hydrodynamics based water quality models which can generate high temporal frequency imagery additionally a cnn trained with the hydrodynamics based model outputs can become a surrogate model or metamodel hong et al 2017 this model enables sensitivity and scenario analyses that are hard to implement by running the hydrodynamics based models when there are a large number of scenarios this study aims to evaluate the applicability of cnns for algal bloom predictions with model generated high temporal frequency image gridded data and investigate the performance mechanisms through scenario analyses which we believe have never been addressed previously we used a calibrated efdc to generate model output images of the concentrations of microcystis in grid cells for a river section these images were used to develop the cnn models applied for the scenario analyses the differences between the scenarios included variances in the forecast lead time spatial observation density and amplitude of noise added to the input images 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the reach of the nakdong river the longest river in south korea was selected for this study two large multi purpose weirs the dalseong ds and hapcheon changyeong hc weirs define the upstream and downstream boundaries of the reach referred to as the hc reach which has the average water depth of 8 4 m and the length of 29 4 km fig 1 two main tributaries the huichan and chacheon bring pollutants from domestic and industrial sewage treatment plants livestock facilities and agricultural fields to the reach lee and kim 2017 these point and non point source pollutants including those from the upstream boundary cause eutrophication in the hc reach with several algal blooms lee et al 2014 additionally the weir increases the flow retention time and stability enhancing harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the summer lee et al 2014 cyanobacterial blooms were observed in the reach a total of 129 days during the four years from 2012 to 2016 furthermore the cell counts of cyanobacteria during 61 of the bloom period i e 79 days exceeded the warning criteria set for early algal alerts in south korea 1000 cells ml 1 lee and kim 2017 2 2 efdc model the layout of this study is presented in fig 2 the first part contains simulations by the hydrodynamic model fig 2a d this study selected the efdc model which is a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model developed at the virginia institute of marine science and approved by the us epa hamrick 1992 the efdc model includes hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxic contaminant transport and fate modules which are capable of simulating flow transport and fate and biochemical processes in rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas the hydrodynamic module solves the three dimensional shallow water equations coupled with salinity and temperature transport hamrick and mills 2000 additionally the efdc solves the vertically hydrostatic and free surface mean turbulent fluid motion equation the specific mass balance equations reflect the changes in the concentrations of water quality constituents such as algal groups nitrogen phosphorus dissolved oxygen silica and carbon 1 t m x m y h c x m y h u c y m x h v c z m x m y w c x m y h a x m x c x y m x

original efdc model has a limitation in the simulation of cyanobacteria because it does not mimic vertical cyanobacterial migration under buoyancy control which can be critical in terms of competition with other algal species for light and nutrients the national institute of environmental research nier in the republic of korea modified the efdc to consider this functionality by allowing algal density to be changed depending on the amount of light the algae receive the modified version efdcnier provides additional capabilities such as simulations for several algal species different cyanobacteria species such as the microcystis and anabaena species can be simulated concurrently by the efdcnier structures of the original control files i e efdc inp and wq3dwc inp were preserved and new control files were built for the initial conditions and parameters of the additional algal species the cyanobacterial density and vertical movement velocity were adopted from kromkamp and walsby 1990 and the settling velocity module was corrected to consider the density and vertical velocity parameters in the input file wqstokes inp in addition the artificial weir module for efdcnier was developed to simulate various weir structure operations such as a fixed or movable weir fishway and small hydraulic power plant the model can reflect the variation of flow rate and water elevation controlled by the hc details of the efdcnier weir module are described in shin et al 2017 2 2 1 1 model setup and boundary condition in the current study the efdcnier model included a section of the river that extended beyond the hc reach to obtain more accurate calibration results the model domain includes most of the primary nakdong river stream extending from the river mouth to the andong dam which is located approximately 340 km upstream from the river mouth fig 1 presents the sub domain for the hc reach where curvilinear orthogonal grids were adopted to represent the geometry of the hc reach thereby generating a total of 480 grid cells figs 1 and 2a the grid cell width and lengths varied ranging from 90 m to 100 m and from 190 m to 200 m respectively the water body was divided into 11 layers of the same thickness with an average depth of 10 m after the grid generation the initial and boundary conditions were set using flow and water quality data acquired from the water environmental information system of the republic of korea observed at the outlets of the two tributaries and using the simulation results from the ds the upstream boundary fig 2b the initial conditions were set using the observation data along the river reach but their effects disappear soon after the spin up period of the model fig 2b in the mainstream and tributaries of the hc the inflow outflow water quality constituent loading and weather data were used to set the initial concentrations and boundary conditions the model was calibrated for the entire year of 2015 and then validated for the years from 2016 to 2018 the significant issues for the water quality module calibration were the algal primary production oxygen consumption after the decomposition of organic matter and dissolved oxygen concentration wu and xu 2011 the optimum model parameters were varied based on the typical ranges found in literature sources fig 2c and were fine tuned until the root mean square difference between the observed and simulated water quality variables was minimized chen et al 2016 2 3 convolutional neural network cnn a cnn is a deep learning model that exploits feature hierarchies of multi dimensional image data from low level to high level features and serves as a powerful image processing tool compared to standard feedforward neural network a cnn requires fewer parameters and connections between elements and is therefore easier to train krizhevsky et al 2012 efdcnier outputs can be organized into images where grid cells serve as pixels thus this study utilized a cnn model with structural units shown in fig 3 to extract the water quality features from the efdcnier output to predict microcystis biomass the typical architecture of a cnn is composed of convolutional and pooling layers lecun et al 2015 in the convolutional layers convolutional filters slide over the input image and the feature extraction consists of finding weights for each filter element and the bias value the output of the convolutional layer is the feature map that serves as the input for the next convolutional layer which can then learn more complex features a set of weights and biases is passed through non linear activation functions such as the sigmoid function and rectified linear unit relu each group of the extracted features in a layer shares the same filters allowing the detection of the same feature pattern in different parts of the image conversely different features result from the various filters that lead to easy feature detection from the input data lecun et al 2015 the convolution layers may be separated by the pooling layers that merge the extracted features before passing them on to the next convolution layer the merge consists of averaging or taking maximum value for the highlighted features and increasing the computation efficiency by reducing the size of the features max pooling was applied in this work during which the dimension of the extracted features is reduced by taking the maximum value from the features in other words if a feature with a 2 2 dimension was passed through the max pooling layer with a 2 2 dimension the maximum value from the feature values of 2 2 is output as one value a cnn model can be configured to have multiple stacked convolutional and pooling layers followed by additional convolutional layers and then fully connected layers the weights in all the filters can be found during the cnn training using the backpropagation algorithm lecun et al 2015 we applied the alexnet as the standard cnn architecture for the configuration based on the tensorflow library abadi et al 2016 for training the cnn model the adam optimizer santoro et al 2017 was used to optimize the weights by minimizing the difference between the microcystis biomass predicted by the cnn model and the efdcnier model the mean square error mse are adopted as the cost function 3 y i 1 n c i l e i l 2 n where n is the number of training data c i l is the predicted microcystis biomass by cnn in carbon concentration gc m 3 and e i l is the predicted microcystis from efdcnier although multiple non linear weights in the stacked cnn layers can be trained from the complicated relationships between inputs and outputs a significant portion of such relationships may be the result of sampling noise by the training data the dropout method was adopted in this study to prevent possible overfitting the dropout layer temporarily removes one node that is chosen randomly from each layer in the network previous studies have suggested that the optimal probability of dropping nodes is 0 5 krizhevsky et al 2012 the weights in the dropped nodes are not renewed in the training network preventing the convergence of particular weights during the training srivastava et al 2014 the statistical distribution of input data is changed in the intermediate convolutional layers because the distribution of the weights in the activation function is constantly changed during training accordingly the training speed of cnn model may become slow because each layer has to learn new data distribution in every training iteration ioffe and szegedy 2015 to address this problem we placed a batch normalization layer after each convolutional layer this layer normalizes the output from the previous convolutional layer and feeds the normalized output into the next layer as the input data devries and taylor 2017 the batch normalization also prevents the early convergence of weights to a narrow range of values 2 3 1 cnn setup the efdcnier model outputs of each grid with a 12 hour interval for the calibration and validation periods were used as inputs for the cnn the grid cell data consists of microcystis biomass water quality variables and environmental variables such as flow velocity temperature and elevation fig 2d and 4 a the atmospheric data such as atmospheric pressure dry and wet temperatures rainfall evapotranspiration solar radiation and cloud cover used for the efdcnier model simulation were assigned to each grid to maintain the same grid data format all the input data were stacked for the configuration of the cnn model fig 2e and 4b so that the model can reflect the features of the water quality the dimensions of the input image data for the cnn were composed of the number of grid cells n size of the grid cells including width w and height h and the number of input variables including water quality environmental and atmospheric variables c the amount of data is dependent on the assumption of the number of observations the width and height of the input image were the size of the input window segmented as 3 3 pixel sizes i e n 3 3 c this study assumed that the observation point was located in the center of the input windows the model included 23 channel dimensions including the stacked water quality environmental and atmospheric states fig 4c the internal layers and parameters of the cnn model were manually varied to provide an accurate microcystis biomass prediction fig 2g two convolutional layers were utilized with batch normalization max pooling and dropout layers to extract the input features the size and number of filters in the first convolutional layer were adopted as 2 2 pixels and 128 respectively with the second layer containing filters of 2 2 pixel size and 256 respectively after finishing the feature extraction of the convolutional layers two sequential fully connected layers with 32 and 64 nodes were adopted to nowcast the microcystis concentrations fig 3a moreover we added new layers between the second convolutional layer and the fully connected layer after the feature extraction of the second convolutional layer the output was vectorized and future weather data were then added the future weather data used were for two days before the target prediction day then two 1 dimensional convolutional layers were used with 8 and 16 filters with 1 5 pixel sizes fig 3b finally the same number of fully connected layers with the nowcasting structure was used to predict the microcystis concentration 2 4 scenario analysis scenarios regarding microcystis biomass prediction under various assumptions were analyzed using the cnn model in which the efdc outputs were assumed to be the true data in an image data format with high temporal frequency fig 2h j the scenario analysis included microcystis predictions with different forecast lead times observation grid cell densities and observation errors using the efdcnier output allowed us to evaluate the cnn performance in predicting microcystis concentrations for different prediction times from nowcasting to 7 day lead times fig 2h the scenarios with various spatial densities of observation grid cells evaluated the effect of the sparsity of observation points on the prediction accuracy because the grid cells of the efdcnier model could be treated as real observation points synthetic data sets with different observation points could be generated by a random selection of grid cells the scenarios included data sets using 100 50 and 20 of the grid cells respectively fig 2i scenarios with different observation errors were developed by introducing random errors that followed uniform normal or gamma distributions with varying magnitudes i e 10 50 and 100 and were added to the cnn inputs fig 2j 3 results and discussion 3 1 efdcnier model for microcystis simulation for an accurate simulation of the hydrodynamics of the river reaches confined by the large weirs the measured flow rate data were used at each weir point as boundary conditions which forced the simulated water levels to be comparable to those observed for water quality table 1 presents the calibration and validation results of the water quality variables the unit of microcystis from the efdcnier output was transformed from carbon unit to cells using the carbon contents of microcystis cells in hc moe 2016 the results for 2015 showed the lowest calibration errors compared with the validation errors from the other years the microcystis validation results produced relatively large errors compared with the other variables these results were attributed to the inherent characteristics of microorganism measurements in the environment which normally show significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity wu and xu 2011 although efdcnier always has internal simulation errors the reason for the use of the synthetic data as ground truth is that this study requires sufficient image data resources with high temporal frequency to evaluate the microcystis prediction performance of the cnn model 3 2 cnn for microcystis biomass nowcasting the nowcasting of microcystis biomass by the cnn model was conducted for the data generated by the efdcnier model only data from august were used to investigate the most vulnerable period of the year to the microcystis dominated bloom to consider the possible influence of previous conditions on the current microcystis biomass the input data for three days from current day denoted as t to two days ago t 2 were entered in the cnn model to predict the status of microcystis at the current date t a total of 30 random grid cells were assumed available for measurements the earliest 70 of the input data were used for model training and the remaining 30 were used for validation the two figures in the first row of fig 5 show the cnn performance on the microcystis nowcasting for the training fig 5a and validation periods fig 5b high accuracy with an nse of 0 95 and r2 of 0 97 was achieved for the training table 2 the outcomes of the validation showed reasonable results with an nse of 0 87 and r2 of 0 90 these results proved that the cnn model could provide reliable nowcasting outcomes for microcystis by reflecting input variations with time the combination of the input variables for the nutrients environment and atmospheric conditions and the selection of three days i e t 2 t 1 and t for the input time window were sufficient to reflect the conditions of the microcystis dominated blooms at day t several studies have demonstrated the reasonable accuracy of cnn based metamodels in various applications wang and xu 2019 built a cnn model with four one dimensional convolutional layers to estimate the walking and running speeds of a person using acceleration data this study found that the cnn structure provided the estimation errors within 18 compared to the observations pyo et al 2019 designed a cnn structure with two convolutional layers to estimate cyanobacteria concentrations from hyperspectral imagery showing r2 values of 0 86 and 0 73 with respect to the observed phycocyanin and chlorophyll a concentrations respectively hong et al 2019 estimated concentrations of ultra fine particles using a pretrained imagenet structure with satellite images and their results demonstrated a regression accuracy of over 86 despite of the different input composition and cnn structures the results of previous studies indicate that the deep feature extraction allowed for finding robust relationships thereby providing a reliable performance of cnn metamodels by extension our study provided an example of time series data as efficient input for nowcast using a cnn model 3 3 scenario analysis 3 3 1 effect of forecast lead time new weather data layers for 2 days t 1 and t 2 were added to the nowcasting cnn configuration to configure a new cnn model for forecasting microcystis for 3 days in the future t 3 fig 4 similarly weather data layers for 6 days from t 1 to t 6 were added for forecasting 7 days in the future t 7 the two figures in the second row of fig 5 show the results of microcystis forecasting with the 3 day lead time for the training fig 5c and validation periods fig 5d fig 5e and f present the results of the 7 day lead time as expected the forecast accuracies of the 3 day lead time simulation were lower than for nowcasting in both the training and validation but they were still reasonably high however the accuracy of the 7 day lead time simulation decreased significantly in particular the accuracy difference between the two cases was the largest for the 3 day forecasting with nse values of 0 92 training and 0 81 validation versus 0 76 and 0 58 for the 7 day simulation respectively table 2 these results indicate that the performance of the cnn model can be significantly degraded with a forecast lead time past a certain point beyond that point the nutrient environment and weather inputs for t 2 t 1 and t could correspond poorly with the future biophysical processes affecting microcystis concentrations fig 6 this trend of decreasing cnn performance with increasing lead time can be observed in prior studies chattopadhyay et al 2019 introduced a decrease in accuracy of cold spell class prediction from 73 to 47 when the lead time changed from 1 day to 5 day the time scale of the prediction also affected the cnn performance in the work of ghimire et al 2019 who found that the relative mean absolute error of the global solar radiation estimation with cnn was 9 91 to 19 57 for daily and monthly values respectively when the forecast lead time increases the internal uncertainty of the cnn model and imperfect descriptions of the extracted input features influence on model training resulting in a decrease in the prediction accuracy miao et al 2019 thus the current study demonstrated the robust short term microcystis forecasting ability of the cnn model 3 3 2 spatial density of observations the prediction performance of the cnn model was tested in terms of varied observation density the spatial observation points were randomly assigned to 50 and 20 of the total model grid cells denoted as od50 and od20 respectively and as od100 when all the grid cells were utilized the cnn model configured for microcystis nowcasting was adopted for these scenarios the nse values of the validation results decreased from 0 84 to 0 70 as the observation density decreased from 100 to 20 the trained models for od100 od50 and od20 were each applied to the entire grid to generate a microcystis map and the accuracy of the three models was compared against the efdcnier output grid cells fig 7 presents the rmse variation of each case od100 od50 and od20 for august od100 showed the lowest rmses while od20 produced the highest table 3 these results indicate that the cnn regression model with higher observation densities can describe the spatial and serial features of microcystis relatively well compared with the model with a lower density therefore the deep learning performance is directly influenced by the amount of the available data sarikaya et al 2014 identified training accuracy variations of a deep learning model considering different data sizes showing the highest classification performance for the case with the largest data size an insufficient amount of data creates a generalization problem for a deep learning model because the trained model may not be capable of representing the features of new data that have not been or have rarely been present in the training data huang and kingsbury 2013 data augmentation techniques such as deformation and rotation of inputs to increase the size of the input data have been used in other studies to address this issue salamon and bello 2017 furthermore the cnn performance is also dominated by the complexity of the input data in particular water quality predictions with cnns using multi dimensional imagery require spatially distributed nutrients environmental variables and microcystis concentrations which can be acquired only from intensive coupled field monitoring and laboratory experiments otherwise one may be left with the limited available data however this study identified the randomly selected 30 grid cells provided reasonable prediction accuracy of cnn model with respect to different forecast lead time although the deep learning performance typically benefits from larger datasets it is difficult to define the minimum or maximum size of the dataset for deep learning models because the complexity of the observation data is an important factor du et al 2018 pyo et al 2019 obtained reasonable cyanobacteria concentration estimation using cnn model with complex image inputs despite the limited number of observation data points preliminary research is needed to establish an acceptable amount of input data for cnn regression modeling 3 3 3 adding noise to cnn inputs in this study three different types of distributions uniform normal and gamma distribution were assumed for the random errors that were added to the training and validation data to build three data cases with different synthetic observational errors the cnn model with the 3 day forecast lead time was utilized for these scenarios four cases for each error distribution model were introduced based on different error amplitudes of the input data no error 10 50 and 100 errors table 4 shows that the training and validation accuracy decreased as the observational error rate increased for all error distribution functions as the error rate increased for the gamma distribution the forecast accuracy decreased significantly the nse was reduced from 0 81 to 0 60 and the rmse increased from 0 27 to 0 39 gc m 3 respectively for the validation results fig 8 b d f and h overall more substantial errors in the input data led to a decrease in the forecast accuracy of the cnn model because the nutrient and environmental inputs with significant errors could worsen the relationship with the microcystis data fig 9 for example nutrient concentrations higher than an optimum level for microcystis growth nutrient saturation cannot reflect the variation in microcystis biomass in august because the algal growth rate reaches its maximum baldia et al 2007 similarly high solar intensity could reduce the biomass of microcystis because algal growth is photo inhibited over a certain solar threshold zevenboom and mur 1984 the optimal water temperature for microcystis growth falls in the range between 28 8 c and 30 5 c with temperatures over 30 5 c decreasing the growth rate robarts and zohary 1987 furthermore erroneously high flow rates would inhibit microcystis bloom formation lin et al 2012 found that the threshold flow rate for microcystis growth was 25 cm s 1 substantial observational errors affect the input data resulting in incorrect nutrient and environmental feature extraction during the cnn model training the accuracy results revealed the significant effect of input error on the cnn prediction performance implying that reducing data acquisition errors is required to improve the prediction performance in addition cnn prediction capability was not compromised by input errors of less than 10 elmes et al 2020 showed that the classification usage of the deep learning model could tolerate the input errors less than 20 if the error does not approach the critical level the cnn model may provide reliable prediction results furthermore a large enough dataset can mitigate the effect of randomly distributed input errors during training because the cnn model can learn the actual relationship between input and output kang et al 2019 3 4 deep learning application with high temporal frequency images we used the output of efdcnier as the synthetic dataset to see what degree of detail may be acceptable to train the cnn and obtain reasonable predictions with this cnn the advantages of using the realistic synthetic dataset are that it can be decimated to different degrees and the noise in perturbed data can be accurately defined however neither the nse nor rmse within the scope of the study accounts for spatial patterns in the concentrations of microcystis synthetic data and subsequent visualization could help in defining the metrics for the cnn reproduction of specific magnitude ranges or areas of microcystis distributions a video clip was generated to compare the microcystis prediction map created by the cnn and efdcnier models in the clip the microcystis spatial distribution from the cnn model mostly agreed well with the distribution of the efdcnier model fig 10 for 2015 the cnn demonstrated the best performance regarding spatial distribution along the hc reach fig 10a the prediction results for 2016 and 2017 showed overestimations of the microcystis concentration the southwest and the northeast sections notably overestimated the microcystis compared with efdcnier prediction fig 10b for 2017 the cnn model overestimated microcystis along the hc reach fig 10c but the prediction for 2018 slightly underestimated the concentrations in the northwest part of the reach fig 10d these prediction uncertainties may be caused by the internal errors in the synthetic data from the efdcnier model because the results of this work were limited by the list of the water quality variables table 1 the available synthetic data may approach the critical level of error accordingly the weak relationship of input variables with microcystis concentrations resulted in the mediocre validation performance of the cnn model overall a high density of data appears to be critical for the cnn microcystis prediction performance acquiring high temporal frequency images can lead to the robust accuracy of the cnn deep learning applications which could be a promising tool for the short term prediction of microcystis biomass this work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role of deep learning models and mechanistic models baker et al 2018 whereas mechanistic models such as efdcnier have difficulties in incorporating data from different space and time scales and can work with relatively small datasets deep learning models such as cnn easily incorporate data from multiple scales but require large datasets for training ad validation mechanistic models once validated can be used as a predictive tool where experiments are difficult or costly to perform whereas deep learning models can only make predictions that relate to patterns within the data this work did not contrapose the models of the two types but rather illustrated two aspects of synergetic use of deep learning and mechanistic models first a large realistic dataset was required to research the ability of the deep learning model cnn to learn the spatio temporal patterns of microcystis biomass concentrations with different spatio temporal data density such a dataset could not be collected in the field at the current level of equipment capabilities and the dataset was produced as the output of the mechanistic model efdcnier second simulations with complex mechanistic models are often computationally expensive and efcnier provides an example of that is substantially time consuming processes spending 20 h compared to spending 4 97 min for cnn simulation guo et al 2016 for such cases the deep learning model can create the surrogate model hong et al 2017 that can be trained at a limited number of detailed simulations without the configuration of initial and boundary conditions the precise characterization of more than 130 number of model parameters djurovic et al 2015 ji 2017 the approximate surrogate model in our case cnn is used for future predictions integration of mechanistic and deep learning models is a fast developing field schuwirth et al 2019 zaherpour et al 2019 presenting promising and important research avenues remote sensing particularly using small unmanned aerial vehicles drones and multiple satellites can provide high frequency of multi or hyper spectral image data these types of data can be converted to water quality variable maps including water temperature alc√¢ntara et al 2010 dissolved oxygen kim et al 2020 total suspended solid wang et al 2018 and total phosphorus xiong et al 2019 which were used as cnn inputs in this study choi et al 2019 ta and wei 2018 we expect groups of remote sensing images to be replaced as cnn input for water quality prediction study in the near future because the image sets can include high temporal frequencies hence the prediction performance of a cnn model was tested preliminarily in this study assuming that high frequency image data are available 4 conclusion this study investigated the cnn performance for microcystis prediction based on synthetic high temporal frequency images the efdcnier model was developed to generate the synthetic nutrient environmental and atmospheric grid cell data that were utilized as inputs for the cnn model the cnn model was then configured for microcystis nowcasting and forecasting modeling scenarios were designed and implemented to investigate how the cnn model performance is affected by the forecast lead time spatial observation density and noise in the input data temporal degradation in the input datasets led to a decrease in cnn accuracy however the cnn performance remained acceptable even after a significant decrease in the volume of spatial data and a substantial addition of noise thus this work highlights the significance of spatial monitoring with high temporal frequency and contributes to the development of insights and guidance regarding data acquisition for future deep learning research for water resources for related future work a sensitivity analysis would be of interest to determine the relative importance of accurate variable inputs such as water quality environmental and weather conditions as potential cyanobacterial bloom predictors in the cnn model declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17540,machine learning modeling techniques have emerged as a potential means for predicting algal blooms in this study synthetic spatio temporal water quality data for a river section were generated with a 3d water quality model and used to investigate the capability of a convolutional neural network cnn for predicting harmful cyanobacterial blooms the cnn model displayed a reasonable capacity for short term predictions of cyanobacteria microcystis biomass in the nowcasting of microcystis the cnn performance had a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 87 an increase in the forecast lead time resulted in a decrease in the prediction accuracy reducing the nse from 0 87 to 0 58 as the spatial observation density increased from 20 to 100 of the input image grids the cnn prediction nse had improved from 0 70 to 0 84 adding noise to the data resulted in accuracy deterioration but even at the noise amplitude of 10 the accuracy was acceptable for some applications with nse 0 76 visualization of the cnn results characterized its performance variations across the studied river reach overall this study successfully demonstrated the capability of the cnn model for cyanobacterial bloom prediction using high temporal frequency images graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords convolutional neural network efdc synthetic data microcystis prediction 1 introduction predicting water quality changes is a challenging issue in environmental research due to the complexity and uncertainty of biochemical processes in natural waters beck et al 2012 summers et al 1993 in particular the accurate prediction of algal dynamics is complicated due to substantial uncertainties associated with growth nutrient uptake grazing and photosynthesis among other factors li et al 2013 xie et al 2012 with the rapid development of computational power numerous efforts have been made to transition water quality models from lumped steady state models to three dimensional dynamic models wang et al 2015 especially models have been improved continuously for algae related predictions clark and jaworski 1972 utilized a one dimensional dynamic estuary model to predict algae concentrations however the one dimensional approach ignored significant physical phenomena such as substantial vertical differences additionally the prediction accuracy was hampered by the use of the simplified equations that averaged the vertical and lateral variations ulanowicz 1976 later studies developed two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to consider longitudinal and vertical advection martin 1988 applied a two dimensional water quality model coupled with hydrodynamic algorithms to predict algal dynamics however the two dimensional model had limited applicability to water bodies with pronounced lateral differences recently with the improvement in computational capability three dimensional hydrodynamic models have been actively utilized to predict algal concentrations wu and xu 2011 and kim et al 2017 predicted algal blooms with reasonable accuracy by applying the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc although this model has been developed for predicting algal bloom trends when sufficient observed data is available the prediction of the algal dynamics still requires improvements interactions among the major processes uncertainty in the kinetic rate parameter values and complexity of the three dimensional hydrodynamic simulation hinder the efficient application of the model for forecasting algal blooms li et al 2013 xie et al 2012 data driven models have been spotlighted as an alternative approach to estimating water quality parameters by reflecting the underlying features of water constituent dynamics teles et al 2006 effectively implemented a time series forecasting of cyanobacteria using artificial neural networks ann cho et al 2011 successfully predicted arsenic concentrations in groundwater using anns and park et al 2015 showed satisfactory performance of support vector machines svm in chlorophyll a predictions conventional data driven models with relatively low dimensional data such as the time series of point measured constituents have shown reasonable accuracy however such models contain a large number of internal units internal parameters and prohibitively high training times for accurate predictions using high dimensional data such as multi dimensional imagery that have become an essential output of modern monitoring programs w√≥jcik and kurdziel 2019 deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks cnns appear to be suitable to process the multi dimensional imagery for classification and regression tasks because cnns can use the high dimensional images as inputs and extract sophisticated features in the imagery data thus radically increasing the explanatory and predictive capacity of the neural network chen et al 2016 yu et al 2017 therefore cnns can be utilized to estimate algal concentrations with multi dimensional data pyo et al 2019 has introduced a cnn regression with hyperspectral imagery for estimating cyanobacteria biomass the applicability of cnns can be expanded to the prediction tasks when images are available with high temporal frequency poliyapram et al 2019 to date cnn predictions for algal blooms have been rarely implemented because it is challenging to obtain imagery data with high temporal frequency from airborne platforms or satellites due to high costs and variable weather conditions yang et al 2010 nevertheless the algal prediction performance of the cnn model can be evaluated using synthetic datasets obtained as outputs of hydrodynamics based water quality models which can generate high temporal frequency imagery additionally a cnn trained with the hydrodynamics based model outputs can become a surrogate model or metamodel hong et al 2017 this model enables sensitivity and scenario analyses that are hard to implement by running the hydrodynamics based models when there are a large number of scenarios this study aims to evaluate the applicability of cnns for algal bloom predictions with model generated high temporal frequency image gridded data and investigate the performance mechanisms through scenario analyses which we believe have never been addressed previously we used a calibrated efdc to generate model output images of the concentrations of microcystis in grid cells for a river section these images were used to develop the cnn models applied for the scenario analyses the differences between the scenarios included variances in the forecast lead time spatial observation density and amplitude of noise added to the input images 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the reach of the nakdong river the longest river in south korea was selected for this study two large multi purpose weirs the dalseong ds and hapcheon changyeong hc weirs define the upstream and downstream boundaries of the reach referred to as the hc reach which has the average water depth of 8 4 m and the length of 29 4 km fig 1 two main tributaries the huichan and chacheon bring pollutants from domestic and industrial sewage treatment plants livestock facilities and agricultural fields to the reach lee and kim 2017 these point and non point source pollutants including those from the upstream boundary cause eutrophication in the hc reach with several algal blooms lee et al 2014 additionally the weir increases the flow retention time and stability enhancing harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the summer lee et al 2014 cyanobacterial blooms were observed in the reach a total of 129 days during the four years from 2012 to 2016 furthermore the cell counts of cyanobacteria during 61 of the bloom period i e 79 days exceeded the warning criteria set for early algal alerts in south korea 1000 cells ml 1 lee and kim 2017 2 2 efdc model the layout of this study is presented in fig 2 the first part contains simulations by the hydrodynamic model fig 2a d this study selected the efdc model which is a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model developed at the virginia institute of marine science and approved by the us epa hamrick 1992 the efdc model includes hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxic contaminant transport and fate modules which are capable of simulating flow transport and fate and biochemical processes in rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas the hydrodynamic module solves the three dimensional shallow water equations coupled with salinity and temperature transport hamrick and mills 2000 additionally the efdc solves the vertically hydrostatic and free surface mean turbulent fluid motion equation the specific mass balance equations reflect the changes in the concentrations of water quality constituents such as algal groups nitrogen phosphorus dissolved oxygen silica and carbon 1 t m x m y h c x m y h u c y m x h v c z m x m y w c x m y h a x m x c x y m x

original efdc model has a limitation in the simulation of cyanobacteria because it does not mimic vertical cyanobacterial migration under buoyancy control which can be critical in terms of competition with other algal species for light and nutrients the national institute of environmental research nier in the republic of korea modified the efdc to consider this functionality by allowing algal density to be changed depending on the amount of light the algae receive the modified version efdcnier provides additional capabilities such as simulations for several algal species different cyanobacteria species such as the microcystis and anabaena species can be simulated concurrently by the efdcnier structures of the original control files i e efdc inp and wq3dwc inp were preserved and new control files were built for the initial conditions and parameters of the additional algal species the cyanobacterial density and vertical movement velocity were adopted from kromkamp and walsby 1990 and the settling velocity module was corrected to consider the density and vertical velocity parameters in the input file wqstokes inp in addition the artificial weir module for efdcnier was developed to simulate various weir structure operations such as a fixed or movable weir fishway and small hydraulic power plant the model can reflect the variation of flow rate and water elevation controlled by the hc details of the efdcnier weir module are described in shin et al 2017 2 2 1 1 model setup and boundary condition in the current study the efdcnier model included a section of the river that extended beyond the hc reach to obtain more accurate calibration results the model domain includes most of the primary nakdong river stream extending from the river mouth to the andong dam which is located approximately 340 km upstream from the river mouth fig 1 presents the sub domain for the hc reach where curvilinear orthogonal grids were adopted to represent the geometry of the hc reach thereby generating a total of 480 grid cells figs 1 and 2a the grid cell width and lengths varied ranging from 90 m to 100 m and from 190 m to 200 m respectively the water body was divided into 11 layers of the same thickness with an average depth of 10 m after the grid generation the initial and boundary conditions were set using flow and water quality data acquired from the water environmental information system of the republic of korea observed at the outlets of the two tributaries and using the simulation results from the ds the upstream boundary fig 2b the initial conditions were set using the observation data along the river reach but their effects disappear soon after the spin up period of the model fig 2b in the mainstream and tributaries of the hc the inflow outflow water quality constituent loading and weather data were used to set the initial concentrations and boundary conditions the model was calibrated for the entire year of 2015 and then validated for the years from 2016 to 2018 the significant issues for the water quality module calibration were the algal primary production oxygen consumption after the decomposition of organic matter and dissolved oxygen concentration wu and xu 2011 the optimum model parameters were varied based on the typical ranges found in literature sources fig 2c and were fine tuned until the root mean square difference between the observed and simulated water quality variables was minimized chen et al 2016 2 3 convolutional neural network cnn a cnn is a deep learning model that exploits feature hierarchies of multi dimensional image data from low level to high level features and serves as a powerful image processing tool compared to standard feedforward neural network a cnn requires fewer parameters and connections between elements and is therefore easier to train krizhevsky et al 2012 efdcnier outputs can be organized into images where grid cells serve as pixels thus this study utilized a cnn model with structural units shown in fig 3 to extract the water quality features from the efdcnier output to predict microcystis biomass the typical architecture of a cnn is composed of convolutional and pooling layers lecun et al 2015 in the convolutional layers convolutional filters slide over the input image and the feature extraction consists of finding weights for each filter element and the bias value the output of the convolutional layer is the feature map that serves as the input for the next convolutional layer which can then learn more complex features a set of weights and biases is passed through non linear activation functions such as the sigmoid function and rectified linear unit relu each group of the extracted features in a layer shares the same filters allowing the detection of the same feature pattern in different parts of the image conversely different features result from the various filters that lead to easy feature detection from the input data lecun et al 2015 the convolution layers may be separated by the pooling layers that merge the extracted features before passing them on to the next convolution layer the merge consists of averaging or taking maximum value for the highlighted features and increasing the computation efficiency by reducing the size of the features max pooling was applied in this work during which the dimension of the extracted features is reduced by taking the maximum value from the features in other words if a feature with a 2 2 dimension was passed through the max pooling layer with a 2 2 dimension the maximum value from the feature values of 2 2 is output as one value a cnn model can be configured to have multiple stacked convolutional and pooling layers followed by additional convolutional layers and then fully connected layers the weights in all the filters can be found during the cnn training using the backpropagation algorithm lecun et al 2015 we applied the alexnet as the standard cnn architecture for the configuration based on the tensorflow library abadi et al 2016 for training the cnn model the adam optimizer santoro et al 2017 was used to optimize the weights by minimizing the difference between the microcystis biomass predicted by the cnn model and the efdcnier model the mean square error mse are adopted as the cost function 3 y i 1 n c i l e i l 2 n where n is the number of training data c i l is the predicted microcystis biomass by cnn in carbon concentration gc m 3 and e i l is the predicted microcystis from efdcnier although multiple non linear weights in the stacked cnn layers can be trained from the complicated relationships between inputs and outputs a significant portion of such relationships may be the result of sampling noise by the training data the dropout method was adopted in this study to prevent possible overfitting the dropout layer temporarily removes one node that is chosen randomly from each layer in the network previous studies have suggested that the optimal probability of dropping nodes is 0 5 krizhevsky et al 2012 the weights in the dropped nodes are not renewed in the training network preventing the convergence of particular weights during the training srivastava et al 2014 the statistical distribution of input data is changed in the intermediate convolutional layers because the distribution of the weights in the activation function is constantly changed during training accordingly the training speed of cnn model may become slow because each layer has to learn new data distribution in every training iteration ioffe and szegedy 2015 to address this problem we placed a batch normalization layer after each convolutional layer this layer normalizes the output from the previous convolutional layer and feeds the normalized output into the next layer as the input data devries and taylor 2017 the batch normalization also prevents the early convergence of weights to a narrow range of values 2 3 1 cnn setup the efdcnier model outputs of each grid with a 12 hour interval for the calibration and validation periods were used as inputs for the cnn the grid cell data consists of microcystis biomass water quality variables and environmental variables such as flow velocity temperature and elevation fig 2d and 4 a the atmospheric data such as atmospheric pressure dry and wet temperatures rainfall evapotranspiration solar radiation and cloud cover used for the efdcnier model simulation were assigned to each grid to maintain the same grid data format all the input data were stacked for the configuration of the cnn model fig 2e and 4b so that the model can reflect the features of the water quality the dimensions of the input image data for the cnn were composed of the number of grid cells n size of the grid cells including width w and height h and the number of input variables including water quality environmental and atmospheric variables c the amount of data is dependent on the assumption of the number of observations the width and height of the input image were the size of the input window segmented as 3 3 pixel sizes i e n 3 3 c this study assumed that the observation point was located in the center of the input windows the model included 23 channel dimensions including the stacked water quality environmental and atmospheric states fig 4c the internal layers and parameters of the cnn model were manually varied to provide an accurate microcystis biomass prediction fig 2g two convolutional layers were utilized with batch normalization max pooling and dropout layers to extract the input features the size and number of filters in the first convolutional layer were adopted as 2 2 pixels and 128 respectively with the second layer containing filters of 2 2 pixel size and 256 respectively after finishing the feature extraction of the convolutional layers two sequential fully connected layers with 32 and 64 nodes were adopted to nowcast the microcystis concentrations fig 3a moreover we added new layers between the second convolutional layer and the fully connected layer after the feature extraction of the second convolutional layer the output was vectorized and future weather data were then added the future weather data used were for two days before the target prediction day then two 1 dimensional convolutional layers were used with 8 and 16 filters with 1 5 pixel sizes fig 3b finally the same number of fully connected layers with the nowcasting structure was used to predict the microcystis concentration 2 4 scenario analysis scenarios regarding microcystis biomass prediction under various assumptions were analyzed using the cnn model in which the efdc outputs were assumed to be the true data in an image data format with high temporal frequency fig 2h j the scenario analysis included microcystis predictions with different forecast lead times observation grid cell densities and observation errors using the efdcnier output allowed us to evaluate the cnn performance in predicting microcystis concentrations for different prediction times from nowcasting to 7 day lead times fig 2h the scenarios with various spatial densities of observation grid cells evaluated the effect of the sparsity of observation points on the prediction accuracy because the grid cells of the efdcnier model could be treated as real observation points synthetic data sets with different observation points could be generated by a random selection of grid cells the scenarios included data sets using 100 50 and 20 of the grid cells respectively fig 2i scenarios with different observation errors were developed by introducing random errors that followed uniform normal or gamma distributions with varying magnitudes i e 10 50 and 100 and were added to the cnn inputs fig 2j 3 results and discussion 3 1 efdcnier model for microcystis simulation for an accurate simulation of the hydrodynamics of the river reaches confined by the large weirs the measured flow rate data were used at each weir point as boundary conditions which forced the simulated water levels to be comparable to those observed for water quality table 1 presents the calibration and validation results of the water quality variables the unit of microcystis from the efdcnier output was transformed from carbon unit to cells using the carbon contents of microcystis cells in hc moe 2016 the results for 2015 showed the lowest calibration errors compared with the validation errors from the other years the microcystis validation results produced relatively large errors compared with the other variables these results were attributed to the inherent characteristics of microorganism measurements in the environment which normally show significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity wu and xu 2011 although efdcnier always has internal simulation errors the reason for the use of the synthetic data as ground truth is that this study requires sufficient image data resources with high temporal frequency to evaluate the microcystis prediction performance of the cnn model 3 2 cnn for microcystis biomass nowcasting the nowcasting of microcystis biomass by the cnn model was conducted for the data generated by the efdcnier model only data from august were used to investigate the most vulnerable period of the year to the microcystis dominated bloom to consider the possible influence of previous conditions on the current microcystis biomass the input data for three days from current day denoted as t to two days ago t 2 were entered in the cnn model to predict the status of microcystis at the current date t a total of 30 random grid cells were assumed available for measurements the earliest 70 of the input data were used for model training and the remaining 30 were used for validation the two figures in the first row of fig 5 show the cnn performance on the microcystis nowcasting for the training fig 5a and validation periods fig 5b high accuracy with an nse of 0 95 and r2 of 0 97 was achieved for the training table 2 the outcomes of the validation showed reasonable results with an nse of 0 87 and r2 of 0 90 these results proved that the cnn model could provide reliable nowcasting outcomes for microcystis by reflecting input variations with time the combination of the input variables for the nutrients environment and atmospheric conditions and the selection of three days i e t 2 t 1 and t for the input time window were sufficient to reflect the conditions of the microcystis dominated blooms at day t several studies have demonstrated the reasonable accuracy of cnn based metamodels in various applications wang and xu 2019 built a cnn model with four one dimensional convolutional layers to estimate the walking and running speeds of a person using acceleration data this study found that the cnn structure provided the estimation errors within 18 compared to the observations pyo et al 2019 designed a cnn structure with two convolutional layers to estimate cyanobacteria concentrations from hyperspectral imagery showing r2 values of 0 86 and 0 73 with respect to the observed phycocyanin and chlorophyll a concentrations respectively hong et al 2019 estimated concentrations of ultra fine particles using a pretrained imagenet structure with satellite images and their results demonstrated a regression accuracy of over 86 despite of the different input composition and cnn structures the results of previous studies indicate that the deep feature extraction allowed for finding robust relationships thereby providing a reliable performance of cnn metamodels by extension our study provided an example of time series data as efficient input for nowcast using a cnn model 3 3 scenario analysis 3 3 1 effect of forecast lead time new weather data layers for 2 days t 1 and t 2 were added to the nowcasting cnn configuration to configure a new cnn model for forecasting microcystis for 3 days in the future t 3 fig 4 similarly weather data layers for 6 days from t 1 to t 6 were added for forecasting 7 days in the future t 7 the two figures in the second row of fig 5 show the results of microcystis forecasting with the 3 day lead time for the training fig 5c and validation periods fig 5d fig 5e and f present the results of the 7 day lead time as expected the forecast accuracies of the 3 day lead time simulation were lower than for nowcasting in both the training and validation but they were still reasonably high however the accuracy of the 7 day lead time simulation decreased significantly in particular the accuracy difference between the two cases was the largest for the 3 day forecasting with nse values of 0 92 training and 0 81 validation versus 0 76 and 0 58 for the 7 day simulation respectively table 2 these results indicate that the performance of the cnn model can be significantly degraded with a forecast lead time past a certain point beyond that point the nutrient environment and weather inputs for t 2 t 1 and t could correspond poorly with the future biophysical processes affecting microcystis concentrations fig 6 this trend of decreasing cnn performance with increasing lead time can be observed in prior studies chattopadhyay et al 2019 introduced a decrease in accuracy of cold spell class prediction from 73 to 47 when the lead time changed from 1 day to 5 day the time scale of the prediction also affected the cnn performance in the work of ghimire et al 2019 who found that the relative mean absolute error of the global solar radiation estimation with cnn was 9 91 to 19 57 for daily and monthly values respectively when the forecast lead time increases the internal uncertainty of the cnn model and imperfect descriptions of the extracted input features influence on model training resulting in a decrease in the prediction accuracy miao et al 2019 thus the current study demonstrated the robust short term microcystis forecasting ability of the cnn model 3 3 2 spatial density of observations the prediction performance of the cnn model was tested in terms of varied observation density the spatial observation points were randomly assigned to 50 and 20 of the total model grid cells denoted as od50 and od20 respectively and as od100 when all the grid cells were utilized the cnn model configured for microcystis nowcasting was adopted for these scenarios the nse values of the validation results decreased from 0 84 to 0 70 as the observation density decreased from 100 to 20 the trained models for od100 od50 and od20 were each applied to the entire grid to generate a microcystis map and the accuracy of the three models was compared against the efdcnier output grid cells fig 7 presents the rmse variation of each case od100 od50 and od20 for august od100 showed the lowest rmses while od20 produced the highest table 3 these results indicate that the cnn regression model with higher observation densities can describe the spatial and serial features of microcystis relatively well compared with the model with a lower density therefore the deep learning performance is directly influenced by the amount of the available data sarikaya et al 2014 identified training accuracy variations of a deep learning model considering different data sizes showing the highest classification performance for the case with the largest data size an insufficient amount of data creates a generalization problem for a deep learning model because the trained model may not be capable of representing the features of new data that have not been or have rarely been present in the training data huang and kingsbury 2013 data augmentation techniques such as deformation and rotation of inputs to increase the size of the input data have been used in other studies to address this issue salamon and bello 2017 furthermore the cnn performance is also dominated by the complexity of the input data in particular water quality predictions with cnns using multi dimensional imagery require spatially distributed nutrients environmental variables and microcystis concentrations which can be acquired only from intensive coupled field monitoring and laboratory experiments otherwise one may be left with the limited available data however this study identified the randomly selected 30 grid cells provided reasonable prediction accuracy of cnn model with respect to different forecast lead time although the deep learning performance typically benefits from larger datasets it is difficult to define the minimum or maximum size of the dataset for deep learning models because the complexity of the observation data is an important factor du et al 2018 pyo et al 2019 obtained reasonable cyanobacteria concentration estimation using cnn model with complex image inputs despite the limited number of observation data points preliminary research is needed to establish an acceptable amount of input data for cnn regression modeling 3 3 3 adding noise to cnn inputs in this study three different types of distributions uniform normal and gamma distribution were assumed for the random errors that were added to the training and validation data to build three data cases with different synthetic observational errors the cnn model with the 3 day forecast lead time was utilized for these scenarios four cases for each error distribution model were introduced based on different error amplitudes of the input data no error 10 50 and 100 errors table 4 shows that the training and validation accuracy decreased as the observational error rate increased for all error distribution functions as the error rate increased for the gamma distribution the forecast accuracy decreased significantly the nse was reduced from 0 81 to 0 60 and the rmse increased from 0 27 to 0 39 gc m 3 respectively for the validation results fig 8 b d f and h overall more substantial errors in the input data led to a decrease in the forecast accuracy of the cnn model because the nutrient and environmental inputs with significant errors could worsen the relationship with the microcystis data fig 9 for example nutrient concentrations higher than an optimum level for microcystis growth nutrient saturation cannot reflect the variation in microcystis biomass in august because the algal growth rate reaches its maximum baldia et al 2007 similarly high solar intensity could reduce the biomass of microcystis because algal growth is photo inhibited over a certain solar threshold zevenboom and mur 1984 the optimal water temperature for microcystis growth falls in the range between 28 8 c and 30 5 c with temperatures over 30 5 c decreasing the growth rate robarts and zohary 1987 furthermore erroneously high flow rates would inhibit microcystis bloom formation lin et al 2012 found that the threshold flow rate for microcystis growth was 25 cm s 1 substantial observational errors affect the input data resulting in incorrect nutrient and environmental feature extraction during the cnn model training the accuracy results revealed the significant effect of input error on the cnn prediction performance implying that reducing data acquisition errors is required to improve the prediction performance in addition cnn prediction capability was not compromised by input errors of less than 10 elmes et al 2020 showed that the classification usage of the deep learning model could tolerate the input errors less than 20 if the error does not approach the critical level the cnn model may provide reliable prediction results furthermore a large enough dataset can mitigate the effect of randomly distributed input errors during training because the cnn model can learn the actual relationship between input and output kang et al 2019 3 4 deep learning application with high temporal frequency images we used the output of efdcnier as the synthetic dataset to see what degree of detail may be acceptable to train the cnn and obtain reasonable predictions with this cnn the advantages of using the realistic synthetic dataset are that it can be decimated to different degrees and the noise in perturbed data can be accurately defined however neither the nse nor rmse within the scope of the study accounts for spatial patterns in the concentrations of microcystis synthetic data and subsequent visualization could help in defining the metrics for the cnn reproduction of specific magnitude ranges or areas of microcystis distributions a video clip was generated to compare the microcystis prediction map created by the cnn and efdcnier models in the clip the microcystis spatial distribution from the cnn model mostly agreed well with the distribution of the efdcnier model fig 10 for 2015 the cnn demonstrated the best performance regarding spatial distribution along the hc reach fig 10a the prediction results for 2016 and 2017 showed overestimations of the microcystis concentration the southwest and the northeast sections notably overestimated the microcystis compared with efdcnier prediction fig 10b for 2017 the cnn model overestimated microcystis along the hc reach fig 10c but the prediction for 2018 slightly underestimated the concentrations in the northwest part of the reach fig 10d these prediction uncertainties may be caused by the internal errors in the synthetic data from the efdcnier model because the results of this work were limited by the list of the water quality variables table 1 the available synthetic data may approach the critical level of error accordingly the weak relationship of input variables with microcystis concentrations resulted in the mediocre validation performance of the cnn model overall a high density of data appears to be critical for the cnn microcystis prediction performance acquiring high temporal frequency images can lead to the robust accuracy of the cnn deep learning applications which could be a promising tool for the short term prediction of microcystis biomass this work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role of deep learning models and mechanistic models baker et al 2018 whereas mechanistic models such as efdcnier have difficulties in incorporating data from different space and time scales and can work with relatively small datasets deep learning models such as cnn easily incorporate data from multiple scales but require large datasets for training ad validation mechanistic models once validated can be used as a predictive tool where experiments are difficult or costly to perform whereas deep learning models can only make predictions that relate to patterns within the data this work did not contrapose the models of the two types but rather illustrated two aspects of synergetic use of deep learning and mechanistic models first a large realistic dataset was required to research the ability of the deep learning model cnn to learn the spatio temporal patterns of microcystis biomass concentrations with different spatio temporal data density such a dataset could not be collected in the field at the current level of equipment capabilities and the dataset was produced as the output of the mechanistic model efdcnier second simulations with complex mechanistic models are often computationally expensive and efcnier provides an example of that is substantially time consuming processes spending 20 h compared to spending 4 97 min for cnn simulation guo et al 2016 for such cases the deep learning model can create the surrogate model hong et al 2017 that can be trained at a limited number of detailed simulations without the configuration of initial and boundary conditions the precise characterization of more than 130 number of model parameters djurovic et al 2015 ji 2017 the approximate surrogate model in our case cnn is used for future predictions integration of mechanistic and deep learning models is a fast developing field schuwirth et al 2019 zaherpour et al 2019 presenting promising and important research avenues remote sensing particularly using small unmanned aerial vehicles drones and multiple satellites can provide high frequency of multi or hyper spectral image data these types of data can be converted to water quality variable maps including water temperature alc√¢ntara et al 2010 dissolved oxygen kim et al 2020 total suspended solid wang et al 2018 and total phosphorus xiong et al 2019 which were used as cnn inputs in this study choi et al 2019 ta and wei 2018 we expect groups of remote sensing images to be replaced as cnn input for water quality prediction study in the near future because the image sets can include high temporal frequencies hence the prediction performance of a cnn model was tested preliminarily in this study assuming that high frequency image data are available 4 conclusion this study investigated the cnn performance for microcystis prediction based on synthetic high temporal frequency images the efdcnier model was developed to generate the synthetic nutrient environmental and atmospheric grid cell data that were utilized as inputs for the cnn model the cnn model was then configured for microcystis nowcasting and forecasting modeling scenarios were designed and implemented to investigate how the cnn model performance is affected by the forecast lead time spatial observation density and noise in the input data temporal degradation in the input datasets led to a decrease in cnn accuracy however the cnn performance remained acceptable even after a significant decrease in the volume of spatial data and a substantial addition of noise thus this work highlights the significance of spatial monitoring with high temporal frequency and contributes to the development of insights and guidance regarding data acquisition for future deep learning research for water resources for related future work a sensitivity analysis would be of interest to determine the relative importance of

17541,vanadate v v and phenanthrene phe commonly coexist in groundwater aquifer posing potential threats to ecological environment and public health however little is known about the complicated biogeochemical processes involving microbial v v reduction coupled with co metabolic phe biodegradation herein we demonstrated that synchronous removal of v v and phe could be realized under anaerobic condition complete v v removal and phe degradation efficiency of 82 0 0 8 were achieved in 7 d operation in batch experiment 250 d continuous column experiment implied that hydrochemical condition

ecosystem and eventually threaten human health gauthier et al 2015 vanadium has been recognized as a potentially dangerous pollutant widely distributed in the earth s crust zhang et al 2018a which is a moderate toxicant and harmful to animal cells with concentrations greater than 1 10 nm naeem et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a vanadium occurs in 3 4 and 5 oxidation states in natural waters and v v is generally more soluble and toxic than other two oxidation states zhang et al 2019b meanwhile as a commercially important metal vanadium is wildly used in steel petroleum refining and catalysts industries cai et al 2017 li et al 2020a resulting in widespread vanadium polluted groundwater with v v as the predominant speciation wang et al 2018 for instance more than 283 sites in usa have been recorded to contain substantial vanadium contamination jiang et al 2018 a vanadium content range of 94 285 Œºg l is found in panzhihua southeast china which far exceeds the limit value of 50 Œºg l for vanadium proposed by china s drinking water standard gb 5749 20 2015 lai et al 2018 kong et al 2020 therefore v v removal from groundwater is of significant interest phe a typical low molecular weight pah with bioaccumulation high ecotoxicity and long term persistence has already aroused critical environmental concerns shon et al 2020 owing to the low solubility and high hydrophobicity zhang et al 2011 it is apt to adhere tightly to soil and sediment in aquifer leglize et al 2006 groundwater contaminated by phe has also been reported frequently dominguez et al 2019 cecconet et al 2020 additionally vanadium is present in crude oil and its concentration increases as the hydrocarbon heavy fraction content increases riccardi et al 2008 combustion processes of fuels from crude oil release abundant v v and phe into environment concurrently combined pollution of v v and phe is commonly found in oil tank farms and suburban railway areas riccardi et al 2008 levengood et al 2015 where the co pollutants can migrate through the unsaturated zone to groundwater for example both vanadium 2 49 665 Œºg l and phenanthrene 1 06 76 4 Œºg l in groundwater are detected from three tank farms located in north central and south italy riccardi et al 2008 additionally accidental spill also contributes to their co presence in environment for instance concentrations of vanadium and phenanthrene reach 148 9 mg kg and 5 5 mg kg in marine sediment after a diesel spill in oaxaca mexico salazar coria et al 2007 however biogeochemical interactions between v v and phe in groundwater environment is poorly understood removal of v v and phe from groundwater can be achieved by chemical physical and biological processes leglize et al 2006 bouzid et al 2017 shi et al 2020a among which microbial transformation is thought to be efficient and cost effective microbial reduction of v v to insoluble vanadium iv v iv for detoxification purposes under anaerobic condition have been well established li et al 2020b jiang et al 2018 heterotrophic v v reducers employ organic carbon to catalyze this biotransformation wang et al 2018 meanwhile anaerobic phe biodegradation readily occurs

environment worked as batch bioreactors 50 ml anaerobic consortium was added to each batch bioreactor as initial inoculum which was obtained from a brewery wastewater treatment facility 200 ml synthetic groundwater was also supplemented into each bioreactor shi et al 2019 both v v and phe concentrations were 10 mg l initially navo3 2h2o acted as the v v source methanol 75 v v was employed as organic carbon source xiao et al 2019 with the equivalent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 800 mg l all chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd beijing china except for phe from sigma co ltd st louis usa bioreactors contained different ingredients where bioreactor designated as v p was supplied with v v and phe while v v phe and methanol were added to bioreactor named v p m bioreactors containing only v v only phe v v and methanol phe and methanol were also employed as controls within three months microbial consortia were fully acclimated by refreshing aqueous solutions every three days then removals of v v and phe were recorded during 7 d operating cycle to evaluate the performance of bioreactors all batch experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c and in triplicate 2 2 column experiment the plexiglass column covered with aluminum foil to avoid light exposure had a total volume of 500 ml with 250 mm height and 50 mm diameter including 500 g quartzes and 100 ml anaerobic consortium which were mixed fully and then packed into the whole column the top and bottom spaces were equipped with gravel to prevent the blockage synthesized groundwater was supplied into the column by a peristaltic pump at a fixed rate of 0 12 ml min the operating conditions of the column bioreactor were shown in table 1 where the whole 250 d experiment was divided into four stages based on varied pollutants and co substrate concentrations the effluent from the column was collected daily to determine v v phe dissolved total v

the coupling of microbial v v reduction and phe degradation under anaerobic condition stoichiometric and energetic calculation also suggested the v v reduction coupled to phe oxidation could occur spontaneously rittmann and mccarty 2012 dolfing et al 2009 1 66 v o 2 c 14 h 10 66 h 66 v o 2 14 c o 2 38 h 2 o Œ¥ g 8114 kj mol the v v and phe removal efficiencies within 7 d operation in v p were 32 9 0 5 and 67 3 0 6 with the corresponding average removal rates of v v and phe were 0 47 0 03 mg l d and 0 96 0 05 mg l d v v and phe removals followed pseudo first order kinetics process fig 1b with kinetics rate constants of 0 061 d 1 and 0 17 d 1 table s2 supporting information when methanol was supplemented in v p m complete v v removal and phe removal efficiency of 82 0 0 8 were achieved average removal rates of v v and phe increased by 2 04 and 0 22 folds reaching 1 43 0 03 mg l d and 1 17 0 05 mg l d with obtained kinetics rate constants of 0 44 d 1 and 0 27 d 1 the substantial improvement in v v and phe removals were ascribed to methanol as supplementary electron donor for v v reduction and co metabolic substrate for phe degradation liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 given that both vanadium and phe concentrations were less than 10 mg l in co contaminated groundwater riccardi et al 2008 this anaerobic bio technique might be a more efficient and robust route for the remediation of v v and phe co polluted aquifer temporal dynamics of v v and phe were also comparatively investigated in control sets v v and phe concentrations remained almost unchanged during 7 d operation in controls with only v v and phe fig s1 supporting information suggesting that v v bio reduction required electron donor while carbon dioxide from heterotrophic respiration poorly acted as electron acceptor for anaerobic phe biodegradation due to lower redox potential e”© 380 mv jiang et al 2018 nzila 2018 however v v was gradually removed in the bioreactor with v v and methanol reaching a removal efficiency of 98 7 0 3 fig s1 supporting information which was comparable to 92 8 in 3 d operation in acetate supported v v reducing biosystem liu et al 2017a moreover this result was higher than that obtained in v p m suggesting phe addition deteriorate v v reduction due to higher toxicity of phe xiao et al 2019 even if co metabolic substrate was presented phe was rarely removed in bioreactor with phe and methanol further implying that effective electron acceptor was essential to anaerobic phe degradation 3 2 long term v v and phe removals under varied condition the time series of v v and phe concentration along with their removal efficiencies and capacities were shown in fig 2 during 250 d operation in the continuous flow biological column in stage 1 day 0 70 92 0 1 5 and 73 1 1 2 of v v and phe were removed respectively with removal capacities of 4 60 0 08 g m3 d and 3 66 0 06 g m3 d accordingly in stage 2 day 71 130 when the influent v v concentration was increased to 25 mg l v v reduction efficiency decreased to 78 8 1 2 whereas the average v v removal capacity increased to 19 7 0 30 g m3 d phe removal efficiency decreased to 56 8 1 1 while its removal capacity decreased to 2 84 0 06 g m3 d these results indicated that bioavailable substrate was sufficient for v v reduction and phe decomposers were more sensitive to increased toxicity in stage 3 day 131 190 when the influent phe concentration was further increased to 25 mg l an obvious decrease in v v removal efficiency to 80 5 1 4 and a slight decrease in v v removal capacity to 4 03 0 07 g m3 d was observed meanwhile phe was reduced to 28 4 1 2 at a capacity of 7 10 0 30 g m3 d these results further implied the poor adaptability of microorganisms for phe degradation with elevated toxicity moscoso et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 in stage 4 day 191 250 when the cod concentration was reduced from 800 mg l to 200 mg l the v v and phe removal efficiencies decreased considerably to 58 3 1 2 and 34 7 1 5 with removal capacities of 2 92 0 06 g m3 d and 1 74 0 08 g m3 d respectively when the carbon source was limited the removals of v v and phe were both inhibited it was reported that bio reduction of 51 mg l v v required approximate 330 mg l organics in terms of cod zhang et al 2019a meanwhile bioavailable substrate was also needed for co metabolic phe degradation shi et al 2015 the greater decrease in phe removal efficiency in stage 4 suggested that co metabolic phe degradation was more easily suppressed than v v reduction when bioavailable substrate was insufficient 3 3 identification of reaction products the total v concentration in the effluent of the biological column was almost equal to effluent v v content fig s2 supporting information suggesting that v v reduction products had precipitated sem image confirmed the produced precipitates deposited on the microbial surfaces fig 3 a eds result indicated that v was the major elemental composition of the precipitates fig 3b furthermore xps spectra identified distinctive peak with binding energy of 515 0 ev fig 3c which was in line with previous finding for v iv zhang et al 2018b this result demonstrated that the precipitated v iv was the main product from v v bio reduction qiu et al 2017 considering v iv is less toxic and insoluble under near neutral ph condition wang and ren 2014 the remediation process based on microorganisms could be practically useful to treat v v contaminated groundwater the observed peaks corresponding to v v may be due to the v iv re oxidation in air during collection and analyzing zhang et al 2009 a variety of intermediate products for phe degradation such as p cresol 10 032 min salicylic acid 12 835 min and cyclohexane 23 804 min were identified in different stages of the column experiment fig 3d which was also observed in previous phe biodegradation processes tsai et al 2009 sarma et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 another potential intermediate identified as 2 4 di tert butylphenol was also detected 15 616 min this result implied that phe experienced ring opening decomposition in our constructed biosystem the knowledge of anaerobic phe biodegradation pathway was still in its infancy while hydroxylation methylation and carboxylation processes were possible mechanisms of phe activation before ring opening nzila 2018 multiple matters in groundwater such as sulfate nitrate and fe iii could be used as electron acceptors in the anaerobic phe degradation coates et al 1996 chang et al 2002 rothermich et al 2002 and phe could be completely biotransformed to carbon dioxide in the presence of sulfate or nitrate nzila 2018 v v have higher redox potential than sulfate e”© 172 mv or nitrate e”© 934 mv thereby complete phe mineralization might occur in our biosystem furthermore the detected intermediate products with low molecular weight were less toxic kim et al 2009 which might be also utilized by microorganisms for v v reduction meanwhile the orp was relatively lower during the whole experiment fig s3 supporting information suggesting anaerobic respiration for v v bio reduction and phe bio oxidation by facultative microorganisms 3 4 evolution of microbial community microbial diversity and richness in experimental stages of biological column were higher than those in the inoculum table s3 supporting information indicating that microorganisms adapted to the environmental changes by enrichment and domestication hao et al 2018 the result from nmds analysis showed that samples cultivated in the different stages were all distinct from the inoculum while the microbial community composition in stage 3 and stage 4 were similar fig 4 a which might be that the higher phe loading in stage 3 further affected the microorganisms in stage 4 the venn diagram showed that there were 128 42 15 and 28 otus confined to each of these four individual stages fig 4b with a total of 474 otus common to all groups the shared otus might adapted to environment with v v phe and co metabolic substrate microbial community structure at class level changed during the long term operation of biological column fig 4c deltaproteobacteria predominated in stage 1 29 1 clostridia and alphaproteobacteria seemed to be more tolerant to v v with highest relative abundances 14 4 and 8 41 in stage 2 in addition anaerolineae 33 7 and gammapotoobacteria 14 9 accumulated in stage 3 with the highest phe concentrations implying that they might be involved in phe metabolism potential bacteria associated with v v reduction and phe degradation were found at genus level fig 4d geobacter appeared in all stages with highest relative abundance of 1 72 in stage 1 the ability of geobacter to reduce v v had been well confirmed but high v v concentration would inhibit its multiplication wang et al 2020 meanwhile the relative abundance of acetobacterium increased both in stage3 and stage 4 which had been reported to be able to promote v v reduction zhang et al 2015a enriched mycobacterium in stage 3 and stage 4 with relative abundances of 0 13 and 0 15 which was an important phe degrading colonizer especially in nutrient poor conditions uyttebroek et al 2006 moreover two new genera clostridium and sphingomonas appeared in stage 3 with higher phe concentration 25 mg l which was not detected in either inoculum or first two stages and were adapted to utilization of phe for its mineralization yan et al 2012 wang et al 2019 3 5 examination of metabolic pathway functional genes pertaining to v v reduction and phe degradation in different stages of biological column were detected fig 5 a genes omca omcb and mtrc were some known microbial genes that participate in the process of electron transfer omca and mtrc belonged to metal reducing gene clusters which could encode outer membrane c type cytochromes to form a protein complex for metal reduction yang et al 2013 min et al 2017 another porin cytochrome protein complex mediated electron transfer across the outer membrane was encoded by omcb gene which was common in geobacter nevin and lovley 2000 although the proteins encoded by the omcb gene shared no identity at the amino acid sequence level with that encoded by the omca and mtrc genes their functions and localizations were similar which localized on the bacterial cell surface and facilitated electron transfer across the outer membrane ding et al 2006 shi et al 2012 the abundance of omcb gene was higher than omca and mtrc genes and increased significantly during operation suggesting that it functioned importantly in v v reduction meanwhile we identified abundant phnac gene appeared in stage 1 which was considered as the key catabolic gene for phe mineralization guo et al 2017 it could be responsible for phe degradation in our system however the abundance of phnac gene decreased dramatically in subsequent stages probably due to the harsh environment elevated pollutants loading or limited substrate catalytic compounds involved in electron transfer for v v and phe bio transformations were also examined cytochrome c and nadh were present and their contents kept relatively steady in all stages fig 5b the contents of cytochrome c and nadh were comparable with those produced in bioreactors treating v v and pentachlorophenol zhang et al 2019a membrane bound cytochrome c could facilitate electron extracellular transfer for v v reduction borloo et al 2007 meanwhile intracellular nadh produced by tricarboxylic acid cycle wang et al 2017 which served as electron donor for detoxification when v v ion entered the cells shi et al 2020a moreover the linkage between nadh oxidation and phe degradation had also been reported deveryshetty and phale 2010 concentration of microbial secretory eps increased slightly during the operation forms 7 22 mg g vss in stage 1 to 9 18 mg g vss in stage 4 the major components of eps were pn and hs whose contents increased progressively fig 5c the organic compositions of eps were further characterized by lc ms fig s4 supporting information tyrosine phenylalanine pyrene glucuronic acid and glucose were identified al halbouni et al 2009 additionally peaks appeared at 1403 cm 1 and 1648 cm 1 in ftir spectrum of eps fig 5d corresponding to functional groups such as carboxyl coo and carbonyl c o liang et al 2010 lai et al 2018 eps had been reported to help microbial cells to resist the oxidative stress caused by v v with high loading lai et al 2018 pn and ps played important roles in strengthening the resistance of bacterial cells as aromatic ring side chains of tyrosine and phenylalanine can be transformed to aromatic ring substances in the presence of strong oxidants for microbial cells protection han et al 2017 hs could bind with v v by functional groups lu et al 1998 liu et al 2017b eps also carried multifarious active functional groups such as hydroxyl oh coo groups and large quantities of unsaturated fatty and aromatic structures such as pyrene which represented potential binding sites for the adsorption of heavy metal ions and organic matter zhang et al 2015b as phe was hydrophobic it was poorly accessible to microorganisms however the eps could facilitate the phe mass transfer from aqueous phase to bacterial cells as well as enhance the bioavailability of phe for biodegradation zhang et al 2015b 3 6 potential mechanisms and environmental implications in the light of v v and phe removal phenomenon reaction product identification microbial analysis and metabolic examination potential mechanisms for the synchronous v v reduction and phe co metabolic biodegradation by mixed anaerobic culture were proposed fig 6 heterotrophic v v reducers such as geobacter and acetobacterium using methanol as carbon source and electron donor to reduce v v meanwhile methanol was also used by phe degrading bacteria mycobacterium and clostridium as co metabolic substrate for phe decomposition xiao et al 2019 with v v as electron acceptor functional genes omca omcb and mtrc encoded proteins for v v reduction shi et al 2020a while enzymes encoded by phnac gene catalyzed phe degradation cytochrome c and intracellular nadh facilitated electron transfer helping electrons to reach v v detoxification and enter the phe degradation pathway via 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid hydroxylase shi et al 2020a deveryshetty and phale 2010 in addition to directly catalyzing v v reduction and binding v v eps could also adsorb phe and increase the bioavailability of poorly soluble phe for enhanced biodegradation zhang et al 2015b 2019a eventually v iv precipitated naturally in groundwater environment while phe was mineralized and converted to low molecular weight organic compounds with lower toxicities which could be further oxidized by microorganisms to donate electrons for v v bio reduction future work should be focused on correlation of microbial community components and their metabolisms of phenanthrene carbon by advanced analytical techniques such as stable isotope probing our work reveals the interactions between v v reduction and phe degradation v v can be biologically reduced to v iv coupled with phe oxidation unraveling coupled biogeochemical cycling of vanadium and carbon from bio refractory organics in groundwater considering the combined exposure of v v and phe in aquifer becomes serious the remediation strategy through co metabolism for v v and phe co contaminated groundwater is thereby proposed based on the bioprocess identified in the present study biostimulation through suppling bioavailable substrate directly will be an easy and efficient route in practical application the organic dosage should be optimized to prevent secondary pollution produced v iv precipitates should be collected to prevent its re oxidation to soluble v v for ex situ application pump and treat remediation is proposed and filtration for recovery of produced v iv precipitates is required before recharge of treated groundwater for in situ application biological permeable reactive barrier with solid slow release organic carbon sources such as woodchip and straw may be welcomed li and zhang 2020 produced v iv precipitates can attach on these materials and be easily recovered by replacing these solid materials during biosystem operation and collection activity anaerobic condition with lower redox potential should be maintained there are also other organic components in crude oil as well as its refined products future study can be conducted by using oil or refined products directly to realize successful remediation of oil contaminated environment with cooccurrence of vanadium and organics 4 conclusions in this study co contaminants v v and phe in

environment worked as batch bioreactors 50 ml anaerobic consortium was added to each batch bioreactor as initial inoculum which was obtained from a brewery wastewater treatment facility 200 ml synthetic groundwater was also supplemented into each bioreactor shi et al 2019 both v v and phe concentrations were 10 mg l initially navo3 2h2o acted as the v v source methanol 75 v v was employed as organic carbon source xiao et al 2019 with the equivalent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 800 mg l all chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd beijing china except for phe from sigma co ltd st louis usa bioreactors contained different ingredients where bioreactor designated as v p was supplied with v v and phe while v v phe and methanol were added to bioreactor named v p m bioreactors containing only v v only phe v v and methanol phe and methanol were also employed as controls within three months microbial consortia were fully acclimated by refreshing aqueous solutions every three days then removals of v v and phe were recorded during 7 d operating cycle to evaluate the performance of bioreactors all batch experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c and in triplicate 2 2 column experiment the plexiglass column covered with aluminum foil to avoid light exposure had a total volume of 500 ml with 250 mm height and 50 mm diameter including 500 g quartzes and 100 ml anaerobic consortium which were mixed fully and then packed into the whole column the top and bottom spaces were equipped with gravel to prevent the blockage synthesized groundwater was supplied into the column by a peristaltic pump at a fixed rate of 0 12 ml min the operating conditions of the column bioreactor were shown in table 1 where the whole 250 d experiment was divided into four stages based on varied pollutants and co substrate concentrations the effluent from the column was collected daily to determine v v phe dissolved total v

the coupling of microbial v v reduction and phe degradation under anaerobic condition stoichiometric and energetic calculation also suggested the v v reduction coupled to phe oxidation could occur spontaneously rittmann and mccarty 2012 dolfing et al 2009 1 66 v o 2 c 14 h 10 66 h 66 v o 2 14 c o 2 38 h 2 o Œ¥ g 8114 kj mol the v v and phe removal efficiencies within 7 d operation in v p were 32 9 0 5 and 67 3 0 6 with the corresponding average removal rates of v v and phe were 0 47 0 03 mg l d and 0 96 0 05 mg l d v v and phe removals followed pseudo first order kinetics process fig 1b with kinetics rate constants of 0 061 d 1 and 0 17 d 1 table s2 supporting information when methanol was supplemented in v p m complete v v removal and phe removal efficiency of 82 0 0 8 were achieved average removal rates of v v and phe increased by 2 04 and 0 22 folds reaching 1 43 0 03 mg l d and 1 17 0 05 mg l d with obtained kinetics rate constants of 0 44 d 1 and 0 27 d 1 the substantial improvement in v v and phe removals were ascribed to methanol as supplementary electron donor for v v reduction and co metabolic substrate for phe degradation liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 given that both vanadium and phe concentrations were less than 10 mg l in co contaminated groundwater riccardi et al 2008 this anaerobic bio technique might be a more efficient and robust route for the remediation of v v and phe co polluted aquifer temporal dynamics of v v and phe were also comparatively investigated in control sets v v and phe concentrations remained almost unchanged during 7 d operation in controls with only v v and phe fig s1 supporting information suggesting that v v bio reduction required electron donor while carbon dioxide from heterotrophic respiration poorly acted as electron acceptor for anaerobic phe biodegradation due to lower redox potential e”© 380 mv jiang et al 2018 nzila 2018 however v v was gradually removed in the bioreactor with v v and methanol reaching a removal efficiency of 98 7 0 3 fig s1 supporting information which was comparable to 92 8 in 3 d operation in acetate supported v v reducing biosystem liu et al 2017a moreover this result was higher than that obtained in v p m suggesting phe addition deteriorate v v reduction due to higher toxicity of phe xiao et al 2019 even if co metabolic substrate was presented phe was rarely removed in bioreactor with phe and methanol further implying that effective electron acceptor was essential to anaerobic phe degradation 3 2 long term v v and phe removals under varied condition the time series of v v and phe concentration along with their removal efficiencies and capacities were shown in fig 2 during 250 d operation in the continuous flow biological column in stage 1 day 0 70 92 0 1 5 and 73 1 1 2 of v v and phe were removed respectively with removal capacities of 4 60 0 08 g m3 d and 3 66 0 06 g m3 d accordingly in stage 2 day 71 130 when the influent v v concentration was increased to 25 mg l v v reduction efficiency decreased to 78 8 1 2 whereas the average v v removal capacity increased to 19 7 0 30 g m3 d phe removal efficiency decreased to 56 8 1 1 while its removal capacity decreased to 2 84 0 06 g m3 d these results indicated that bioavailable substrate was sufficient for v v reduction and phe decomposers were more sensitive to increased toxicity in stage 3 day 131 190 when the influent phe concentration was further increased to 25 mg l an obvious decrease in v v removal efficiency to 80 5 1 4 and a slight decrease in v v removal capacity to 4 03 0 07 g m3 d was observed meanwhile phe was reduced to 28 4 1 2 at a capacity of 7 10 0 30 g m3 d these results further implied the poor adaptability of microorganisms for phe degradation with elevated toxicity moscoso et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 in stage 4 day 191 250 when the cod concentration was reduced from 800 mg l to 200 mg l the v v and phe removal efficiencies decreased considerably to 58 3 1 2 and 34 7 1 5 with removal capacities of 2 92 0 06 g m3 d and 1 74 0 08 g m3 d respectively when the carbon source was limited the removals of v v and phe were both inhibited it was reported that bio reduction of 51 mg l v v required approximate 330 mg l organics in terms of cod zhang et al 2019a meanwhile bioavailable substrate was also needed for co metabolic phe degradation shi et al 2015 the greater decrease in phe removal efficiency in stage 4 suggested that co metabolic phe degradation was more easily suppressed than v v reduction when bioavailable substrate was insufficient 3 3 identification of reaction products the total v concentration in the effluent of the biological column was almost equal to effluent v v content fig s2 supporting information suggesting that v v reduction products had precipitated sem image confirmed the produced precipitates deposited on the microbial surfaces fig 3 a eds result indicated that v was the major elemental composition of the precipitates fig 3b furthermore xps spectra identified distinctive peak with binding energy of 515 0 ev fig 3c which was in line with previous finding for v iv zhang et al 2018b this result demonstrated that the precipitated v iv was the main product from v v bio reduction qiu et al 2017 considering v iv is less toxic and insoluble under near neutral ph condition wang and ren 2014 the remediation process based on microorganisms could be practically useful to treat v v contaminated groundwater the observed peaks corresponding to v v may be due to the v iv re oxidation in air during collection and analyzing zhang et al 2009 a variety of intermediate products for phe degradation such as p cresol 10 032 min salicylic acid 12 835 min and cyclohexane 23 804 min were identified in different stages of the column experiment fig 3d which was also observed in previous phe biodegradation processes tsai et al 2009 sarma et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 another potential intermediate identified as 2 4 di tert butylphenol was also detected 15 616 min this result implied that phe experienced ring opening decomposition in our constructed biosystem the knowledge of anaerobic phe biodegradation pathway was still in its infancy while hydroxylation methylation and carboxylation processes were possible mechanisms of phe activation before ring opening nzila 2018 multiple matters in groundwater such as sulfate nitrate and fe iii could be used as electron acceptors in the anaerobic phe degradation coates et al 1996 chang et al 2002 rothermich et al 2002 and phe could be completely biotransformed to carbon dioxide in the presence of sulfate or nitrate nzila 2018 v v have higher redox potential than sulfate e”© 172 mv or nitrate e”© 934 mv thereby complete phe mineralization might occur in our biosystem furthermore the detected intermediate products with low molecular weight were less toxic kim et al 2009 which might be also utilized by microorganisms for v v reduction meanwhile the orp was relatively lower during the whole experiment fig s3 supporting information suggesting anaerobic respiration for v v bio reduction and phe bio oxidation by facultative microorganisms 3 4 evolution of microbial community microbial diversity and richness in experimental stages of biological column were higher than those in the inoculum table s3 supporting information indicating that microorganisms adapted to the environmental changes by enrichment and domestication hao et al 2018 the result from nmds analysis showed that samples cultivated in the different stages were all distinct from the inoculum while the microbial community composition in stage 3 and stage 4 were similar fig 4 a which might be that the higher phe loading in stage 3 further affected the microorganisms in stage 4 the venn diagram showed that there were 128 42 15 and 28 otus confined to each of these four individual stages fig 4b with a total of 474 otus common to all groups the shared otus might adapted to environment with v v phe and co metabolic substrate microbial community structure at class level changed during the long term operation of biological column fig 4c deltaproteobacteria predominated in stage 1 29 1 clostridia and alphaproteobacteria seemed to be more tolerant to v v with highest relative abundances 14 4 and 8 41 in stage 2 in addition anaerolineae 33 7 and gammapotoobacteria 14 9 accumulated in stage 3 with the highest phe concentrations implying that they might be involved in phe metabolism potential bacteria associated with v v reduction and phe degradation were found at genus level fig 4d geobacter appeared in all stages with highest relative abundance of 1 72 in stage 1 the ability of geobacter to reduce v v had been well confirmed but high v v concentration would inhibit its multiplication wang et al 2020 meanwhile the relative abundance of acetobacterium increased both in stage3 and stage 4 which had been reported to be able to promote v v reduction zhang et al 2015a enriched mycobacterium in stage 3 and stage 4 with relative abundances of 0 13 and 0 15 which was an important phe degrading colonizer especially in nutrient poor conditions uyttebroek et al 2006 moreover two new genera clostridium and sphingomonas appeared in stage 3 with higher phe concentration 25 mg l which was not detected in either inoculum or first two stages and were adapted to utilization of phe for its mineralization yan et al 2012 wang et al 2019 3 5 examination of metabolic pathway functional genes pertaining to v v reduction and phe degradation in different stages of biological column were detected fig 5 a genes omca omcb and mtrc were some known microbial genes that participate in the process of electron transfer omca and mtrc belonged to metal reducing gene clusters which could encode outer membrane c type cytochromes to form a protein complex for metal reduction yang et al 2013 min et al 2017 another porin cytochrome protein complex mediated electron transfer across the outer membrane was encoded by omcb gene which was common in geobacter nevin and lovley 2000 although the proteins encoded by the omcb gene shared no identity at the amino acid sequence level with that encoded by the omca and mtrc genes their functions and localizations were similar which localized on the bacterial cell surface and facilitated electron transfer across the outer membrane ding et al 2006 shi et al 2012 the abundance of omcb gene was higher than omca and mtrc genes and increased significantly during operation suggesting that it functioned importantly in v v reduction meanwhile we identified abundant phnac gene appeared in stage 1 which was considered as the key catabolic gene for phe mineralization guo et al 2017 it could be responsible for phe degradation in our system however the abundance of phnac gene decreased dramatically in subsequent stages probably due to the harsh environment elevated pollutants loading or limited substrate catalytic compounds involved in electron transfer for v v and phe bio transformations were also examined cytochrome c and nadh were present and their contents kept relatively steady in all stages fig 5b the contents of cytochrome c and nadh were comparable with those produced in bioreactors treating v v and pentachlorophenol zhang et al 2019a membrane bound cytochrome c could facilitate electron extracellular transfer for v v reduction borloo et al 2007 meanwhile intracellular nadh produced by tricarboxylic acid cycle wang et al 2017 which served as electron donor for detoxification when v v ion entered the cells shi et al 2020a moreover the linkage between nadh oxidation and phe degradation had also been reported deveryshetty and phale 2010 concentration of microbial secretory eps increased slightly during the operation forms 7 22 mg g vss in stage 1 to 9 18 mg g vss in stage 4 the major components of eps were pn and hs whose contents increased progressively fig 5c the organic compositions of eps were further characterized by lc ms fig s4 supporting information tyrosine phenylalanine pyrene glucuronic acid and glucose were identified al halbouni et al 2009 additionally peaks appeared at 1403 cm 1 and 1648 cm 1 in ftir spectrum of eps fig 5d corresponding to functional groups such as carboxyl coo and carbonyl c o liang et al 2010 lai et al 2018 eps had been reported to help microbial cells to resist the oxidative stress caused by v v with high loading lai et al 2018 pn and ps played important roles in strengthening the resistance of bacterial cells as aromatic ring side chains of tyrosine and phenylalanine can be transformed to aromatic ring substances in the presence of strong oxidants for microbial cells protection han et al 2017 hs could bind with v v by functional groups lu et al 1998 liu et al 2017b eps also carried multifarious active functional groups such as hydroxyl oh coo groups and large quantities of unsaturated fatty and aromatic structures such as pyrene which represented potential binding sites for the adsorption of heavy metal ions and organic matter zhang et al 2015b as phe was hydrophobic it was poorly accessible to microorganisms however the eps could facilitate the phe mass transfer from aqueous phase to bacterial cells as well as enhance the bioavailability of phe for biodegradation zhang et al 2015b 3 6 potential mechanisms and environmental implications in the light of v v and phe removal phenomenon reaction product identification microbial analysis and metabolic examination potential mechanisms for the synchronous v v reduction and phe co metabolic biodegradation by mixed anaerobic culture were proposed fig 6 heterotrophic v v reducers such as geobacter and acetobacterium using methanol as carbon source and electron donor to reduce v v meanwhile methanol was also used by phe degrading bacteria mycobacterium and clostridium as co metabolic substrate for phe decomposition xiao et al 2019 with v v as electron acceptor functional genes omca omcb and mtrc encoded proteins for v v reduction shi et al 2020a while enzymes encoded by phnac gene catalyzed phe degradation cytochrome c and intracellular nadh facilitated electron transfer helping electrons to reach v v detoxification and enter the phe degradation pathway via 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid hydroxylase shi et al 2020a deveryshetty and phale 2010 in addition to directly catalyzing v v reduction and binding v v eps could also adsorb phe and increase the bioavailability of poorly soluble phe for enhanced biodegradation zhang et al 2015b 2019a eventually v iv precipitated naturally in groundwater environment while phe was mineralized and converted to low molecular weight organic compounds with lower toxicities which could be further oxidized by microorganisms to donate electrons for v v bio reduction future work should be focused on correlation of microbial community components and their metabolisms of phenanthrene carbon by advanced analytical techniques such as stable isotope probing our work reveals the interactions between v v reduction and phe degradation v v can be biologically reduced to v iv coupled with phe oxidation unraveling coupled biogeochemical cycling of vanadium and carbon from bio refractory organics in groundwater considering the combined exposure of v v and phe in aquifer becomes serious the remediation strategy through co metabolism for v v and phe co contaminated groundwater is thereby proposed based on the bioprocess identified in the present study biostimulation through suppling bioavailable substrate directly will be an easy and efficient route in practical application the organic dosage should be optimized to prevent secondary pollution produced v iv precipitates should be collected to prevent its re oxidation to soluble v v for ex situ application pump and treat remediation is proposed and filtration for recovery of produced v iv precipitates is required before recharge of treated groundwater for in situ application biological permeable reactive barrier with solid slow release organic carbon sources such as woodchip and straw may be welcomed li and zhang 2020 produced v iv precipitates can attach on these materials and be easily recovered by replacing these solid materials during biosystem operation and collection activity anaerobic condition with lower redox potential should be maintained there are also other organic components in crude oil as well as its refined products future study can be conducted by using oil or refined products directly to realize successful remediation of oil contaminated environment with cooccurrence of vanadium and organics 4 conclusions in this study co contaminants v v and phe in groundwater were removed simultaneously in anaerobic bioreactors the major conclusions were l batch test indicated that synchronous v v bio reduction and phe biodegradation can be realized under

17542,cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs currently threaten water security and affect the ecosystem services provided by these freshwater ecosystems such as drinking water and recreational use climate change is expected to further exacerbate the situation in the future because of higher temperatures extended droughts and nutrient enrichment due to urbanisation and intensified agriculture nutrients are considered critical for the deterioration of water quality in lakes and reservoirs and responsible for the widespread increase in cyanobacterial blooms we model the response of cyanobacteria abundance to variations in lake total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations using a data set from 822 northern european lakes we divide lakes in ten groups based on their physico chemical characteristics following a modified lake typology defined for the water framework directive wfd this classification is used in a bayesian hierarchical linear model which employs a probabilistic approach transforming uncertainty into probability thresholds the hierarchical model is used to calculate probabilities of cyanobacterial concentrations exceeding risk levels for human health associated with the use of lakes for recreational activities as defined by the world health organization who different tn and tp concentration combinations result in variable probabilities to exceed pre set thresholds our objective is to support lake managers in estimating acceptable nutrient concentrations and allow them to identify actions that would achieve compliance of cyanobacterial abundance risk levels with a given confidence level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria nutrients water framework directive bayesian hierarchical modelling eutrophication lake management who risk levels 1 introduction freshwater is inextricably linked to human well being and socio economic development while this dependence is a key condition for the sustainable management of freshwater resources as the planet s population increases and as a consequence urbanisation and agriculture intensify freshwater security is threatened by the growing demand for food production electrical power generation industrial processes and human consumption on top of that water quality generally suffers from continuous degradation in many regions and as a result freshwater ecosystems often become inhospitable habitats for living organisms unep 2016 this trend is expected to worsen in the near future and next generations are likely to face significant adverse impacts on water quantity and quality especially under the threat of climate change in recent years global concern has evolved into specific action plans for water management the united nations released an agenda defining sustainable development goals sdgs where water management holds a prominent position calling for actions by all countries to increase the access to clean drinking water and sanitation sdg 6 and to conserve and use oceans seas and marine resources sustainably sdg 14 un 2019 furthermore since 2000 the european water framework directive wfd has transformed water management in europe by bringing aquatic ecology to the forefront of decisions hering et al 2010 traditionally the only common biological indicator of lake quality assessment and management was chlorophyl a chl a but following the implementation of the wfd cyanobacteria abundance has become an additional indicator required for assessment of ecological status for european lakes birk et al 2012 harmful cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious risk to freshwater quality affecting human and animal health due to the toxins released by many bloom forming species water becomes inappropriate to serve human needs such as drinking water fisheries and recreation charmichael et al 2016 l√©vesque et al 2014 ibelings et al 2016 scientific research has paid considerable attention to predicting the frequency and extent of cyanobacterial bloom events suggesting possible interventions to mitigate these phenomena jewett et al 2008 tromas et al 2017 however predicting cyanobacterial abundance remains a challenge even though there is good understanding of the key factors that drive and influence cyanobacterial dynamics there is still high variability making it difficult to accurately predict the abundance in addition availability of data exhibits great variation among freshwater ecosystems making it difficult to come up with robust methodologies that would be applicable to a wide range of lake types richardson et al 2018 a common practice for bridging the gap of insufficient data in lake ecosystems is to borrow data from lakes with similar characteristics and in this way expand the sample size towards strengthening statistical analyses however when predictive models are applied to lakes categorized to groups following the assumption of homogeneity the results usually fail to prove realistic since homogeneity within a lake group is a weak assumption malve and qian 2006 beaulieu et al 2013 used a 1000 lake dataset containing data from lakes across the united states and implemented multiple linear regression analyses to predict cyanobacterial biomass on the whole dataset and on subsets of lake type according to depth and to whether the ecosystem is natural or a reservoir the findings of this analysis indicated that predictions improved when lakes were categorized to groups however the overall low predictive strength advocates that the grouping assumption alone lacks satisfactory results in another study conducted by richardson et al 2018 the response of cyanobacteria to multiple stressors by using linear regression mixed effect models varied greatly with lake type resulting in the conclusion that a one size fits all approach is inappropriate towards understanding and managing the risks of harmful algal blooms carvalho et al 2013 used quantile regression modelling to quantify the relationship between tp concentrations and cyanobacteria using a data set from 800 european lakes the analysis showed that tp cannot be singled out as the dominant factor regarding cyanobacteria concentrations in lakes rather tp quantile modelling can be used to define the lake maximum cyanobacteria abundance but only in relation to tp even though it is widely recognized that total nitrogen tn also plays a key role in cyanobacteria previous modelling efforts of cyanobacteria in large datasets focus only on tp in their models richardson et al 2018 carvalho et al 2013 obenour et al 2014 in their work based on mesocosm experiments richardson et al 2019 include both tn and tp but only in combination not separately so the interaction with cyanobacteria cannot be analysed our work addresses this gap as it uses both tn and tp separately as predictors for cyanobacteria bayesian hierarchical models can combine prior and data driven knowledge both from multiple groups of lakes and from lakes of the same group in order to make predictions for a single lake belonging to a specific group in other words the hierarchical approach moves one step further from the classical grouping approach by considering the effects of the ensemble of lakes on predictions the bayesian modelling framework which is based on probability distributions is very suitable for the analysis of cyanobacteria blooms as they are rare events with high uncertainty the method has been used extensively in the past with convincing results e g malve and qian 2006 shimoda and archonditsis 2015 shimoda et al 2016 cheng et al 2009 obenour et al 2014 stow et al 2014 however the method has not been used for prediction of cyanobacteria abundance specifically malve and qian 2006 have developed a similar modelling framework using tn and tp as predictors but they only predicted chl a this research is to our knowledge novel because it models cyanobacteria using a bayesian hierarchical model with both tn and tp as predictors herein we build upon the work of malve and colleagues expanding it for cyanobacteria in this article we use a multi lake data set of 822 northern european lakes and evaluate trends in cyanobacteria biomass cbb using nutrient concentrations as predictors fitted with a non parametric generalised additive model gam curve and a lowess curve then by dividing lakes into 10 groups with different physico chemical characteristics we implement a linear bayesian hierarchical modelling framework and obtain posterior probability simulations that exhibit a strong predictive modelling performance overall that varies depending on lake group and number of observations results are implemented for analyzing lake cbb concentrations according to the three risk levels associated to human health for recreational activities low cbb 2mg l medium cbb between 2 and 10 mg l and high cbb 10mg l as defined by the world health organization 2006 finally exceedance probability response surfaces are produced for a range of nutrient concentrations for the who risk levels showing that the bayesian hierarchical modelling framework can be used for lake eutrophication management by setting nutrient targets to sustain specific cbb thresholds with an associated exceedance risk level 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset our dataset consists of a range of biological cyanobacteria biomass chl a physical latitude altitude surface area mean max depth mean max air temperature and chemical total nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio alkalinity type and humic type features of several northern european lakes extracted from the central database of the eu funded project wiser moe et al 2013 wiser was launched in 2009 and for three years 25 european institutions representing 16 countries have addressed the assessment and management of rivers lakes transitional and coastal waters in europe although the dataset originally contained observations for several features for 1851 lakes it was unbalanced in terms of the number of monitored features per lake thus after a thorough screening procedure we ended up with a subset of 822 lakes containing data for all the aforementioned variables in other words even though initially we had data for 1851 lakes for a large number of variables we ended up with a compact dataset of 822 lakes containing data for a smaller group of variables our goal was to create a dataset with features that would be covered by all lakes the final subset contains lakes from six northern european countries namely uk denmark norway sweden finland and lithuania the total observations are 4 175 from may to october and from 1980 to 2009 however observations are unevenly distributed among years months and lakes a total of 164 lakes have only a single observation while the rest of the lakes range between 2 and 55 observations approximately 30 of the observations are from august while 27 18 13 9 and 3 are from july june may september and october respectively in fig 1 the spatial distribution of all lakes in the dataset across the european map is shown more details on the data set are included in mellios et al 2020 2 2 categorizing lakes into groups lake type specific models rely on the simple assumption that lakes belonging to a specific group are likely to exhibit similar behavior and response to changes in intra and extra lake conditions under this context the response of cbb to stressors is expected to follow a similar behavior among lakes of the same type in this work grouping of lakes into types should ideally follow the lake typology defined for the water framework directive wfd implementation within the nordic geographic intercalibration group poikane 2009 solheim et al 2019 have developed a simplified version of the original typology new broad typology that has been used as guidance for developing lake groups in this article richardson et al 2018 used a modified lake typology that included a classification in 18 lake types which was eventually aggregated to 8 lake types to match data availability in each category malve and qian 2006 used the geomorphological typology of finnish lakes specified by the finnish environment institute since their analysis included solely finnish lakes according to this typology lakes are grouped into different types based on their geographical and natural characteristics pilke et al 2002 the wfd nordic lake typology is strongly influenced by the finnish lake typology so our grouping was an adaptation of the latter to include criteria that match our dataset which has a high proportion of finnish lakes two typology variables altitude and alkalinity or calcium level siliceous vs calcareous are not included in the finnish lake typology and were also left out from our analysis the reason for excluding altitude was that only a few lakes had higher altitude so this would result in the formation of unbalanced datasets under each lake category regarding calcium level alkalinity such data were not available in our dataset for all lakes besides alkalinity tends to co vary with tp although not for all lake groups and its role has been investigated in other papers namely in richardson et al 2018 and carvalho et al 2013 here we wanted to focus more on other factors such as humic type since there is evidence that there is a negative effect of humic level for cyanobacteria ptacnik et al 2008 richardson et al 2018 the chosen lake classification is very similar to the one used by malve and qian 2006 and included 10 groups modifying lake types in order to fit the availability of data in our dataset as specified in table 1 the grouping of lakes was determined by mean depth humic type and surface area mean depth was already discretized in the wiser dataset in three levels namely very shallow shallow and deep in terms of humic type the classes followed a similar discretization namely non humic humic and very humic indicated by the color level in terms of lake size the wiser typology included four classes according to lake surface area namely very small small medium and large in our dataset we retained large and grouped medium small and very small under a single category named medium small and ended up with two size categories this grouping was done in order to reflect the types of lakes included in our dataset a critical mass of data is ensured in each type with this grouping 2 3 identifying the best predictors of cbb linear correlation analysis indicated high correlation between cbb and chl a r 0 52 mellios et al 2020 but chl a was excluded from the explanatory variables because chl a and cyanobacteria are not independent since cyanobacteria is a proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass of which chl a is an indicator maximum air temperature and maximum depth show high collinearity with mean temperature and mean depth respectively thus they were also excluded since their effects on cbb are not distinct to determine which of the other variables latitude altitude surface area mean depth tn tp tn tp and mean temperature explain most of the variation of the response variable cbb a classification and regression tree cart analysis was conducted by satisfying the criterion to diminish the prediction error the best tree model was chosen which is illustrated in fig 2 the cart analysis procedure was done in the programming environment r version 3 6 2 https www r project org by using the mvpart package de ath 2007 as indicated by the cart analysis results when considering the whole dataset including all ten lake groups tp plays the most significant role towards the prediction of cbb while tn is influential only for the subset of samples n 276 where tp is larger than 89 75 Œºg l these findings are in accordance with downing et al 2001 who analyzed data from 99 temperate lakes and showed that cyanobacteria blooms are more strongly correlated with variation in tp and tn than the ratio of tn tp watson et al 1997 performed regression analyses and showed that the mean summer biomass of cyanobacteria is significantly and positively related to tp for different nutrient ranges h√•kanson et al 2007 used linear regression to model a transformed form of cyanobacteria concentration cbb0 25 on log tn and log tp and found significant correlations with r2 0 63 and 0 75 respectively and concluded that variations in tp rather than tn seem to be more important to predict variations among systems in cyanobacteria following these results tn and tp concentrations were selected as the best predictors of cbb and were used to construct the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model the advantage of including only two predictors is that the model is simple lean and flexible and easy to be applied 2 4 bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bayesian methods are gaining ground in a wide range of scientific fields and especially in ecology mainly due to their ability to produce probabilistic oriented inferences which in many cases outperform deterministic approaches since ecological modelling is characterized by high uncertainty due to the complex and many times unknown cause effect relationships among variables a probabilistic approach that yields distributions of possible outcomes in essence transforms uncertainty into probability thresholds the advantage of bayesian methods relies on their ability to combine prior knowledge about model parameters with evidence from data arhonditsis et al 2006 they are well suited for analysis of multilevel models showing i flexibility in specifying multilevel structures of parameters using priors ii ability to handle small samples and model misspecification overparameterization of the likelihood can be resolved with well chosen priors iii explicit handling of uncertainty and iv intuitive and easy interpretation of results

the hierarchy of the specified model relies on the assumption that each lake s cbb values are modelled conditional on lake specific model parameter values the lake specific model parameter values are modelled conditional on a common distribution representing all group specific lakes the lake group specific parameter values are modelled conditional on a common parameter distribution representing all groups the ensemble of groups is modelled conditional on a common distribution representing all lakes while all lakes are in turn modelled conditional on representative hyperparameters for the whole population of lakes considered in our dataset to be more specific yijk is conditionally normally distributed on xŒ≤ij and œÑ 2 Œ≤ ij are conditionally normally distributed on Œ≤ i œÉ i 2 while Œ≤ i is conditionally normally distributed on Œ≤ and œÉ 2 the non informative prior distributions of Œ≤ œÑ œÉ i and œÉ which represent the hyperparameters follow a normal distribution n 0 10000 with

respectively the hyperparameters of œÑ œÉ i and œÉ are considered vague or non informative as there is no information about their distribution 2 5 description of the modelling procedure the bayesian hierarchical analysis was conducted with the winbugs software lunn et al 2000 which is a program for bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using markov chain monte carlo mcmc techniques in this study the metropolis algorithm was used which is based on a symmetric normal proposal distribution whose standard deviation is turned over the first 4000 iterations in order to get an acceptance rate of between 20 and 40 lunn et al 2000 to run the constructed model a chain was produced and run for 100 000 iterations in order to let the mcmc simulation converge to the true posterior distribution to check the convergence of the proposed model we used the heidelberger and welch diagnostic which is appropriate for the analysis of individual chains under the boa package in the programming environment r version 3 6 2 smith 2007 the advantage of this diagnostic method is two fold it both estimates the number of samples to be discarded as a burn in sequence and it tests for non convergence in our case the burn in period as indicated by the convergence diagnostic tool was 50 000 while convergence was succeeded over 100 000 iterations in order to reduce autocorrelation of the sample we took 1 250 samples for each unknown parameter Œ≤ ij Œ≤ i œÉ i 2 œÉ 2 œÑ 2 from the 50 000 remaining mcmc iterations by keeping the data of every 40th iteration thin 40 finally we confirmed the accuracy of the posterior parameter values by assuring that the mc error to the sample standard deviation error ratio for all parameters did not exceed the 5 limit as proposed by spiegelhalter et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 data exploratory analysis in table 2 and fig 3 we show data statistics and boxplots of the response and explanatory variables included in the analysis for all lake groups exploring the relationship between cbb and nutrients in each group it is noticeable that this relationship varies among groups in groups 1 to 3 mean cbb decreases as humic level increases which is consistent with the finding that cyanobacteria dominate more often in clear lakes than in humic ones ptacnik et al 2008 lake depth groups 9 and 10 seems to play a determinant role in minimizing cyanobacteria abundance which is in line with several studies bakker and hilt 2015 sharma et al 2011 however no clear pattern can be detected between the relationship of cbb and nutrients even though higher mean tn and tp values result in higher cbb values for the most part this is probably related to the variable carrying capacity maximum abundance of lakes for cyanobacteria and to the nutrient that is limiting in each lake type thus even though phosphorus is often considered the limiting nutrient in lakes richardson et al 2018 nitrogen can also play a key role beaulieu et al 2013 some of the basic properties of the data for all lakes are shown in fig 4 a and b where we show a scatter plot of the relationships of cbb vs log tp and log tn for all lakes fitted with a non parametric generalised additive model gam curve along with the 5 and 95 confidence intervals statistical analyses for both curves are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively in table 3 the intercept estimate and standard errors are very similar for both tp and tn signifying that if either variable were zero the model would predict the same value of 0 6421 mg l for cbb in terms of the significance of the smooth terms table 4 again both variables have similar results with tp performing better with 19 of deviance explained as opposed to 13 for tn this is consistent with our cart analysis that showed that tp plays the most significant role towards the prediction of cbb while tn is influential only for a subset of samples this result is also consistent with other research works e g hamilton et al 2016 s√∏ndergaard et al 2017 and moss et al 2013 the p values table 4 are very small in both cases for intercepts and smooth terms showing that the data is sufficient to recognize that the smoothed relationship between cbb and tn and tp explains the data better than assuming that cbb is independent of tn and tp intercept only model to further explore the relationship between cbb and both tn and tp we perform a lowess curve fitting analysis here cbb is predicted using two explanatory variables i e cbb s tp tn and the 3d scatter plot with the predicted surface is shown in fig 5 a while the corresponding contour plot is shown in fig 5 b the model does not predict peak cbb concentrations for the combination of the highest tn and tp concentrations but rather for relatively low tp concentrations in the order of 200 Œºg l and medium low tn concentrations in the order of 2 300 Œºg l this signifies the fact that depending on the concentrations there is tn and tp limitation and lakes reach maximum abundance at those tn and tp concentrations the model fails to capture most of the high cbb values since peak cbb values in the order of 15 mg l are predicted while peak observed values are in the 70s this is expected however since model predictions are based on the whole cbb dataset a skewed distribution with many zero values as shown in figure 3 a statistics of the analysis are shown in fig 5 a relatively low r2 is obtained similar to what has been observed in the literature i e beaulieu et al 2013 carvalho et al 2013 chirico et al 2020 but it is improved from the individual cbb vs tn and cbb vs tp plots table 4 proving that the capability of prediction of cbb using these advanced smoothing models is limited and predictions have relatively low reliability 3 2 linear hierarchical modelling and model fit having explored the potential to predict cyanobacteria with nonlinear relationships we proceed with a linear hierarchical model to take advantage of the simplicity and flexibility of linear models linear regression is used even though cyanobacteria response to the nutrient gradient is non linear fig 4 nevertheless linear models are still commonly used in ecology since non linear models tend to become complicated and require the pre definition of parameters by the user such as defining the maximum of the curve or the point where the concavity and or convexity of the curve begins carvalho et al 2013 this way there exists a potential to introduce error by predefining the results with skewed distributions the assumptions underlying regression models based on normal distribution are violated so data transformation is commonly used the box cox procedure defines the parameter Œª that is used to choose the most suitable transformation for the dataset to achieve normality for our dataset Œª was close to zero so the suitable transformation would be logarithmic this is relatively common in ecology since environmental variables take only positive values and the logarithm of these variables are likely to be normal and the resulting model is easy to interpret qian 2016 in this work a log transformation did not prove useful first because the dataset is unbalanced and includes a large number of zero concentrations of cbb even when replacing zero concentrations with small numbers to avoid the conflict with the log transformation the retransformation of the log cbb variable was problematic because the exponential of the log mean was not the same as the mean concentration and model fit deteriorated when compared to the untransformed dataset in this case the error term Œµ cannot be ignored and needs to be included in the retransformation of data ultimately introducing a bias to the results by the fixed multiplicative factor eŒµ even though using a bias correction factor is a possibility sprugel 1983 it is difficult to define a formula for the standard error and the estimated mean of the dependent variable qian 2016 based on this analysis we conducted the modelling with untransformed data and obtained good model fits overall with hierarchical modelling log transforming tn and tp in order to setup a linear log model did not improve results therefore all variables were used untransformed to assess hierarchical modelling fit in terms of both precision and accuracy we compare predicted vs observed cbb values through scatter plots for all lake groups as shown in fig 6 the circles represent the mean predicted values while the lower and upper limits of the red lines are the 10th and 90th percentiles in the last graph we show simulated vs observed for the whole dataset all lakes at the value of 0 74 we see that r2 for all lakes fig 6 is remarkably improved when compared to the predictions that were reported for multiple linear regression for the same data set in mellios et al 2020 r2 0 33 predictions are also greatly improved when compared to both non parametric curve models performed gams or lowess lake groups show variable accuracy and precision with some groups performing impressively well e g r2 0 87 for group 8 large humic lakes r2 0 85 for group 6 shallow very humic lakes and r2 0 81 for group 1 very shallow non humic lakes while some groups performing poorly e g r2 0 15 for group 10 medium small deep humic lakes it seems that the model drops in performance when the maximum observed cbb values in a group are small i e less than 3 mg l as is the case in group 10 the number of observations is also important with the number of observations being inversely proportional to model fit the hierarchical model even though it models the non linear response of cbb to nutrient concentrations linearly has a great advantage in the fact that while it fits different model parameters for each lake thus customizing the model to the specific lake data it also treats lakes within the same group as exchangeable essentially parameters of lakes in the same lake group are assumed to come from the same prior distributions thereby pooling information from similar lakes as a result this pooling of information results in reduced bias at lake level while model error variance is reduced as well this method is superior especially for lakes that need to be managed for eutrophication but have no prior data to base management decisions on the lake will be classified in a group according to its characteristics and the group parameters will be used to model it as more data are included the lake model will improve by customising its model parameters and differentiating them from those of the group however during the phase that no data exist there will be an initial set of parameters to be used successfully 3 3 posterior probabilities and exceedance probability surfaces in order to demonstrate how hierarchical models can be used for the management of eutrophic lakes we simulate posterior probabilities of cbb for a range of tn and tp for an indicative list of four specific lakes coming from groups 1 6 8 and 10 engelsholm s√∏ lillsj√∂n p√§ij√§nne and gjersj√∏en respectively the number of observations for these lakes are 18 3 24 and 11 respectively the tn and tp ranges that are plotted are consistent with the corresponding observed concentrations for each lake in figs 7 a d g and j the resulting surface is presented for the 50th percentile of the predictive distributions along with the scatter plots of observed values in a 3d format showing the goodness of fit of the model these surfaces were designed using the posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ ij Œ≤ 0 ij Œ≤ 1 ij Œ≤ 2 ij that are specific for each lake in figs 7 b e h and k we show the same plots as before but without the observed values scatter plot this time we visualize two horizontal planes that correspond to the three distinct health risk levels low medium high with thresholds at 2 and 10 mg l as defined by who after converting cell counts into concentrations mellios et al 2020 from these posterior probability surfaces we can identify the combination of tn and tp concentrations that result in the 50th percentile of cbb distribution being lower than 2 mg l below the bottom horizontal plane green color being between 2 and 10 mg l between the two planes yellow color and being above 10 mg l above the top horizontal plane red color posterior probability surfaces are shown for all four lakes showing how successful hierarchical modelling is in capturing the variability of cbb for a wide range of lakes and lake groups and multitude of observations in figs 7 h and k the predicted concentrations are below the 2 mg l threshold thus no horizontal plane is shown it should be noted here that even though for all groups plots in the left and center panels are identical for groups 1 6 and 10 the plots in the center panel are rotated for better visualization of the 3 d surfaces in the right panels figs 7 c f i and l we show the 3d posterior probability surface plots for the 50th percentile of predictive distributions for each lake group for tn and tp ranges consistent with the corresponding observed concentrations for all lakes belonging to each group this way we can see how hierarchical modelling works in the absence of any data for a single lake the prediction probabilities would have to come from the lake group level in which the lake belongs shown in figs 7 c f i and l these surfaces were designed using posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ i Œ≤ 0 i Œ≤ 1 i Œ≤ 2 i for each lake group naturally as data from the lake become available hierarchical modelling greatly improves and provides more accurate predictions specific for each lake as shown in the center and left panels table 5 lists all posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ i Œ≤ 0 i Œ≤ 1 i Œ≤ 2 i for all ten lake groups when comparing Œ≤ 1 i the coefficient of tn and Œ≤ 2 i the coefficient of tp we see that for almost all lake groups Œ≤ 2 i is positive and over one order of magnitude greater than Œ≤ 1 i indeed this result matches with the cart presented earlier since it enforces that tp is the most influential being the most important one strongly affecting cbb tn is also important but seems to play a secondary role the bayesian hierarchical model becomes a powerful framework when cbb standard exceedance probability response surfaces are simulated such a surface can set nutrient criteria that can be directly used under a risk assessment framework for eutrophic lake management therefore an exceedance probability response for the 10 mg l cbb threshold shows the range and combination of tn and tp concentrations for which the predicted cbb has less than a specific probability to exceed that threshold of 10 mg l this is indicatively shown in fig 8 a for lake engelsholm s√∏ group 1 where x and y axes show nutrient concentrations and the z axis is the probability to exceed the 10mg l threshold in fig 8 b and 8 c we show the contour diagram of the exceedance probability response surface for all percentiles for the 2 mg l and 10 mg l threshold respectively for a lake eutrophication management scheme the lake manager can identify the risk level that s he wants to operate under if a 90 risk level is chosen then the combination of tn and tp concentrations that correspond to the 90 line in fig 8 b and c signify the concentrations that give a 90 probability to exceed the 2 mg l and 10 mg l thresholds respectively for a lower risk level lower tn and tp concentrations are required alternatively if tn and tp concentrations in the lake are measured under a monitoring scheme or if criteria for tn and tp are set by the european water framework directive poikane et al 2019 or a relevant authority the lake manager can have an estimate of what the risk level is to exceed the 2 or 10 mg l threshold to show how this might work in fig 8 b and c we plot the observed combinations of tn and tp concentrations for lake engelsholm s√∏ along with the corresponding cbb concentrations with red font we show the cbb concentrations that exceed the preset thresholds and we see that indeed all high cbb concentrations appear in the area that is above the 97 5 exceedance line only a few high cbbs are found on the risk level lines 25 and higher while there is no red font in the safe area under the 2 5 risk line with posterior predictive simulations of the bayesian hierarchical approach similar curves can be drawn for any threshold providing a flexible and robust framework of probabilistic risk assessment for various management decisions and associated nutrient concentrations that is relatively easy to use and understand to our knowledge these contour diagrams of the exceedance probability response surface for a given threshold of cbb for all percentiles and for the full range of nutrient concentrations in a single graph as a result of bayesian hierarchical modelling has not been done before and is a novel and powerful methodology for lake eutrophication management the lake load response model also a bayesian hierarchical model was developed into an online tool for lake managers http lakestate vyh fi and can be used e g for prediction of chl a and phytoplankton biomass from tn and tp loads llr is a useful lake management tool that allows the calculation of estimates of the amount of loading reduction needed to achieve good water quality in a lake in a similar way our model can form the basis of a tool for predicting cyanobacteria biomass from tn and tp concentrations for different lake groups 4 conclusions the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model calculates lake specific probabilities of cbb concentrations to exceed the two health risk levels for recreational use under different tp and tn concentrations enabling lake managers to define combinations of tp and tn concentrations that will result in exceedance risk levels for pre defined thresholds appropriate for each ecosystem can lead to optimal monitoring schemes and can minimize uncertainty associated with each lake ecosystem after compiling a large water quality data set for a system of lakes with different characteristics and typology divided into groups competent authorities can develop a monitoring strategy that will focus on lakes that have the greatest risk at violating the thresholds and developing cyanobacterial blooms thus monitoring schemes become targeted and efficient with maximum benefits for society using bayesian hierarchical modelling lake managers can focus on lakes with significant ecosystem services including recreational quality and can thus maximise the provision of these services categorizing lakes in different types according to their characteristics allows a clear generalization of lake responses promotes our understanding of lake cyanobacteria dynamics and enables lake managers to target measures to minimize risks under climate change finally a lake with no data history can take advantage of the data series of other lakes that belong to the same group and can follow a management scheme that will be superior to a generalized scheme that would be

17542,cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs currently threaten water security and affect the ecosystem services provided by these freshwater ecosystems such as drinking water and recreational use climate change is expected to further exacerbate the situation in the future because of higher temperatures extended droughts and nutrient enrichment due to urbanisation and intensified agriculture nutrients are considered critical for the deterioration of water quality in lakes and reservoirs and responsible for the widespread increase in cyanobacterial blooms we model the response of cyanobacteria abundance to variations in lake total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations using a data set from 822 northern european lakes we divide lakes in ten groups based on their physico chemical characteristics following a modified lake typology defined for the water framework directive wfd this classification is used in a bayesian hierarchical linear model which employs a probabilistic approach transforming uncertainty into probability thresholds the hierarchical model is used to calculate probabilities of cyanobacterial concentrations exceeding risk levels for human health associated with the use of lakes for recreational activities as defined by the world health organization who different tn and tp concentration combinations result in variable probabilities to exceed pre set thresholds our objective is to support lake managers in estimating acceptable nutrient concentrations and allow them to identify actions that would achieve compliance of cyanobacterial abundance risk levels with a given confidence level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria nutrients water framework directive bayesian hierarchical modelling eutrophication lake management who risk levels 1 introduction freshwater is inextricably linked to human well being and socio economic development while this dependence is a key condition for the sustainable management of freshwater resources as the planet s population increases and as a consequence urbanisation and agriculture intensify freshwater security is threatened by the growing demand for food production electrical power generation industrial processes and human consumption on top of that water quality generally suffers from continuous degradation in many regions and as a result freshwater ecosystems often become inhospitable habitats for living organisms unep 2016 this trend is expected to worsen in the near future and next generations are likely to face significant adverse impacts on water quantity and quality especially under the threat of climate change in recent years global concern has evolved into specific action plans for water management the united nations released an agenda defining sustainable development goals sdgs where water management holds a prominent position calling for actions by all countries to increase the access to clean drinking water and sanitation sdg 6 and to conserve and use oceans seas and marine resources sustainably sdg 14 un 2019 furthermore since 2000 the european water framework directive wfd has transformed water management in europe by bringing aquatic ecology to the forefront of decisions hering et al 2010 traditionally the only common biological indicator of lake quality assessment and management was chlorophyl a chl a but following the implementation of the wfd cyanobacteria abundance has become an additional indicator required for assessment of ecological status for european lakes birk et al 2012 harmful cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious risk to freshwater quality affecting human and animal health due to the toxins released by many bloom forming species water becomes inappropriate to serve human needs such as drinking water fisheries and recreation charmichael et al 2016 l√©vesque et al 2014 ibelings et al 2016 scientific research has paid considerable attention to predicting the frequency and extent of cyanobacterial bloom events suggesting possible interventions to mitigate these phenomena jewett et al 2008 tromas et al 2017 however predicting cyanobacterial abundance remains a challenge even though there is good understanding of the key factors that drive and influence cyanobacterial dynamics there is still high variability making it difficult to accurately predict the abundance in addition availability of data exhibits great variation among freshwater ecosystems making it difficult to come up with robust methodologies that would be applicable to a wide range of lake types richardson et al 2018 a common practice for bridging the gap of insufficient data in lake ecosystems is to borrow data from lakes with similar characteristics and in this way expand the sample size towards strengthening statistical analyses however when predictive models are applied to lakes categorized to groups following the assumption of homogeneity the results usually fail to prove realistic since homogeneity within a lake group is a weak assumption malve and qian 2006 beaulieu et al 2013 used a 1000 lake dataset containing data from lakes across the united states and implemented multiple linear regression analyses to predict cyanobacterial biomass on the whole dataset and on subsets of lake type according to depth and to whether the ecosystem is natural or a reservoir the findings of this analysis indicated that predictions improved when lakes were categorized to groups however the overall low predictive strength advocates that the grouping assumption alone lacks satisfactory results in another study conducted by richardson et al 2018 the response of cyanobacteria to multiple stressors by using linear regression mixed effect models varied greatly with lake type resulting in the conclusion that a one size fits all approach is inappropriate towards understanding and managing the risks of harmful algal blooms carvalho et al 2013 used quantile regression modelling to quantify the relationship between tp concentrations and cyanobacteria using a data set from 800 european lakes the analysis showed that tp cannot be singled out as the dominant factor regarding cyanobacteria concentrations in lakes rather tp quantile modelling can be used to define the lake maximum cyanobacteria abundance but only in relation to tp even though it is widely recognized that total nitrogen tn also plays a key role in cyanobacteria previous modelling efforts of cyanobacteria in large datasets focus only on tp in their models richardson et al 2018 carvalho et al 2013 obenour et al 2014 in their work based on mesocosm experiments richardson et al 2019 include both tn and tp but only in combination not separately so the interaction with cyanobacteria cannot be analysed our work addresses this gap as it uses both tn and tp separately as predictors for cyanobacteria bayesian hierarchical models can combine prior and data driven knowledge both from multiple groups of lakes and from lakes of the same group in order to make predictions for a single lake belonging to a specific group in other words the hierarchical approach moves one step further from the classical grouping approach by considering the effects of the ensemble of lakes on predictions the bayesian modelling framework which is based on probability distributions is very suitable for the analysis of cyanobacteria blooms as they are rare events with high uncertainty the method has been used extensively in the past with convincing results e g malve and qian 2006 shimoda and archonditsis 2015 shimoda et al 2016 cheng et al 2009 obenour et al 2014 stow et al 2014 however the method has not been used for prediction of cyanobacteria abundance specifically malve and qian 2006 have developed a similar modelling framework using tn and tp as predictors but they only predicted chl a this research is to our knowledge novel because it models cyanobacteria using a bayesian hierarchical model with both tn and tp as predictors herein we build upon the work of malve and colleagues expanding it for cyanobacteria in this article we use a multi lake data set of 822 northern european lakes and evaluate trends in cyanobacteria biomass cbb using nutrient concentrations as predictors fitted with a non parametric generalised additive model gam curve and a lowess curve then by dividing lakes into 10 groups with different physico chemical characteristics we implement a linear bayesian hierarchical modelling framework and obtain posterior probability simulations that exhibit a strong predictive modelling performance overall that varies depending on lake group and number of observations results are implemented for analyzing lake cbb concentrations according to the three risk levels associated to human health for recreational activities low cbb 2mg l medium cbb between 2 and 10 mg l and high cbb 10mg l as defined by the world health organization 2006 finally exceedance probability response surfaces are produced for a range of nutrient concentrations for the who risk levels showing that the bayesian hierarchical modelling framework can be used for lake eutrophication management by setting nutrient targets to sustain specific cbb thresholds with an associated exceedance risk level 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset our dataset consists of a range of biological cyanobacteria biomass chl a physical latitude altitude surface area mean max depth mean max air temperature and chemical total nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio alkalinity type and humic type features of several northern european lakes extracted from the central database of the eu funded project wiser moe et al 2013 wiser was launched in 2009 and for three years 25 european institutions representing 16 countries have addressed the assessment and management of rivers lakes transitional and coastal waters in europe although the dataset originally contained observations for several features for 1851 lakes it was unbalanced in terms of the number of monitored features per lake thus after a thorough screening procedure we ended up with a subset of 822 lakes containing data for all the aforementioned variables in other words even though initially we had data for 1851 lakes for a large number of variables we ended up with a compact dataset of 822 lakes containing data for a smaller group of variables our goal was to create a dataset with features that would be covered by all lakes the final subset contains lakes from six northern european countries namely uk denmark norway sweden finland and lithuania the total observations are 4 175 from may to october and from 1980 to 2009 however observations are unevenly distributed among years months and lakes a total of 164 lakes have only a single observation while the rest of the lakes range between 2 and 55 observations approximately 30 of the observations are from august while 27 18 13 9 and 3 are from july june may september and october respectively in fig 1 the spatial distribution of all lakes in the dataset across the european map is shown more details on the data set are included in mellios et al 2020 2 2 categorizing lakes into groups lake type specific models rely on the simple assumption that lakes belonging to a specific group are likely to exhibit similar behavior and response to changes in intra and extra lake conditions under this context the response of cbb to stressors is expected to follow a similar behavior among lakes of the same type in this work grouping of lakes into types should ideally follow the lake typology defined for the water framework directive wfd implementation within the nordic geographic intercalibration group poikane 2009 solheim et al 2019 have developed a simplified version of the original typology new broad typology that has been used as guidance for developing lake groups in this article richardson et al 2018 used a modified lake typology that included a classification in 18 lake types which was eventually aggregated to 8 lake types to match data availability in each category malve and qian 2006 used the geomorphological typology of finnish lakes specified by the finnish environment institute since their analysis included solely finnish lakes according to this typology lakes are grouped into different types based on their geographical and natural characteristics pilke et al 2002 the wfd nordic lake typology is strongly influenced by the finnish lake typology so our grouping was an adaptation of the latter to include criteria that match our dataset which has a high proportion of finnish lakes two typology variables altitude and alkalinity or calcium level siliceous vs calcareous are not included in the finnish lake typology and were also left out from our analysis the reason for excluding altitude was that only a few lakes had higher altitude so this would result in the formation of unbalanced datasets under each lake category regarding calcium level alkalinity such data were not available in our dataset for all lakes besides alkalinity tends to co vary with tp although not for all lake groups and its role has been investigated in other papers namely in richardson et al 2018 and carvalho et al 2013 here we wanted to focus more on other factors such as humic type since there is evidence that there is a negative effect of humic level for cyanobacteria ptacnik et al 2008 richardson et al 2018 the chosen lake classification is very similar to the one used by malve and qian 2006 and included 10 groups modifying lake types in order to fit the availability of data in our dataset as specified in table 1 the grouping of lakes was determined by mean depth humic type and surface area mean depth was already discretized in the wiser dataset in three levels namely very shallow shallow and deep in terms of humic type the classes followed a similar discretization namely non humic humic and very humic indicated by the color level in terms of lake size the wiser typology included four classes according to lake surface area namely very small small medium and large in our dataset we retained large and grouped medium small and very small under a single category named medium small and ended up with two size categories this grouping was done in order to reflect the types of lakes included in our dataset a critical mass of data is ensured in each type with this grouping 2 3 identifying the best predictors of cbb linear correlation analysis indicated high correlation between cbb and chl a r 0 52 mellios et al 2020 but chl a was excluded from the explanatory variables because chl a and cyanobacteria are not independent since cyanobacteria is a proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass of which chl a is an indicator maximum air temperature and maximum depth show high collinearity with mean temperature and mean depth respectively thus they were also excluded since their effects on cbb are not distinct to determine which of the other variables latitude altitude surface area mean depth tn tp tn tp and mean temperature explain most of the variation of the response variable cbb a classification and regression tree cart analysis was conducted by satisfying the criterion to diminish the prediction error the best tree model was chosen which is illustrated in fig 2 the cart analysis procedure was done in the programming environment r version 3 6 2 https www r project org by using the mvpart package de ath 2007 as indicated by the cart analysis results when considering the whole dataset including all ten lake groups tp plays the most significant role towards the prediction of cbb while tn is influential only for the subset of samples n 276 where tp is larger than 89 75 Œºg l these findings are in accordance with downing et al 2001 who analyzed data from 99 temperate lakes and showed that cyanobacteria blooms are more strongly correlated with variation in tp and tn than the ratio of tn tp watson et al 1997 performed regression analyses and showed that the mean summer biomass of cyanobacteria is significantly and positively related to tp for different nutrient ranges h√•kanson et al 2007 used linear regression to model a transformed form of cyanobacteria concentration cbb0 25 on log tn and log tp and found significant correlations with r2 0 63 and 0 75 respectively and concluded that variations in tp rather than tn seem to be more important to predict variations among systems in cyanobacteria following these results tn and tp concentrations were selected as the best predictors of cbb and were used to construct the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model the advantage of including only two predictors is that the model is simple lean and flexible and easy to be applied 2 4 bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bayesian methods are gaining ground in a wide range of scientific fields and especially in ecology mainly due to their ability to produce probabilistic oriented inferences which in many cases outperform deterministic approaches since ecological modelling is characterized by high uncertainty due to the complex and many times unknown cause effect relationships among variables a probabilistic approach that yields distributions of possible outcomes in essence transforms uncertainty into probability thresholds the advantage of bayesian methods relies on their ability to combine prior knowledge about model parameters with evidence from data arhonditsis et al 2006 they are well suited for analysis of multilevel models showing i flexibility in specifying multilevel structures of parameters using priors ii ability to handle small samples and model misspecification overparameterization of the likelihood can be resolved with well chosen priors iii explicit handling of uncertainty and iv intuitive and easy interpretation of results

the hierarchy of the specified model relies on the assumption that each lake s cbb values are modelled conditional on lake specific model parameter values the lake specific model parameter values are modelled conditional on a common distribution representing all group specific lakes the lake group specific parameter values are modelled conditional on a common parameter distribution representing all groups the ensemble of groups is modelled conditional on a common distribution representing all lakes while all lakes are in turn modelled conditional on representative hyperparameters for the whole population of lakes considered in our dataset to be more specific yijk is conditionally normally distributed on xŒ≤ij and œÑ 2 Œ≤ ij are conditionally normally distributed on Œ≤ i œÉ i 2 while Œ≤ i is conditionally normally distributed on Œ≤ and œÉ 2 the non informative prior distributions of Œ≤ œÑ œÉ i and œÉ which represent the hyperparameters follow a normal distribution n 0 10000 with

respectively the hyperparameters of œÑ œÉ i and œÉ are considered vague or non informative as there is no information about their distribution 2 5 description of the modelling procedure the bayesian hierarchical analysis was conducted with the winbugs software lunn et al 2000 which is a program for bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using markov chain monte carlo mcmc techniques in this study the metropolis algorithm was used which is based on a symmetric normal proposal distribution whose standard deviation is turned over the first 4000 iterations in order to get an acceptance rate of between 20 and 40 lunn et al 2000 to run the constructed model a chain was produced and run for 100 000 iterations in order to let the mcmc simulation converge to the true posterior distribution to check the convergence of the proposed model we used the heidelberger and welch diagnostic which is appropriate for the analysis of individual chains under the boa package in the programming environment r version 3 6 2 smith 2007 the advantage of this diagnostic method is two fold it both estimates the number of samples to be discarded as a burn in sequence and it tests for non convergence in our case the burn in period as indicated by the convergence diagnostic tool was 50 000 while convergence was succeeded over 100 000 iterations in order to reduce autocorrelation of the sample we took 1 250 samples for each unknown parameter Œ≤ ij Œ≤ i œÉ i 2 œÉ 2 œÑ 2 from the 50 000 remaining mcmc iterations by keeping the data of every 40th iteration thin 40 finally we confirmed the accuracy of the posterior parameter values by assuring that the mc error to the sample standard deviation error ratio for all parameters did not exceed the 5 limit as proposed by spiegelhalter et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 data exploratory analysis in table 2 and fig 3 we show data statistics and boxplots of the response and explanatory variables included in the analysis for all lake groups exploring the relationship between cbb and nutrients in each group it is noticeable that this relationship varies among groups in groups 1 to 3 mean cbb decreases as humic level increases which is consistent with the finding that cyanobacteria dominate more often in clear lakes than in humic ones ptacnik et al 2008 lake depth groups 9 and 10 seems to play a determinant role in minimizing cyanobacteria abundance which is in line with several studies bakker and hilt 2015 sharma et al 2011 however no clear pattern can be detected between the relationship of cbb and nutrients even though higher mean tn and tp values result in higher cbb values for the most part this is probably related to the variable carrying capacity maximum abundance of lakes for cyanobacteria and to the nutrient that is limiting in each lake type thus even though phosphorus is often considered the limiting nutrient in lakes richardson et al 2018 nitrogen can also play a key role beaulieu et al 2013 some of the basic properties of the data for all lakes are shown in fig 4 a and b where we show a scatter plot of the relationships of cbb vs log tp and log tn for all lakes fitted with a non parametric generalised additive model gam curve along with the 5 and 95 confidence intervals statistical analyses for both curves are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively in table 3 the intercept estimate and standard errors are very similar for both tp and tn signifying that if either variable were zero the model would predict the same value of 0 6421 mg l for cbb in terms of the significance of the smooth terms table 4 again both variables have similar results with tp performing better with 19 of deviance explained as opposed to 13 for tn this is consistent with our cart analysis that showed that tp plays the most significant role towards the prediction of cbb while tn is influential only for a subset of samples this result is also consistent with other research works e g hamilton et al 2016 s√∏ndergaard et al 2017 and moss et al 2013 the p values table 4 are very small in both cases for intercepts and smooth terms showing that the data is sufficient to recognize that the smoothed relationship between cbb and tn and tp explains the data better than assuming that cbb is independent of tn and tp intercept only model to further explore the relationship between cbb and both tn and tp we perform a lowess curve fitting analysis here cbb is predicted using two explanatory variables i e cbb s tp tn and the 3d scatter plot with the predicted surface is shown in fig 5 a while the corresponding contour plot is shown in fig 5 b the model does not predict peak cbb concentrations for the combination of the highest tn and tp concentrations but rather for relatively low tp concentrations in the order of 200 Œºg l and medium low tn concentrations in the order of 2 300 Œºg l this signifies the fact that depending on the concentrations there is tn and tp limitation and lakes reach maximum abundance at those tn and tp concentrations the model fails to capture most of the high cbb values since peak cbb values in the order of 15 mg l are predicted while peak observed values are in the 70s this is expected however since model predictions are based on the whole cbb dataset a skewed distribution with many zero values as shown in figure 3 a statistics of the analysis are shown in fig 5 a relatively low r2 is obtained similar to what has been observed in the literature i e beaulieu et al 2013 carvalho et al 2013 chirico et al 2020 but it is improved from the individual cbb vs tn and cbb vs tp plots table 4 proving that the capability of prediction of cbb using these advanced smoothing models is limited and predictions have relatively low reliability 3 2 linear hierarchical modelling and model fit having explored the potential to predict cyanobacteria with nonlinear relationships we proceed with a linear hierarchical model to take advantage of the simplicity and flexibility of linear models linear regression is used even though cyanobacteria response to the nutrient gradient is non linear fig 4 nevertheless linear models are still commonly used in ecology since non linear models tend to become complicated and require the pre definition of parameters by the user such as defining the maximum of the curve or the point where the concavity and or convexity of the curve begins carvalho et al 2013 this way there exists a potential to introduce error by predefining the results with skewed distributions the assumptions underlying regression models based on normal distribution are violated so data transformation is commonly used the box cox procedure defines the parameter Œª that is used to choose the most suitable transformation for the dataset to achieve normality for our dataset Œª was close to zero so the suitable transformation would be logarithmic this is relatively common in ecology since environmental variables take only positive values and the logarithm of these variables are likely to be normal and the resulting model is easy to interpret qian 2016 in this work a log transformation did not prove useful first because the dataset is unbalanced and includes a large number of zero concentrations of cbb even when replacing zero concentrations with small numbers to avoid the conflict with the log transformation the retransformation of the log cbb variable was problematic because the exponential of the log mean was not the same as the mean concentration and model fit deteriorated when compared to the untransformed dataset in this case the error term Œµ cannot be ignored and needs to be included in the retransformation of data ultimately introducing a bias to the results by the fixed multiplicative factor eŒµ even though using a bias correction factor is a possibility sprugel 1983 it is difficult to define a formula for the standard error and the estimated mean of the dependent variable qian 2016 based on this analysis we conducted the modelling with untransformed data and obtained good model fits overall with hierarchical modelling log transforming tn and tp in order to setup a linear log model did not improve results therefore all variables were used untransformed to assess hierarchical modelling fit in terms of both precision and accuracy we compare predicted vs observed cbb values through scatter plots for all lake groups as shown in fig 6 the circles represent the mean predicted values while the lower and upper limits of the red lines are the 10th and 90th percentiles in the last graph we show simulated vs observed for the whole dataset all lakes at the value of 0 74 we see that r2 for all lakes fig 6 is remarkably improved when compared to the predictions that were reported for multiple linear regression for the same data set in mellios et al 2020 r2 0 33 predictions are also greatly improved when compared to both non parametric curve models performed gams or lowess lake groups show variable accuracy and precision with some groups performing impressively well e g r2 0 87 for group 8 large humic lakes r2 0 85 for group 6 shallow very humic lakes and r2 0 81 for group 1 very shallow non humic lakes while some groups performing poorly e g r2 0 15 for group 10 medium small deep humic lakes it seems that the model drops in performance when the maximum observed cbb values in a group are small i e less than 3 mg l as is the case in group 10 the number of observations is also important with the number of observations being inversely proportional to model fit the hierarchical model even though it models the non linear response of cbb to nutrient concentrations linearly has a great advantage in the fact that while it fits different model parameters for each lake thus customizing the model to the specific lake data it also treats lakes within the same group as exchangeable essentially parameters of lakes in the same lake group are assumed to come from the same prior distributions thereby pooling information from similar lakes as a result this pooling of information results in reduced bias at lake level while model error variance is reduced as well this method is superior especially for lakes that need to be managed for eutrophication but have no prior data to base management decisions on the lake will be classified in a group according to its characteristics and the group parameters will be used to model it as more data are included the lake model will improve by customising its model parameters and differentiating them from those of the group however during the phase that no data exist there will be an initial set of parameters to be used successfully 3 3 posterior probabilities and exceedance probability surfaces in order to demonstrate how hierarchical models can be used for the management of eutrophic lakes we simulate posterior probabilities of cbb for a range of tn and tp for an indicative list of four specific lakes coming from groups 1 6 8 and 10 engelsholm s√∏ lillsj√∂n p√§ij√§nne and gjersj√∏en respectively the number of observations for these lakes are 18 3 24 and 11 respectively the tn and tp ranges that are plotted are consistent with the corresponding observed concentrations for each lake in figs 7 a d g and j the resulting surface is presented for the 50th percentile of the predictive distributions along with the scatter plots of observed values in a 3d format showing the goodness of fit of the model these surfaces were designed using the posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ ij Œ≤ 0 ij Œ≤ 1 ij Œ≤ 2 ij that are specific for each lake in figs 7 b e h and k we show the same plots as before but without the observed values scatter plot this time we visualize two horizontal planes that correspond to the three distinct health risk levels low medium high with thresholds at 2 and 10 mg l as defined by who after converting cell counts into concentrations mellios et al 2020 from these posterior probability surfaces we can identify the combination of tn and tp concentrations that result in the 50th percentile of cbb distribution being lower than 2 mg l below the bottom horizontal plane green color being between 2 and 10 mg l between the two planes yellow color and being above 10 mg l above the top horizontal plane red color posterior probability surfaces are shown for all four lakes showing how successful hierarchical modelling is in capturing the variability of cbb for a wide range of lakes and lake groups and multitude of observations in figs 7 h and k the predicted concentrations are below the 2 mg l threshold thus no horizontal plane is shown it should be noted here that even though for all groups plots in the left and center panels are identical for groups 1 6 and 10 the plots in the center panel are rotated for better visualization of the 3 d surfaces in the right panels figs 7 c f i and l we show the 3d posterior probability surface plots for the 50th percentile of predictive distributions for each lake group for tn and tp ranges consistent with the corresponding observed concentrations for all lakes belonging to each group this way we can see how hierarchical modelling works in the absence of any data for a single lake the prediction probabilities would have to come from the lake group level in which the lake belongs shown in figs 7 c f i and l these surfaces were designed using posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ i Œ≤ 0 i Œ≤ 1 i Œ≤ 2 i for each lake group naturally as data from the lake become available hierarchical modelling greatly improves and provides more accurate predictions specific for each lake as shown in the center and left panels table 5 lists all posterior distribution parameters Œ≤ i Œ≤ 0 i Œ≤ 1 i Œ≤ 2 i for all ten lake groups when comparing Œ≤ 1 i the coefficient of tn and Œ≤ 2 i the coefficient of tp we see that for almost all lake groups Œ≤ 2 i is positive and over one order of magnitude greater than Œ≤ 1 i indeed this result matches with the cart presented earlier since it enforces that tp is the most influential being the most important one strongly affecting cbb tn is also important but seems to play a secondary role the bayesian hierarchical model becomes a powerful framework when cbb standard exceedance probability response surfaces are simulated such a surface can set nutrient criteria that can be directly used under a risk assessment framework for eutrophic lake management therefore an exceedance probability response for the 10 mg l cbb threshold shows the range and combination of tn and tp concentrations for which the predicted cbb has less than a specific probability to exceed that threshold of 10 mg l this is indicatively shown in fig 8 a for lake engelsholm s√∏ group 1 where x and y axes show nutrient concentrations and the z axis is the probability to exceed the 10mg l threshold in fig 8 b and 8 c we show the contour diagram of the exceedance probability response surface for all percentiles for the 2 mg l and 10 mg l threshold respectively for a lake eutrophication management scheme the lake manager can identify the risk level that s he wants to operate under if a 90 risk level is chosen then the combination of tn and tp concentrations that correspond to the 90 line in fig 8 b and c signify the concentrations that give a 90 probability to exceed the 2 mg l and 10 mg l thresholds respectively for a lower risk level lower tn and tp concentrations are required alternatively if tn and tp concentrations in the lake are measured under a monitoring scheme or if criteria for tn and tp are set by the european water framework directive poikane et al 2019 or a relevant authority the lake manager can have an estimate of what the risk level is to exceed the 2 or 10 mg l threshold to show how this might work in fig 8 b and c we plot the observed combinations of tn and tp concentrations for lake engelsholm s√∏ along with the corresponding cbb concentrations with red font we show the cbb concentrations that exceed the preset thresholds and we see that indeed all high cbb concentrations appear in the area that is above the 97 5 exceedance line only a few high cbbs are found on the risk level lines 25 and higher while there is no red font in the safe area under the 2 5 risk line with posterior predictive simulations of the bayesian hierarchical approach similar curves can be drawn for any threshold providing a flexible and robust framework of probabilistic risk assessment for various management decisions and associated nutrient concentrations that is relatively easy to use and understand to our knowledge these contour diagrams of the exceedance probability response surface for a given threshold of cbb for all percentiles and for the full range of nutrient concentrations in a single graph as a result of bayesian hierarchical modelling has not been done before and is a novel and powerful methodology for lake eutrophication management the lake load response model also a bayesian hierarchical model was developed into an online tool for lake managers http lakestate vyh fi and can be used e g for prediction of chl a and phytoplankton biomass from tn and tp loads llr is a useful lake management tool that allows the calculation of estimates of the amount of loading reduction needed to achieve good water quality in a lake in a similar way our model can form the basis of a tool for predicting cyanobacteria biomass from tn and tp concentrations for different lake groups 4 conclusions the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model calculates lake specific probabilities of cbb concentrations to exceed the two health risk levels for recreational use under different tp and tn concentrations enabling lake managers to define combinations of tp and tn concentrations that will result in exceedance risk levels for pre defined thresholds appropriate for each ecosystem can lead to optimal monitoring schemes and can minimize uncertainty associated with each lake ecosystem after compiling a large water quality data set for a system of lakes with different characteristics and typology divided into groups competent authorities can develop a monitoring strategy that will focus on lakes that have the greatest risk at violating the thresholds and developing cyanobacterial blooms thus monitoring schemes become targeted and efficient with maximum benefits for society using bayesian hierarchical modelling lake managers can focus on lakes with significant ecosystem services including recreational quality and can thus maximise the provision of these services categorizing lakes in different types according to their characteristics allows a clear generalization of lake responses promotes our understanding of lake cyanobacteria dynamics and enables lake managers to target measures to minimize risks under climate change finally a lake with no data history can take advantage of the data series of other lakes that belong to the same group and can follow a management scheme that will be superior to a generalized scheme that would be

17543,the feasibility of integrated uv ozone o3 peroxydisulfate pds process for abatement of clofibric acid ca was systematically explored in this study with focus on the kinetic simulation and oxidation mechanisms the results indicated the uv o3 pds process was of prominent treatment capability with pseudo first order rate constant of ca degradation increased by 65 9 and 86 0 compared to uv o3 and uv pds processes respectively a chemical kinetic model was developed and successfully employed to predict ca elimination as well as the specific contributions of uv hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 under different pds dosage ph natural organic matters bicarbonate and chloride conditions in uv o3 pds process according to quantum chemical calculation radical addition on ortho site of isopropoxy substituent and single electron transfer were corroborated to be the dominant reaction channels for the oxidation of ca by oh and so4 respectively additionally the reactive sites and transformation pathways of ca were proposed via fukui function calculation and uplc q tof ms analysis moreover the performance of uv o3 pds process was further evaluated with regard to the energy demand and bromate formation this study first proposed a kinetic model in uv o3 pds process and elucidated the regioselectivity and products distribution of ca during oxidative treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv ozone peroxydisulfate kinetic modeling quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction the emergence of diverse micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aquatic ecosystem has raised considerable concern owing to the potential risk of triggering adverse ecological and health effects to wildlife and humans schwarzenbach et al 2006

concentrations of 0 03 to 0 55 Œºg l 1 buser et al 1998 isidori et al 2007 however traditional biological treatment processes can only achieve limited removal of ca due to its stable chemical

extensively studied for efficient abatement of a large number of organic micropollutants via the direct oxidation by ozone o3 molecule and indirect oxidation by generated hydroxyl radical oh from o3 decomposition von gunten 2003a huber et al 2005 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 von gunten 2018 recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have gained substantial scientific interests and the uv photolysis of peroxydisulfate pds i e uv pds was demonstrated to be an effective option to produce so4 by the homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 yang et al 2019 typically so4 as a strong one electron oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v has an extremely high reactivity towards a wide range of organic compounds which is comparable with that of oh buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 in addition so4 tends to react with organic substances through the one electron transfer mechanism rather than h abstraction and addition processes and is less impacted by water matrix components such as natural organic matters nom and alkalinity indicating that so4 oxidation may complement oh based aops with diverse compound reactivities products patterns and energy efficiencies neta et al 1988 lutze et al 2015a to address the limited treatment capability of single aop for water quality improvement the combined aops can be employed to expedite the decontamination of refractory compounds it was reported that the combination of o3 or o3 h2o2 with uv h2o2 could achieve significant mitigation of micropollutants with decrease of energy consumption and minimization of oxidation byproducts formation lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 lee et al 2016 additionally uv pds can potentially have a higher efficiency and a lower energy footprint than uv h2o2 owing to the higher quantum yield of pds than h2o2 0 7 versus 0 5 and the less dependence on operational parameters luo et al 2015 li et al 2018 however the integration of ozonation with uv pds process for water purification has rarely been investigated which may also be an appealing alternative due to the simultaneous generation of oh and so4 the structural diversity of micropollutants in varying water matrices makes it cost prohibitive and time consuming to measure their mitigation efficiencies and poses a challenge for generalized design of advanced water treatment processes lee at al 2013 have reported that a chemical kinetic model can be applied to predict the degradation efficiencies of micropollutants during ozonation by use of kinetic and water specific information in addition several other studies have proposed and tested the simplified kinetic models based on steady state approximation in uv pds process luo et al 2015 luo et al 2016 lian et al 2017 however a comprehensive kinetic model to estimate the abatement of contaminants and investigate the distribution of various reactive radicals has never been reported in the integrated uv o3 pds process furthermore it still remains challenging to clarify the mechanistic aspects of ca attenuation during oxidative treatment especially in relation to the contribution of each reaction pathway due to the restriction of analytical methods quantum chemical calculation is proven to be a powerful tool for theoretical investigations on bimolecular reactions and can provide a supplement or even an alternative to experimental studies for understanding of oxidation mechanisms of organic compounds in aops an et al 2014 gao et al 2014 tentscher et al 2019 the main objectives of this study are to

charge and spin multiplicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of ca abatement in various systems the degradation of ca was evaluated and compared in different systems including pds alone uv alone o3 alone o3 pds uv o3 uv pds and uv o3 pds as shown in fig 1 a the direct oxidation of ca by pds was negligible in addition no obvious enhancement of ca removal was observed in o3 pds process compared to o3 alone which was consistent with the previous study that o3 almost does not directly react with pds yang et al 2015 the uv pds and uv o3 could abate 34 7 and 36 5 Œºm of ca after 3 min while only 27 1 and 21 4 Œºm of ca was degraded in uv alone and o3 alone respectively importantly the degradation of ca was obviously expedited by uv o3 pds treatment with the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of 0 785 min 1 which was increased by 1 9 and 1 7 times compared to uv pds 0 422 min 1 and uv o3 0 473 min 1 respectively the results demonstrate that the uv o3 pds process is of pronounced treatment capability and may serve as a potential alternative for efficient abatement of refractory contaminants it is expected that both oh and so4 can be generated in uv o3 pds process which was corroborated by the epr experiments fig s2 zou et al 2013 wu et al 2019a to quantitatively elucidate the roles of oh and so4 nitrobenzene nb was used as a oh probe compound which reacts rapidly with oh but resists to the oxidation by o3 and so4 k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k o 3 nb 0 09 m 1 s 1 k so 4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the second order rate constants for the reactions of ca with o3 oh and so4 were determined to be 9 5 2 8 109 and 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively text s3 and fig s3 the contribution of molecular o3 to ca removal was confirmed to be negligible 1 0 in uv o3 pds process via the determination of o3 exposure and the detailed calculation of the relative contributions of oh and so4 are provided in text s4 guo et al 2017 wu et al 2019b as displayed in fig 1b the specific degradation rates of ca by uv k uv oh k oh and so4 k so 4 in uv o3 pds process were calculated to be 0 232 0 178 and 0 375 min 1 respectively compared to uv o3 process the k oh decreased from 0 241 to 0 178 min 1 which could be explained by the competition of pds with o3 for uv light absorbance and the scavenging effect of pds towards oh k oh pds 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 11 interestingly the k so 4 in uv o3 pds process was higher than that in uv pds process contribution of oh in uv pds was insignificant data not shown indicating that the presence of o3 may enhance the formation of so4 under uv irradiation via the electron transfer from oh and other reactive radicals abu amr et al 2013 yang et al 2016a 3 2 effect of pds dosage and ph fig 2 a displays the k obs of ca degradation at different pds dosages in uv o3 pds process the k obs increased from 0 521 to 0 785 min 1 with the increase of pds dosage from 0 1 to 0 4 mm which decreased to 0 716 min 1 as pds further increased to 0 5 mm based on kintecus simulation the modeling results of k obs k cal tot of ca removal and the specific rates of uv k cal uv oh k cal oh and so4 k cal so 4 in uv o3 pds process are also provided in fig 2a it was observed that the k cal tot values were basically consistent with the experimental values and the simulated steady state concentrations of oh and so4 at 0 4 mm pds dosage were also in agreement with the determined results by using nb as a probe compound table s2 the k cal uv values were slightly lower than the k uv in uv alone due to the uv absorbance by o3 and pds in uv o3 pds process moreover the contribution of so4 to ca abatement was always higher than that of oh on account of the low dissolved o3 concentrations during reactions range from tens to hundreds of Œºg l 1 which increased from 30 7 to 53 2 in the pds dosage range of 0 1 to 0 5 mm noteworthily the k cal oh also raised from 0 089 to 0 201 min 1 with increasing pds dosage from 0 1 to 0 5 mm which can be attributed to the promoted oh production via the electron transfer of so4 with oh and h2o k so 4 o h 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 k so 4 h 2 o 8 3 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 yu et al 2004 however the generated oh and so4 can also be scavenged by pds with rate constants of 1 4 107 and 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 resulting in the decrease of k obs at high pds dosage not well predicted by the model as shown in fig 2b the k obs of ca degradation was not significantly affected with the variation of solution ph as ph increased from 4 0 to 8 0 the k obs increased from 0 714 to 0 827 min 1 and the k cal tot also agreed well with the experimental results at ph 4 0 to 6 0 the contributions of oh and so4 to ca removal almost remained constant with k cal oh and k cal so 4 in the range of 0 180 0 187 and 0 412 0 419 min 1 respectively luo et al 2016 have reported that the formation of so4 from pds photolysis at 254 nm is not influenced by the change of ph due to the identical quantum efficiency of photo dissociation and molar absorption coefficient in addition ca mainly existed in the deprotonated form in the investigated ph range due to its low pka pka of ca 3 18 kong et al 2018 indicating the reaction rates of ca with oh and so4 were also slightly affected by ph with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the k cal oh raised from 0 187 to 0 242 min 1 along with the decline of k cal so 4 from 0 419 to 0 366 min 1 the enhanced generation of oh with increase of ph may be attributed to the much higher reaction rate of o3 with formed ho2 than that with h2o2 and the accelerated conversion of so4 into oh k o 3 h 2 o 2 0 01 m 1 s 1 k o 3 ho 2 5 5 106 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigne 1982 sein et al 2007 however the scavenging effect of hpo4 2 towards so4 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 is two orders of magnitude stronger than h2po4 k 7 2 104 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 which leads to the decreasing trend of so4 at high ph 3 3 effect of water matrices 3 3 1 nom the presence of nom obviously retarded the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process fig 3 a as nom concentration increased from 0 to 10 mgc l 1 the k obs decreased from 0 785 to 0 255 min 1 specifically the k cal uv k cal oh and k cal so 4 decreased by 66 1 99 3 and 84 8 in the presence of 10 mgc l 1 nom respectively nom can quench oh and so4 with rate constants of 1 4 104 and 6 8 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively lutze et al 2015a additionally nom can exert as an inner filter of uv light to reduce the formation of oh and so4 from photolysis of o3 and pds Œµ nom 254nm 0 028 l mgc 1 cm 1 determined in this study fang et al 2014 wu et al 2019b as illustrated in fig 3a the k cal tot with no filter effect deviated more significantly from k cal tot than that with no scavenging effect demonstrating the scavenging effect of nom may be less important in uv o3 pds process it was noted that the k cal tot values were all lower than the experimental values especially for high dosage of nom 10 mgc l 1 which can be attributed to the rate constants for nom used in this study furthermore o3 can directly react with specific electron rich moieties in nom e g phenols and amines to produce oh buffle and von gunten 2006 lee et al 2013 additionally the formation of photo oxidants from nom photosensitization under uv irradiation e g excited triplet state of nom and singlet oxygen may also contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants lester et al 2013 gao et al 2019 3 3 2 bicarbonate as depicted in fig 3b the k obs slightly declined from 0 785 to 0 627 min 1 with the increase of hco3 concentration from 0 to 5 mm also the k cal oh and k cal so 4 decreased from 0 187 to 0 053 min 1 and 0 419 to 0 383 min 1 respectively hco3 can scavenge oh and so4 to form co3 with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively zuo et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 it should be noted that both h2co3 and hco3 are the dominant carbonate species at ph 6 pka1 6 3 pka2 10 3 and so4 is assumed to react with h2co3 with similar rate constant to that with hco3 due to the unavailable rate constant of so4 with h2co3 table s1 fang et al 2014 luo et al 2016 according to the simulation results the steady state concentration of co3 was even higher than oh table s2 nevertheless the contribution of co3 to ca abatement was insignificant due to its low reaction rate with ca kong et al 2018 3 3 3 chloride the presence of cl also exhibited slightly inhibitory effect on the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process fig 3c with the increase of cl from 0 to 10 mm the k obs decreased from 0 785 to 0 625 min 1 interestingly the k cal oh sharply raised from 0 187 to 0 432 min 1 with the introduction of 3 mm cl along with the distinct decrease of k cal so 4 from 0 419 to 0 025 min 1 the contributions of oh and so4 almost stayed unchanged with further increase of cl lutze et al 2015b have pointed out that so4 can substantially transform into oh in the presence of cl at ph 5 0 eqs 3 5 although oh also reacts quickly with cl eqs 5 reverse this reaction is inhibited by the extremely fast forward reaction and the formation of cl from oxidation of cl by oh is only significant at a ph below 3 0 eqs 6 von gunten 2003b yang et al 2014 generally several reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and clo can be formed from the reactions of cl with oh and so4 and the simulated steady state concentrations are presented in table s2 the rate constants of ca with cl and cl2 were reported to be 5 5 109 and 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction of ca with clo was assumed to be ignorable kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 the cl achieved the highest contribution to ca removal at 1 mm cl dosage 0 7 but declined with the increase of cl whereas the contribution of cl2 increased from 0 to 3 2 in the cl dosage from 0 to 10 mm which was mainly ascribed to the enhanced transformation of cl into cl2 eqs 7 yu and barker 2003 li et al 2018 3 so 4 c l

kinetic model validation to further corroborate the reliability of the kinetic model other eight micropollutants with different degradation patterns by o3 and uv were also investigated in uv o3 pds process including diclofenac sulfamethoxazole naproxen o3 uv reactive bisphenol a carbamazepine o3 reactive uv resistant atrazine iopamidol o3 resistant uv reactive and ibuprofen o3 uv resistant lee et al 2016 the kinetic and optical parameters of the selected micropollutants are provided in table s3 for o3 reactive contaminants i e k o 3 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 the dissolved o3 during reactions was below the detection limit and cinnamic acid was employed as a chemical probe for o3 exposure estimation which selectively reacts with o3 to form benzaldehyde via the criegee mechanism in 1 1 stoichiometry text s5 yang et al 2016b as shown in fig 4 the predicted k obs of six compounds were basically consistent with the experimental decay rates however the calculated k obs of diclofenac and bisphenol a were significantly higher than the measured values data not shown for o3 reactive micropollutants the contributions of o3 molecule were 34 6 82 7 and oh contributions were all below 10 0 because of the much lower concentrations of formed oh 10 14 m than aqueous o3 10 8 m under this experimental condition the uv photolysis contributed 7 9 and 10 4 to naproxen and sulfamethoxazole degradation respectively but only 0 2 to carbamazepine for o3 resistant micropollutants the o3 contributions were below 1 5 and the contributions of uv and oh were in the range of 9 2 30 5 and 29 3 40 3 respectively furthermore the contributions of so4 were all above 40 0 except for sulfamethoxazole 5 4 and carbamazepine 24 7 which could be attributed to the reduced pds photolysis resulting from the high molar absorption coefficient of sulfamethoxazole and the relatively low rate constant between carbamazepine and so4 table s3 considering the error introduced by o3 concentration estimation this kinetic model may be more suitable for the elimination prediction of o3 refractory micropollutants 3 5 theoretical thermodynamics for the oxidation of ca the oxidation of ca by oh and so4 via three pathways radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom transfer hat and single electron transfer set was theoretically investigated at smd m06 2x 6 311 g b3lyp 6 31g level figs 5 and s4 the detailed thermodynamic results e g enthalpy change Œ¥ h r gibbs free energy change Œ¥ g r and gibbs free energy of activation Œ¥ g are tabulated in table s4 for raf pathways each site was thermodynamically favorable Œ¥ g r 0 and exothermic Œ¥ h r 0 for oh oxidation with Œ¥ g r and Œ¥ h r in the range of 32 00 to 6 86 kcal mol 1 and 40 13 to 16 69 kcal mol 1 respectively however the addition routes may only happen at c7 c8 and c9 sites for so4 which could be attributed to the loss of aromaticity and the steric hindrance effect of o c ch3 2 cooh group for so4 has a larger molecular size than oh yang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 it should be noted that spontaneous dechlorination occurred during the optimization of the addition products on c8 site resulting in the lower Œ¥ g r and Œ¥ h r for hat pathways both oh and so4 could abstract the h atom on methyl groups h15 and h24 while the h transfer on carboxyl h25 was thermodynamically unfavorable primarily due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the o h bond in carboxyl 110 112 kcal mol 1 mendes et al 2014 the Œ¥ g r of set were 15 98 and 3 90 kcal mol 1 for oh and so4 respectively manifesting such reaction pathway was only spontaneous for so4 furthermore the Œ¥ g for oh and so4 reactions ranged from 7 86 to 16 02 kcal mol 1 and 3 81 to 12 06 kcal mol 1 respectively owing to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups fig s5 the Œ¥ g of oh addition onto c6 site was obviously lower than other reaction channels demonstrating raf as the dominant reaction pathway for oh xiao et al 2014 additionally the Œ¥ g for so4 obtained the lowest value at set route which was consistent with the previous reports that so4 tends to react with organic compound via an electron transfer pathway neta et al 1988 luo et al 2017 3 6 transformation mechanisms and proposed pathways of ca to further clarify the molecular susceptibility of ca to o3 and radicals at atomic level the condensed fukui function f and dual descriptor Œ¥f based on hirshfeld charge were calculated by multiwfn software and the detailed descriptions and results are provided in text s6 and table s5 parr and yang 1984 yang and mortier 1986 lu and chen 2012 as depicted in fig 6 a cl11 c8 c5 and o4 hold the most negative values of Œ¥f suggesting the most favorable sites for o3 attack due to the intrinsic electrophilic characteristic of o3 red area refers to negative value of Œ¥f whereas blue area refers to positive value in addition aromatic ring and cl11 were demonstrated to be the most vulnerable sites to radical attack fig 6b blue area refers to higher value of f 0 and red area refers to lower value which was consistent with the location of highest occupied molecular orbital homo fig s6 it is worth noting that although chlorine substituent cl is an electron withdrawer the isopropoxy o c ch3 2 is an electron donating group luo et al 2017 meanwhile both isopropoxy and chlorine substituents are ortho para directors implying that isopropoxy can increase the electron density on the ring carbons ortho and para to it while chlorine substituent primarily decreases the electron density meta to it which may account for the relatively high reactivity of c5 and c8 sites the main transformation products tps of ca during uv o3 pds treatment were identified by uplc q tof ms and the detailed information and ms spectra are provided in table s6 and fig s7 as shown in fig 6c dechlorination hydroxylation demethylation and decarboxylation were the dominant transformation mechanisms for the abatement of ca in uv o3 pds process initially the cleavage of cl11 c8 bond and subsequent reactions with hydronium ions and hydrated electrons formed the dechlorinated product tp 1 chen et al 2017 the formation of tp 2 may result from c8 addition of oh followed by oxygen mediated elimination of h or electron abstraction by so4 followed by water trapping of radical cation at c8 site song et al 2012 an et al 2014 in addition the release of singlet oxygen from o3 adduct on c8 site and subsequent h transfer also contributed to the hydroxylated product tp 2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the h abstraction on methyl groups of tp 2 by oh so4 could produce a carbon center radical which was oxidized by o2 to yield a peroxy radical and converted to the demethylated tp 3a eventually khan et al 2014 the dissociation of c cooh bond by uv photolysis may be responsible for the decarboxylation reaction which was also commonly observed in the photodegradation of naproxen and ibuprofen marotta et al 2013 luo et al 2018a luo et al 2018b wu et al 2019b hydroxylation of the decarboxylated intermediate of tp 3a resulted in the generation of tp 4 ultimately the attack of o3 and oh so4 on c5 o4 sites leaded to the formation of tp 9 similar transformation mechanisms can also be employed to explain the production of tp 3b tp 5 tp 6 tp 7 and tp 8 during the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process noteworthily the oh addition product of ca was not experimentally detected whereas it s transformation products such as tps 10 12 were observed in this study in addition the transformation products of ca were also detected in the uv o3 and uv pds processes and the detailed comparison and results are provided in text s7 and fig s8 3 7 energy consumption and bromate formation the electrical energy per order ee o was used to calculate the energy requirement for the degradation of ca in different processes text s8 as depicted in fig s9 the ee o in various systems followed the order o3 pds uv pds uv o3 pds uv alone uv o3 o3 alone since the reactivity between o3 and pds was low while pds was expensive o3 pds was demonstrated to be the most energy intensive technique for ca abatement compared to uv pds the introduction of o3 accelerated the generation of oh and so4 which offset the energy demand of o3 and leaded to lower ee o of uv o3 pds however uv o3 pds process was less cost effective than uv o3 primarily due to the inhibited oh formation and the high price of pds it should be noted that although the energy consumption of uv alone and o3 alone were lower they may not be efficient enough to achieve a satisfactory removal of recalcitrant micropollutants bromate formation was typically an important issue during ozonation treatment the formation of bromate in o3 alone uv o3 and uv o3 pds processes were also examined in this study and the results are illustrated in fig s10 for o3 alone the formed bromate reached 2 93 Œºm after 15 min reaction however the bromate generation was negligible during uv o3 process which could be explained by the low aqueous o3 concentrations under uv irradiation and the uv photolysis of produced hobr obr and bro3 zhang et al 2010 interestingly the bromate formation in uv o3 pds process was higher than that in uv o3 process and reached 1 03 Œºm after 15 min even though the dissolved o3 was also significantly lower than o3 alone it was reported that br could also be oxidized by so4 and converted into bro3 eventually with the involvement of hobr obr as reaction intermediates fang and shang 2012 therefore instead of o3 molecule reactive radicals e g oh and so4 may dominate the formation of bromate in uv o3 pds process 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the integrated uv o3 pds process was of pronounced treatment capability especially for o3 or uv refractory micropollutants and had a high resistance to the influence of ph bicarbonate chloride and the scavenging effect of nom the kinetic model proposed in this study may benefit the prediction of the abatement efficiency of structurally diverse micropollutants during water treatment consisting of o3 and or uv pds scenarios quantum chemical calculations were successfully applied to investigate the oxidation mechanisms and transformation pathways of ca however it is still necessary to assess the performance of uv o3 pds process and modify the kinetic model in real wastewater or drinking water matrix with regard to the impact of matrix components formation of oxidation byproducts and potential toxicological effects the theoretically proposed mechanisms need to be further verified provided that thermodynamic results for the corresponding reaction pathway can be obtained experimentally in addition the combination of computer based tools with advanced analytical methods should be further employed to improve the understanding of oxidation mechanisms and prediction of products distribution declaration

17543,the feasibility of integrated uv ozone o3 peroxydisulfate pds process for abatement of clofibric acid ca was systematically explored in this study with focus on the kinetic simulation and oxidation mechanisms the results indicated the uv o3 pds process was of prominent treatment capability with pseudo first order rate constant of ca degradation increased by 65 9 and 86 0 compared to uv o3 and uv pds processes respectively a chemical kinetic model was developed and successfully employed to predict ca elimination as well as the specific contributions of uv hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 under different pds dosage ph natural organic matters bicarbonate and chloride conditions in uv o3 pds process according to quantum chemical calculation radical addition on ortho site of isopropoxy substituent and single electron transfer were corroborated to be the dominant reaction channels for the oxidation of ca by oh and so4 respectively additionally the reactive sites and transformation pathways of ca were proposed via fukui function calculation and uplc q tof ms analysis moreover the performance of uv o3 pds process was further evaluated with regard to the energy demand and bromate formation this study first proposed a kinetic model in uv o3 pds process and elucidated the regioselectivity and products distribution of ca during oxidative treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv ozone peroxydisulfate kinetic modeling quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction the emergence of diverse micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aquatic ecosystem has raised considerable concern owing to the potential risk of triggering adverse ecological and health effects to wildlife and humans schwarzenbach et al 2006 richardson and ternes 2014 clofibric acid ca as the active metabolite of lipid regulators e g clofibrate and etofibrate exhibited high persistence in water systems and was frequently detected at concentrations of 0 03 to 0 55 Œºg l 1 buser et al 1998 isidori et al 2007 however traditional biological treatment processes can only achieve limited removal of ca due to its stable chemical structure sui et al 2011 hence development of appropriate technology to mitigate such micropollutants has become an imperative issue for water resources protection and potable reuse ozonation has been extensively studied for efficient abatement of a large number of organic micropollutants via the direct oxidation by ozone o3 molecule and indirect oxidation by generated hydroxyl radical oh from o3 decomposition von gunten 2003a huber et al 2005 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 von gunten 2018 recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have gained substantial scientific interests and the uv photolysis of peroxydisulfate pds i e uv pds was demonstrated to be an effective option to produce so4 by the homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 yang et al 2019 typically so4 as a strong one electron oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v has an extremely high reactivity towards a wide range of organic compounds which is comparable with that of oh buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 in addition so4 tends to react with organic substances through the one electron transfer mechanism rather than h abstraction and addition processes and is less impacted by water matrix components such as natural organic matters nom and alkalinity indicating that so4 oxidation may complement oh based aops with diverse compound reactivities products patterns and energy efficiencies neta et al 1988 lutze et al 2015a to address the limited treatment capability of single aop for water quality improvement the combined aops can be employed to expedite the decontamination of refractory compounds it was reported that the combination of o3 or o3 h2o2 with uv h2o2 could achieve significant mitigation of micropollutants with decrease of energy consumption and minimization of oxidation byproducts formation lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 lee et al 2016 additionally uv pds can potentially have a higher efficiency and a lower energy footprint than uv h2o2 owing to the higher quantum yield of pds than h2o2 0 7 versus 0 5 and the less dependence on operational parameters luo et al 2015 li et al 2018 however the integration of ozonation with uv pds process for water purification has rarely been investigated which may also be an appealing alternative due to the simultaneous generation of oh and so4 the structural diversity of micropollutants in varying water matrices makes it cost prohibitive and time consuming to measure their mitigation efficiencies and poses a challenge for generalized design of advanced water treatment processes lee at al 2013 have reported that a chemical kinetic model can be applied to predict the degradation efficiencies of micropollutants during ozonation by use of kinetic and water specific information in addition several other studies have proposed and tested the simplified kinetic models based on steady state approximation in uv pds process luo et al 2015 luo et al 2016 lian et al 2017 however a comprehensive kinetic model to estimate the abatement of contaminants and investigate the distribution of various reactive radicals has never been reported in the integrated uv o3 pds process furthermore it still remains challenging to clarify the mechanistic aspects of ca attenuation during oxidative treatment especially in relation to the contribution of each reaction pathway due to the restriction of analytical methods quantum chemical calculation is proven to be a powerful tool for theoretical investigations on bimolecular reactions and can provide a supplement or even an alternative to experimental studies for understanding of oxidation mechanisms of organic compounds in aops an et al 2014 gao et al 2014 tentscher et al 2019 the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the performance of uv o3 pds process for the elimination of ca 2 develop a comprehensive kinetic model to predict the abatement of ca in uv o3 pds process 3 explore the theoretical oxidation mechanisms and propose the plausible degradation pathways of ca in uv o3 pds process and 4 assess the energy demand and bromate formation potential of uv o3 pds process 2 materials and

cylindrical batch reactor fig s1 pds with predetermined concentration was added into the experimental solution spiked with ca at desirable concentration before initiating the reaction it should be

explore the reaction pathways of ca with oh and so4 based on density functional theory all geometries were optimized without symmetry constraints at b3lyp 6 31g level by gaussian 09 program becke 1993 frisch et al 2009 vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level of geometry optimization to characterize the nature of stationary points with no imaginary frequency for reactants and products and only one imaginary frequency for transition state ts species intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to verify that the ts species connected the correct reactants and products on potential energy surfaces single point energies of optimized structures were calculated at m06 2x 6 311 g level with the solvation model based on density smd implicit solvation model zhao and truhlar 2008 marenich et al 2009 noteworthily the activation barrier Œ¥ g set of single electron transfer reaction is calculated by marcus theory eqs 1 and 2 gao et al 2014 luo et al 2017 1 Œ¥ g

charge and spin multiplicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of ca abatement in various systems the degradation of ca was evaluated and compared in different systems including pds alone uv alone o3 alone o3 pds uv o3 uv pds and uv o3 pds as shown in fig 1 a the direct oxidation of ca by pds was negligible in addition no obvious enhancement of ca removal was observed in o3 pds process compared to o3 alone which was consistent with the previous study that o3 almost does not directly react with pds yang et al 2015 the uv pds and uv o3 could abate 34 7 and 36 5 Œºm of ca after 3 min while only 27 1 and 21 4 Œºm of ca was degraded in uv alone and o3 alone respectively importantly the degradation of ca was obviously expedited by uv o3 pds treatment with the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of 0 785 min 1 which was increased by 1 9 and 1 7 times compared to uv pds 0 422 min 1 and uv o3 0 473 min 1 respectively the results demonstrate that the uv o3 pds process is of pronounced treatment capability and may serve as a potential alternative for efficient abatement of refractory contaminants it is expected that both oh and so4 can be generated in uv o3 pds process which was corroborated by the epr experiments fig s2 zou et al 2013 wu et al 2019a to quantitatively elucidate the roles of oh and so4 nitrobenzene nb was used as a oh probe compound which reacts rapidly with oh but resists to the oxidation by o3 and so4 k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k o 3 nb 0 09 m 1 s 1 k so 4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the second order rate constants for the reactions of ca with o3 oh and so4 were determined to be 9 5 2 8 109 and 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively text s3 and fig s3 the contribution of molecular o3 to ca removal was confirmed to be negligible 1 0 in uv o3 pds process via the determination of o3 exposure and the detailed calculation of the relative contributions of oh and so4 are provided in text s4 guo et al 2017 wu et al 2019b as displayed in fig 1b the specific degradation rates of ca by uv k uv oh k oh and so4 k so 4 in uv o3 pds process were calculated to be 0 232 0 178 and 0 375 min 1 respectively compared to uv o3 process the k oh decreased from 0 241 to 0 178 min 1 which could be explained by the competition of pds with o3 for uv light absorbance and the scavenging effect of pds towards oh k oh pds 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 11 interestingly the k so 4 in uv o3 pds process was higher than that in uv pds process contribution of oh in uv pds was insignificant data not shown indicating that the presence of o3 may enhance the formation of so4 under uv irradiation via the electron transfer from oh and other reactive radicals abu amr et al 2013 yang et al 2016a 3 2 effect of pds dosage and ph fig 2 a displays the k obs of ca degradation at different pds dosages in uv o3 pds process the k obs increased from 0 521 to 0 785 min 1 with the increase of pds dosage from 0 1 to 0 4 mm which decreased to 0 716 min 1 as pds further increased to 0 5 mm based on kintecus simulation the modeling results of k obs k cal tot of ca removal and the specific rates of uv k cal uv oh k cal oh and so4 k cal so 4 in uv o3 pds process are also provided in fig 2a it was observed that the k cal tot values were basically consistent with the experimental values and the simulated steady state concentrations of oh and so4 at 0 4 mm pds dosage were also in agreement with the determined results by using nb as a probe compound table s2 the k cal uv values were slightly lower than the k uv in uv alone due to the uv absorbance by o3 and pds in uv o3 pds process moreover the contribution of so4 to ca abatement was always higher than that of oh on account of the low dissolved o3 concentrations during reactions range from tens to hundreds of Œºg l 1 which increased from 30 7 to 53 2 in the pds dosage range of 0 1 to 0 5 mm noteworthily the k cal oh also raised from 0 089 to 0 201 min 1 with increasing pds dosage from 0 1 to 0 5 mm which can be attributed to the promoted oh production via the electron transfer of so4 with oh and h2o k so 4 o h 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 k so 4 h 2 o 8 3 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 yu et al 2004 however the generated oh and so4 can also be scavenged by pds with rate constants of 1 4 107 and 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 resulting in the decrease of k obs at high pds dosage not well predicted by the model as shown in fig 2b the k obs of ca degradation was not significantly affected with the variation of solution ph as ph increased from 4 0 to 8 0 the k obs increased from 0 714 to 0 827 min 1 and the k cal tot also agreed well with the experimental results at ph 4 0 to 6 0 the contributions of oh and so4 to ca removal almost remained constant with k cal oh and k cal so 4 in the range of 0 180 0 187 and 0 412 0 419 min 1 respectively luo et al 2016 have reported that the formation of so4 from pds photolysis at 254 nm is not influenced by the change of ph due to the identical quantum efficiency of photo dissociation and molar absorption coefficient in addition ca mainly existed in the deprotonated form in the investigated ph range due to its low pka pka of ca 3 18 kong et al 2018 indicating the reaction rates of ca with oh and so4 were also slightly affected by ph with the increase of ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the k cal oh raised from 0 187 to 0 242 min 1 along with the decline of k cal so 4 from 0 419 to 0 366 min 1 the enhanced generation of oh with increase of ph may be attributed to the much higher reaction rate of o3 with formed ho2 than that with h2o2 and the accelerated conversion of so4 into oh k o 3 h 2 o 2 0 01 m 1 s 1 k o 3 ho 2 5 5 106 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigne 1982 sein et al 2007 however the scavenging effect of hpo4 2 towards so4 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 is two orders of magnitude stronger than h2po4 k 7 2 104 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 which leads to the decreasing trend of so4 at high ph 3 3 effect of water matrices 3 3 1 nom the presence of nom obviously retarded the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process fig 3 a as nom concentration increased from 0 to 10 mgc l 1 the k obs decreased from 0 785 to 0 255 min 1 specifically the k cal uv k cal oh and k cal so 4 decreased by 66 1 99 3 and 84 8 in the presence of 10 mgc l 1 nom respectively nom can quench oh and so4 with rate constants of 1 4 104 and 6 8 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively lutze et al 2015a additionally nom can exert as an inner filter of uv light to reduce the formation of oh and so4 from photolysis of o3 and pds Œµ nom 254nm 0 028 l mgc 1 cm 1 determined in this study fang et al 2014 wu et al 2019b as illustrated in fig 3a the k cal tot with no filter effect deviated more significantly from k cal tot than that with no scavenging effect demonstrating the scavenging effect of nom may be less important in uv o3 pds process it was noted that the k cal tot values were all lower than the experimental values especially for high dosage of nom 10 mgc l 1 which can be attributed to the rate constants for nom used in this study furthermore o3 can directly react with specific electron rich moieties in nom e g phenols and amines to produce oh buffle and von gunten 2006 lee et al 2013 additionally the formation of photo oxidants from nom photosensitization under uv irradiation e g excited triplet state of nom and singlet oxygen may also contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants lester et al 2013 gao et al 2019 3 3 2 bicarbonate as depicted in fig 3b the k obs slightly declined from 0 785 to 0 627 min 1 with the increase of hco3 concentration from 0 to 5 mm also the k cal oh and k cal so 4 decreased from 0 187 to 0 053 min 1 and 0 419 to 0 383 min 1 respectively hco3 can scavenge oh and so4 to form co3 with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively zuo et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 it should be noted that both h2co3 and hco3 are the dominant carbonate species at ph 6 pka1 6 3 pka2 10 3 and so4 is assumed to react with h2co3 with similar rate constant to that with hco3 due to the unavailable rate constant of so4 with h2co3 table s1 fang et al 2014 luo et al 2016 according to the simulation results the steady state concentration of co3 was even higher than oh table s2 nevertheless the contribution of co3 to ca abatement was insignificant due to its low reaction rate with ca kong et al 2018 3 3 3 chloride the presence of cl also exhibited slightly inhibitory effect on the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process fig 3c with the increase of cl from 0 to 10 mm the k obs decreased from 0 785 to 0 625 min 1 interestingly the k cal oh sharply raised from 0 187 to 0 432 min 1 with the introduction of 3 mm cl along with the distinct decrease of k cal so 4 from 0 419 to 0 025 min 1 the contributions of oh and so4 almost stayed unchanged with further increase of cl lutze et al 2015b have pointed out that so4 can substantially transform into oh in the presence of cl at ph 5 0 eqs 3 5 although oh also reacts quickly with cl eqs 5 reverse this reaction is inhibited by the extremely fast forward reaction and the formation of cl from oxidation of cl by oh is only significant at a ph below 3 0 eqs 6 von gunten 2003b yang et al 2014 generally several reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and clo can be formed from the reactions of cl with oh and so4 and the simulated steady state concentrations are presented in table s2 the rate constants of ca with cl and cl2 were reported to be 5 5 109 and 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction of ca with clo was assumed to be ignorable kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 the cl achieved the highest contribution to ca removal at 1 mm cl dosage 0 7 but declined with the increase of cl whereas the contribution of cl2 increased from 0 to 3 2 in the cl dosage from 0 to 10 mm which was mainly ascribed to the enhanced transformation of cl into cl2 eqs 7 yu and barker 2003 li et al 2018 3 so 4 c l

kinetic model validation to further corroborate the reliability of the kinetic model other eight micropollutants with different degradation patterns by o3 and uv were also investigated in uv o3 pds process including diclofenac sulfamethoxazole naproxen o3 uv reactive bisphenol a carbamazepine o3 reactive uv resistant atrazine iopamidol o3 resistant uv reactive and ibuprofen o3 uv resistant lee et al 2016 the kinetic and optical parameters of the selected micropollutants are provided in table s3 for o3 reactive contaminants i e k o 3 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 the dissolved o3 during reactions was below the detection limit and cinnamic acid was employed as a chemical probe for o3 exposure estimation which selectively reacts with o3 to form benzaldehyde via the criegee mechanism in 1 1 stoichiometry text s5 yang et al 2016b as shown in fig 4 the predicted k obs of six compounds were basically consistent with the experimental decay rates however the calculated k obs of diclofenac and bisphenol a were significantly higher than the measured values data not shown for o3 reactive micropollutants the contributions of o3 molecule were 34 6 82 7 and oh contributions were all below 10 0 because of the much lower concentrations of formed oh 10 14 m than aqueous o3 10 8 m under this experimental condition the uv photolysis contributed 7 9 and 10 4 to naproxen and sulfamethoxazole degradation respectively but only 0 2 to carbamazepine for o3 resistant micropollutants the o3 contributions were below 1 5 and the contributions of uv and oh were in the range of 9 2 30 5 and 29 3 40 3 respectively furthermore the contributions of so4 were all above 40 0 except for sulfamethoxazole 5 4 and carbamazepine 24 7 which could be attributed to the reduced pds photolysis resulting from the high molar absorption coefficient of sulfamethoxazole and the relatively low rate constant between carbamazepine and so4 table s3 considering the error introduced by o3 concentration estimation this kinetic model may be more suitable for the elimination prediction of o3 refractory micropollutants 3 5 theoretical thermodynamics for the oxidation of ca the oxidation of ca by oh and so4 via three pathways radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom transfer hat and single electron transfer set was theoretically investigated at smd m06 2x 6 311 g b3lyp 6 31g level figs 5 and s4 the detailed thermodynamic results e g enthalpy change Œ¥ h r gibbs free energy change Œ¥ g r and gibbs free energy of activation Œ¥ g are tabulated in table s4 for raf pathways each site was thermodynamically favorable Œ¥ g r 0 and exothermic Œ¥ h r 0 for oh oxidation with Œ¥ g r and Œ¥ h r in the range of 32 00 to 6 86 kcal mol 1 and 40 13 to 16 69 kcal mol 1 respectively however the addition routes may only happen at c7 c8 and c9 sites for so4 which could be attributed to the loss of aromaticity and the steric hindrance effect of o c ch3 2 cooh group for so4 has a larger molecular size than oh yang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 it should be noted that spontaneous dechlorination occurred during the optimization of the addition products on c8 site resulting in the lower Œ¥ g r and Œ¥ h r for hat pathways both oh and so4 could abstract the h atom on methyl groups h15 and h24 while the h transfer on carboxyl h25 was thermodynamically unfavorable primarily due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the o h bond in carboxyl 110 112 kcal mol 1 mendes et al 2014 the Œ¥ g r of set were 15 98 and 3 90 kcal mol 1 for oh and so4 respectively manifesting such reaction pathway was only spontaneous for so4 furthermore the Œ¥ g for oh and so4 reactions ranged from 7 86 to 16 02 kcal mol 1 and 3 81 to 12 06 kcal mol 1 respectively owing to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups fig s5 the Œ¥ g of oh addition onto c6 site was obviously lower than other reaction channels demonstrating raf as the dominant reaction pathway for oh xiao et al 2014 additionally the Œ¥ g for so4 obtained the lowest value at set route which was consistent with the previous reports that so4 tends to react with organic compound via an electron transfer pathway neta et al 1988 luo et al 2017 3 6 transformation mechanisms and proposed pathways of ca to further clarify the molecular susceptibility of ca to o3 and radicals at atomic level the condensed fukui function f and dual descriptor Œ¥f based on hirshfeld charge were calculated by multiwfn software and the detailed descriptions and results are provided in text s6 and table s5 parr and yang 1984 yang and mortier 1986 lu and chen 2012 as depicted in fig 6 a cl11 c8 c5 and o4 hold the most negative values of Œ¥f suggesting the most favorable sites for o3 attack due to the intrinsic electrophilic characteristic of o3 red area refers to negative value of Œ¥f whereas blue area refers to positive value in addition aromatic ring and cl11 were demonstrated to be the most vulnerable sites to radical attack fig 6b blue area refers to higher value of f 0 and red area refers to lower value which was consistent with the location of highest occupied molecular orbital homo fig s6 it is worth noting that although chlorine substituent cl is an electron withdrawer the isopropoxy o c ch3 2 is an electron donating group luo et al 2017 meanwhile both isopropoxy and chlorine substituents are ortho para directors implying that isopropoxy can increase the electron density on the ring carbons ortho and para to it while chlorine substituent primarily decreases the electron density meta to it which may account for the relatively high reactivity of c5 and c8 sites the main transformation products tps of ca during uv o3 pds treatment were identified by uplc q tof ms and the detailed information and ms spectra are provided in table s6 and fig s7 as shown in fig 6c dechlorination hydroxylation demethylation and decarboxylation were the dominant transformation mechanisms for the abatement of ca in uv o3 pds process initially the cleavage of cl11 c8 bond and subsequent reactions with hydronium ions and hydrated electrons formed the dechlorinated product tp 1 chen et al 2017 the formation of tp 2 may result from c8 addition of oh followed by oxygen mediated elimination of h or electron abstraction by so4 followed by water trapping of radical cation at c8 site song et al 2012 an et al 2014 in addition the release of singlet oxygen from o3 adduct on c8 site and subsequent h transfer also contributed to the hydroxylated product tp 2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the h abstraction on methyl groups of tp 2 by oh so4 could produce a carbon center radical which was oxidized by o2 to yield a peroxy radical and converted to the demethylated tp 3a eventually khan et al 2014 the dissociation of c cooh bond by uv photolysis may be responsible for the decarboxylation reaction which was also commonly observed in the photodegradation of naproxen and ibuprofen marotta et al 2013 luo et al 2018a luo et al 2018b wu et al 2019b hydroxylation of the decarboxylated intermediate of tp 3a resulted in the generation of tp 4 ultimately the attack of o3 and oh so4 on c5 o4 sites leaded to the formation of tp 9 similar transformation mechanisms can also be employed to explain the production of tp 3b tp 5 tp 6 tp 7 and tp 8 during the degradation of ca in uv o3 pds process noteworthily the oh addition product of ca was not experimentally detected whereas it s transformation products such as tps 10 12 were observed in this study in addition the transformation products of ca were also detected in the uv o3 and uv pds processes and the detailed comparison and results are provided in text s7 and fig s8 3 7 energy consumption and bromate formation the electrical energy per order ee o was used to calculate the energy requirement for the degradation of ca in different processes text s8 as depicted in fig s9 the ee o in various systems followed the order o3 pds uv pds uv o3 pds uv alone uv o3 o3 alone since the reactivity between o3 and pds was low while pds was expensive o3 pds was demonstrated to be the most energy intensive technique for ca abatement compared to uv pds the introduction of o3 accelerated the generation of oh and so4 which offset the energy demand of o3 and leaded to lower ee o of uv o3 pds however uv o3 pds process was less cost effective than uv o3 primarily due to the inhibited oh formation and the high price of pds it should be noted that although the energy consumption of uv alone and o3 alone were lower they may not be efficient enough to achieve a satisfactory removal of recalcitrant micropollutants bromate formation was typically an important issue during ozonation treatment the formation of bromate in o3 alone uv o3 and uv o3 pds processes were also examined in this study and the results are illustrated in fig s10 for o3 alone the formed bromate reached 2 93 Œºm after 15 min reaction however the bromate generation was negligible during uv o3 process which could be explained by the low aqueous o3 concentrations under uv irradiation and the uv photolysis of produced hobr obr and bro3 zhang et al 2010 interestingly the bromate formation in uv o3 pds process was higher than that in uv o3 process and reached 1 03 Œºm after 15 min even though the dissolved o3 was also significantly lower than o3 alone it was reported that br could also be oxidized by so4 and converted into bro3 eventually with the involvement of hobr obr as reaction intermediates fang and shang 2012 therefore instead of o3 molecule reactive radicals e g oh and so4 may dominate the formation of bromate in uv o3 pds process 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the integrated uv o3 pds process was of pronounced treatment capability especially for o3 or uv refractory micropollutants and had a high resistance to the influence of ph bicarbonate chloride and the scavenging effect of nom the kinetic model proposed in this study may benefit the prediction of the abatement efficiency of structurally diverse micropollutants during water treatment consisting of o3 and or uv pds scenarios quantum chemical calculations were successfully applied to investigate the oxidation mechanisms and transformation pathways of ca however it is still necessary to assess the performance of uv o3 pds process and modify the kinetic model in real wastewater or drinking water matrix with regard to the impact of matrix components formation of oxidation byproducts and potential toxicological effects the theoretically proposed mechanisms need to be further verified provided that thermodynamic results for the corresponding reaction pathway can be obtained experimentally in addition the combination of computer based tools with advanced analytical methods should be further employed to improve the understanding of oxidation mechanisms and prediction of products distribution declaration

17544,surface water quality management requires foresighted decision making regarding long term investments it should consider multiple objectives e g related to different pollutants and costs integrate multiple sources of pollution point and diffuse sources and external conditions that change over time climate population and land use changes multi attribute value theory can support such decisions especially the development of an assessment method integrated surface water quality assessment methods including micropollutants are currently lacking or in development in many countries important steps for the development of such an immission oriented and integrated surface water quality assessment method are discussed in this paper and exemplified for organic micropollutants the proposed assessment method goes beyond simple pass fail criteria for single substances it provides a continuous assessment on a scale from zero to one based on five color coded water quality classes and suggestions for the visualization of assessment results it takes into account the toxicity of the micropollutants and their mixture to aquatic organisms by comparing measured concentrations to environmental quality standards eqs the focus of this paper is on aggregation over multiple substances and time advantages and disadvantages of different aggregation methods are discussed as well as their implications for practice the consequences of different aggregation methods are illustrated with didactical examples and by an application of the proposed water quality assessment method to pesticide monitoring data from switzerland recommendations are provided that account for the purpose of the assessment furthermore the paper illustrates how the proposed method can facilitate dealing with uncertainty and a transparent communication of monitoring results to support water quality management decisions keywords uncertainty surface water quality integrated assessment multi criteria decision analysis river basin management micropollutants visualization 1 introduction micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals are increasingly recognized as a threat to freshwater ecosystems schwarzenbach et al 2006 and many countries set up monitoring programs for micropollutants in surface waters still so far integrated assessment methods are lacking that translate individual measurements into an overall assessment of the water quality state going beyond pass fail criteria of single substances and single monitoring samples this makes it difficult to assess the overall water quality and to follow spatial and temporal developments at various scales an integrated assessment of the water quality of surface waters has to cover different substances from nutrients to micropollutants and different sources of pollution diffuse and point sources schwarzenbach et al 2006 it has to account for the toxicity of different substances and their degradation products and for mixture toxicity drakvik et al 2020 it should consider exposure patterns since concentrations of many substances vary largely over time especially those from diffuse sources such as agriculture or sewer overflows furthermore the spatial variation of exposure within catchments depends on the position of point sources in the river network land use patterns in the catchment and the dilution in the river with increasing discharge in this paper a framework based on multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 eisenfuehr et al 2010 is introduced that is able to cover the different aspects and can deal with different sources of uncertainty it follows an immission oriented approach to assess the surface water quality in the receiving waters at the site and catchment or river basin scale it relies on environmental quality standards that are based on ecotoxicological hazard assessment and considers mixture toxicity such a procedure can hardly be comprehensive due to missing environmental quality standards for many substances and the challenge to quantify all substance concentrations therefore it would be advisable to complement the proposed method with effect based tools biotests and non target screening of contaminants brack et al 2017 however this goes beyond the scope of this paper potentially controversial steps for the development of such an assessment and critical decisions that have to be taken based on expert knowledge are introduced in the following the development of an integrated water quality assessment method based on multi attribute value theory can be divided into the following steps eisenfuehr et al 2010 1 objectives hierarchy the development of an objectives hierarchy facilitates a transparent and explicit formulation of all water quality aspects that should be assessed it provides a structure that helps linking the overall objective good water quality to more concrete sub objectives e g low concentrations of specific substances see fig 1 for an example the hierarchical structure supports the aggregation of multiple objectives into an overall objective eisenfuehr et al 2010 2 measurable attributes the lowest level sub objectives are linked to measurable attributes e g substance concentrations in the scope of water quality assessment the development of an objectives hierarchy has to consider the selection of substances that have to be monitored and assessed as well as their toxicity to aquatic organisms and mixture toxicity junghans et al 2013 spycher et al 2018 3 continuous value function common for the assessment of the ecological status of rivers in europe are the definition of water quality classes that allow a color coding of the assessment results and facilitate the communication of results high blue good green moderate yellow poor orange bad red according to the water framework directive european union 2000 the same classification is applied to the proposed water quality assessment method however to avoid discretization errors and to allow us to evaluate differences within a quality class a continuous assessment scale from 0 bad to 1 high is applied that describes the fulfilment of the objectives and can be discretized into the water quality classes at each level of the objectives hierarchy e g langhans et al 2013 following multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 we can construct such a value function for each objective at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy that directly depends on measurable attributes and is not restricted to any functional form 4 hierarchical aggregation to assess the fulfilment of objectives at higher levels of the objectives hierarchy the values of the corresponding lower level nodes have to be aggregated with an aggregation rule that reflects how the fulfilment of the higher level objective depends on the fulfilment of its sub objectives langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 in principle all functions from the family of so called quasi arithmetic means can be considered grabisch et al 2009 5 temporal aggregation exposure patterns of different substances vary largely over time and are affected by weather conditions which have to be accounted for by an appropriate monitoring design wittmer et al 2014 to assess the effects of management actions and to follow temporal trends different temporal time scales may be of interest for example to assess the seasonal development within one year one would be interested in the results at the resolution of the samples to compare different sites or different years it might be reasonable to aggregate over the samples within each year and site in principle the same aggregation functions can be used as for the hierarchical aggregation and the choice can be made based on a similar reasoning as described below 6 spatial aggregation exposure patterns vary not only in time but also in space the dendritic network structure of rivers the hydrological conditions and the location of point and non point sources lead to variations of exposure patterns in space water quality monitoring was traditionally often focused on the outlet of a catchment which allows a good overview about fluxes but does not provide information about concentrations within the network this can lead to the fact that an exceedance of toxic thresholds within the network is overlooked especially in headwater streams with a low dilution of pollutants whether or not a spatial aggregation is useful depends on the purpose of the assessment and the spatial resolution of the monitoring program it could be useful to quantify the water quality status of whole river basins or catchments for example in the scope of prioritizing management measures within the catchment to maximize the overall ecological state of the catchment since water quality monitoring is typically restricted to a few points within a river network this would usually require an inter and extrapolation of monitoring results to the whole network which should consider the location of point and non point sources of pollution one of the fundamental objectives of immission based surface water quality assessment is the quantification of the ecological status to protect the organisms inhabiting the ecosystems such as fish invertebrates and primary producers for those organisms the spatial arrangement of habitats matter and have to be considered to assess the ecological status of catchments as a whole as opposed to the assessment of specific reaches or sites since water quality is an important aspect of habitat quality the water quality assessment should ideally be integrated into an ecological assessment at the catchment scale kuemmerlen et al 2019 7 propagation of uncertainty different sources of uncertainty influence the water quality assessment from sampling chemical analytics environmental quality standards baudrot and charles 2019 to parameters of the value function including aggregation multi attribute value theory offers a transparent framework that allows us to propagate and assess these uncertainties to evaluate the robustness of the final assessments schuwirth et al 2012 scholten et al 2015 schuwirth et al 2018 8 communication of results communication of risks is an important step towards more comprehensive risk assessment topping et al 2020 monitoring and assessment usually serves multiple purposes and has to address different audiences it should inform experts by allowing detailed analyses with high temporal and spatial resolution to identify deficits and potential management actions and it should provide a synthesized overview to inform policy makers stakeholders or the public and to support the planning of management actions in other sectors such as morphological river restoration therefore it is important to provide visualizations and numerical results at different levels of the objectives hierarchy and at different temporal and spatial scales reichert et al 2013 schuwirth et al 2018 the focus of this paper is on the aggregation over multiple pollutants and time a comprehensive coverage of spatial aggregation goes beyond the scope of this paper because it requires the inter extrapolation of the attributes to the whole river network and consideration of additional ecological criteria the paper provides recommendations on how to deal with these challenges by discussing each step in detail section 2 and an illustration of the proposed methods with existing pesticide monitoring data from switzerland section 3 the aim of this paper is to support the development of integrative assessment methods for the water quality of surface waters 2 methods i use multi attribute value theory to formulate an integrated water quality assessment method following the eight steps introduced above dyer and sarin 1979 based on insights from discussions with a working group in switzerland that aims for the development of a water quality assessment method with different stakeholders from cantonal and federal authorities objectives for water quality assessment include no ecotoxicological risk for different groups of aquatic organisms from single substances and from the mixture of substances acute and chronic effects should be considered the hierarchical structure regarding these objectives should be chosen in order to facilitate the synthesis and communication of the results and support management the objectives hierarchy should be comprehensive and sub objectives that are not in the same branch should be complementary on the other hand the hierarchy should be as concise as possible to facilitate the communication of results marttunen et al 2019 different structures are possible and should be discussed with stakeholders that are going to use the assessment method one possible hierarchical structure breaks down the overall objective of good water quality into different modules that group the pollutants according to the sampling and measurement strategy e g nutrients organic micropollutants heavy metals and metalloids this ensures that the results of a measurement campaign can be presented together other structures are possible for example to further sub divide substance groups or to distinguish different sources of pollution however since many substances can have various sources the latter is more difficult to implement for organic micropollutants we can distinguish chronic and acute toxicity single substances and mixture toxicity fig 1 in addition to the ecotoxicological risk assessment it might be advisable to include objectives that cover the environmental pollution with substances that are typically not of concern because of their toxicity but still do not belong in a natural environment lienert et al 2011 such as x ray contrast agents artificial sweeteners or repellents this could be implemented by an additional objective for the general prohibition of pollution by non natural substances the next step is to identify measurable attributes that allow us to measure the fulfilment of the lowest level sub objectives the selection of substances to be monitored and sampling strategies should reflect the objectives and are crucial aspects of the monitoring design behmel et al 2016 norman et al 2020 these aspects are not discussed here in all detail but they should be standardized to ensure the comparability of results within one monitoring program it would make only limited sense to aggregate data from different sampling strategies wittmer et al 2014 propose a concept for the sampling and assessment of organic micropollutants in switzerland suggesting biweekly composite samples to be compared with chronic environmental quality standards this design takes into account that micropollutants from non point sources such as agricultural pesticides have seasonal exposure patterns that vary with application times and depend on weather conditions a yearly averaging would lead to a strong dilution of the concentration of these substances which would not be representative for the exposure situation of stream organisms ecotoxicological tests to assess the chronic toxicity usually have a duration between 72h and several weeks a biweekly sampling strategy therefore roughly corresponds to the duration of the chronic toxicity tests wittmer et al 2014 this complies with the new swiss waters protection ordinance 1 1 https www bafu admin ch bafu de home themen wasser mitteilungen msg id 78122 html available in german french and italian for the assessment of acute effects 24 96h composite samples would be ideal we can then use the concept of risk quotients where the measured concentrations in the water samples are divided by the environmental quality standard mixture toxicity can be assessed according to junghans et al 2013 where the risk quotient of substances that affect the same organism group are summed up spycher et al 2018 as additional information an assessment of the toxicity of single substances can be provided to support the identification of the sources of pollution and potential management measures for this the highest risk quotient of the single substances for each organism group can be used the following class boundaries were suggested to link the risk quotient of single substances or mixtures to five color coded water quality classes wittmer et al 2014 high blue rq 0 1 good green rq 1 moderate yellow rq 2 poor orange rq 10 bad red rq 10 a straightforward way to derive a continuous value function from discrete water quality classes is to assume equally spaced intervals at the value scale and apply linear piecewise interpolation between class boundaries e g fig 2 but any other functional form is possible that best reflects how the fulfilment of the objective depends on the attribute level here the class boundary between the moderate and the good state is based on the legal requirements in this case the eqs valuei e risk quotient 1 such a continuous assessment and its translation into five color coded quality classes provides a graded system that can resolve differences between sites or temporal changes better than just a binary pass fail criterion currently applied for the assessment of chemical contamination in the european water framework directive brack et al 2017 most commonly used aggregation techniques for hierarchical and temporal aggregation are minimum aggregation i e worst case or one out all out and additive aggregation weighted arithmetic mean see table 1 for examples while minimum aggregation just takes the worst value of the sub objectives as the aggregated value the additive aggregation takes a weighted average across all sub objectives which means that it allows for full compensation between good and bad values many other less widely used aggregation techniques exist that provide a compromise between those extreme aggregation methods langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 see table 2 in the main text for examples and their mathematical equations to choose an appropriate aggregation function it is important to be aware about the properties that the aggregation functions should have in the scope of the assessment properties for aggregation techniques that seem rather undisputed in the scope of water quality assessment are 1 if the values of all sub objectives are the same the aggregated value is also the same idempotency 2 if the value of one of the sub objectives improves the aggregated value does not get worse and vice versa these two properties may seem rather obvious they are also mentioned as a precondition in mathematical aggregation theory and their application to sustainability assessment pollesch and dale 2015 still not all aggregation methods discussed in the literature fulfil them for example the multiplicative aggregation method introduced in multi criteria decision making keeney and raiffa 1976 does not fulfil the idempotency requirement 1 and even in the field of water quality assessment the aggregation methods proposed by swamee and tyagi 2000 2007 do not fulfil the idempotency requirement furthermore these two methods depend on the number of sub objectives to be aggregated which is another undesired property further desirable properties that were mentioned in discussions with stakeholders are 3 the aggregation technique is easy to understand and communicate 4 the aggregation technique is sensitive to changes and facilitates the detection of improvements and deteriorations in space or time e g across years i e if one of the sub objectives improves worsens the aggregated value also improves worsens 5 the aggregation technique helps to provide a differentiated picture i e it facilitates the ranking or grading of sites according to their overall water quality e g to identify hotspots of bad water quality and prioritize management actions 6 a if the value of one of the sub objectives is in the bad class the overall value shall not be in the good or high class or even more extreme b if one of the sub objectives is in the moderate poor or bad class the aggregated value shall not be in the good or high class 7 small changes in the fulfilment of sub objectives should lead to only small changes in the aggregated value this property is also called continuity pollesch and dale 2015 these desirable properties are partially conflicting especially the extreme version of property 6 b with properties 4 and 5 there exists no aggregation technique that fulfils all of them to the optimal degree the minimum aggregation fulfils property 3 and is the only of the proposed aggregation methods that fulfils the extreme version of property 6 b but it does not fulfil the properties 4 and 5 the additive aggregation fulfils property 3 and to some degree 4 but less so property 5 and not property 6 the additive minimum and geometric offset aggregation techniques fulfil properties 4 and 5 the fulfilment of property 6 can be adapted based on the choice of the parameter values but they do not fulfil its extreme version b to which degree they fulfil property 3 can be judged differently but to a lesser degree than minimum or additive aggregation in contrast to the aggregation methods mentioned in table 1 the weighted geometric mean does not fulfil property 7 because as soon as one of the sub objectives has a value of zero the aggregated value is zero therefore a small increase in one sub objective from zero to a small value above zero can lead to a large difference in the aggregated value especially if the other sub objectives have a value close to 1 to avoid this the geometric offset was introduced schuwirth et al 2018 which prevents this behaviour for Œ¥ values above 0 since all of these aggregation techniques fulfil the property 1 they lead to very similar results if all sub objectives have a similar value see example 3 in table 1 however they lead to very different results if some of the sub objectives have a very high and others a very low value see example 1 in table 1 the importance of the desirable properties can be controversial among stakeholders and depends on the purpose of the assessment langhans et al 2014 in cases where it is sufficient to know if the concentration of any of the substances was above a legal threshold at any time monitoring compliance with regulation the minimum aggregation is adequate in cases where a prioritization among sites is important when temporal changes should be assessed trend monitoring or when responses to management actions should be evaluated impact control the minimum aggregation is not adequate and the additive minimum or geometric offset aggregation technique is preferable see tables 1 and a1 in these cases the properties 4 and 5 are of particular importance haag et al 2019 provide a method to infer the aggregation method and their parameters from stakeholder interviews in addition or as an alternative the importance of the desirable properties can be discussed and the aggregation function chosen accordingly reichert et al 2019 the parameters can then be chosen based on the evaluation of didactical and real examples that illustrate the consequences of different aggregation functions see table 1 and fig 7 to account for the fact that the assessment of single substances can only be equal or better than the assessment of mixture toxicity we propose an aggregation function for the nodes no risk of chronic toxicity and no risk of acute toxicity that takes the same value as the nodes no risk of chronic mixture toxicity and no risk of acute mixture toxicity respectively this can be implemented by a minimum aggregation this means that the assessment of single substances does not affect the higher level objectives but it serves as additional information to evaluate if the risk is mainly due to single substances or due to a complex mixture of substances price and han 2011 to compare the results across time or space it is important that the number and timing of the samplings as well as the number and selection of substances to be analyzed are standardized within the monitoring program this poses a challenge for practice since the list of potentially relevant substances is long and varies over time as do analytical possibilities while the budget for monitoring is limited and not for all substances environmental quality standards are available ecotox centre 2020 therefore it should be foreseen to critically review the monitoring design in this regard from time to time and to adapt the assessment method when necessary propagation of uncertainty is technically straightforward using monte carlo simulations and can be implemented with any statistical computing language e g r development core team 2019 however it requires an estimate of the uncertainty of all inputs to the assessment procedure by the specification of probability distributions such as attribute levels here consisting of measured concentrations and environmental quality standards and aggregation parameters we can then draw a random sample from these probability distributions and propagate it through the assessment function to derive the uncertainty of the outcome to which degree this is worth pursuing depends on the scope of the assessment and may be controversial among users it is probably more relevant for the assessment of future scenarios of management actions based on modelled water quality variables schuwirth et al 2018 and when developing a new monitoring and assessment strategy than for the assessment of routine monitoring results uncertainty in the assessment is sometimes used as an argument for discrete rather than continuous assessments and to favour only two or three instead of five water quality classes however the uncertainty of a classification does not only depend on the uncertainty of the attribute level but also on the location of its expected value if the expected value of the attribute is close to a class boundary the uncertainty about the classification can be high even when the uncertainty about the attribute value is relatively small fig 3 grey colored distribution on the other hand the uncertainty about the classification can be rather low when the expected value is in the middle of a class even when the attribute has a rather high uncertainty fig 3 shaded distribution it is good scientific practice to round numbers of any measurement to provide only significant digits taking into account the precision of the measurement for symmetrically distributed values i e not skewed usually a mean standard deviation is provided in the examples of fig 3 this would be 5 0 0 8 and 10 0 0 1 for the shaded and the grey distribution respectively this implies that the last provided digit of the mean value is uncertain rounding to less than the number of significant digits introduces a discretization error and reduces the information content this should also be considered when discretizing the results to quality classes if we provide only two or three instead of five water quality classes we lose information which is important to detect changes but how much this reduces the uncertainty of the classification depends on whether the estimated values are close to a class boundary or not to judge the uncertainty of the classification a provision of the attribute value and its uncertainty e g standard deviation or quantile ranges would be ideal from this we can calculate the assessment at the continuous value scale between 0 and 1 as well as its uncertainty in addition to the estimated quality class this then also allows us to assess the uncertainty of the classification and to follow changes within one water quality class a distinction of five quality classes has proven useful e g for ecological assessments in the european water framework directive and in switzerland to synthesize numerical results e g to communicate with policymakers or the public and to distinguish and prioritize sites as mentioned above the communication and visualization of results has to be adapted to the purpose often water quality monitoring programs fulfil multiple purposes they should provide a representative spatial and temporal overview identify impaired sites and ideally support the identification of management actions for remediation this requires that the assessment method can provide results at each level of the objectives hierarchy to facilitate a synthesis of the results at a high level as well as providing detailed information at the lowest level examples for different visualizations for real monitoring data are provided in the next section the water quality assessment can be implemented with the r package utility version 1 4 5 reichert et al 2013 the r scripts to produce the assessment results are provided in the supporting information the proposed water quality assessment is illustrated for real monitoring data from a swiss federal monitoring program from the year 2012 moschet et al 2014 in this program biweekly time proportional composite samples were taken at five different sites in switzerland for illustration in this paper we use the biweekly samples for the assessment of chronic and acute effects it should be noted however that it would be recommended to use samples with a better temporal resolution e g composite samples from 24 96h for the assessment of acute effects because an averaging over longer periods usually leads to a dilution and therefore an underestimation of acute effects norman et al 2020 in this monitoring program 249 different polar organic compounds were analyzed that are sold as pesticides in switzerland and applied to agricultural or urban land in addition to 134 transformation products each of which could be quantified in the low ng l range in addition pharmaceuticals were analyzed however chronic and acute environmental quality standards were available for only 56 of the analyzed substances ecotox centre 2020 this means that the water quality status assessment only provides an upper bound and the actual water quality may be worse 3 illustration of results with real monitoring data assessment results for a single sample can be visualized with a color coded objectives hierarchy fig 4 in this example the highest risk exists for primary producers from chronic mixture toxicity which reaches a poor state orange colored box to compare different samples e g a time series from the same site a tabular visualization is more convenient figs 5 6 for this site single substances that pose the highest risks and exceed chronic eqs are diclofenac fish thiacloprid and diazinon invertebrates nicosulfurone and metolachlor primary producers similarly we could plot a table with the results for multiple sites the choice of the aggregation functions and their respective parameters for hierarchical aggregation strongly affect the assessment results of the higher level objectives this can be seen when comparing fig 5 with additive minimum aggregation and fig 6 with minimum aggregation for the same samples while the minimum aggregation clearly reflects the worst value of the sub objectives the additive minimum aggregation shows a better differentiation between samples in fig 7 we can compare four different aggregation functions for one sample in this example the minimum aggregation leads to a poor assessment of the main objective no organic pollution with a value of 0 39 in contrast the additive aggregation which allows for a full compensation between good and bad values of the sub objectives leads to a good assessment with a value 0 66 the additive minimum aggregation provides a compromise between both where the parameter Œ± can be adjusted to specify the desired level of compensation see table 2 in the main text to visualize the results of an uncertainty assessment or the temporal or spatial variability we can provide the 5 and 95 range of the assessment results as color coded boxes in the objectives hierarchy fig 8 similarly in a tabular visualization not shown 4 conclusions multi attribute value theory provides the methods to formulate a continuous multi attribute water quality assessment without any restrictions regarding its functional form e g aggregation functions or non linear dependence on attributes this can facilitate a the explicit formulation and structuring of objectives b the consideration of non linear relationships between measurable attributes and the water quality status c the identification of aggregation rules that best represent the dependence of the overall objective on sub objectives d visualization and communication of assessment results at all levels of the objectives hierarchy and at various temporal and spatial scales it should be noted that the assessment results strongly depend on the coverage of substances that are monitored and the availability of environmental quality standards for all substances it would therefore be advisable to complement the water quality assessment with effect based tools biotests and non target screening of contaminants especially for pesticides that have exposure patterns with a large temporal and spatial variability the temporal resolution and spatial coverage are crucial aspects of the monitoring design furthermore critical decisions about the hierarchical structure and aggregation methods have to be taken that have consequences for water quality management and policy making since the adequacy of aggregation methods depends on the purpose of the monitoring and assessment it seems reasonable to apply a different aggregation method for compliance monitoring than for the evaluation of temporal and spatial trends or management support for the identification of sites that do not comply with regulation a simple minimum aggregation over samplings and sub objectives is sufficient the identification of sources of impairment then does not rely on aggregated values but rather on the full time series of all single substances stakeholders that have this monitoring purpose in mind are therefore reluctant in accepting any aggregation method that allows for even partial compensation among sub objectives or samplings because they do not want a dilution of the results however when the scope of the assessment is to get an integrated view on the severity of water quality problems to identify temporal changes or detect a response to management actions an aggregation method that is sensitive to changes in all sub objectives is more adequate e g the minimum additive or geometric offset aggregation the visualization and communication of results has to be adapted to the monitoring purpose accordingly supporting information a zip file with

17544,surface water quality management requires foresighted decision making regarding long term investments it should consider multiple objectives e g related to different pollutants and costs integrate multiple sources of pollution point and diffuse sources and external conditions that change over time climate population and land use changes multi attribute value theory can support such decisions especially the development of an assessment method integrated surface water quality assessment methods including micropollutants are currently lacking or in development in many countries important steps for the development of such an immission oriented and integrated surface water quality assessment method are discussed in this paper and exemplified for organic micropollutants the proposed assessment method goes beyond simple pass fail criteria for single substances it provides a continuous assessment on a scale from zero to one based on five color coded water quality classes and suggestions for the visualization of assessment results it takes into account the toxicity of the micropollutants and their mixture to aquatic organisms by comparing measured concentrations to environmental quality standards eqs the focus of this paper is on aggregation over multiple substances and time advantages and disadvantages of different aggregation methods are discussed as well as their implications for practice the consequences of different aggregation methods are illustrated with didactical examples and by an application of the proposed water quality assessment method to pesticide monitoring data from switzerland recommendations are provided that account for the purpose of the assessment furthermore the paper illustrates how the proposed method can facilitate dealing with uncertainty and a transparent communication of monitoring results to support water quality management decisions keywords uncertainty surface water quality integrated assessment multi criteria decision analysis river basin management micropollutants visualization 1 introduction micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals are increasingly recognized as a threat to freshwater ecosystems schwarzenbach et al 2006 and many countries set up monitoring programs for micropollutants in surface waters still so far integrated assessment methods are lacking that translate individual measurements into an overall assessment of the water quality state going beyond pass fail criteria of single substances and single monitoring samples this makes it difficult to assess the overall water quality and to follow spatial and temporal developments at various scales an integrated assessment of the water quality of surface waters has to cover different substances from nutrients to micropollutants and different sources of pollution diffuse and point sources schwarzenbach et al 2006 it has to account for the toxicity of different substances and their degradation products and for mixture toxicity drakvik et al 2020 it should consider exposure patterns since concentrations of many substances vary largely over time especially those from diffuse sources such as agriculture or sewer overflows furthermore the spatial variation of exposure within catchments depends on the position of point sources in the river network land use patterns in the catchment and the dilution in the river with increasing discharge in this paper a framework based on multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 eisenfuehr et al 2010 is introduced that is able to cover the different aspects and can deal with different sources of uncertainty it follows an immission oriented approach to assess the surface water quality in the receiving waters at the site and catchment or river basin scale it relies on environmental quality standards that are based on ecotoxicological hazard assessment and considers mixture toxicity such a procedure can hardly be comprehensive due to missing environmental quality standards for many substances and the challenge to quantify all substance concentrations therefore it would be advisable to complement the proposed method with effect based tools biotests and non target screening of contaminants brack et al 2017 however this goes beyond the scope of this paper potentially controversial steps for the development of such an assessment and critical decisions that have to be taken based on expert knowledge are introduced in the following the development of an integrated water quality assessment method based on multi attribute value theory can be divided into the following steps eisenfuehr et al 2010 1 objectives hierarchy the development of an objectives hierarchy facilitates a transparent and explicit formulation of all water quality aspects that should be assessed it provides a structure that helps linking the overall objective good water quality to more concrete sub objectives e g low concentrations of specific substances see fig 1 for an example the hierarchical structure supports the aggregation of multiple objectives into an overall objective eisenfuehr et al 2010 2 measurable attributes the lowest level sub objectives are linked to measurable attributes e g substance concentrations in the scope of water quality assessment the development of an objectives hierarchy has to consider the selection of substances that have to be monitored and assessed as well as their toxicity to aquatic organisms and mixture toxicity junghans et al 2013 spycher et al 2018 3 continuous value function common for the assessment of the ecological status of rivers in europe are the definition of water quality classes that allow a color coding of the assessment results and facilitate the communication of results high blue good green moderate yellow poor orange bad red according to the water framework directive european union 2000 the same classification is applied to the proposed water quality assessment method however to avoid discretization errors and to allow us to evaluate differences within a quality class a continuous assessment scale from 0 bad to 1 high is applied that describes the fulfilment of the objectives and can be discretized into the water quality classes at each level of the objectives hierarchy e g langhans et al 2013 following multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 we can construct such a value function for each objective at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy that directly depends on measurable attributes and is not restricted to any functional form 4 hierarchical aggregation to assess the fulfilment of objectives at higher levels of the objectives hierarchy the values of the corresponding lower level nodes have to be aggregated with an aggregation rule that reflects how the fulfilment of the higher level objective depends on the fulfilment of its sub objectives langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 in principle all functions from the family of so called quasi arithmetic means can be considered grabisch et al 2009 5 temporal aggregation exposure patterns of different substances vary largely over time and are affected by weather conditions which have to be accounted for by an appropriate monitoring design wittmer et al 2014 to assess the effects of management actions and to follow temporal trends different temporal time scales may be of interest for example to assess the seasonal development within one year one would be interested in the results at the resolution of the samples to compare different sites or different years it might be reasonable to aggregate over the samples within each year and site in principle the same aggregation functions can be used as for the hierarchical aggregation and the choice can be made based on a similar reasoning as described below 6 spatial aggregation exposure patterns vary not only in time but also in space the dendritic network structure of rivers the hydrological conditions and the location of point and non point sources lead to variations of exposure patterns in space water quality monitoring was traditionally often focused on the outlet of a catchment which allows a good overview about fluxes but does not provide information about concentrations within the network this can lead to the fact that an exceedance of toxic thresholds within the network is overlooked especially in headwater streams with a low dilution of pollutants whether or not a spatial aggregation is useful depends on the purpose of the assessment and the spatial resolution of the monitoring program it could be useful to quantify the water quality status of whole river basins or catchments for example in the scope of prioritizing management measures within the catchment to maximize the overall ecological state of the catchment since water quality monitoring is typically restricted to a few points within a river network this would usually require an inter and extrapolation of monitoring results to the whole network which should consider the location of point and non point sources of pollution one of the fundamental objectives of immission based surface water quality assessment is the quantification of the ecological status to protect the organisms inhabiting the ecosystems such as fish invertebrates and primary producers for those organisms the spatial arrangement of habitats matter and have to be considered to assess the ecological status of catchments as a whole as opposed to the assessment of specific reaches or sites since water quality is an important aspect of habitat quality the water quality assessment should ideally be integrated into an ecological assessment at the catchment scale kuemmerlen et al 2019 7 propagation of uncertainty different sources of uncertainty influence the water quality assessment from sampling chemical analytics environmental quality standards baudrot and charles 2019 to parameters of the value function including aggregation multi attribute value theory offers a transparent framework that allows us to propagate and assess these uncertainties to evaluate the robustness of the final assessments schuwirth et al 2012 scholten et al 2015 schuwirth et al 2018 8 communication of results communication of risks is an important step towards more comprehensive risk assessment topping et al 2020 monitoring and assessment usually serves multiple purposes and has to address different audiences it should inform experts by allowing detailed analyses with high temporal and spatial resolution to identify deficits and potential management actions and it should provide a synthesized overview to inform policy makers stakeholders or the public and to support the planning of management actions in other sectors such as morphological river restoration therefore it is important to provide visualizations and numerical results at different levels of the objectives hierarchy and at different temporal and spatial scales reichert et al 2013 schuwirth et al 2018 the focus of this paper is on the aggregation over multiple pollutants and time a comprehensive coverage of spatial aggregation goes beyond the scope of this paper because it requires the inter extrapolation of the attributes to the whole river network and consideration of additional ecological criteria the paper provides recommendations on how to deal with these challenges by discussing each step in detail section 2 and an illustration of the proposed methods with existing pesticide monitoring data from switzerland section 3 the aim of this paper is to support the development of integrative assessment methods for the water quality of surface waters 2 methods i use multi attribute value theory to formulate an integrated water quality assessment method following the eight steps introduced above dyer and sarin 1979 based on insights from discussions with a working group in switzerland that aims for the development of a water quality assessment method with different stakeholders from cantonal and federal authorities objectives for water quality assessment include no ecotoxicological risk for different groups of aquatic organisms from single substances and from the mixture of substances acute and chronic effects should be considered the hierarchical structure regarding these objectives should be chosen in order to facilitate the synthesis and communication of the results and support management the objectives hierarchy should be comprehensive and sub objectives that are not in the same branch should be complementary on the other hand the hierarchy should be as concise as possible to facilitate the communication of results marttunen et al 2019 different structures are possible and should be discussed with stakeholders that are going to use the assessment method one possible hierarchical structure breaks down the overall objective of good water quality into different modules that group the pollutants according to the sampling and measurement strategy e g nutrients organic micropollutants heavy metals and metalloids this ensures that the results of a measurement campaign can be presented together other structures are possible for example to further sub divide substance groups or to distinguish different sources of pollution however since many substances can have various sources the latter is more difficult to implement for organic micropollutants we can distinguish chronic and acute toxicity single substances and mixture toxicity fig 1 in addition to the ecotoxicological risk assessment it might be advisable to include objectives that cover the environmental pollution with substances that are typically not of concern because of their toxicity but still do not belong in a natural environment lienert et al 2011 such as x ray contrast agents artificial sweeteners or repellents this could be implemented by an additional objective for the general prohibition of pollution by non natural substances the next step is to identify measurable attributes that allow us to measure the fulfilment of the lowest level sub objectives the selection of substances to be monitored and sampling strategies should reflect the objectives and are crucial aspects of the monitoring design behmel et al 2016 norman et al 2020 these aspects are not discussed here in all detail but they should be standardized to ensure the comparability of results within one monitoring program it would make only limited sense to aggregate data from different sampling strategies wittmer et al 2014 propose a concept for the sampling and assessment of organic micropollutants in switzerland suggesting biweekly composite samples to be compared with chronic environmental quality standards this design takes into account that micropollutants from non point sources such as agricultural pesticides have seasonal exposure patterns that vary with application times and depend on weather conditions a yearly averaging would lead to a strong dilution of the concentration of these substances which would not be representative for the exposure situation of stream organisms ecotoxicological tests to assess the chronic toxicity usually have a duration between 72h and several weeks a biweekly sampling strategy therefore roughly corresponds to the duration of the chronic toxicity tests wittmer et al 2014 this complies with the new swiss waters protection ordinance 1 1 https www bafu admin ch bafu de home themen wasser mitteilungen msg id 78122 html available in german french and italian for the assessment of acute effects 24 96h composite samples would be ideal we can then use the concept of risk quotients where the measured concentrations in the water samples are divided by the environmental quality standard mixture toxicity can be assessed according to junghans et al 2013 where the risk quotient of substances that affect the same organism group are summed up spycher et al 2018 as additional information an assessment of the toxicity of single substances can be provided to support the identification of the sources of pollution and potential management measures for this the highest risk quotient of the single substances for each organism group can be used the following class boundaries were suggested to link the risk quotient of single substances or mixtures to five color coded water quality classes wittmer et al 2014 high blue rq 0 1 good green rq 1 moderate yellow rq 2 poor orange rq 10 bad red rq 10 a straightforward way to derive a continuous value function from discrete water quality classes is to assume equally spaced intervals at the value scale and apply linear piecewise interpolation between class boundaries e g fig 2 but any other functional form is possible that best reflects how the fulfilment of the objective depends on the attribute level here the class boundary between the moderate and the good state is based on the legal requirements in this case the eqs valuei e risk quotient 1 such a continuous assessment and its translation into five color coded quality classes provides a graded system that can resolve differences between sites or temporal changes better than just a binary pass fail criterion currently applied for the assessment of chemical contamination in the european water framework directive brack et al 2017 most commonly used aggregation techniques for hierarchical and temporal aggregation are minimum aggregation i e worst case or one out all out and additive aggregation weighted arithmetic mean see table 1 for examples while minimum aggregation just takes the worst value of the sub objectives as the aggregated value the additive aggregation takes a weighted average across all sub objectives which means that it allows for full compensation between good and bad values many other less widely used aggregation techniques exist that provide a compromise between those extreme aggregation methods langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2019 reichert et al 2019 see table 2 in the main text for examples and their mathematical equations to choose an appropriate aggregation function it is important to be aware about the properties that the aggregation functions should have in the scope of the assessment properties for aggregation techniques that seem rather undisputed in the scope of water quality assessment are 1 if the values of all sub objectives are the same the aggregated value is also the same idempotency 2 if the value of one of the sub objectives improves the aggregated value does not get worse and vice versa these two properties may seem rather obvious they are also mentioned as a precondition in mathematical aggregation theory and their application to sustainability assessment pollesch and dale 2015 still not all aggregation methods discussed in the literature fulfil them for example the multiplicative aggregation method introduced in multi criteria decision making keeney and raiffa 1976 does not fulfil the idempotency requirement 1 and even in the field of water quality assessment the aggregation methods proposed by swamee and tyagi 2000 2007 do not fulfil the idempotency requirement furthermore these two methods depend on the number of sub objectives to be aggregated which is another undesired property further desirable properties that were mentioned in discussions with stakeholders are 3 the aggregation technique is easy to understand and communicate 4 the aggregation technique is sensitive to changes and facilitates the detection of improvements and deteriorations in space or time e g across years i e if one of the sub objectives improves worsens the aggregated value also improves worsens 5 the aggregation technique helps to provide a differentiated picture i e it facilitates the ranking or grading of sites according to their overall water quality e g to identify hotspots of bad water quality and prioritize management actions 6 a if the value of one of the sub objectives is in the bad class the overall value shall not be in the good or high class or even more extreme b if one of the sub objectives is in the moderate poor or bad class the aggregated value shall not be in the good or high class 7 small changes in the fulfilment of sub objectives should lead to only small changes in the aggregated value this property is also called continuity pollesch and dale 2015 these desirable properties are partially conflicting especially the extreme version of property 6 b with properties 4 and 5 there exists no aggregation technique that fulfils all of them to the optimal degree the minimum aggregation fulfils property 3 and is the only of the proposed aggregation methods that fulfils the extreme version of property 6 b but it does not fulfil the properties 4 and 5 the additive aggregation fulfils property 3 and to some degree 4 but less so property 5 and not property 6 the additive minimum and geometric offset aggregation techniques fulfil properties 4 and 5 the fulfilment of property 6 can be adapted based on the choice of the parameter values but they do not fulfil its extreme version b to which degree they fulfil property 3 can be judged differently but to a lesser degree than minimum or additive aggregation in contrast to the aggregation methods mentioned in table 1 the weighted geometric mean does not fulfil property 7 because as soon as one of the sub objectives has a value of zero the aggregated value is zero therefore a small increase in one sub objective from zero to a small value above zero can lead to a large difference in the aggregated value especially if the other sub objectives have a value close to 1 to avoid this the geometric offset was introduced schuwirth et al 2018 which prevents this behaviour for Œ¥ values above 0 since all of these aggregation techniques fulfil the property 1 they lead to very similar results if all sub objectives have a similar value see example 3 in table 1 however they lead to very different results if some of the sub objectives have a very high and others a very low value see example 1 in table 1 the importance of the desirable properties can be controversial among stakeholders and depends on the purpose of the assessment langhans et al 2014 in cases where it is sufficient to know if the concentration of any of the substances was above a legal threshold at any time monitoring compliance with regulation the minimum aggregation is adequate in cases where a prioritization among sites is important when temporal changes should be assessed trend monitoring or when responses to management actions should be evaluated impact control the minimum aggregation is not adequate and the additive minimum or geometric offset aggregation technique is preferable see tables 1 and a1 in these cases the properties 4 and 5 are of particular importance haag et al 2019 provide a method to infer the aggregation method and their parameters from stakeholder interviews in addition or as an alternative the importance of the desirable properties can be discussed and the aggregation function chosen accordingly reichert et al 2019 the parameters can then be chosen based on the evaluation of didactical and real examples that illustrate the consequences of different aggregation functions see table 1 and fig 7 to account for the fact that the assessment of single substances can only be equal or better than the assessment of mixture toxicity we propose an aggregation function for the nodes no risk of chronic toxicity and no risk of acute toxicity that takes the same value as the nodes no risk of chronic mixture toxicity and no risk of acute mixture toxicity respectively this can be implemented by a minimum aggregation this means that the assessment of single substances does not affect the higher level objectives but it serves as additional information to evaluate if the risk is mainly due to single substances or due to a complex mixture of substances price and han 2011 to compare the results across time or space it is important that the number and timing of the samplings as well as the number and selection of substances to be analyzed are standardized within the monitoring program this poses a challenge for practice since the list of potentially relevant substances is long and varies over time as do analytical possibilities while the budget for monitoring is limited and not for all substances environmental quality standards are available ecotox centre 2020 therefore it should be foreseen to critically review the monitoring design in this regard from time to time and to adapt the assessment method when necessary propagation of uncertainty is technically straightforward using monte carlo simulations and can be implemented with any statistical computing language e g r development core team 2019 however it requires an estimate of the uncertainty of all inputs to the assessment procedure by the specification of probability distributions such as attribute levels here consisting of measured concentrations and environmental quality standards and aggregation parameters we can then draw a random sample from these probability distributions and propagate it through the assessment function to derive the uncertainty of the outcome to which degree this is worth pursuing depends on the scope of the assessment and may be controversial among users it is probably more relevant for the assessment of future scenarios of management actions based on modelled water quality variables schuwirth et al 2018 and when developing a new monitoring and assessment strategy than for the assessment of routine monitoring results uncertainty in the assessment is sometimes used as an argument for discrete rather than continuous assessments and to favour only two or three instead of five water quality classes however the uncertainty of a classification does not only depend on the uncertainty of the attribute level but also on the location of its expected value if the expected value of the attribute is close to a class boundary the uncertainty about the classification can be high even when the uncertainty about the attribute value is relatively small fig 3 grey colored distribution on the other hand the uncertainty about the classification can be rather low when the expected value is in the middle of a class even when the attribute has a rather high uncertainty fig 3 shaded distribution it is good scientific practice to round numbers of any measurement to provide only significant digits taking into account the precision of the measurement for symmetrically distributed values i e not skewed usually a mean standard deviation is provided in the examples of fig 3 this would be 5 0 0 8 and 10 0 0 1 for the shaded and the grey distribution respectively this implies that the last provided digit of the mean value is uncertain rounding to less than the number of significant digits introduces a discretization error and reduces the information content this should also be considered when discretizing the results to quality classes if we provide only two or three instead of five water quality classes we lose information which is important to detect changes but how much this reduces the uncertainty of the classification depends on whether the estimated values are close to a class boundary or not to judge the uncertainty of the classification a provision of the attribute value and its uncertainty e g standard deviation or quantile ranges would be ideal from this we can calculate the assessment at the continuous value scale between 0 and 1 as well as its uncertainty in addition to the estimated quality class this then also allows us to assess the uncertainty of the classification and to follow changes within one water quality class a distinction of five quality classes has proven useful e g for ecological assessments in the european water framework directive and in switzerland to synthesize numerical results e g to communicate with policymakers or the public and to distinguish and prioritize sites as mentioned above the communication and visualization of results has to be adapted to the purpose often water quality monitoring programs fulfil multiple purposes they should provide a representative spatial and temporal overview identify impaired sites and ideally support the identification of management actions for remediation this requires that the assessment method can provide results at each level of the objectives hierarchy to facilitate a synthesis of the results at a high level as well as providing detailed information at the lowest level examples for different visualizations for real monitoring data are provided in the next section the water quality assessment can be implemented with the r package utility version 1 4 5 reichert et al 2013 the r scripts to produce the assessment results are provided in the supporting information the proposed water quality assessment is illustrated for real monitoring data from a swiss federal monitoring program from the year 2012 moschet et al 2014 in this program biweekly time proportional composite samples were taken at five different sites in switzerland for illustration in this paper we use the biweekly samples for the assessment of chronic and acute effects it should be noted however that it would be recommended to use samples with a better temporal resolution e g composite samples from 24 96h for the assessment of acute effects because an averaging over longer periods usually leads to a dilution and therefore an underestimation of acute effects norman et al 2020 in this monitoring program 249 different polar organic compounds were analyzed that are sold as pesticides in switzerland and applied to agricultural or urban land in addition to 134 transformation products each of which could be quantified in the low ng l range in addition pharmaceuticals were analyzed however chronic and acute environmental quality standards were available for only 56 of the analyzed substances ecotox centre 2020 this means that the water quality status assessment only provides an upper bound and the actual water quality may be worse 3 illustration of results with real monitoring data assessment results for a single sample can be visualized with a color coded objectives hierarchy fig 4 in this example the highest risk exists for primary producers from chronic mixture toxicity which reaches a poor state orange colored box to compare different samples e g a time series from the same site a tabular visualization is more convenient figs 5 6 for this site single substances that pose the highest risks and exceed chronic eqs are diclofenac fish thiacloprid and diazinon invertebrates nicosulfurone and metolachlor primary producers similarly we could plot a table with the results for multiple sites the choice of the aggregation functions and their respective parameters for hierarchical aggregation strongly affect the assessment results of the higher level objectives this can be seen when comparing fig 5 with additive minimum aggregation and fig 6 with minimum aggregation for the same samples while the minimum aggregation clearly reflects the worst value of the sub objectives the additive minimum aggregation shows a better differentiation between samples in fig 7 we can compare four different aggregation functions for one sample in this example the minimum aggregation leads to a poor assessment of the main objective no organic pollution with a value of 0 39 in contrast the additive aggregation which allows for a full compensation between good and bad values of the sub objectives leads to a good assessment with a value 0 66 the additive minimum aggregation provides a compromise between both where the parameter Œ± can be adjusted to specify the desired level of compensation see table 2 in the main text to visualize the results of an uncertainty assessment or the temporal or spatial variability we can provide the 5 and 95 range of the assessment results as color coded boxes in the objectives hierarchy fig 8 similarly in a tabular visualization not shown 4 conclusions multi attribute value theory provides the methods to formulate a continuous multi attribute water quality assessment without any restrictions regarding its functional form e g aggregation functions or non linear dependence on attributes this can facilitate a the explicit formulation and structuring of objectives b the consideration of non linear relationships between measurable attributes and the water quality status c the identification of aggregation rules that best represent the dependence of the overall objective on sub objectives d visualization and communication of assessment results at all levels of the objectives hierarchy and at various temporal and spatial scales it should be noted that the assessment results strongly depend on the coverage of substances that are monitored and the availability of environmental quality standards for all substances it would therefore be advisable to complement the water quality assessment with effect based tools biotests and non target screening of contaminants especially for pesticides that have exposure patterns with a large temporal and spatial variability the temporal resolution and spatial coverage are crucial aspects of the monitoring design furthermore critical decisions about the hierarchical structure and aggregation methods have to be taken that have consequences for water quality management and policy making since the adequacy of aggregation methods depends on the purpose of the monitoring and assessment it seems reasonable to apply a different aggregation method for compliance monitoring than for the evaluation of temporal and spatial trends or management support for the identification of sites that do not comply with regulation a simple minimum aggregation over samplings and sub objectives is sufficient the identification of sources of impairment then does not rely on aggregated values but rather on the full time series of all single substances stakeholders that have this monitoring purpose in mind are therefore reluctant in accepting any aggregation method that allows for even partial compensation among sub objectives or samplings because they do not want a dilution of the results however when the scope of the assessment is to get an integrated view on the severity of water quality problems to identify temporal changes or detect a response to management actions an aggregation method that is sensitive to changes in all sub objectives is more adequate e g the minimum additive or geometric offset aggregation the visualization and communication of results has to be adapted to the monitoring purpose accordingly supporting information a zip file with
