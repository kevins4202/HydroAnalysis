14875,light is an important driver of algal growth and for the formation of surface blooms long term buoyancy maintenance of microcystis colonies is crucial for their aggregation at the water surface and the following algal bloom development however the effect of light mediated variations of colony morphology on the buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies remains unclear in this study growth parameters colony morphology and floatation sinking performance of microcystis colonies were determined to explore how variations in colony morphology influence the buoyancy of colonies under different light conditions we quantified colony compactness through the cell volume to colony volume ratio vr and found different responses of colony size and vr under different light intensities microcystis colonies with higher vr could stay longer at the water surface under low light conditions which was beneficial for the long term growth and buoyancy maintenance however increased colony size and decreased compactness were observed at a later growth stage under relatively higher light intensity i e 108 µmol photons m 2 s 1 interestingly we found a counterintuitive negative correlation between colony size and buoyancy of microcystis under high light intensity additionally we found that the influence of colony morphology on buoyancy was stronger at high light intensity these results indicate that light could regulate the buoyancy via colonial morphology and that the role of colony morphology in buoyancy regulation needs to be accounted for in further studies under variable

threatens the safety of freshwater ecosystems and public health kosten et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 microcystis is one of the major cyanobacterial species that can form surface blooms with a series of negative effects to the aquatic environment and humans huisman et al 2018 song et al 2018 microcystis have specific adaptations which can facilitate their dominance over other competitors in aquatic environments including buoyancy regulation an annual growth cycle with a special storage strategy efficient nitrogen uptake and resistance to zooplankton grazing chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2012 among these adaptive strategies buoyancy regulation is regarded as most important for the formation and persistence of microcystis blooms walsby 1994 wu et al 2021 microcystis can adapt to changing environments by adjusting their buoyancy and are characterized by the following features low density and large size which was mainly related to the formation of gas vesicle and colonies respectively li et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 three mechanisms for buoyancy regulation have been proposed changes in cell ballast production and dilution of gas vesicles and irreversible collapse of gas vesicles walsby 1994 light is a critical environmental factor in buoyancy regulation and several studies demonstrated that the mass density of microcystis cells increases at high irradiance and that positive buoyancy can be derived from the gas vesicles at low irradiance deacon and walsby 1990 wei et al 2018 yao et al 2017 photosynthetic production and storage of carbohydrates tend to increase cell density during daytime and to decrease it at night the carbohydrate content of microcystis cells is positively correlated with cell density and negatively correlated with buoyancy gonzalez fernandez and ballesteros 2012 kromkamp and mur 1984 the majority of previous studies focused on the relationship between buoyancy of microcystis and the content of gas vesicles or the intracellular carbohydrate visser et al 1996 wei et al 2018 however field observations show that microcystis cells and colonies can maintain positive buoyancy also during long term light exposure cui et al 2016 li et al 2013a consequently there must be additional mechanisms supporting surface scum formation and persistence which potentially include gas bubble formation in colonies aparicio medrano et al 2016a dervaux et al 2015 or self shading of microcystis colonies wu et al 2021 colony formation is thought to be an important process for bloom formation larger colonies accumulate more easily at the water surface whereas smaller colonies do not remain at the water surface and are rather homogeneouls distributed throughout the surface mixed layer aparicio medrano et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 the vertical migration velocity of larger colonies is higher than that of small colonies and large colonies remain more easily at the water surface to form blooms wu et al 2020b many studies have reported a positive relationship between colony size and floatation velocity li et al 2016 wu et al 2020b xiao et al 2012 larger microcystis colonies have a longer daily averaged retention time at the water surface yao et al 2017 therefore large colonies can be considered as main contributors to microcystis surface scum formation two mechanisms for colony formation in microcystis have been recognized i cell division where cells remain attached after binary fission and the daughter cells become enveloped in a layer of secreted extracellular polysaccharides eps that prevents their separation ii cell or colony adhesion where single cells or colonies aggregate which is also promoted by the secretion of adhesive eps li et al 2013b xiao et al 2017 the buoyancy of microcystis colonies depends on both the cell and eps content wei et al 2021 wu et al 2020a previous studies indicated that microcystis colonies with high compactness here defined as the volume ratio of cells to colonies vr are more buoyant than colonies with lower vr reynolds 2007 wu et al 2021 larger colony compactness can result in higher floatation velocities and longer retention of microcystis colonies at the water surface wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 improved knowledge about the processes that govern and promote microcystis scum formation are critical for successful prediction and for the development of lake management and mitigation strategies thus it is of great significance to explore the influence of colony size and compactness on floatation behavior of microcystis colonies however the effect of the morphological changes of microcystis colonies under different light intensities on their buoyancy and floatation has not been adequately explored we supposed that morphological changes of microcystis colonies play an important role in their buoyancy regulation under different light conditions we performed laboratory experiments to explore the effect of light intensity on the growth rate morphology and floatation behavior of microcystis colonies in particular we evaluated the influence of colony size and compactness on its floatation behavior the results of the present study are supposed to advance the understanding about the retention of microcystis colonies at the water surface under different light conditions and contribute to improving the prediction of bloom formation and bloom dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 organisms and culture conditions a stock of microcystis colonies was collected at the water surface 0 30 cm depth of the guanqiao fishpond wuhan hubei province china using a silk plankton net with 63 µm mesh size during a cyanobacteria bloom to select predominantly microcystis colonies with similar morphology wu et al 2021 the samples were first filtered through a 180 μm sieve to remove large particles and then through a 45 μm sieve to remove single cells and smaller sized colonies the selection of the size range was based on the particle size distributions fig s1a b and flowcam results of microcystis colonies collected from guanqiao fishpond fig s1c the sieved microcystis colonies were washed two times using distilled water and bg 11 medium 10 v v wu et al 2020b the colonies were then pre cultured in 1 2 l of diluted bg 11 medium 10 v v which was found to provide most favorable conditions for microcystis colonies growth fig s2 the pre cultures were maintained in a 2 l transparent conical flask at a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 and a temperature of 25 1 c until the desired cell density for each experiment was obtained all culture media were sterile filtered through gf membranes 0 22 µm pore size before inoculation microscopic observations showed that the collected phytoplankton species were predominantly microcystis mainly m viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii which accounted for 98 of the total biovolume fig s1d 2 2 experimental design for the experiments cultured microcystis colonies were successively filtered through 180 µm and 45 µm sieves before inoculation into 1 l transparent conical flasks containing 600 ml of diluted bg 11 medium 10 v v with an initial density of 9 4 108 cells l 1 for an experimental period of 42 days three replicated flasks were exposed to four different light intensities respectively with a light dark ratio of 12 h 12 h 7 30 am to 7 30 pm and at a temperature of 25 1 c according to the result of previous studies chalifour et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 we refer to high light intensity groups in the following if the light intensity was exceeding 100 µmol photons m 2 s 1 a control group group d was under continuous dark conditions 0 µmol photons m 2 s 1 low light intensity groups group l1 and l2 were exposed to 18

bg 11 medium 10 ml was added to each flask every three days to maintain the essential nutrients for algae to grow time series of total nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations are shown in fig s3 the conical flasks were slightly shaken twice each day 7 30 am and 7 30 pm all the experimental utensils and media were autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before usage as a diurnal pattern in the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies was not observed in the culture during 24 h the effects of changes in mass density of microcystis cells and self shading on the floatation behavior of colonies was not considered during the experimental period water samples were collected at mid depth of the conical flasks after slight mixing at 8 00 am every two days to measure cell density and every three days to measure colony size of microcystis chlorophyll a concentration chl a the photochemical efficiency of psⅱ qy equivalent to f v f m and volume ratio of cells to the colony vr compactness of microcystis colonies were measured every six days as the microcystis colony samples from the very thin surface and the bottom of the 1 l conical flasks were difficult to collect an additional experiment was conducted to analyze the influence of compactness and colony size on colony buoyancy at different growth phases and under different light intensities firstly the colony samples were collected at the middle of the flasks after slight mixing at day 18 day 30 and day 42 which represent the mid exponential growth phase the end exponential phase and the stationary or decline phase respectively then the samples were diluted in 10 ml centrifuge tubes 8 cm height and placed without movement for 5 h at a temperature of 25 1 c and a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 in these samples we measured cell density colony size and vr and calculated the percentage of the total biomass of microcystis colonies that were collected at the water surface and at the bottom of tubes after 5 h to ensure complete floatation or sinking respectively 2 3 measurement of growth parameters samples of 3 ml were taken from the experimental flasks every 6 days to measure chl a and photochemical efficiency of psⅱ qy equivalent to f v f m using a portable fluorometer aquapen c ap c 100 photon system instruments czech republic after being darkened for 15 min the cell density c cell l 1 was counted in a hemocytometer using an optical microscope bx43 olympus corporation at 40x magnification after being disintegrated by alkaline hydrolysis with 0 05 mol l 1 sodium hydroxide at 85 c for 6 8 min wang et al 2015 every 2 days the exponential growth rate µ was calculated for the initial exponential growth phase as 1 μ ln c l ln c 0 t 1 t 0 where c l cell l 1 and c 0 cell l 1

positively and negatively buoyant colonies in samples collected at day 18 day 30 and day 42 8 00 am to ensure that all floating and sinking colonies the samples were diluted in 10 ml centrifugation tubes 8 cm height and placed without movement for 5 h at a temperature of 25 1 c and a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 then 2 ml samples were collected from the surface and the bottom of the 10 ml centrifuge tubes and used to determine the cell density median colony size d 50 and vr of both floating colonies c f and sinking colonies c s using the methods described above the

correlations between sampling time light intensity colony size and vr significance was tested for a probably value p 0 05 3 results 3 1 growth of microcystis under different light intensities during the first 30 days of the experiment the cell densities and chl a concentrations increased continuously in all illuminated groups fig 1 a and b the maximal cell densities at the end of the initial growth phase were generally higher for higher light intensities 8 7 109 1 3 1010 1 4 1010 and 1 6 1010 cells l 1 for the groups l1 h2 respectively after the initial growth phase the cell densities remained nearly constant under low light conditions group l1 l2 whereas the cell densities of the high light intensity groups group h1 h2 decreased from day 30 to day 42 at the end of the experimental period day 42 the cell densities in both low light intensity groups were higher than those in the high light intensity groups under dark condition the cell density increased slightly during the first 6 days and then decreased for the remaining experimental period with a maximal cell density of 1 18 109 cell l 1 a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the cell density and the logarithm of chl a r 2 0 96 fig s4 the exponential growth rates during the initial period were generally increasing with increasing light intensity table 1 the increase of the growth rates with light intensity was not linear but could be well described by a logarithmic relationship r 2 0 95 fig s5 the duration of the initial growth period was slightly lower 30 days in the high light intensity groups than in the low light groups 36 days the net growth rate of microcystis was increasing or fluctuating during the first 18 days and then decreased continuously from day 18 to day 42 in all illuminated groups fig 1c for the high light intensity groups the net growth rate became negative after day 36 in contrast the net growth rate of the low light intensity group was positive also after day 36 under dark condition the net growth rate of microcystis colonies was positive during the initial 6 days and negative during the remaining experimental time the photochemical efficiency of psⅱ of microcystis colonies fluctuated between 0 21 and 0 34 in the four different light intensities group l1 h2 whereas it decreased from 0 32 to 0 19 under dark condition fig 1d the mean photochemical efficiency of all illuminated groups group l1 2 and group h1 2 was similar ranging from 0 25 to 0 27 and higher than that of group d 0 23 3 2 colony size distribution during the first six days of the experiment the median colony size d 50 increased in all experimental groups including the dark group at similar rates while in the dark group the colony size remained at a relatively constant value of 154 µm throughout the remaining experimental period the colony sizes in the illuminated groups continued to increase before leveling off at larger maximum sizes fig 2 a the maximal d 50 under the different light conditions l1 to h2 were 174 µm 224 µm 318 µm and 307 µm respectively in both high light intensity groups the colony size was similar and reached maximum values at the end of the experimental period under dark conditions the biovolume concentration of microcystis colonies decreased continuously during the experiment especially for the smallest size class 0 150 µm fig 2b the total biovolume of microcystis colonies in cotrast increased under all light conditions fig 2c f the biovolume of microcystis colonies in different size classes showed different temporal dynamics in the experimental groups mainly resulting from differences in the medium size class 150 300 µm obviously the concentration of large colonies 300 500 µm was small under lower light intensity fig 2c d but continuously increased under high light intensity fig 2e f generally the temporal dynamics observed in the colony size distributions appeared to be unrelated to the dynamics in cell density 3 3 colony compactness the cell to colony volume ratio vr increased with time for the lowest light intensity from 0 03 to 0 05 whereas it decreased continuously from 0 04 to 0 01 for all higher light intensities fig 3 the mean vr of the four different experimental groups decreased with increasing light intensity 3 4 percentages of floating and sinking colonies the cell density at the water surface floating microcystis colonies increased with increasing light intensity during the first measurements day 18 while it was less variable among the experimental groups at day 30 and showed an opposing trend with lowest densities for highest light intensities at the final sampling on day 42 fig 4 a the cell density of sinking microcystis colonies was significantly lower under dark group d and low light l1 conditions than under higher light intensities p 0 05 fig 4b there were significant differences between cell densities of sinking colonies observed at the same time under different light intensities and at different days of each light intensity group p 0 05 the percentages of floating microcystis colonies were comparatively high 40 6 to 59 2 at low light intensity but decreased from 51 8 to 13 2 continuously from day 18 to day 42 at high light intensities fig 4c meanwhile the percentage of sinking microcystis colonies was positively correlated with light intensity and there was a significant difference between the percentages for group l1 and the other experimental groups p 0 05 the percentage of sinking microcystis colonies was similar at the three sampling days 4 5 to 8 6 for the lowest light intensity group l1 however it increased with time at high light intensities group h1 h2 where it ranged from 10 8 to 52 3 these results indicate that microcystis colonies are more buoyant at low light intensities and are predominantly sinking for both dark conditions and high light intensities at the later growth stage i e after day 18 fig s6 under dark condition the cell density of floating microcystis was extremely low and the percentage of sinking microcystis increased with time from 2 9 to nearly 60 3 5 colony size of floating and sinking colonies the median size of floating microcystis colonies d 50 was similar in all groups at day 18 120 µm to 146 µm whereas it was increasing with increasing light intensity at day 30 and 42 fig 5 a the increase of d 50 from day 18 to day 42 was larger at high light intensities h1 220 µm h2 199 µm than under low light conditions l1 26 µm l2 71 µm p 0 01 under dark conditions d 50 of floating microcystis colonies increased continuously from 146 µm to 222 µm on day 18 and day 42 respectively for sinking microcystis colonies the d 50 of the high light intensity groups was higher than that of the low light intensity groups and there was a significant difference in d 50 among different light intensity groups except for group l2 at day 30 fig 5b the d 50 of sinking microcystis colonies under low light conditions first increased and then decreased with time whereas in the high light intensity groups the d 50 of sinking microcystis colonies continuously increased from 236 µm to 303 µm the size of floating and sinking microcystis colonies differed significantly except for group d at day 18 and group l1 at day 18 and 42 fig 5c on day 18 and day 30 floating colonies were smaller than sinking colonies under all four light conditions however the d 50 of floating colonies was larger than that of sinking colonies under dark condition and high light intensities at day 42 indicating that both the larger sized colonies under high light intensity and smaller sized of colonies under dark condition were less buoyant at the final stage of the experiment 3 6 compactness of floating and sinking colonies the vr of floating microcystis colonies showed no consistent temporal trend or dependence on light intensity fig 6 a for the lowest light intensity l1 vr increased over time whereas the vr of floating microcystis colonies of the groups l2 and h1 slightly decreased from 0 06 to 0 02 and 0 06 to 0 03 respectively under the highest light intensity vr of floating microcystis colonies first decreased from 0 07 to 0 03 and then increased to 0 05 however the vr of floating microcystis colonies was highest 0 45 at the last sampling under dark condition the vr of sinking microcystis colonies was highest for the low light intensity group l1 fig 6b here the vr of sinking colonies first increased from 0 1 to 0 2 and then decreased to 0 18 for the high light intensity groups h1 and h2 vr of sinking colonies decreased from 0 07 to 0 05 and from 0 05 to 0 04 respectively under dark condition vr of sinking microcystis colonies increased from 0 05 to 0 08 the vr of floating microcystis colonies was mostly lower than that of sinking microcystis colonies at all light intensities except for group h1 at day 18 and group h2 at day 18 42 fig 6c under dark conditions the vr of floating microcystis colonies was larger than that of sinking microcystis colonies at all sampling times p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effect of light intensity on growth and colony size to analyze the effects of light induced changes in colony morphology on their floatation behavior we performed replicated laboratory experiments with cultures of natural microcystis strains during the first 30 to 36 days of the experiment the algae were growing exponentially with light limited growth in the two low light intensity groups and similar growth rates in the two high light intensity groups fig 1 table 1 the growth rates could be described by a logarithmic dependence on light intensity and were in the range to those reported for microcystis in previous studies from 0 008 d 1 at 10 µmol photons m 2 s 1 to 0 215 d 1 at 200 µmol photons m 2 s 1 xiao et al 2012 light inhibition as it has been found in other studies at light intensities being comparable to the highest intensity used in our study 200 µmol photons m 2 s 1 cheng and zhang 2020 islam and beardall 2017 was not observed the different results reported in these studies might be due to the different strains of microcystis and experimental conditions including nutrient concentrations and incubation volume moreover self shading of microcystis colonies may exist which can reduce light inhibition at high light intensities wu et al 2021 previous studies have also shown that small changes in the concentrations of nitrogen n and phosphorous p can significantly influence the growth of microcystis vezie et al 2002 xu et al 2010 the concentration thresholds for eutrophication in freshwaters are 0 50 1 00 mg l 1 for n and 0 02 0 1 mg l 1 for p lin et al 2008 the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was comparably high 13 8 to 55 0 mg l 1 for the light groups whereas the total dissolved phosphorous concentration tdp was relatively low i e 0 01 to 0 03 mg l 1 for group h1 2 after day 24 fig s3 during the later stage of the experiments phosphorous deficiency may have been a limiting factor for microcystis growth these conditions may also have affected the growth stagnation at low light intensities and the population decline at high light intensities during the later experimental phase 30 42 days nevertheless the observed dynamics in colony size and morphology appeared to differ from that of the microcystis growth microcystis colonies were larger under high light intensities than at low light intensity fig 2a this result is consistent with previous studies reporting that low light intensity is unfavorable for large microcystis colonies which form at higher light intensity 36 288 µmol photons m 2 s 1 zhang et al 2014 increased eps content was considered to stimulate colony formation of microcystis xu et al 2016 yang et al 2008 at the beginning of our experiment day 0 to day 18 microcystis colonies were compact i e were characterized by a high ratio of cell volume to colony volume vr at all light intensities from day 18 to day 42 the colonies exposed to low light intensities group l1 l2 remained compact whereas at high light intensities group h1 h2 colonies became looser indicating increasing mucilage eps content in the colonies fig s7 the two formerly proposed mechanisms for colony formation can be expected to result in different dynamics of vr cell division was associated with an increase in vr whereas colony adhesion would be associated with decreasing or low vr due to the secreted bound eps wu et al 2020a xiao et al 2017 in the present experiments vr of microcystis colonies was increasing with time for the lowest light intensity 18 µmol photons m 2 s 1 whereas it was decreasing with time under higher light intensities 54 216 µmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 3 thus the dominant mechanism of colony formation was cell division under lower light intensities and colony adhesion under higher light intensities this result is similar to those of previous studies which reported that colony formation by cell division dominated at low light intensities xiao et al 2018 2017 the decrease of vr suggests that eps production of microcystis significantly increased under high light intensities which confirms former findings xiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the absence of large colonies at the lowest light intensity fig 2c suggests that not only population growth but also colony size was limited by light under these conditions microcystis colonies below the surface scum will absorb less light due to self shading wu et al 2021 moreover the attenuation of light within colonies was found to follow the lambert beer law and depends on cell concentration in the colony feng et al 2019 with cell division being to the dominant mechanism for colony formation at low light intensity both the cell concentration per colony and the colony size increased resulting in increasing light attenuation within the colonies 4 2 effect of colony morphology on buoyancy the eps content in the colonies affects their buoyancy and therewith their floatation and sinking behavior chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 except for the lowest light intensity l1 the percentage of sinking colonies in our experiments increased over time and reached more than 50 fig s6 we suggest that the continuously increasing production and internal storage of carbohydrates under higher light intensities kromkamp and mur 1984 visser et al 1996 yao et al 2017 was the main reason for this decrease in colony buoyancy we found that microcystis colonies with higher vr high light intensity were more buoyant than colonies with smaller vr fig 5 6 which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 however the opposite phenomenon was observed on day 30 when large colonies with high vr sank under low light conditions and smaller colonies with lower vr remained at the water surface fig 5 6 since the density of mucilage is higher than the density of water there must be at least one additional mechanism that provides buoyancy to floating microcystis colonies gas production in cell vesicles is limited by the availability of photosynthetic products and is approximately linearly related to light intensity between 0 and 20 µmol photons m 2 s 1 deacon and walsby 1990 thus the buoyancy of microcystis cells in colonies would decrease with increasing colony size and vr under low light conditions in addition to cellular gas content oxygen production and limited gas diffusion in large colonies can lead to dissolved gas supersaturation and the nucleation of bubbles that are trapped within the mucilage and provide additional buoyancy aparicio medrano et al 2016a dervaux et al 2015 oxygen gas bubble formation depends on photosynthetic rates which are limited by light intensity therefore we speculate that the attenuation of light inside colonies with high vr at low light intensity and bubble production within colony mucilage under high light intensity were the main reasons for the floatation behavior of microcystis colonies in our experiment existing mechanistic models for the vertical distribution dynamics of microcystis consider ensembles of different colony sizes with distinct vr aparicio medrano et al 2016b ranjbar et al 2021 but these models do not account for dynamic changes in colony morphology in response to light conditions to inform models and to improve predictions of bloom formation and persistence future experimental work should therefore focus on a parametrization of changes in colony morphology under dynamic light conditions 4 3 buoyancy regulation by morphological variance generally cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes can be classified into three stages 1 bloom development during late spring to early summer when microcystis accumulates and form surface scum 2 bloom maintenance during mid summer to middle autumn when microcystis are broadly distributed at the water surface of the lake 3 bloom decay in late autumn when the blooms disaggregate and decline tang et al 2018 seasonal changes in morphospecies composition and colony size of microcystis were investigated in lake taihu li et al 2013a where it was found that the colony size of microcystis increased contuneously starting from april reaching a maximum size in october before it decreased rapidly after november the massive accumulation of microcystis at the water surface in lake taihu was always accompanied by large sizes of microcystis colonies zhu et al 2014 similarly we found that microcystis colonies were larger under high light intensity fig 2 and that larger colonies with higher vr could stay longer at the water surface wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 however higher light intensity may decrease vr and promote the sinking of the colonies indicating that the variation of vr of microcystis colonies may respond to seasonal changes in enviromental conditions i e nutrient concentrations light and temperature which should not be neglected therefore the dynamics of colony size and vr which can cause changes in colony buoyancy through light mediated variations of colony morphology should be monitored more frequently to better predict the floatation behavior of microcystis colonies and the persistence of surface scum 5 conclusions this study examined the effects of colony size and compactness on floatation and sinking of microcystis colonies under different light intensities under light limiting growth conditions microcystis colony size and cell to colony volume ratio varied with light intensity at low light intensity 18 µmol photons m 2 s 1 colony formation was mostly governed by cell division in contrast to cell and colony adhesion under higher light intensities 54 µmol photons m 2 s 1 low light intensity was favorable for the persistence of high microcystis biomass of microcystis colonies at the water surface future investigations will be aimed toward identifying factors that control colony

14875,light is an important driver of algal growth and for the formation of surface blooms long term buoyancy maintenance of microcystis colonies is crucial for their aggregation at the water surface and the following algal bloom development however the effect of light mediated variations of colony morphology on the buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies remains unclear in this study growth parameters colony morphology and floatation sinking performance of microcystis colonies were determined to explore how variations in colony morphology influence the buoyancy of colonies under different light conditions we quantified colony compactness through the cell volume to colony volume ratio vr and found different responses of colony size and vr under different light intensities microcystis colonies with higher vr could stay longer at the water surface under low light conditions which was beneficial for the long term growth and buoyancy maintenance however increased colony size and decreased compactness were observed at a later growth stage under relatively higher light intensity i e 108 µmol photons m 2 s 1 interestingly we found a counterintuitive negative correlation between colony size and buoyancy of microcystis under high light intensity additionally we found that the influence of colony morphology on buoyancy was stronger at high light intensity these results indicate that light could regulate the buoyancy via colonial morphology and that the role of colony morphology in buoyancy regulation needs to be accounted for in further studies under variable

threatens the safety of freshwater ecosystems and public health kosten et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 microcystis is one of the major cyanobacterial species that can form surface blooms with a series of negative effects to the aquatic environment and humans huisman et al 2018 song et al 2018 microcystis have specific adaptations which can facilitate their dominance over other competitors in aquatic environments including buoyancy regulation an annual growth cycle with a special storage strategy efficient nitrogen uptake and resistance to zooplankton grazing chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2012 among these adaptive strategies buoyancy regulation is regarded as most important for the formation and persistence of microcystis blooms walsby 1994 wu et al 2021 microcystis can adapt to changing environments by adjusting their buoyancy and are characterized by the following features low density and large size which was mainly related to the formation of gas vesicle and colonies respectively li et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 three mechanisms for buoyancy regulation have been proposed changes in cell ballast production and dilution of gas vesicles and irreversible collapse of gas vesicles walsby 1994 light is a critical environmental factor in buoyancy regulation and several studies demonstrated that the mass density of microcystis cells increases at high irradiance and that positive buoyancy can be derived from the gas vesicles at low irradiance deacon and walsby 1990 wei et al 2018 yao et al 2017 photosynthetic production and storage of carbohydrates tend to increase cell density during daytime and to decrease it at night the carbohydrate content of microcystis cells is positively correlated with cell density and negatively correlated with buoyancy gonzalez fernandez and ballesteros 2012 kromkamp and mur 1984 the majority of previous studies focused on the relationship between buoyancy of microcystis and the content of gas vesicles or the intracellular carbohydrate visser et al 1996 wei et al 2018 however field observations show that microcystis cells and colonies can maintain positive buoyancy also during long term light exposure cui et al 2016 li et al 2013a consequently there must be additional mechanisms supporting surface scum formation and persistence which potentially include gas bubble formation in colonies aparicio medrano et al 2016a dervaux et al 2015 or self shading of microcystis colonies wu et al 2021 colony formation is thought to be an important process for bloom formation larger colonies accumulate more easily at the water surface whereas smaller colonies do not remain at the water surface and are rather homogeneouls distributed throughout the surface mixed layer aparicio medrano et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 the vertical migration velocity of larger colonies is higher than that of small colonies and large colonies remain more easily at the water surface to form blooms wu et al 2020b many studies have reported a positive relationship between colony size and floatation velocity li et al 2016 wu et al 2020b xiao et al 2012 larger microcystis colonies have a longer daily averaged retention time at the water surface yao et al 2017 therefore large colonies can be considered as main contributors to microcystis surface scum formation two mechanisms for colony formation in microcystis have been recognized i cell division where cells remain attached after binary fission and the daughter cells become enveloped in a layer of secreted extracellular polysaccharides eps that prevents their separation ii cell or colony adhesion where single cells or colonies aggregate which is also promoted by the secretion of adhesive eps li et al 2013b xiao et al 2017 the buoyancy of microcystis colonies depends on both the cell and eps content wei et al 2021 wu et al 2020a previous studies indicated that microcystis colonies with high compactness here defined as the volume ratio of cells to colonies vr are more buoyant than colonies with lower vr reynolds 2007 wu et al 2021 larger colony compactness can result in higher floatation velocities and longer retention of microcystis colonies at the water surface wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 improved knowledge about the processes that govern and promote microcystis scum formation are critical for successful prediction and for the development of lake management and mitigation strategies thus it is of great significance to explore the influence of colony size and compactness on floatation behavior of microcystis colonies however the effect of the morphological changes of microcystis colonies under different light intensities on their buoyancy and floatation has not been adequately explored we supposed that morphological changes of microcystis colonies play an important role in their buoyancy regulation under different light conditions we performed laboratory experiments to explore the effect of light intensity on the growth rate morphology and floatation behavior of microcystis colonies in particular we evaluated the influence of colony size and compactness on its floatation behavior the results of the present study are supposed to advance the understanding about the retention of microcystis colonies at the water surface under different light conditions and contribute to improving the prediction of bloom formation and bloom dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 organisms and culture conditions a stock of microcystis colonies was collected at the water surface 0 30 cm depth of the guanqiao fishpond wuhan hubei province china using a silk plankton net with 63 µm mesh size during a cyanobacteria bloom to select predominantly microcystis colonies with similar morphology wu et al 2021 the samples were first filtered through a 180 μm sieve to remove large particles and then through a 45 μm sieve to remove single cells and smaller sized colonies the selection of the size range was based on the particle size distributions fig s1a b and flowcam results of microcystis colonies collected from guanqiao fishpond fig s1c the sieved microcystis colonies were washed two times using distilled water and bg 11 medium 10 v v wu et al 2020b the colonies were then pre cultured in 1 2 l of diluted bg 11 medium 10 v v which was found to provide most favorable conditions for microcystis colonies growth fig s2 the pre cultures were maintained in a 2 l transparent conical flask at a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 and a temperature of 25 1 c until the desired cell density for each experiment was obtained all culture media were sterile filtered through gf membranes 0 22 µm pore size before inoculation microscopic observations showed that the collected phytoplankton species were predominantly microcystis mainly m viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii which accounted for 98 of the total biovolume fig s1d 2 2 experimental design for the experiments cultured microcystis colonies were successively filtered through 180 µm and 45 µm sieves before inoculation into 1 l transparent conical flasks containing 600 ml of diluted bg 11 medium 10 v v with an initial density of 9 4 108 cells l 1 for an experimental period of 42 days three replicated flasks were exposed to four different light intensities respectively with a light dark ratio of 12 h 12 h 7 30 am to 7 30 pm and at a temperature of 25 1 c according to the result of previous studies chalifour et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 we refer to high light intensity groups in the following if the light intensity was exceeding 100 µmol photons m 2 s 1 a control group group d was under continuous dark conditions 0 µmol photons m 2 s 1 low light intensity groups group l1 and l2 were exposed to 18

bg 11 medium 10 ml was added to each flask every three days to maintain the essential nutrients for algae to grow time series of total nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations are shown in fig s3 the conical flasks were slightly shaken twice each day 7 30 am and 7 30 pm all the experimental utensils and media were autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before usage as a diurnal pattern in the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies was not observed in the culture during 24 h the effects of changes in mass density of microcystis cells and self shading on the floatation behavior of colonies was not considered during the experimental period water samples were collected at mid depth of the conical flasks after slight mixing at 8 00 am every two days to measure cell density and every three days to measure colony size of microcystis chlorophyll a concentration chl a the photochemical efficiency of psⅱ qy equivalent to f v f m and volume ratio of cells to the colony vr compactness of microcystis colonies were measured every six days as the microcystis colony samples from the very thin surface and the bottom of the 1 l conical flasks were difficult to collect an additional experiment was conducted to analyze the influence of compactness and colony size on colony buoyancy at different growth phases and under different light intensities firstly the colony samples were collected at the middle of the flasks after slight mixing at day 18 day 30 and day 42 which represent the mid exponential growth phase the end exponential phase and the stationary or decline phase respectively then the samples were diluted in 10 ml centrifuge tubes 8 cm height and placed without movement for 5 h at a temperature of 25 1 c and a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 in these samples we measured cell density colony size and vr and calculated the percentage of the total biomass of microcystis colonies that were collected at the water surface and at the bottom of tubes after 5 h to ensure complete floatation or sinking respectively 2 3 measurement of growth parameters samples of 3 ml were taken from the experimental flasks every 6 days to measure chl a and photochemical efficiency of psⅱ qy equivalent to f v f m using a portable fluorometer aquapen c ap c 100 photon system instruments czech republic after being darkened for 15 min the cell density c cell l 1 was counted in a hemocytometer using an optical microscope bx43 olympus corporation at 40x magnification after being disintegrated by alkaline hydrolysis with 0 05 mol l 1 sodium hydroxide at 85 c for 6 8 min wang et al 2015 every 2 days the exponential growth rate µ was calculated for the initial exponential growth phase as 1 μ ln c l ln c 0 t 1 t 0 where c l cell l 1 and c 0 cell l 1

positively and negatively buoyant colonies in samples collected at day 18 day 30 and day 42 8 00 am to ensure that all floating and sinking colonies the samples were diluted in 10 ml centrifugation tubes 8 cm height and placed without movement for 5 h at a temperature of 25 1 c and a light intensity of 27 µmol photons m 2 s 1 then 2 ml samples were collected from the surface and the bottom of the 10 ml centrifuge tubes and used to determine the cell density median colony size d 50 and vr of both floating colonies c f and sinking colonies c s using the methods described above the percentages of floating colonies f and sinking colonies s were calculated as 4 f c f 2 ml c 10 ml 100 5 s c s 2 ml c 10 ml 100 where c f cell l 1 and c s cell l 1 was the cell density of colonies

correlations between sampling time light intensity colony size and vr significance was tested for a probably value p 0 05 3 results 3 1 growth of microcystis under different light intensities during the first 30 days of the experiment the cell densities and chl a concentrations increased continuously in all illuminated groups fig 1 a and b the maximal cell densities at the end of the initial growth phase were generally higher for higher light intensities 8 7 109 1 3 1010 1 4 1010 and 1 6 1010 cells l 1 for the groups l1 h2 respectively after the initial growth phase the cell densities remained nearly constant under low light conditions group l1 l2 whereas the cell densities of the high light intensity groups group h1 h2 decreased from day 30 to day 42 at the end of the experimental period day 42 the cell densities in both low light intensity groups were higher than those in the high light intensity groups under dark condition the cell density increased slightly during the first 6 days and then decreased for the remaining experimental period with a maximal cell density of 1 18 109 cell l 1 a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the cell density and the logarithm of chl a r 2 0 96 fig s4 the exponential growth rates during the initial period were generally increasing with increasing light intensity table 1 the increase of the growth rates with light intensity was not linear but could be well described by a logarithmic relationship r 2 0 95 fig s5 the duration of the initial growth period was slightly lower 30 days in the high light intensity groups than in the low light groups 36 days the net growth rate of microcystis was increasing or fluctuating during the first 18 days and then decreased continuously from day 18 to day 42 in all illuminated groups fig 1c for the high light intensity groups the net growth rate became negative after day 36 in contrast the net growth rate of the low light intensity group was positive also after day 36 under dark condition the net growth rate of microcystis colonies was positive during the initial 6 days and negative during the remaining experimental time the photochemical efficiency of psⅱ of microcystis colonies fluctuated between 0 21 and 0 34 in the four different light intensities group l1 h2 whereas it decreased from 0 32 to 0 19 under dark condition fig 1d the mean photochemical efficiency of all illuminated groups group l1 2 and group h1 2 was similar ranging from 0 25 to 0 27 and higher than that of group d 0 23 3 2 colony size distribution during the first six days of the experiment the median colony size d 50 increased in all experimental groups including the dark group at similar rates while in the dark group the colony size remained at a relatively constant value of 154 µm throughout the remaining experimental period the colony sizes in the illuminated groups continued to increase before leveling off at larger maximum sizes fig 2 a the maximal d 50 under the different light conditions l1 to h2 were 174 µm 224 µm 318 µm and 307 µm respectively in both high light intensity groups the colony size was similar and reached maximum values at the end of the experimental period under dark conditions the biovolume concentration of microcystis colonies decreased continuously during the experiment especially for the smallest size class 0 150 µm fig 2b the total biovolume of microcystis colonies in cotrast increased under all light conditions fig 2c f the biovolume of microcystis colonies in different size classes showed different temporal dynamics in the experimental groups mainly resulting from differences in the medium size class 150 300 µm obviously the concentration of large colonies 300 500 µm was small under lower light intensity fig 2c d but continuously increased under high light intensity fig 2e f generally the temporal dynamics observed in the colony size distributions appeared to be unrelated to the dynamics in cell density 3 3 colony compactness the cell to colony volume ratio vr increased with time for the lowest light intensity from 0 03 to 0 05 whereas it decreased continuously from 0 04 to 0 01 for all higher light intensities fig 3 the mean vr of the four different experimental groups decreased with increasing light intensity 3 4 percentages of floating and sinking colonies the cell density at the water surface floating microcystis colonies increased with increasing light intensity during the first measurements day 18 while it was less variable among the experimental groups at day 30 and showed an opposing trend with lowest densities for highest light intensities at the final sampling on day 42 fig 4 a the cell density of sinking microcystis colonies was significantly lower under dark group d and low light l1 conditions than under higher light intensities p 0 05 fig 4b there were significant differences between cell densities of sinking colonies observed at the same time under different light intensities and at different days of each light intensity group p 0 05 the percentages of floating microcystis colonies were comparatively high 40 6 to 59 2 at low light intensity but decreased from 51 8 to 13 2 continuously from day 18 to day 42 at high light intensities fig 4c meanwhile the percentage of sinking microcystis colonies was positively correlated with light intensity and there was a significant difference between the percentages for group l1 and the other experimental groups p 0 05 the percentage of sinking microcystis colonies was similar at the three sampling days 4 5 to 8 6 for the lowest light intensity group l1 however it increased with time at high light intensities group h1 h2 where it ranged from 10 8 to 52 3 these results indicate that microcystis colonies are more buoyant at low light intensities and are predominantly sinking for both dark conditions and high light intensities at the later growth stage i e after day 18 fig s6 under dark condition the cell density of floating microcystis was extremely low and the percentage of sinking microcystis increased with time from 2 9 to nearly 60 3 5 colony size of floating and sinking colonies the median size of floating microcystis colonies d 50 was similar in all groups at day 18 120 µm to 146 µm whereas it was increasing with increasing light intensity at day 30 and 42 fig 5 a the increase of d 50 from day 18 to day 42 was larger at high light intensities h1 220 µm h2 199 µm than under low light conditions l1 26 µm l2 71 µm p 0 01 under dark conditions d 50 of floating microcystis colonies increased continuously from 146 µm to 222 µm on day 18 and day 42 respectively for sinking microcystis colonies the d 50 of the high light intensity groups was higher than that of the low light intensity groups and there was a significant difference in d 50 among different light intensity groups except for group l2 at day 30 fig 5b the d 50 of sinking microcystis colonies under low light conditions first increased and then decreased with time whereas in the high light intensity groups the d 50 of sinking microcystis colonies continuously increased from 236 µm to 303 µm the size of floating and sinking microcystis colonies differed significantly except for group d at day 18 and group l1 at day 18 and 42 fig 5c on day 18 and day 30 floating colonies were smaller than sinking colonies under all four light conditions however the d 50 of floating colonies was larger than that of sinking colonies under dark condition and high light intensities at day 42 indicating that both the larger sized colonies under high light intensity and smaller sized of colonies under dark condition were less buoyant at the final stage of the experiment 3 6 compactness of floating and sinking colonies the vr of floating microcystis colonies showed no consistent temporal trend or dependence on light intensity fig 6 a for the lowest light intensity l1 vr increased over time whereas the vr of floating microcystis colonies of the groups l2 and h1 slightly decreased from 0 06 to 0 02 and 0 06 to 0 03 respectively under the highest light intensity vr of floating microcystis colonies first decreased from 0 07 to 0 03 and then increased to 0 05 however the vr of floating microcystis colonies was highest 0 45 at the last sampling under dark condition the vr of sinking microcystis colonies was highest for the low light intensity group l1 fig 6b here the vr of sinking colonies first increased from 0 1 to 0 2 and then decreased to 0 18 for the high light intensity groups h1 and h2 vr of sinking colonies decreased from 0 07 to 0 05 and from 0 05 to 0 04 respectively under dark condition vr of sinking microcystis colonies increased from 0 05 to 0 08 the vr of floating microcystis colonies was mostly lower than that of sinking microcystis colonies at all light intensities except for group h1 at day 18 and group h2 at day 18 42 fig 6c under dark conditions the vr of floating microcystis colonies was larger than that of sinking microcystis colonies at all sampling times p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effect of light intensity on growth and colony size to analyze the effects of light induced changes in colony morphology on their floatation behavior we performed replicated laboratory experiments with cultures of natural microcystis strains during the first 30 to 36 days of the experiment the algae were growing exponentially with light limited growth in the two low light intensity groups and similar growth rates in the two high light intensity groups fig 1 table 1 the growth rates could be described by a logarithmic dependence on light intensity and were in the range to those reported for microcystis in previous studies from 0 008 d 1 at 10 µmol photons m 2 s 1 to 0 215 d 1 at 200 µmol photons m 2 s 1 xiao et al 2012 light inhibition as it has been found in other studies at light intensities being comparable to the highest intensity used in our study 200 µmol photons m 2 s 1 cheng and zhang 2020 islam and beardall 2017 was not observed the different results reported in these studies might be due to the different strains of microcystis and experimental conditions including nutrient concentrations and incubation volume moreover self shading of microcystis colonies may exist which can reduce light inhibition at high light intensities wu et al 2021 previous studies have also shown that small changes in the concentrations of nitrogen n and phosphorous p can significantly influence the growth of microcystis vezie et al 2002 xu et al 2010 the concentration thresholds for eutrophication in freshwaters are 0 50 1 00 mg l 1 for n and 0 02 0 1 mg l 1 for p lin et al 2008 the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was comparably high 13 8 to 55 0 mg l 1 for the light groups whereas the total dissolved phosphorous concentration tdp was relatively low i e 0 01 to 0 03 mg l 1 for group h1 2 after day 24 fig s3 during the later stage of the experiments phosphorous deficiency may have been a limiting factor for microcystis growth these conditions may also have affected the growth stagnation at low light intensities and the population decline at high light intensities during the later experimental phase 30 42 days nevertheless the observed dynamics in colony size and morphology appeared to differ from that of the microcystis growth microcystis colonies were larger under high light intensities than at low light intensity fig 2a this result is consistent with previous studies reporting that low light intensity is unfavorable for large microcystis colonies which form at higher light intensity 36 288 µmol photons m 2 s 1 zhang et al 2014 increased eps content was considered to stimulate colony formation of microcystis xu et al 2016 yang et al 2008 at the beginning of our experiment day 0 to day 18 microcystis colonies were compact i e were characterized by a high ratio of cell volume to colony volume vr at all light intensities from day 18 to day 42 the colonies exposed to low light intensities group l1 l2 remained compact whereas at high light intensities group h1 h2 colonies became looser indicating increasing mucilage eps content in the colonies fig s7 the two formerly proposed mechanisms for colony formation can be expected to result in different dynamics of vr cell division was associated with an increase in vr whereas colony adhesion would be associated with decreasing or low vr due to the secreted bound eps wu et al 2020a xiao et al 2017 in the present experiments vr of microcystis colonies was increasing with time for the lowest light intensity 18 µmol photons m 2 s 1 whereas it was decreasing with time under higher light intensities 54 216 µmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 3 thus the dominant mechanism of colony formation was cell division under lower light intensities and colony adhesion under higher light intensities this result is similar to those of previous studies which reported that colony formation by cell division dominated at low light intensities xiao et al 2018 2017 the decrease of vr suggests that eps production of microcystis significantly increased under high light intensities which confirms former findings xiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the absence of large colonies at the lowest light intensity fig 2c suggests that not only population growth but also colony size was limited by light under these conditions microcystis colonies below the surface scum will absorb less light due to self shading wu et al 2021 moreover the attenuation of light within colonies was found to follow the lambert beer law and depends on cell concentration in the colony feng et al 2019 with cell division being to the dominant mechanism for colony formation at low light intensity both the cell concentration per colony and the colony size increased resulting in increasing light attenuation within the colonies 4 2 effect of colony morphology on buoyancy the eps content in the colonies affects their buoyancy and therewith their floatation and sinking behavior chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 except for the lowest light intensity l1 the percentage of sinking colonies in our experiments increased over time and reached more than 50 fig s6 we suggest that the continuously increasing production and internal storage of carbohydrates under higher light intensities kromkamp and mur 1984 visser et al 1996 yao et al 2017 was the main reason for this decrease in colony buoyancy we found that microcystis colonies with higher vr high light intensity were more buoyant than colonies with smaller vr fig 5 6 which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 however the opposite phenomenon was observed on day 30 when large colonies with high vr sank under low light conditions and smaller colonies with lower vr remained at the water surface fig 5 6 since the density of mucilage is higher than the density of water there must be at least one additional mechanism that provides buoyancy to floating microcystis colonies gas production in cell vesicles is limited by the availability of photosynthetic products and is approximately linearly related to light intensity between 0 and 20 µmol photons m 2 s 1 deacon and walsby 1990 thus the buoyancy of microcystis cells in colonies would decrease with increasing colony size and vr under low light conditions in addition to cellular gas content oxygen production and limited gas diffusion in large colonies can lead to dissolved gas supersaturation and the nucleation of bubbles that are trapped within the mucilage and provide additional buoyancy aparicio medrano et al 2016a dervaux et al 2015 oxygen gas bubble formation depends on photosynthetic rates which are limited by light intensity therefore we speculate that the attenuation of light inside colonies with high vr at low light intensity and bubble production within colony mucilage under high light intensity were the main reasons for the floatation behavior of microcystis colonies in our experiment existing mechanistic models for the vertical distribution dynamics of microcystis consider ensembles of different colony sizes with distinct vr aparicio medrano et al 2016b ranjbar et al 2021 but these models do not account for dynamic changes in colony morphology in response to light conditions to inform models and to improve predictions of bloom formation and persistence future experimental work should therefore focus on a parametrization of changes in colony morphology under dynamic light conditions 4 3 buoyancy regulation by morphological variance generally cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes can be classified into three stages 1 bloom development during late spring to early summer when microcystis accumulates and form surface scum 2 bloom maintenance during mid summer to middle autumn when microcystis are broadly distributed at the water surface of the lake 3 bloom decay in late autumn when the blooms disaggregate and decline tang et al 2018 seasonal changes in morphospecies composition and colony size of microcystis were investigated in lake taihu li et al 2013a where it was found that the colony size of microcystis increased contuneously starting from april reaching a maximum size in october before it decreased rapidly after november the massive accumulation of microcystis at the water surface in lake taihu was always accompanied by large sizes of microcystis colonies zhu et al 2014 similarly we found that microcystis colonies were larger under high light intensity fig 2 and that larger colonies with higher vr could stay longer at the water surface wu et al 2020a yao et al 2017 however higher light intensity may decrease vr and promote the sinking of the colonies indicating that the variation of vr of microcystis colonies may respond to seasonal changes in enviromental conditions i e nutrient concentrations light and temperature which should not be neglected therefore the dynamics of colony size and vr which can cause changes in colony buoyancy through light mediated variations of colony morphology should be monitored more frequently to better predict the floatation behavior of microcystis colonies and the persistence of surface scum 5 conclusions this study examined the effects of colony size and compactness on floatation and sinking of microcystis colonies under different light intensities under light limiting growth conditions microcystis colony size and cell to colony volume ratio varied with light intensity at low light intensity 18 µmol photons m 2 s 1 colony formation was mostly governed by cell division in contrast to cell and colony adhesion under higher light intensities 54 µmol photons m 2 s 1 low light intensity was favorable for the persistence of high microcystis biomass of microcystis colonies at the water surface future investigations will be aimed toward identifying factors that control colony

14876,the majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib to develop criteria for promoting the general public s health to address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of fib in indicating health risks we developed a nanopore metagenomic sequencing based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide pma and cellular spike ins using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat killed cells we observed near complete relic dna removal by pma with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells demonstrating the feasibility of pma treatment in profiling viable cells by nanopore sequencing on a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification we then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable escherichia coli and vibrio spp in beach waters by comparing to culture based method which were also in high agreement furthermore we demonstrated that 1 gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of 10 cells ml in beach waters using our viability resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water we conducted 1 screening

safeguarding the health and welfare of the public as bathers in coastal waters experience greater health risks than non bathers leonard et al 2018 in monitoring the microbial quality of beach waters levels of faecal indicator bacteria fib have been routinely used for indicating compliance to an acceptable health risk owing to its significant correlation to human illness and its simple enumeration in practice lim et al 2017 however recent studies have addressed limitations in using fib for beach water risk assessment lim et al 2017 tymensen et al 2015 including its technical delay in effective risk management decision making and its limited power in indicating the human health risk of etiologic pathogenic agents pertinent to waterborne infections for a diverse range of scenarios though culturing is still the universally recognized gold standard in practice its time consuming laborious potentially subjective nature and narrow coverage li et al 2014 to all viable microbes impair its ability to trigger early alerts for quick beach notification advisories to provide rapid water quality determination dna based quantitative pcr qpcr techniques which can provide measurements in only a few hours have been actively explored by both academic and governmental entities for the estimation of the fib cell densities chern et al 2011 walker et al 2017 metagenomics has also quickly gained popularity in environmental microbial surveillance due to its profound ability to comprehensively reveal the microbial structure and potential resistance and virulence recent technological advances in real time sequencing on the portal sequencer e g the minion sequencer by oxford nanopore technologies ont have further accelerated the results generation enabling near real time microbial risk monitoring however like all dna based tools hurdles remain in generating absolute microbial quantification of only those membrane intact hereafter referred to as live cells using metagenomic tools hampering their capacity to predict the microbial risk of water bodies furthermore as much of the statutory regulations in beach water quality rely on the absolute counts of cells genome copies gene copies relative quantification results are ineffective in directly correlating the enumeration results to risks additionally the high fraction lennon et al 2018 and the persistence bae and wuertz 2009 of relic dna from the extracellular dna pool or membrane compromised cells also referred to as dead could obscure our understanding of the viable microbial composition thus misinforming the level of microbiological contamination and risk of recreational coastal waters and compromising the managerial practices in ensuring beach water safety fibs have been traditionally selected to indicate human health risks posed by human faecal pollution due to the significant fib risk association documented in sewage impacted beaches in epidemiological studies usepa 2012 however the reliability of fib to imply human faecal pollution has been recently called into question due to the observed fib naturalization phenomenon i e survival and replication of fib in the environment lim et al 2017 tymensen et al 2015 and inconsistent correlations reported between fib measurements and swimmers illnesses harwood et al 2014 sercu et al 2009 as an alternative to fib quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been recommended by who for aiding site specific recreational water safety management who 2016 in addressing these issues we designed a rapid nanopore metagenomic sequencing workflow to absolutely quantify only the viable microorganisms to reveal the relevant microbial risks of beach waters in achieving so we incorporated a photoreactive intercalating dye propidium monoazide pma at the sample pre treatment stage to block the relic dna signal in sequencing we then systematically evaluated the feasibility accuracy and rapidity of our pma based viable cell absolute quantification approach and investigated the impact of pma on microbial profiling for beach waters finally implementing our methodology we demonstrated a screening level qmra to assess human health risks associated with exposure to pathogens and resistome supplementing a metagenomics based risk assessment tool apart from marine beach water quality monitoring we further envision our established workflow to be beneficial to other fields in monitoring microbiological safety such as food security and freshwater monitoring 2 materials and methods 2 1 evaluation of the feasibility of pma in blocking relic dna signals in nanopore sequencing the feasibility of using pma to block relic dna was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic communities where qualitative feasibility was tested in terms of relic dna depletion in pure culture mixtures fig 1 a 1 details in si1 s1 and under the potential marine water matrix effect fig 1a 2 details in si1 s2 and quantitative feasibility referred to the reconstruction of the viable microbial composition fig 1a 3 details in si1 s3 for such evaluation synthetic microbial communities were constructed by considering different mixing scenarios i e live dead live live and dead dead for gram positive and negative bacteria mixtures were aliquoted into 2 equal portions for testing the effect of pma treatment 2 2 evaluation of the accuracy of cellular

previous work yang et al 2022 scaling factors were used to normalize sequenced copy numbers of genome gene into their absolute abundances in the actual sample under the assumptions that 1 microbial cells shared the same extraction efficiencies and experimental recovery rates with the spike in cell and 2 args and the spike in fluorescent marker gene had the same mapping recovery modifications in our present study were that 1 as viable cells were of focus spike in cells were dosed at their exponential growth phase viable 2 for zymobiomics gut microbiome standard zymo research usa composed of mixtures of pure cultures an adjustment factor was applied to the scaling factor to account for the difference in coverages between the single copy fluorescent marker gene and the spike in genome for bacteria under exponential growth details in si1 s8 such adjustment factor was not applied to marine beach water samples 3 in calculating the sequenced genome copy number of a taxonomic lineage an

all beach waters to compare colony forming units cfu with our culture independent quantification results detailed in si1 s9 2 6 assessment of illness risk by qmra methodology using results generated by our pma enabled saq for viable cells screening level deterministic qmra was conducted to evaluate the probability of human health illnesses associated with bathing in public beaches per exposure event the typical qmra paradigm was adopted to determine human health risks problem formulation exposure assessment health effects assessment and risk characterization who 2016 detailed qmra methodology and model inputs for calculation were provided in si1 s10 briefly we selected 8 reference pathogenic bacteria si1 s10 table s12 to holistically take different swimming related infections e g gastrointestinal skin and pulmonary into account in the assessment as a simplistic demonstration all model inputs were point estimates except for the volume of accidental water ingestion during swimming which was modeled by a triangular distribution federigi et al 2020 we started by simulating 1000 random points following this distribution as the volume of accidentally ingested water using the r package kwb qmra v0 3 0 https github com kwb r kwb qmra these 1000 random points were then used for exposure assessment they were subsequently fed into the projection of the probability of infection or illness implementing published beta poisson si1 s10 eq s5 and exponential si1 s10 eq s6 dose response models haas et al 2014 finally the cumulative illness risk from exposure to all the 9 reference pathogens was computed to compare with the regulatory health outcomes si1 s10 eq s8 2 7 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed on r tests for association were computed with stats using spearman s rho on log transformed data equations and statistics relating to model fitting were generated using the stat poly eq function in ggpmisc aphalo 2023 alpha and beta diversities were calculated using vegan oksanen et al 2012 all principal coordinate analysis pcoa was carried out using ade4 dray and dufour 2007 fed with weighted bray curtis dissimilarity computed by the wcmdscale function in vegan based on lingoes corrected relative abundances at the genera for beach waters only those genus with min 0 05 cell abundance or species for synthetic bacterial communities levels the between sample difference in alpha diversities was conducted using the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test in ggpubr kassambara 2020 hedges g effect sizes were estimated using effsize torchiano 2020 chord diagrams were plotted using circlize gu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 pma could deplete relic dna while preserving viable microbial compositions in simple synthetic bacterial communities depletion of relic dna by pma reaction could happen at both dna extraction and dna sequencing stages and our results suggested that it happened equally to both gram positive and gram negative cells dna yields in the synthetic 2 bacteria mixtures were lower in samples treated with pma under the live dead scenario and remained practically unchanged under the live live scenario compared to pma untreated samples si2 table s4 si1 figure s1 suggesting that at the dna extraction stage pma could decrease the yield of non living dna while only slightly affect dna yields from living cells although dnas were still extracted for samples treated with pma under the dead dead mixing scenario no relic dna signals were detectable in the sequencing suggesting further inhibition of the relic dna signal generation by pma at the dna sequencing stage fig 3a in the dead dead mixing scenarios we observed complete removal of relic dnas by pma for synthetic communities of both gram stains under the live dead scenario successful differentiation was achieved between the viable and heat killed strains and the proportions of sequenced relic dna were lower than 0 01 for both gram stains si2 table s4 marine water matrix did not affect pma efficacy in blocking relic dna in evaluating the marine water matrix effect on the feasibility of pma reaction we dosed synthetic communities consisting of 4 bacterial species to the heat killed marine water mixture as shown in all 6 cases fig 3b noises of the relic dna were much diminished after the pma treatment and the microbial profiles generally only consisted of viable microorganisms particularly in the dead dead scenario case 6 the sequencing readouts were 2 orders of magnitude lower in the sample treated with pma si2 table s5 for the other scenarios case 1 5 only 2 81 7 25 of sequences were potential false positive signals which could be contributed by both the insufficiently removed dna in dead cells or the insufficiently killed thus still live cells viable microbial profiles were similar before and after pma treatments to investigate the capacity of pma to preserve the viable microbial composition we used 3 synthetic viable communities containing 5 different bacterial species mixed in different proportions fig 3c results suggested that pma generally reconstructed the viable microbial profiles and the two dimensional pcoa analysis revealed that each mixture represented a distinct viable synthetic community and pma treatment had a small alteration to the microbial profile in all mixtures as the profiles of samples treated with and without pma clustered fig 3d 3 2 pma enabled in silico absolute quantification of viable microbial cells saq approach reproduced the theoretical absolute profile of a mock standard at the species level and spike ins of both gram stains performed equally well quantification results revealed broadly similar abundances among the estimated and expected species at the logarithmic scale fig 4a and high agreements both had a log transformed spearman s ρ 0 95 were observed between the mean theoretical mock absolute profiles and the absolute profiles quantified using both gram positive and gram negative spike ins figs 4b si1 and s6 at the arithmetic level our approach demonstrated high accuracy for species of 0 001 relative cell abundances fig 4c with an average 29 deviation ranging from 0 15 to 69 si2 table s7 to the expected values however for species of ultra low relative cell abundances e g clostridium p perfringens of 0 0001 cell abundance our approach generated a large deviation from the expected 1 3 times deviation high accordance between culture based and pma based saq results was achieved for beach waters we then integrated our saq workflow with pma treatment to examine if such workflow could achieve absolute counting of viable cells our results suggested a high correlation fig 4d log transformed spearman s ρ 0 94 si2 table s8 between our in silico estimated viable cell count and cfu results for bacterial species of different concentration i e e coli 2 logs 100 ml and vibrio spp 3 4 logs 100 ml subsampling results suggested that 1 gbases sequencing data for recreational marine waters would be sufficient for quantifying species of a minimum of 10 cells ml to the absolute level fig 4e g with high log transformed spearman correlations ρ 0 94 si2 table s9 however such minimum data size requirement for putative pathogenic species absolute quantification would rise to 5 gbases log transformed spearman s ρ 0 83 si1 figure s10 depending on the nanopore sequencing platform adopted 5 gbases of data could be generated in 8 10 h on minion or in 2 h on promethion https dnatech genomecenter ucdavis edu nanopore sequencing ont promethion this minimum data size proposed for pathogen quantification in marine waters was about 10 times as much as needed for sewage effluents yang et al 2022 this could be partially due to the higher microbial diversity in seawater than in wwtps wu et al 2019 and thus deep sequencing depths would be preferable for seawater pathogen quantification 3 3 effect of pma on microbial compositions variable proportions of dead cells were present in beach waters the average absolute abundance of the total microbial community untreated with pma was 4 66 10 7 cells l 3 16 6 52 10 7 cells l fig 5a si2 table s11 which was within the reported ranges kong et al 2021 after the pma treatment an average of 39 6 19 6 ranging from 25 68 of total microbial cell reduction was observed across all beaches resulting in an overall average viable microbial concentration of 2 78 10 7 cells l 1 65 4 74 10 7 cells l this suggested that a large fig 5b and variable fraction of microbial dna in beach waters was from dead cells and pma treatment could largely deplete them seven genera could induce large bias in pma untreated beach water profiling due to their low viability among all the identified genera 281 had at least 0 05 cell abundance in at least 1 beach water accounting for 77 6 5 02 total cell abundance and 71 4 2 79 viable cell abundance in total 29 genera were the most dominant top 10 abundancy in at least 1 beach colored bars in fig 5a comprising about half of the total microbial abundance in both the total and the living profiles si1 table s12 four genera i e o pelagibacterales g pelagibacter o rhodobacterales g himb11 o rhodobacterales g med g52 and o pseudomonadales g luminiphilus were especially abundant across all 4 samples making up 19 8 34 9 of the total microbial cellular abundances and 13 6 24 8 viable microbial cellular abundances in particular g pelagibacter alone accounted for 11 4 16 5 of the total microbial cellular abundance and 7 00 15 4 of the viable microbial abundance it belongs to the highly dominant sar11 clade in the p alphaproteobacteria in seawater often taking up 25 50 of the microbes in the marine and plays a significant role in the earth s carbon cycle morris et al 2002 we also identified 16 prevalent genera with at least 0 25 cell abundance across all 8 beach samples comprising 28 9 46 7 of the total microbial abundances si1 table s13 among these 281 genera 50 genera had the highest potential of contributing biases to microbial profiling for recreational marine waters as they had 50 viable cells across at least 3 of the 4 beaches fig 5e these genera were mostly from the classes of alphaproteobacteria 15 50 gammaproteobacteria 11 50 bacteriodia 8 50 and poseidoniia a 4 50 planktonic microbial archaea together they accounted for 23 3 7 99 of the total microbial concentrations and 9 81 4 31 of the viable microbial cells all these 77 important genera i e 29 dominant 16 prevalent and 50 low viability genera took up 43 65 of total microbial cell abundances fig 5f si2 table s14 specifically 7 of them were dominant genera that had low viability i e g actinomarina from f actinomarinaceae g himb11 g med g52 g himb59 g marinobacterium g scgc aaa076 p13 and g uba10364 which could potentially cause bias in beach water microbial profiling when relic dna was not removed and 4 of them were also prevalent genera across all 4 beach samples 3 4 screening level qmra quantified human health risks associated with swimming in beach waters due to exposure to human pathogens coastal recreational exposure to vibrio cholerae could pose important health risks fig 6a reported the probability of illness caused by each of the 8 different human pathogens and the total cumulative probability of illness taking all 8 pathogens into account together these pathogens are responsible for a wide range of adverse health outcomes e g gastrointestinal respiratory eye ear and skin ailments in most cases vibrio cholera an opportunistic pathogen tended to contribute predominantly to the total illness risk followed by campylobacter d jejuni and enterococci additionally when only considering the recommended fib for marine water quality monitoring usepa 2012 enterococci all 4 beaches complied the locally stipulated regulation 10 illnesses per 1000 swimmers hkepd 2022 however when considering the qmra result for marine water quality monitoring anglers beach avg 17 5 illnesses in 1000 exposures si2 table s15 exceeded the local benchmark and the other 3 beaches were at the marginally acceptable levels 6 2 7 8 illnesses per 1000 swimmers by the local guidelines qmra revealed site specific illness risk patterns in the 4 beaches that had diverse possible sources of pollution for example in trio beach which was predominantly impacted by a fish farm culture zone a high abundance of l pneumophila was found 3 6 times higher than other beaches si2 table s15 and the subsequent risk posed by legionella pneumophila was much elevated than in the other beaches for the 2 beaches potentially impacted by wwtps anglers and lido beaches the abundances and the associated health risks by vibrio parahaemolyticus were about 3 10 times higher than those unaffected by wwtps si2 figure s15 3 5 metagenomics enabled surveillance of args in viable cells could supplement risk assessment for beach waters on average these 4 beach waters had a total arg absolute abundance of 8 77 10 5 copies l fig 6b ranged from 7 62 10 5 to 1 11 10 6 copies l si2 table s16 a wide range of relic arg proportion was observed 3 0 64 resulting in an overall mean viable arg abundance of 6 08 10 5 copies l 4 01 10 5 7 98 10 5 copies l si1 fig s11 and 0 01 0 03 copies cell in total 42 arg subtypes belonging to 11 arg types were detected across these beaches ranging from 6 10 arg types 6 26 arg subtypes detected for a beach args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam tetracycline and bacitracin were found in all 4 beach waters accounting for an average of 66 of the total absolute abundance of arg copies together ranging from 31 to 90 si2 table s16b a large proportion of args in sewage impacted beaches were of high risks though lido beach impacted by sewage effluents had the lowest amount of active args i e active args inside of live cells si2 table s16c 60 of them were of the top 2 risk ranks encompassing those mobile args highly enriched in human impacted environments resulting in its highest absolute abundance of active risky args across all beaches fig 6b host tracking and genetic context investigation fig 6b also confirmed that args in viable bacterial cells in lido beach had the highest number of potentially pathogenic hosts and the highest capacity of mobility on the other hand tong fuk beach receiving limited human impact had the 2nd highest amount of args but only a quarter of them was of high risk to human health trio beach had the lowest proportion of high risk args 10 holistic consideration of human health risks associated with swimming could be achieved by combining qmra and resistome risk assessment when relying on e coli levels in beach water grading all 4 beaches complied with the local statutory water quality criteria 180 cfu 100 ml si2 table s8b with the 2 beaches potentially impacted by sewage effluent having the highest counts regarding the human illness risks associated with both enteric and opportunistic pathogens evaluated by qmra fig 6c lido tong fuk and trio had similarly marginally acceptable illness risks and illness probability exceeded the local regulation while still satisfying the usepa s recommendation in anglers beach that was possibly impacted by both aquaculture and wwtps health risks associated with resistome were the highest in lido beach and the lowest in trio beach all things considered trio had the overall lowest human risks anglers and lido had the highest risks with respect to the illness probability and resistome risks and tong fuk was in between 4 discussion microbiological safety assessment based on the counts of fib alone is not sufficient for assessing the risks of recreational marine waters in an array of contexts in this study we established a validated workflow for absolute quantification of viable microbial cells in beach waters we then implemented the pathogen abundances for qmra to assess risks associated with swimming and supplemented resistome as a part of the risk assessment related to difficulty in antibiotics treatment of illness caused by pathogenic bacteria in evaluating pma performance in the marine water environment we spiked synthetic communities mixed with heat killed and viable cells into heat killed marine debris and observed substantial relic dna depletion however as high as 8 of the sequencing output in samples treated with pma was undesirable the reasons for this could be multifaceted first it could be a result of insufficient pma intercalation that led to the persistence of some relic dnas second these undesirable dna could be originated from unsuccessfully killed viable microbes since their growths though almost negligible were observed on plates plated with heat killed marine waters si1 figure s3 finally it was worth mentioning that while comparable data output was achieved for pma untreated samples between the dead dead mixing scenario fig 3b case 6 and other scenarios mixed with live microorganisms fig 3b case 1 3 si2 table s5 2 orders of data output reduction was achieved after pma treatment in case 6 fig 3b indicating that signals of dead dnas could indeed be largely removed by pma treatment compared to dna degradation happened at the heat kill in the water bath stage though the matrix effect did not seem significant for marine waters in our study where marine biomass was collected from membrane filters through pbs environment specific optimization of the pma reaction conditions is strongly recommended for complete relic dna elimination when benchmarking the performance of our workflow using spike ins of 2 different gram stains we observed similar accuracies which could be attributed to the moderately extended cell disruption time as reported previously tourlousse et al 2021 2 rounds of 40s bead beating cycles were sufficient for releasing dna from gram positive cells with this respect we argue that with efficient cell lysis the cell wall structure type of spike ins does not affect the overall quantification accuracy high proportions of relic dna reported in this study avg 40 for beach waters and their potentially high persistence from hours to days under natural conditions bae and wuertz 2009 signify the importance of removing relic dnas for more accurate microbial risk assessment the largest effect of pma on microbial profiling laid in the total abundances fig 5b it has been reported that pma treatment improved the detection of rare taxa rogers et al 2013 and less abundant pathogenic bacteria reyneke et al 2022 which could be due to increased sequencing depth after removing relic signals we also had similar observations that echoed such claims as our arg host tracking results suggested that the changes in arg total abundances synchronized with the changes in the number of identified hosts si1 figure s11a b additionally some viable hosts of args and virulence factors were only revealed after pma treatment si1 figure s11c such as bacteroides and klebsiella in anglers and lido respectively adopting qmra we could identify region specific sources of risks which would be otherwise inaccessible by fib measurements only overall vibrio cholera contributed the most to the cumulative illness risk in beach waters suggesting that besides pathogens from fecal pollution indigenous coastal marine pathogens could also play a role in swimmers health additionally in trio beach a significantly high illness risks of legionella pneumophila was found which could be partly explained by two favourable conditions for l pneumophila in the nearby confined marine fish zones due to biofouling braithwaite and mcevoy 2005 of cages and nets and the presence of fish pathogenic amoebae as their hosts fields et al 2002 as the presence of l pneumophila in saline waters is largely facilitated by biofilm surman et al 2001 and protozoan hosts gast et al 2011 as anthropogenic activity has drastically accelerated the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment largely complicating treatments of resistance pathogens we surveyed viable pathogenic hosts of args to complement a holistic risk assessment si1 figure s12 in tong fuk beach highly effective carbapenem hydrolysing beta lactamases oxa 48 type meletis 2016 and an extended spectrum beta lactamase pdc 3 were both detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa a group of resistant pathogens listed as the first priority i e critical priority by who who 2017 assessment of resistome on pathogens augmented our vision on human health impacts in trio beach tetracycline resistance args were the most abundant arg si1 figure s11 and carried by g vibrio si1 figure s13 this could be related to the wide application of oxytetracycline during marine aquaculture production nonaka and suzuki 2002 in a nearby fish culture zone and it has been suggested that the impact of antibiotic application in aquaculture farms could extend to the environment schmidt et al 2000 additionally significantly higher tetracycline abundances were observed in fish farm samples compared to non fish farm samples jo et al 2021 corroborating our results interestingly we observed that the proportions of tetracycline and quinolone resistance genes carried by g vibrio were much enriched in the beach under the impact of fish farm culture zone trio and sewage effluent lido respectively si1 fig s13 and for the beach under the impact of both pollution sources anglers g vibrio had a relatively equal carriage of both arg types in fish farms tetracycline args were identified as dominant args and vibrio was the most prevalent pathogenic host of args jo et al 2021 as such we propose that such phenomenon could be used to source track and suggest the pollution level from aquaculture and sewage effluent in beach waters here we acknowledge a few limitations in our study that may guide future enhancements first the use of spike in in our study induced information loss of those microbes within the same genus as the spike in for example in saq for beach microbiome we removed all reads in g pseudomonas e which could result in data loss although this did not create barriers in our ability to quantify bacterial pathogen associated taxa we recommend tailored selections of the spike in s suitable for a specific environment second as our study only compared the culture based and metagenomics based counting results for viable gram negative cells i e e coli and vibrio spp significant unknown bias in pma based viable cell metagenomic quantification may be present due to the lack of a comprehensive assessment for a broad variety of microbial cells in a wide range of habitat conditions third as classification between closely related taxa remains challenging in metagenomic studies especially for error prone nanopore reads and species level diversity could be inflated by kraken2 so such data should be dealt with caution however the excelling runtime of kraken2 renders it a promising tool for fast screening of major features additionally kraken2 achieved high accuracies at the genus level and reasonable accuracies at the species level for nanopore reads and accuracy improved when imposing length filtering si1 fig s7 with the actively improving algorithms and long read sequencing chemistries pma based saq developed in this study will continue to grow in accuracy fourth although the feasibility of pma was tested in our study using 5 bacterial species covering cell wall structures of both gram stains they do not represent the entire complex community of the environmental samples therefore future efforts in testing taxon specific influence by pma for different sample types will be beneficial fifth the reliability of our assumption in using spike in cells to mimic the extraction behaviour of the complex and diverse microbial cells in the natural marine water deserves further investigation though we have demonstrated in fig 4b that cell wall structure did not seem to affect the results strongly for mixtures of pure microbial isolates potentially due to sufficient cell lysis in dna extraction the exact dna extraction behaviour of each different cells under different conditions remains unknown future research in establishing complex referencing standard material for benchmarking could be beneficial in further evaluation of quantitative microbial studies last though other pathogens protozoa and viruses were out of the scope of this study future risk assessment works incorporating them would allow for a more detailed understanding of microbial risks 5 conclusion in summary we proposed a metagenomics based in silico absolute live microbial cell quantification workflow to enumerate a broad spectrum of viable cells which ultimately would give meaningful results in microbial risk assessment efficiently a high correlation was observed between culture based enumeration and our pma based saq in marine beach waters supporting the immense potential of our workflow in absolutely enumerating viable cells applying our workflow we assessed the illness probability and the potential difficulty in illness treatment associated with swimming in different beaches by screening level qmra and metagenomics based arg risk assessment respectively achieving a holistic assessment of risks in exposure to pathogens and high risk args as antibiotic resistance is one of the most critical health challenges of the century refining qmra models to accurately estimate the human health risks from exposure to antibiotic resistant pathogens and args should be future priorities our metagenomics based absolute quantification of viable cells supports qmra in estimating local level exposure

14876,the majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib to develop criteria for promoting the general public s health to address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of fib in indicating health risks we developed a nanopore metagenomic sequencing based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide pma and cellular spike ins using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat killed cells we observed near complete relic dna removal by pma with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells demonstrating the feasibility of pma treatment in profiling viable cells by nanopore sequencing on a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification we then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable escherichia coli and vibrio spp in beach waters by comparing to culture based method which were also in high agreement furthermore we demonstrated that 1 gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of 10 cells ml in beach waters using our viability resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water we conducted 1 screening level quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to investigate human illness risk and site specific risk patterns that might guide risk management efforts and 2 metagenomics based resistome risk assessment to evaluate another layer of risk caused by difficult illness treatment due to antimicrobial resistance amr in summary our metagenomic workflow for the rapid absolute quantification of

quantification asf adjusted scaling factor cfu colony forming units pcoa principal coordinate analysis 1 introduction the microbiological safety of recreational coastal waters plays a vital role in safeguarding the health and welfare of the public as bathers in coastal waters experience greater health risks than non bathers leonard et al 2018 in monitoring the microbial quality of beach waters levels of faecal indicator bacteria fib have been routinely used for indicating compliance to an acceptable health risk owing to its significant correlation to human illness and its simple enumeration in practice lim et al 2017 however recent studies have addressed limitations in using fib for beach water risk assessment lim et al 2017 tymensen et al 2015 including its technical delay in effective risk management decision making and its limited power in indicating the human health risk of etiologic pathogenic agents pertinent to waterborne infections for a diverse range of scenarios though culturing is still the universally recognized gold standard in practice its time consuming laborious potentially subjective nature and narrow coverage li et al 2014 to all viable microbes impair its ability to trigger early alerts for quick beach notification advisories to provide rapid water quality determination dna based quantitative pcr qpcr techniques which can provide measurements in only a few hours have been actively explored by both academic and governmental entities for the estimation of the fib cell densities chern et al 2011 walker et al 2017 metagenomics has also quickly gained popularity in environmental microbial surveillance due to its profound ability to comprehensively reveal the microbial structure and potential resistance and virulence recent technological advances in real time sequencing on the portal sequencer e g the minion sequencer by oxford nanopore technologies ont have further accelerated the results generation enabling near real time microbial risk monitoring however like all dna based tools hurdles remain in generating absolute microbial quantification of only those membrane intact hereafter referred to as live cells using metagenomic tools hampering their capacity to predict the microbial risk of water bodies furthermore as much of the statutory regulations in beach water quality rely on the absolute counts of cells genome copies gene copies relative quantification results are ineffective in directly correlating the enumeration results to risks additionally the high fraction lennon et al 2018 and the persistence bae and wuertz 2009 of relic dna from the extracellular dna pool or membrane compromised cells also referred to as dead could obscure our understanding of the viable microbial composition thus misinforming the level of microbiological contamination and risk of recreational coastal waters and compromising the managerial practices in ensuring beach water safety fibs have been traditionally selected to indicate human health risks posed by human faecal pollution due to the significant fib risk association documented in sewage impacted beaches in epidemiological studies usepa 2012 however the reliability of fib to imply human faecal pollution has been recently called into question due to the observed fib naturalization phenomenon i e survival and replication of fib in the environment lim et al 2017 tymensen et al 2015 and inconsistent correlations reported between fib measurements and swimmers illnesses harwood et al 2014 sercu et al 2009 as an alternative to fib quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been recommended by who for aiding site specific recreational water safety management who 2016 in addressing these issues we designed a rapid nanopore metagenomic sequencing workflow to absolutely quantify only the viable microorganisms to reveal the relevant microbial risks of beach waters in achieving so we incorporated a photoreactive intercalating dye propidium monoazide pma at the sample pre treatment stage to block the relic dna signal in sequencing we then systematically evaluated the feasibility accuracy and rapidity of our pma based viable cell absolute quantification approach and investigated the impact of pma on microbial profiling for beach waters finally implementing our methodology we demonstrated a screening level qmra to assess human health risks associated with exposure to pathogens and resistome supplementing a metagenomics based risk assessment tool apart from marine beach water quality monitoring we further envision our established workflow to be beneficial to other fields in monitoring microbiological safety such as food security and freshwater monitoring 2 materials and methods 2 1 evaluation of the feasibility of pma in blocking relic dna signals in nanopore sequencing the feasibility of using pma to block relic dna was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic communities where qualitative feasibility was tested in terms of relic dna depletion in pure culture mixtures fig 1 a 1 details in si1 s1 and under the potential marine water matrix effect fig 1a 2 details in si1 s2 and quantitative feasibility referred to the reconstruction of the viable microbial composition fig 1a 3 details in si1 s3 for such evaluation synthetic microbial communities were constructed by considering different mixing scenarios i e live dead live live and dead dead for gram positive and negative bacteria mixtures were aliquoted into 2 equal portions for testing the effect of pma treatment 2 2 evaluation of the accuracy of cellular

previous work yang et al 2022 scaling factors were used to normalize sequenced copy numbers of genome gene into their absolute abundances in the actual sample under the assumptions that 1 microbial cells shared the same extraction efficiencies and experimental recovery rates with the spike in cell and 2 args and the spike in fluorescent marker gene had the same mapping recovery modifications in our present study were that 1 as viable cells were of focus spike in cells were dosed at their exponential growth phase viable 2 for zymobiomics gut microbiome standard zymo research usa composed of mixtures of pure cultures an adjustment factor was applied to the scaling factor to account for the difference in coverages between the single copy fluorescent marker gene and the spike in genome for bacteria under exponential growth details in si1 s8 such adjustment factor was not applied to marine beach water samples 3 in calculating the sequenced genome copy number of a taxonomic lineage an

all beach waters to compare colony forming units cfu with our culture independent quantification results detailed in si1 s9 2 6 assessment of illness risk by qmra methodology using results generated by our pma enabled saq for viable cells screening level deterministic qmra was conducted to evaluate the probability of human health illnesses associated with bathing in public beaches per exposure event the typical qmra paradigm was adopted to determine human health risks problem formulation exposure assessment health effects assessment and risk characterization who 2016 detailed qmra methodology and model inputs for calculation were provided in si1 s10 briefly we selected 8 reference pathogenic bacteria si1 s10 table s12 to holistically take different swimming related infections e g gastrointestinal skin and pulmonary into account in the assessment as a simplistic demonstration all model inputs were point estimates except for the volume of accidental water ingestion during swimming which was modeled by a triangular distribution federigi et al 2020 we started by simulating 1000 random points following this distribution as the volume of accidentally ingested water using the r package kwb qmra v0 3 0 https github com kwb r kwb qmra these 1000 random points were then used for exposure assessment they were subsequently fed into the projection of the probability of infection or illness implementing published beta poisson si1 s10 eq s5 and exponential si1 s10 eq s6 dose response models haas et al 2014 finally the cumulative illness risk from exposure to all the 9 reference pathogens was computed to compare with the regulatory health outcomes si1 s10 eq s8 2 7 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed on r tests for association were computed with stats using spearman s rho on log transformed data equations and statistics relating to model fitting were generated using the stat poly eq function in ggpmisc aphalo 2023 alpha and beta diversities were calculated using vegan oksanen et al 2012 all principal coordinate analysis pcoa was carried out using ade4 dray and dufour 2007 fed with weighted bray curtis dissimilarity computed by the wcmdscale function in vegan based on lingoes corrected relative abundances at the genera for beach waters only those genus with min 0 05 cell abundance or species for synthetic bacterial communities levels the between sample difference in alpha diversities was conducted using the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test in ggpubr kassambara 2020 hedges g effect sizes were estimated using effsize torchiano 2020 chord diagrams were plotted using circlize gu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 pma could deplete relic dna while preserving viable microbial compositions in simple synthetic bacterial communities depletion of relic dna by pma reaction could happen at both dna extraction and dna sequencing stages and our results suggested that it happened equally to both gram positive and gram negative cells dna yields in the synthetic 2 bacteria mixtures were lower in samples treated with pma under the live dead scenario and remained practically unchanged under the live live scenario compared to pma untreated samples si2 table s4 si1 figure s1 suggesting that at the dna extraction stage pma could decrease the yield of non living dna while only slightly affect dna yields from living cells although dnas were still extracted for samples treated with pma under the dead dead mixing scenario no relic dna signals were detectable in the sequencing suggesting further inhibition of the relic dna signal generation by pma at the dna sequencing stage fig 3a in the dead dead mixing scenarios we observed complete removal of relic dnas by pma for synthetic communities of both gram stains under the live dead scenario successful differentiation was achieved between the viable and heat killed strains and the proportions of sequenced relic dna were lower than 0 01 for both gram stains si2 table s4 marine water matrix did not affect pma efficacy in blocking relic dna in evaluating the marine water matrix effect on the feasibility of pma reaction we dosed synthetic communities consisting of 4 bacterial species to the heat killed marine water mixture as shown in all 6 cases fig 3b noises of the relic dna were much diminished after the pma treatment and the microbial profiles generally only consisted of viable microorganisms particularly in the dead dead scenario case 6 the sequencing readouts were 2 orders of magnitude lower in the sample treated with pma si2 table s5 for the other scenarios case 1 5 only 2 81 7 25 of sequences were potential false positive signals which could be contributed by both the insufficiently removed dna in dead cells or the insufficiently killed thus still live cells viable microbial profiles were similar before and after pma treatments to investigate the capacity of pma to preserve the viable microbial composition we used 3 synthetic viable communities containing 5 different bacterial species mixed in different proportions fig 3c results suggested that pma generally reconstructed the viable microbial profiles and the two dimensional pcoa analysis revealed that each mixture represented a distinct viable synthetic community and pma treatment had a small alteration to the microbial profile in all mixtures as the profiles of samples treated with and without pma clustered fig 3d 3 2 pma enabled in silico absolute quantification of viable microbial cells saq approach reproduced the theoretical absolute profile of a mock standard at the species level and spike ins of both gram stains performed equally well quantification results revealed broadly similar abundances among the estimated and expected species at the logarithmic scale fig 4a and high agreements both had a log transformed spearman s ρ 0 95 were observed between the mean theoretical mock absolute profiles and the absolute profiles quantified using both gram positive and gram negative spike ins figs 4b si1 and s6 at the arithmetic level our approach demonstrated high accuracy for species of 0 001 relative cell abundances fig 4c with an average 29 deviation ranging from 0 15 to 69 si2 table s7 to the expected values however for species of ultra low relative cell abundances e g clostridium p perfringens of 0 0001 cell abundance our approach generated a large deviation from the expected 1 3 times deviation high accordance between culture based and pma based saq results was achieved for beach waters we then integrated our saq workflow with pma treatment to examine if such workflow could achieve absolute counting of viable cells our results suggested a high correlation fig 4d log transformed spearman s ρ 0 94 si2 table s8 between our in silico estimated viable cell count and cfu results for bacterial species of different concentration i e e coli 2 logs 100 ml and vibrio spp 3 4 logs 100 ml subsampling results suggested that 1 gbases sequencing data for recreational marine waters would be sufficient for quantifying species of a minimum of 10 cells ml to the absolute level fig 4e g with high log transformed spearman correlations ρ 0 94 si2 table s9 however such minimum data size requirement for putative pathogenic species absolute quantification would rise to 5 gbases log transformed spearman s ρ 0 83 si1 figure s10 depending on the nanopore sequencing platform adopted 5 gbases of data could be generated in 8 10 h on minion or in 2 h on promethion https dnatech genomecenter ucdavis edu nanopore sequencing ont promethion this minimum data size proposed for pathogen quantification in marine waters was about 10 times as much as needed for sewage effluents yang et al 2022 this could be partially due to the higher microbial diversity in seawater than in wwtps wu et al 2019 and thus deep sequencing depths would be preferable for seawater pathogen quantification 3 3 effect of pma on microbial compositions variable proportions of dead cells were present in beach waters the average absolute abundance of the total microbial community untreated with pma was 4 66 10 7 cells l 3 16 6 52 10 7 cells l fig 5a si2 table s11 which was within the reported ranges kong et al 2021 after the pma treatment an average of 39 6 19 6 ranging from 25 68 of total microbial cell reduction was observed across all beaches resulting in an overall average viable microbial concentration of 2 78 10 7 cells l 1 65 4 74 10 7 cells l this suggested that a large fig 5b and variable fraction of microbial dna in beach waters was from dead cells and pma treatment could largely deplete them seven genera could induce large bias in pma untreated beach water profiling due to their low viability among all the identified genera 281 had at least 0 05 cell abundance in at least 1 beach water accounting for 77 6 5 02 total cell abundance and 71 4 2 79 viable cell abundance in total 29 genera were the most dominant top 10 abundancy in at least 1 beach colored bars in fig 5a comprising about half of the total microbial abundance in both the total and the living profiles si1 table s12 four genera i e o pelagibacterales g pelagibacter o rhodobacterales g himb11 o rhodobacterales g med g52 and o pseudomonadales g luminiphilus were especially abundant across all 4 samples making up 19 8 34 9 of the total microbial cellular abundances and 13 6 24 8 viable microbial cellular abundances in particular g pelagibacter alone accounted for 11 4 16 5 of the total microbial cellular abundance and 7 00 15 4 of the viable microbial abundance it belongs to the highly dominant sar11 clade in the p alphaproteobacteria in seawater often taking up 25 50 of the microbes in the marine and plays a significant role in the earth s carbon cycle morris et al 2002 we also identified 16 prevalent genera with at least 0 25 cell abundance across all 8 beach samples comprising 28 9 46 7 of the total microbial abundances si1 table s13 among these 281 genera 50 genera had the highest potential of contributing biases to microbial profiling for recreational marine waters as they had 50 viable cells across at least 3 of the 4 beaches fig 5e these genera were mostly from the classes of alphaproteobacteria 15 50 gammaproteobacteria 11 50 bacteriodia 8 50 and poseidoniia a 4 50 planktonic microbial archaea together they accounted for 23 3 7 99 of the total microbial concentrations and 9 81 4 31 of the viable microbial cells all these 77 important genera i e 29 dominant 16 prevalent and 50 low viability genera took up 43 65 of total microbial cell abundances fig 5f si2 table s14 specifically 7 of them were dominant genera that had low viability i e g actinomarina from f actinomarinaceae g himb11 g med g52 g himb59 g marinobacterium g scgc aaa076 p13 and g uba10364 which could potentially cause bias in beach water microbial profiling when relic dna was not removed and 4 of them were also prevalent genera across all 4 beach samples 3 4 screening level qmra quantified human health risks associated with swimming in beach waters due to exposure to human pathogens coastal recreational exposure to vibrio cholerae could pose important health risks fig 6a reported the probability of illness caused by each of the 8 different human pathogens and the total cumulative probability of illness taking all 8 pathogens into account together these pathogens are responsible for a wide range of adverse health outcomes e g gastrointestinal respiratory eye ear and skin ailments in most cases vibrio cholera an opportunistic pathogen tended to contribute predominantly to the total illness risk followed by campylobacter d jejuni and enterococci additionally when only considering the recommended fib for marine water quality monitoring usepa 2012 enterococci all 4 beaches complied the locally stipulated regulation 10 illnesses per 1000 swimmers hkepd 2022 however when considering the qmra result for marine water quality monitoring anglers beach avg 17 5 illnesses in 1000 exposures si2 table s15 exceeded the local benchmark and the other 3 beaches were at the marginally acceptable levels 6 2 7 8 illnesses per 1000 swimmers by the local guidelines qmra revealed site specific illness risk patterns in the 4 beaches that had diverse possible sources of pollution for example in trio beach which was predominantly impacted by a fish farm culture zone a high abundance of l pneumophila was found 3 6 times higher than other beaches si2 table s15 and the subsequent risk posed by legionella pneumophila was much elevated than in the other beaches for the 2 beaches potentially impacted by wwtps anglers and lido beaches the abundances and the associated health risks by vibrio parahaemolyticus were about 3 10 times higher than those unaffected by wwtps si2 figure s15 3 5 metagenomics enabled surveillance of args in viable cells could supplement risk assessment for beach waters on average these 4 beach waters had a total arg absolute abundance of 8 77 10 5 copies l fig 6b ranged from 7 62 10 5 to 1 11 10 6 copies l si2 table s16 a wide range of relic arg proportion was observed 3 0 64 resulting in an overall mean viable arg abundance of 6 08 10 5 copies l 4 01 10 5 7 98 10 5 copies l si1 fig s11 and 0 01 0 03 copies cell in total 42 arg subtypes belonging to 11 arg types were detected across these beaches ranging from 6 10 arg types 6 26 arg subtypes detected for a beach args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam tetracycline and bacitracin were found in all 4 beach waters accounting for an average of 66 of the total absolute abundance of arg copies together ranging from 31 to 90 si2 table s16b a large proportion of args in sewage impacted beaches were of high risks though lido beach impacted by sewage effluents had the lowest amount of active args i e active args inside of live cells si2 table s16c 60 of them were of the top 2 risk ranks encompassing those mobile args highly enriched in human impacted environments resulting in its highest absolute abundance of active risky args across all beaches fig 6b host tracking and genetic context investigation fig 6b also confirmed that args in viable bacterial cells in lido beach had the highest number of potentially pathogenic hosts and the highest capacity of mobility on the other hand tong fuk beach receiving limited human impact had the 2nd highest amount of args but only a quarter of them was of high risk to human health trio beach had the lowest proportion of high risk args 10 holistic consideration of human health risks associated with swimming could be achieved by combining qmra and resistome risk assessment when relying on e coli levels in beach water grading all 4 beaches complied with the local statutory water quality criteria 180 cfu 100 ml si2 table s8b with the 2 beaches potentially impacted by sewage effluent having the highest counts regarding the human illness risks associated with both enteric and opportunistic pathogens evaluated by qmra fig 6c lido tong fuk and trio had similarly marginally acceptable illness risks and illness probability exceeded the local regulation while still satisfying the usepa s recommendation in anglers beach that was possibly impacted by both aquaculture and wwtps health risks associated with resistome were the highest in lido beach and the lowest in trio beach all things considered trio had the overall lowest human risks anglers and lido had the highest risks with respect to the illness probability and resistome risks and tong fuk was in between 4 discussion microbiological safety assessment based on the counts of fib alone is not sufficient for assessing the risks of recreational marine waters in an array of contexts in this study we established a validated workflow for absolute quantification of viable microbial cells in beach waters we then implemented the pathogen abundances for qmra to assess risks associated with swimming and supplemented resistome as a part of the risk assessment related to difficulty in antibiotics treatment of illness caused by pathogenic bacteria in evaluating pma performance in the marine water environment we spiked synthetic communities mixed with heat killed and viable cells into heat killed marine debris and observed substantial relic dna depletion however as high as 8 of the sequencing output in samples treated with pma was undesirable the reasons for this could be multifaceted first it could be a result of insufficient pma intercalation that led to the persistence of some relic dnas second these undesirable dna could be originated from unsuccessfully killed viable microbes since their growths though almost negligible were observed on plates plated with heat killed marine waters si1 figure s3 finally it was worth mentioning that while comparable data output was achieved for pma untreated samples between the dead dead mixing scenario fig 3b case 6 and other scenarios mixed with live microorganisms fig 3b case 1 3 si2 table s5 2 orders of data output reduction was achieved after pma treatment in case 6 fig 3b indicating that signals of dead dnas could indeed be largely removed by pma treatment compared to dna degradation happened at the heat kill in the water bath stage though the matrix effect did not seem significant for marine waters in our study where marine biomass was collected from membrane filters through pbs environment specific optimization of the pma reaction conditions is strongly recommended for complete relic dna elimination when benchmarking the performance of our workflow using spike ins of 2 different gram stains we observed similar accuracies which could be attributed to the moderately extended cell disruption time as reported previously tourlousse et al 2021 2 rounds of 40s bead beating cycles were sufficient for releasing dna from gram positive cells with this respect we argue that with efficient cell lysis the cell wall structure type of spike ins does not affect the overall quantification accuracy high proportions of relic dna reported in this study avg 40 for beach waters and their potentially high persistence from hours to days under natural conditions bae and wuertz 2009 signify the importance of removing relic dnas for more accurate microbial risk assessment the largest effect of pma on microbial profiling laid in the total abundances fig 5b it has been reported that pma treatment improved the detection of rare taxa rogers et al 2013 and less abundant pathogenic bacteria reyneke et al 2022 which could be due to increased sequencing depth after removing relic signals we also had similar observations that echoed such claims as our arg host tracking results suggested that the changes in arg total abundances synchronized with the changes in the number of identified hosts si1 figure s11a b additionally some viable hosts of args and virulence factors were only revealed after pma treatment si1 figure s11c such as bacteroides and klebsiella in anglers and lido respectively adopting qmra we could identify region specific sources of risks which would be otherwise inaccessible by fib measurements only overall vibrio cholera contributed the most to the cumulative illness risk in beach waters suggesting that besides pathogens from fecal pollution indigenous coastal marine pathogens could also play a role in swimmers health additionally in trio beach a significantly high illness risks of legionella pneumophila was found which could be partly explained by two favourable conditions for l pneumophila in the nearby confined marine fish zones due to biofouling braithwaite and mcevoy 2005 of cages and nets and the presence of fish pathogenic amoebae as their hosts fields et al 2002 as the presence of l pneumophila in saline waters is largely facilitated by biofilm surman et al 2001 and protozoan hosts gast et al 2011 as anthropogenic activity has drastically accelerated the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment largely complicating treatments of resistance pathogens we surveyed viable pathogenic hosts of args to complement a holistic risk assessment si1 figure s12 in tong fuk beach highly effective carbapenem hydrolysing beta lactamases oxa 48 type meletis 2016 and an extended spectrum beta lactamase pdc 3 were both detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa a group of resistant pathogens listed as the first priority i e critical priority by who who 2017 assessment of resistome on pathogens augmented our vision on human health impacts in trio beach tetracycline resistance args were the most abundant arg si1 figure s11 and carried by g vibrio si1 figure s13 this could be related to the wide application of oxytetracycline during marine aquaculture production nonaka and suzuki 2002 in a nearby fish culture zone and it has been suggested that the impact of antibiotic application in aquaculture farms could extend to the environment schmidt et al 2000 additionally significantly higher tetracycline abundances were observed in fish farm samples compared to non fish farm samples jo et al 2021 corroborating our results interestingly we observed that the proportions of tetracycline and quinolone resistance genes carried by g vibrio were much enriched in the beach under the impact of fish farm culture zone trio and sewage effluent lido respectively si1 fig s13 and for the beach under the impact of both pollution sources anglers g vibrio had a relatively equal carriage of both arg types in fish farms tetracycline args were identified as dominant args and vibrio was the most prevalent pathogenic host of args jo et al 2021 as such we propose that such phenomenon could be used to source track and suggest the pollution level from aquaculture and sewage effluent in beach waters here we acknowledge a few limitations in our study that may guide future enhancements first the use of spike in in our study induced information loss of those microbes within the same genus as the spike in for example in saq for beach microbiome we removed all reads in g pseudomonas e which could result in data loss although this did not create barriers in our ability to quantify bacterial pathogen associated taxa we recommend tailored selections of the spike in s suitable for a specific environment second as our study only compared the culture based and metagenomics based counting results for viable gram negative cells i e e coli and vibrio spp significant unknown bias in pma based viable cell metagenomic quantification may be present due to the lack of a comprehensive assessment for a broad variety of microbial cells in a wide range of habitat conditions third as classification between closely related taxa remains challenging in metagenomic studies especially for error prone nanopore reads and species level diversity could be inflated by kraken2 so such data should be dealt with caution however the excelling runtime of kraken2 renders it a promising tool for fast screening of major features additionally kraken2 achieved high accuracies at the genus level and reasonable accuracies at the species level for nanopore reads and accuracy improved when imposing length filtering si1 fig s7 with the actively improving algorithms and long read sequencing chemistries pma based saq developed in this study will continue to grow in accuracy fourth although the feasibility of pma was tested in our study using 5 bacterial species covering cell wall structures of both gram stains they do not represent the entire complex community of the environmental samples therefore future efforts in testing taxon specific influence by pma for different sample types will be beneficial fifth the reliability of our assumption in using spike in cells to mimic the extraction behaviour of the complex and diverse microbial cells in the natural marine water deserves further investigation though we have demonstrated in fig 4b that cell wall structure did not seem to affect the results strongly for mixtures of pure microbial isolates potentially due to sufficient cell lysis in dna extraction the exact dna extraction behaviour of each different cells under different conditions remains unknown future research in establishing complex referencing standard material for benchmarking could be beneficial in further evaluation of quantitative microbial studies last though other pathogens protozoa and viruses were out of the scope of this study future risk assessment works incorporating them would allow for a more detailed understanding of microbial risks 5 conclusion in summary we proposed a metagenomics based in silico absolute live microbial cell quantification workflow to enumerate a broad spectrum of viable cells which ultimately would give meaningful results in microbial risk assessment efficiently a high correlation was observed between culture based enumeration and our pma based saq in marine beach waters supporting the immense potential of our workflow in absolutely enumerating viable cells applying our workflow we assessed the illness probability and the potential difficulty in illness treatment associated with swimming in different beaches by screening level qmra and metagenomics based arg risk assessment respectively achieving a holistic assessment of risks in exposure to pathogens and high risk args as antibiotic resistance is one of the most critical health challenges of the century refining qmra models to accurately estimate the human health risks from exposure to antibiotic resistant pathogens and args should be future priorities our metagenomics based absolute quantification of viable cells supports qmra in estimating local level exposure

14877,understanding the sources of antibiotics is important for managing antibiotic contamination and preventing environmental risks in the aquatic environment in this study the distribution of dissolved organic matter dom and 24 antibiotics from four typical classes quinolones macrolides sulfonamides and tetracyclines in the yellow river basin containing distinct sources of pollution was investigated in particular relationships between the antibiotic concentrations and fluorescent properties of dom were to be established to identify antibiotic sources a total of 22 antibiotics were detected with maximum concentrations ranging from 0 27 to 30 14 ng l in the mainstream of the yellow river of these antibiotics only erythromycin ery and sulfamethoxazole smx posed potential risks to aquatic organisms spatially tetracyclines were mainly distributed in the upstream reaches of the river and quinolones were largely distributed in the midstream high levels of sulfonamides were present downstream of the investigated river only eyr belonging to the macrolide group was detected and had a high downstream concentration eem parafac analysis showed that dom was composed of visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and protein like fraction c3 using pearson correlation analysis this study demonstrated a close relationship between dom spectral parameters and antibiotic concentrations in the yellow river basin specifically r c3 c2 was significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations of smx sulfadoxine sdx and ery while humification index hix had an opposite relationship with these antibiotics these results suggested that smx sdx and ery were mainly discharged from wastewater treatment plants into the mainstream of the yellow river this work provides a powerful demonstration that dom plays an important role in indicating the occurrence and sources of antibiotics in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics fluorescence dissolved organic matter dom parallel factor analysis parafac sources mainstream of the yellow river data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction presence of antibiotic residues has received increasing attention in the aquatic environment due to their direct impact on aquatic organisms as well as possible induction and proliferation of resistant bacteria that threaten human health carvalho and santos 2016 the main routes of antibiotics into natural water bodies have been classified as point source pollution and non point source pollution discharges hirsch et al 1999 most antibiotics are characteristically water soluble and biologically resistant antonina kruglova et al 2016 while biological processes are the main functional units for removing pollutants during urban sewage treatment yildiz 2012 as a result exceptionally low antibiotic biodegradation efficiencies are often observed in conventional sewage treatment plants which represent a typical point source that increases antibiotic concentrations in rivers antibiotics from livestock farms which are often located in villages and towns and have relatively backward sewage treatment facilities can also discharge into the environment as non point source pollution tong et al 2009 in addition a large number of antibiotics excreted unaltered or partially degraded in livestock manure and sewage sludge which are often used as organic fertilizers may also eventually drain into rivers through surface runoffs of agricultural land edelmann et al 2000 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the regional occurrence of typical antibiotics and their possible sources are vital in controlling pollution levels and environmental risks of antibiotics in aquatic environments dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in river water xu and guo 2017 and can be derived from terrestrial or and anthropogenic sources chen et al 2016a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem is a useful tool for characterizing dom composition and has been used to identify dom sources and pollution characteristics in the aquatic environment shen et al 2023 previously several researchers have studied the effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents on river dom composition reporting that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic acid like fluorescence could provide valuable information on river pollution characteristics yin et al 2020 it has been shown that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic like fluorescence is small for non polluted river systems while the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic like fluorescence from polluted rivers was relatively large yin et al 2020 notably previous studies have highlighted that the origin of dom dominated by point and nonpoint sources in rivers is similar to that of antibiotic contamination he et al 2022 for example as well as the non point source discharge of pollutants into rivers the land based dom pathway into the receiving water body was mainly dependent on runoff processes through rainfall or and agricultural irrigation nimptsch et al 2015 furthermore dom could strongly bind to antibiotics and thus govern the solubility and partition behavior of antibiotics in rivers gbadegesin et al 2022 therefore dom characterization may be a useful proxy for assessing pollution levels and sources of antibiotics in the aquatic environment previously researchers have identified the sources of different types of antibiotics by their use patterns and who they are used by kim et al 2007 or and by using principal component analysis combined with multiple linear regression pca mlr jia et al 2011 such methods often require tedious data searches and complex statistical analysis procedures all of which are time consuming labor intensive and expensive mesquita et al 2017 the 3d eem parafac analysis technique for distinguishing different dom origins would provide an easy inexpensive and quick alternative to tracking antibiotic pollution sources to date a few studies have successfully used eem parafac analysis of dom in identifying the aquaculture origin of norfloxacin nfx in a city river reservoir system zhang et al 2019 and indicating pollution levels of sulfamethoxazole smx contamination in a river basin sijia sijia li et al 2018 however these studies were either conducted in a limited area e g a river in a city or involved only a few antibiotics the fluorescence properties of dom that indicate contamination patterns and discharge sources of multiple classes of antibiotics in rivers at a large regional scale are not fully understood in particular dom fluorescence and antibiotic concentrations in different types of rivers differ significantly depending on their composition and sources fu et al 2020 for example large river basins tend to contain more information on point and nonpoint sources of dom and antibiotic contamination than small river basins ross 2006 this further highlights the urgent need for complementary regional surveys on dom composition antibiotic distribution and their correlations in the aquatic environment the yellow river is the fifth longest river in the world and has played a critical role in chinese civilization for thousands of years it spans four geomorphological units from west to east across the qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and huang huai hai plain in china including both sparsely populated plateau areas and dense urban and arable land areas jiang 2002 consequently the yellow river often simultaneously receives discharges from non point sources e g livestock farming and point sources of human activities e g urban sewage treatment plants fig s2 3 however no comprehensive regional study has been conducted to characterize the frequency and spatial distribution of multiple antibiotics and to use fluorescence dom as an indicator of multiple sources of antibiotic contamination throughout large watershed surface water therefore this work investigates the occurrence of tetracyclines tcs sulfonamides sas macrolides mls and quinolones qns residues in the yellow river basin and characterizes the relationships between dom composition and antibiotics that identify antibiotic sources the objectives of this study are 1 to reveal spatial variations in the composition and concentration of target antibiotics through statistical analysis of the moran global index 2 to identify the fluorescent components spatial variability and dom sources using 3d eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac 3 to elucidated the sources of contamination of target antibiotics by correlation analysis of antibiotic concentrations with dom spectral components 4 to prove the feasibility of tracing the origin of antibiotics by dom spectral components by comparing pca mlr statistical results this study can provide a theoretical reference for the systematic management of environmental pollution as well as some support for the ecological risk assessment of antibiotics in the surface water 2

from local suppliers ultrapure water prepared by a milli q rc apparatus millipore bedford ma was used throughout the experiments hlb solid phase extraction cartridges 500 mg 6 cm3 were obtained from waters corporation milford ma 2 2 sampling sites and sample collection a sampling campaign was conducted for the yellow river basin in may 2021 water samples were collected about 0 20 m below the river surface mainstream river water samples were collected upstream u1 u18 midstream m1 m6 and downstream d1 d6 in addition a total of 37 samples from four lakes l1 l4 and three reservoirs re1 re3 were also collected from their upper and middle reaches the detailed distribution of sampling sites is shown in fig s1 supplementary materials at each site the basic characteristics of river water were monitored by a portable water quality meter with multi parameter panels sl1000 hach usa as shown in table s2 three 1 5 l field replicates were collected from the centroid of the flow into the sealed brown glass bottles immediately all samples were stored in a vehicle mounted refrigerator 2 1 c and transported directly to the laboratory upon arrival at the laboratory the water samples were divided into two groups one group was stored directly at 2 1 c in a refrigerator for measuring antibiotic concentrations the other group was filtered through a 0 45 µm glass fiber filter and dissolved organic concentration and fluorescence spectral parameters were determined text s1 extraction and measurement were performed within 48 h and 7d of sample collection the specific sample transport process is described in text s4 2 3 antibiotics measurement 2 3 1 sample preparation and extraction solid phase extraction spe was used to extract antibiotics from water samples based on our previous work wang et al 2022 in brief bulk water samples were spiked with surrogate standards to a final concentration of 1 0 μg l na2edta 0 5 w v was added prior to extraction to minimize metal antibiotic chelates interference during instrumental analysis zhang et al 2014 water samples 1000 ml were then mixed with solvents and the extracts were purified and concentrated by spe and n2 stripping finally a 1 0 ml sample was obtained for quantification details of the spe clean up and concentration processes are described in text s2 2 3 2 instrumental analysis the concentrations of target antibiotics were determined by high performance liquid chromatography combined with a tandem triple quadrupole mlss spectrometer hplc ms ms shimadzu 8050 briefly a c18 column waters acquity uplc beh 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 7 μm was used to separate the 24 target antibiotics ultrapure water containing 0 1 formic acid v v phase a and methanol or acetonitrile phase b were used as mobile phases at a flow rate of 0 2 0 3 ml min and the injection volume was 1 5 μl all compounds were quantified in the positive electrospray ionization esi mode of ms ms full information of the hplc gradient program for antibiotic separation and full ms ms measurement conditions for individual compound were reported in table s3 and table s4 respectively 2 4 quality control target antibiotics were determined by external standard methods recovery was determined by spiking standard alternatives to water samples on the overall monitoring process limits of detection lods and limits of quantification loqs were calculated with signal noise ratios of 3 and 12 respectively the calibration curve 5 10 30 50 80 100 μg l showed a good linear relationship r2 0 999 all analytical data were obtained in strict compliance with qa qc procedures and method blanks were used to detect contamination caused by human or environmental factors throughout the experiment field method blanks were used to control the accuracy of the entire experimental process under optimal conditions the recovery of the overall monitoring process lods and loqs of target antibiotics were 84 4 108 0 0 01 ng l 0 36 ng l and 0 04 ng l 1 44 ng l respectively full information of recoveries lods and loqs of the target antibiotics are reported in table s5 2 5 risk assessment risk quotients rqs of target antibiotics were determined to assess their environmental effects in the yellow river basin the rq calculation followed eq 1 1 rqs mecs pnecs where mecs are the maximum measured environmental concentrations of the target compounds ng l and pnecs are the predicted no effect concentration of the target compounds in water ng l toxicity data were collected from the ecotox database http cfpub epa gov ecotox toxicity data and pnec values are shown in table s6 risks were classified into four levels based on individual antibiotic rq values which include insignificant risk rqs 0 01 low risk 0 01 rqs 0 1 medium risk 0 1 rqs 1 0 and high risk rqs 1 0 hernando et al 2006 2 6 statistical analysis in this study geographic information of sampling points spatial distribution of detected antibiotics and land use type were expressed using arcgis statistical analysis including pearson correlation test and principal component analysis was performed using spss 23 0 software ibm usa and origin2023 software statistical significance was assessed at 95 confidence level p 0 05 3d eem parafac model of dom was carried out in matlab box plots were drawn using origin2023 software geospatial analysis method and geoda software was used to explore the spatial distribution of antibiotics in mainstream river water of the yellow river text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of antibiotics in the yellow river and its environmental risk as shown in table 1 four sas smm smx spd and sdz were detected at high frequencies of 97 0 78 8 72 7 and 69 7 respectively the mean concentration of smx in the yellow river mainstream 8 63 ng l was higher than that in the brahmaputra river in bangladesh 1 39 ng l hossain et al 2018 and urban surface water in singapore 2 6 ng l yi et al 2019 moreover the mean concentration of sdz in the yellow river mainstream 1 25 ng l was higher than that in bangladesh s brahmaputra river 0 09 ng l hossain et al 2018 for the antibiotics belonging to ml class eyr was detected at a relatively high frequency of 87 9 table 1 compared with the results of other rivers the mean concentration of ery in the yellow river mainstream 2 29 ng l was moderate higher than that of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh 1 31 ng l but lower than that of the ganges river in india 14 5 ng l in the case of qn compounds eno oxo and cin were detected at high frequencies of 97 0 84 5 and 72 75 respectively table 2 in particular the maximum nor concentration in the yellow river 0 41 ng l was higher than the pollution level in urban rivers in brazil 0 13 ng l böger et al 2021 but lower than that in the suquía river in argentina 80 ng l valdés et al 2021 notably the results indicated that most nqs were detected less frequently than sas and mls in the mainstream of the yellow river which is likely due to strong sorption on river sediments or suspended matters duong et al 2008 in addition table 3 showed that the overall detection frequency of tcs in the yellow river is quite low and their concentrations were lower than those in other rivers azanu et al 2018 pérez et al 2022 singh and suthar 2021 this can be explained by the strong binding capacity of tcs on sediments and cations in river systems figueroa and mackay 2005 mackay and canterbury 2005 the concentrations of detected antibiotics varied significantly with maximum levels ranging from 0 27 to 30 14 ng l table 1 3 as a result these detected antibiotics posed potential risks at different levels in the yellow river according to their rq values in table s7 1 table s7 2 and table s7 3 most upstream and midstream yellow river sampling sites were found to have maximum green algae rq values ranging from 0 to 0 1 indicating insignificant to low risk for most downstream sites antibiotics are likely to pose a moderate risk to green algae with rq green algae values in the range of 0 1 to 1 and the compound that poses a moderate risk to green algae is ery in the case of daphnia s risks the detected antibiotics posed a negligible or low risk of rq daphnia below 0 1 in the upstream and midstream of the yellow river while smx may have a medium downstream risk due to its maximum rq daphnia range of 0 1 1 in addition no risk was found for zebrafish due to the maximum rq zebrafish values of detected antibiotics below 0 01 in the yellow river 3 2 spatial distribution of antibiotics relatively high concentrations of tcs were generally found in the upstream reaches fig 1 probably due to the high density of industrial areas for livestock farming to the north of the 400 mm isoprecipitation line fig s2 the vegetation is mainly grassland fig s3 which is not suitable for agricultural production due to the chronic rainfall deficit as such livestock is the dominant industry wenping et al 2022 which explains the higher upstream tc levels than in other regions the high variability in the concentration and detection frequency of qns in different sampling sites could be mainly related to their different consumption patterns and environmental behaviors in different regions for example nor is an antibiotic for both human and veterinary use while enr is for veterinary use only berkner et al 2014 in addition the midstream section of the river flows through desert areas of china fig s2 and is a barren land type fig s3 with tributaries carrying large amounts of sediment when merging into the mainstream douglas 1989 qns that strongly associated with soil or and sediment li et al 2012 may enter the yellow river along with soil erosion contributing to high spatial distribution of species in the midstream section fig 2 a for qns moran s scatter plot fig 2b showed moran s i 0 345 and z 3 35 which is greater than 1 96 suggesting moran s index is significantly effective p 0 005 and the spatial distribution of detected antibiotics is not random the lisa aggregation plots showed a high concentration and high concentration aggregation distribution among themselves at upstream endpoints however the concentration of qns in the downstream lakes was higher than the mainstream river the downstream reaches of the yellow river are suspended rivers with fewer tributaries to the mainstream yue et al 2017 furthermore lakes are not directly connected to the mainstream resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of detected antibiotics in lake water near the downstream of the mainstream as compared to mainstream river water in addition the composition of detected qns was almost identical in all water samples indicating general consistency in the use of qn along the yellow river basin in the case of the sas group their pollution levels were concentrated downstream of river water fig 3 a furthermore the spatial correlation data showed that sas exhibited a high concentration and high concentration aggregation positive correlation downstream but a low concentration and low concentration aggregation positive correlation upstream moran s i 0 680 z 6 10 p 0 001 fig 3b sas are highly water soluble and recalcitrant and in most cases exhibit the highest concentrations and detection frequencies yonggang et al 2015 si li et al 2018 in terms of the composition of detected sa compounds sampling lakes consisted of smp and smm specifically the concentration of smp gradually decreased from upstream to downstream interestingly the concentration of smm showed a gradual increasing trend which was not consistent with the changing pattern of the concentration of smp and smm in the upstream and downstream of the yellow river fig s5b c the reason for this is on one hand because the bodies of lake water in the midstream and downstream reaches are not connected to the mainstream river and on the other hand according to our field observation most of the midstream and downstream lakes have aquaculture industries that may cause veterinary smp and smm use to account for the main component of sulfonamide antibiotics in lakes in addition screening was conducted to reflect heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of antibiotic concentrations in lake water adjacent to mainstream and mainstream rivers the composition of antibiotics in reservoirs and mainstream water was similar and the change in concentration was consistent upstream and downstream fig s5a and fig s5c in particular the concentration of smm decreased gradually from upstream to downstream while the concentration of smx showed an opposite upstream to downstream trend in both the reservoir and mainstream river fig s5a and fig s5c this is because the reservoir is used to store flood water and reduce flood flow into the downstream channel during flood disasters and its water body is part of the mainstream water body in addition smm and smx are often used for animals and humans only table s1 the land type from upstream to downstream along the yellow river ranges from high altitude grassland to cropland and anthropogenically developed land fig s2 s3 this could indirectly indicate that livestock farming decreases as agriculture and population increase quan et al 2022 resulting in a gradual decrease in the use of smm and a gradual increase in the use of smx from upstream to downstream in addition smx is non biodegradable in the aquatic environment ying et al 2013 which may further contributes to its high occurrence in rivers for the ml antibiotics only ery was detected and concentrated levels were observed in the downstream yellow river fig 4 a further spatial correlation analysis showed that eyr had a high concentration and high concentration aggregation positive correlation in downstream reaches but a low concentration and low concentration aggregation positive correlation in upstream reaches moran s i 0 588 z 5 45 p 0 002 fig 4b this may be related to the widespread occurrence of high altitude grassland areas upstream of the yellow river basin fig s2 and fig s3 where the population is relatively small compared to downstream areas eastern coastal cities resulting in less use of ery upstream than downstream ery is unstable under acidic conditions and prone to hydrolysis zhang et al 2012 the ph of river water in the mainstream of the yellow river ranges from 8 to 9 table s2 which is not conducive to ery hydrolysis in addition ery s non biodegradability may also contribute to its high pollution loads in the yellow river table s8 3 3 fluorescent characteristics of dom the mean concentration of dom in different reaches of the yellow river followed the rank order downstream upstream midstream fig 5 a the mean organic matter content in the upstream reaches of the yellow river was higher than in the midstream reaches p 0 001 this may be because the qinghai tibet plateau the water source of the yellow river has higher soil organic matter content than other parts of the yellow river basin zheng et al 2023 similarly a previous study reported that scouring and leaching such as snow mountain ablation and rainfall in high organic matter soils may result in higher dom concentrations in upstream areas than in midstream areas liu et al 2014 significant increase in mean dom concentrations in the downstream region fig 5a is possibly associated with significant human impact nearly half of the cropland in the downstream reaches of the yellow river basin is irrigated with yellow river water yang et al 2004 the application of livestock manure is a common practice to increase the organic matter and nutrients in these croplands ju et al 2005 during one time or multiple base applications of fertilizer in seasonal or wheat crop rotation organic matter in soil may migrate through leaching and or percolation of rainwater and eventually enter rivers sharpley and halvorson 2020 moreover in recent years nearly 70 of the water consumption in the yellow river basin can be attributed to inefficient irrigation methods mainly flood irrigation in the midstream and downstream reaches zhang et al 2013 resulting in a large amount of high dom water reentering the yellow river in addition the impact of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater cannot be ignored especially for the highly polluted tributaries that discharge into the midstream and downstream reaches of the yellow river zhao et al 2020 as presented in fig 5b dom humification index hix in the upstream and midstream reaches of the mainstream mainly ranged from 3 to 5 while those in the downstream reaches were generally less than 3 as widely reported an hix 1 50 indicates that dom is mainly derived from microorganisms an hix of 1 50 3 00 indicates weak humus characteristics and obvious endogenous characteristics while an hix 3 00 indicates strong humus and terrestrial characteristics huguet et al 2009 therefore the results of this study suggest that the humification degree of dom was high in upstream and midstream reaches while in downstream reaches dom had obvious endogenous characteristics and was weakly humified p 0 05 this may indicate that the mainstream of the yellow river is heavily polluted by urban domestic sewage and biological activity is higher in the downstream reaches three optimal dom fluorescence fractions in the mainstream of the yellow river were derived from eem parafac analysis fig 6 including visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and tryptophan like fraction of protein like fraction c3 these fluorescence peaks are present in both the river dom and ocean dom coble 1996 del castillo et al 1999 yao et al 2011 in addition the dom component of the river is more strongly affected by human activities and anthropogenic pollutants xia et al 2022 pollution can lead to increased fluorescence intensity of protein like components in the aquatic environment mounier et al 1999 fu et al used 3d eem to study dom river characteristics and reported that dom fluorescence consists of fulvic acid like fluorescent peaks and protein like fluorescent peaks fu et al 2004 in general dom fluorescence spectra from rivers contaminated by human activities would contain strong protein like fluorophores hudson et al 2007 it was observed that the c3 fraction gradually increased from upstream to downstream reaches of the yellow river fig 7 a this reflects that the mainstream of the yellow river is increasingly polluted by human activities from upstream to downstream previous studies investigated the effect of wastewater treatment plant discharges on the rivers dom reporting that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic acid like fluorescence was about 1 in moderately polluted rivers and was above 1 when the rivers were heavily polluted by wastewater treatment plants baker 2001 han et al 2021 wen et al 2023 we defined the ratio of protein like fluorescence peak c3 to ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence peak c2 as r c3 c2 peak c3 peak c2 as shown in fig 7b the mean values of r c3 c2 for upstream and midstream samples ranged from 0 5 to 1 and the mean value of r c3 c2 for downstream samples was greater than 1 these results reflect that river water in the upstream and midstream contained quite small amounts of pollutants released from sewage treatment plant while the river water samples in the downstream contained high amounts of sewage treatment plant substances this further confirms the statement that the discharge of urban domestic sewage into the yellow river basin gradually increases from upstream to downstream as population density increases as suggested by yin et al 2020 3 4 correlations between dom components and sources of antibiotics the correlations between dom and antibiotic concentrations in the yellow river basin are shown in fig 8 it was observed that r c3 c2 was significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of smx r 0 79 p 0 001 sdx r 0 60 p 0 001 and ery r 0 73 p 0 001 this could provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that these three antibiotics are commonly used for domestic and medical purposes along the yellow river basin which agrees with the fact that they are mainly consumed for the treatment of human diseases table s1 a significant proportion of antibiotics entering the body are not fully absorbed and excreted as prodrugs or metabolites in urine and feces before entering municipal wtps khetan and collins 2007 in addition most antibiotics are not completely removed by wtps and a large amount of antibiotics would be released into surface water with effluent zhang and li 2011 previous research has found smx to be one of the 35 most frequently detected substances in wastewater treatment plant effluent kim and carlson 2005 importantly smx and ery have no biodegradation capacity in aquatic organisms table s8 additionally the overall neutral ph and high turbidity of the yellow river mainstream especially downstream effectively mitigated the hydrolysis and photolysis of antibiotics likely contributing to the stable occurrence of smx and ery table s2 in the case of the relationship between hix and antibiotic concentrations fig 8 hix had a significant negative correlation with the concentrations of smx r 0 67 p 0 001 sdx r 0 59 p 0 001 and ery r 0 59 p 0 001 previously a study monitored the in situ composition and properties of dom in surface water at different influent flows and found that dom concentration and molecular size increased significantly with increasing influent flows zhou et al 2016 in addition dom spectral characteristics suggested that the dom fractions entering the river were dominated by macromolecular humic substances during the rainy season indicating that non point source pollution can directly affect dom humification in the river given that dom hix above 3 represents a dominant terrestrial contribution to dom chen et al 2016b these results further confirmed that smx sdx and ery residues in the mainstream of the yellow river mainly originate from sewage treatment plants but are not closely related to nonpoint source pollution discharges such as rainfall and irrigation runoff overall when the r c3 c2 value is higher and the hix value is smaller at a certain location of the river it not only reflects that high levels of dom components that are strongly influenced by human activities are present in the river but also indicates that the river tends to contain high levels of human antibiotics especially those that can be stable in the aquatic environment additionally fig 8 showed a negative correlation between r c3 c2 and the concentrations of 8 antibiotics smp smm lom nor mcl otc tc and ctc and a positive correlation for hix with these antibiotic concentrations at the same time p 0 05 among them smp smm and ctc were animal based table s1 reflecting the non point source contribution of their terrestrial origin for two humans mcl and lom and three common human animal antibiotics nor otc and tc they were mostly distributed upstream across the river fig s4c and fig s6 the relatively poor sewage treatment facilities upstream suggest that these antibiotics may not be discharged into the river via sewage plants zhang 2009 such a phenomenon suggests that more land based dom sources and non point source discharges of animal human and mixed use antibiotics with smaller r c3 c2 values and larger hix values were present at one point in the river moreover hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation directly affect the stability of antibiotics in the aqueous environment and have a profound effect on their environmental behavior yang et al 2021 which may be responsible for the insignificance of the non point source pollution process in relation to the dom component in the non point source discharge process however not every antibiotic has been found and reported to have a half life under specific conditions table s8 and further research on the mechanisms of degradation and transformation of each antibiotic is needed in the aqueous environment to further confirm these findings two factors representing antibiotic sources were obtained primarily using the pca mlr model table 4 factor 1 was heavily weighted by smx and ery which have been used primarily for urinary tract infections respiratory tract infections and skin infections in humans in comparison with fig 8 r c3 c2 and hix were closely correlated with these three human antibiotics i e smx ery and sdx reflecting one more point source contaminant contributor than the pc mlr method factor 2 was heavily weighted by eno smp and sdz as shown in tables1 smp and sdz are used as veterinary drugs although eno is a human antibiotic most of the high concentration points are located at upstream in the mainstream of the yellow river fig s4c where sewage treatment facilities are relatively poor resulting in the same non point source discharge of eno into the river as smp and sdz therefore pca2 represents a non point source contamination antibiotic type compared to fig 8 there was a negative correlation for r c3 c2 and 8 antibiotics smp smm lom nor mcl otc tc and ctc and a positive correlation for hix with these antibiotics at the same time a broader range of non point source contamination antibiotics was obtained than the pca mlr method overall the two source indicator variables i e r c3 c2 and hix analyzed by dom characteristics contain more information than pca mlr method and can predict antibiotic contamination without complex instrumental determination in aquatic environments 4 conclusion this comprehensive study investigated the occurrence and spatial distribution of antibiotics humification characteristics and fluorescence composition of dom and their correlations throughout the yellow river basin the study s findings indicate that tcs antibiotics were generally detected at low levels with higher concentrations observed in the upstream region qns antibiotics were found to have relatively elevated levels near the end of the upstream point while sas and mls antibiotics showed a low concentration in the upstream area and a notable increase downstream meanwhile dom was abundant and composed of visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and tryptophan like fraction of protein like fraction c3 in the yellow river with the humification degree upstream and midstream higher than that of the downstream furthermore pearson correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of smx ery and sdx in the yellow river was closely related to the effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants the r c3 c2 and hix of dom may indirectly reflect the pollution and source composition of the detected antibiotics in the yellow river the new analytical approach using fluorescence dom as an indicator to explore sources of antibiotic like contaminants is a groundbreaking step in establishing a qualitative and quantitative source allocation method in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

14877,understanding the sources of antibiotics is important for managing antibiotic contamination and preventing environmental risks in the aquatic environment in this study the distribution of dissolved organic matter dom and 24 antibiotics from four typical classes quinolones macrolides sulfonamides and tetracyclines in the yellow river basin containing distinct sources of pollution was investigated in particular relationships between the antibiotic concentrations and fluorescent properties of dom were to be established to identify antibiotic sources a total of 22 antibiotics were detected with maximum concentrations ranging from 0 27 to 30 14 ng l in the mainstream of the yellow river of these antibiotics only erythromycin ery and sulfamethoxazole smx posed potential risks to aquatic organisms spatially tetracyclines were mainly distributed in the upstream reaches of the river and quinolones were largely distributed in the midstream high levels of sulfonamides were present downstream of the investigated river only eyr belonging to the macrolide group was detected and had a high downstream concentration eem parafac analysis showed that dom was composed of visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and protein like fraction c3 using pearson correlation analysis this study demonstrated a close relationship between dom spectral parameters and antibiotic concentrations in the yellow river basin specifically r c3 c2 was significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations of smx sulfadoxine sdx and ery while humification index hix had an opposite relationship with these antibiotics these results suggested that smx sdx and ery were mainly discharged from wastewater treatment plants into the mainstream of the yellow river this work provides a powerful demonstration that dom plays an important role in indicating the occurrence and sources of antibiotics in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics fluorescence dissolved organic matter dom parallel factor analysis parafac sources mainstream of the yellow river data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction presence of antibiotic residues has received increasing attention in the aquatic environment due to their direct impact on aquatic organisms as well as possible induction and proliferation of resistant bacteria that threaten human health carvalho and santos 2016 the main routes of antibiotics into natural water bodies have been classified as point source pollution and non point source pollution discharges hirsch et al 1999 most antibiotics are characteristically water soluble and biologically resistant antonina kruglova et al 2016 while biological processes are the main functional units for removing pollutants during urban sewage treatment yildiz 2012 as a result exceptionally low antibiotic biodegradation efficiencies are often observed in conventional sewage treatment plants which represent a typical point source that increases antibiotic concentrations in rivers antibiotics from livestock farms which are often located in villages and towns and have relatively backward sewage treatment facilities can also discharge into the environment as non point source pollution tong et al 2009 in addition a large number of antibiotics excreted unaltered or partially degraded in livestock manure and sewage sludge which are often used as organic fertilizers may also eventually drain into rivers through surface runoffs of agricultural land edelmann et al 2000 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the regional occurrence of typical antibiotics and their possible sources are vital in controlling pollution levels and environmental risks of antibiotics in aquatic environments dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in river water xu and guo 2017 and can be derived from terrestrial or and anthropogenic sources chen et al 2016a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem is a useful tool for characterizing dom composition and has been used to identify dom sources and pollution characteristics in the aquatic environment shen et al 2023 previously several researchers have studied the effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents on river dom composition reporting that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic acid like fluorescence could provide valuable information on river pollution characteristics yin et al 2020 it has been shown that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic like fluorescence is small for non polluted river systems while the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic like fluorescence from polluted rivers was relatively large yin et al 2020 notably previous studies have highlighted that the origin of dom dominated by point and nonpoint sources in rivers is similar to that of antibiotic contamination he et al 2022 for example as well as the non point source discharge of pollutants into rivers the land based dom pathway into the receiving water body was mainly dependent on runoff processes through rainfall or and agricultural irrigation nimptsch et al 2015 furthermore dom could strongly bind to antibiotics and thus govern the solubility and partition behavior of antibiotics in rivers gbadegesin et al 2022 therefore dom characterization may be a useful proxy for assessing pollution levels and sources of antibiotics in the aquatic environment previously researchers have identified the sources of different types of antibiotics by their use patterns and who they are used by kim et al 2007 or and by using principal component analysis combined with multiple linear regression pca mlr jia et al 2011 such methods often require tedious data searches and complex statistical analysis procedures all of which are time consuming labor intensive and expensive mesquita et al 2017 the 3d eem parafac analysis technique for distinguishing different dom origins would provide an easy inexpensive and quick alternative to tracking antibiotic pollution sources to date a few studies have successfully used eem parafac analysis of dom in identifying the aquaculture origin of norfloxacin nfx in a city river reservoir system zhang et al 2019 and indicating pollution levels of sulfamethoxazole smx contamination in a river basin sijia sijia li et al 2018 however these studies were either conducted in a limited area e g a river in a city or involved only a few antibiotics the fluorescence properties of dom that indicate contamination patterns and discharge sources of multiple classes of antibiotics in rivers at a large regional scale are not fully understood in particular dom fluorescence and antibiotic concentrations in different types of rivers differ significantly depending on their composition and sources fu et al 2020 for example large river basins tend to contain more information on point and nonpoint sources of dom and antibiotic contamination than small river basins ross 2006 this further highlights the urgent need for complementary regional surveys on dom composition antibiotic distribution and their correlations in the aquatic environment the yellow river is the fifth longest river in the world and has played a critical role in chinese civilization for thousands of years it spans four geomorphological units from west to east across the qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and huang huai hai plain in china including both sparsely populated plateau areas and dense urban and arable land areas jiang 2002 consequently the yellow river often simultaneously receives discharges from non point sources e g livestock farming and point sources of human activities e g urban sewage treatment plants fig s2 3 however no comprehensive regional study has been conducted to characterize the frequency and spatial distribution of multiple antibiotics and to use fluorescence dom as an indicator of multiple sources of antibiotic contamination throughout large watershed surface water therefore this work investigates the occurrence of tetracyclines tcs sulfonamides sas macrolides mls and quinolones qns residues in the yellow river basin and characterizes the relationships between dom composition and antibiotics that identify antibiotic sources the objectives of this study are 1 to reveal spatial variations in the composition and concentration of target antibiotics through statistical analysis of the moran global index 2 to identify the fluorescent components spatial variability and dom sources using 3d eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac 3 to elucidated the sources of contamination of target antibiotics by correlation analysis of antibiotic concentrations with dom spectral components 4 to prove the feasibility of tracing the origin of antibiotics by dom spectral components by comparing pca mlr statistical results this study can provide a theoretical reference for the systematic management of environmental pollution as well as some support for the ecological risk assessment of antibiotics in the surface water 2

river surface mainstream river water samples were collected upstream u1 u18 midstream m1 m6 and downstream d1 d6 in addition a total of 37 samples from four lakes l1 l4 and three reservoirs re1 re3 were also collected from their upper and middle reaches the detailed distribution of sampling sites is shown in fig s1 supplementary materials at each site the basic characteristics of river water were monitored by a portable water quality meter with multi parameter panels sl1000 hach usa as shown in table s2 three 1 5 l field replicates were collected from the centroid of the flow into the sealed brown glass bottles immediately all samples were stored in a vehicle mounted refrigerator 2 1 c and transported directly to the laboratory upon arrival at the laboratory the water samples were divided into two groups one group was stored directly at 2 1 c in a refrigerator for measuring antibiotic concentrations the other group was filtered through a 0 45 µm glass fiber filter and dissolved organic concentration and fluorescence spectral parameters were determined text s1 extraction and measurement were performed within 48 h and 7d of sample collection the specific sample transport process is described in text s4 2 3 antibiotics measurement 2 3 1 sample preparation and extraction solid phase extraction spe was used to extract antibiotics from water samples based on our previous work wang et al 2022 in brief bulk water samples were spiked with surrogate standards to a final concentration of 1 0 μg l na2edta 0 5 w v was added prior to extraction to minimize metal antibiotic

separation and full ms ms measurement conditions for individual compound were reported in table s3 and table s4 respectively 2 4 quality control target antibiotics were determined by external standard methods recovery was determined by spiking standard alternatives to water samples on the overall monitoring process limits of detection lods and limits of quantification loqs were calculated with signal noise ratios of 3 and 12 respectively the calibration curve 5 10 30 50 80 100 μg l showed a good linear relationship r2 0 999 all analytical data were obtained in strict compliance with qa qc procedures and method blanks were used to detect contamination caused by human or environmental factors throughout the experiment field method blanks were used to control the accuracy of the entire

respectively full information of recoveries lods and loqs of the target antibiotics are reported in table s5 2 5 risk assessment risk quotients rqs of target antibiotics were determined to assess their environmental effects in the yellow river basin the rq calculation followed eq 1 1 rqs mecs pnecs where mecs are the maximum measured environmental concentrations of the target compounds ng l and pnecs are the predicted no effect concentration of the target compounds in water ng l toxicity data were collected from the ecotox database http cfpub epa gov ecotox toxicity data and pnec values are shown in table s6 risks were classified into four levels based on individual antibiotic rq values which include insignificant risk rqs 0 01 low risk 0 01 rqs 0 1 medium risk 0 1 rqs 1 0 and high risk rqs 1 0 hernando et al 2006 2 6 statistical analysis in this study geographic information of sampling points spatial distribution of detected antibiotics and land use type were expressed using arcgis statistical analysis including pearson correlation test and principal component analysis was performed using spss 23 0 software ibm usa and origin2023 software statistical significance was assessed at 95 confidence level p 0 05 3d eem parafac model of dom was carried out in matlab box plots were drawn using origin2023 software geospatial analysis method and geoda software was used to explore the spatial distribution of antibiotics in mainstream river water of the yellow river text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of antibiotics in the yellow river and its environmental risk as shown in table 1 four sas smm smx spd and sdz were detected at high frequencies of 97 0 78 8 72 7 and 69 7 respectively the mean concentration of smx in the yellow river mainstream 8 63 ng l was higher than that in the brahmaputra river in bangladesh 1 39 ng l hossain et al 2018 and urban surface water in singapore 2 6 ng l yi et al 2019 moreover the mean concentration of sdz in the yellow river mainstream 1 25 ng l was higher than that in bangladesh s brahmaputra river 0 09 ng l hossain et al 2018 for the antibiotics belonging to ml class eyr was detected at a relatively high frequency of 87 9 table 1 compared with the results of other rivers the mean concentration of ery in the yellow river mainstream 2 29 ng l was moderate higher than that of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh 1 31 ng l but lower than that of the ganges river in india 14 5 ng l in the case of qn compounds eno oxo and cin were detected at high frequencies of 97 0 84 5 and 72 75 respectively table 2 in particular the maximum nor concentration in the yellow river 0 41 ng l was higher than the pollution level in urban rivers in brazil 0 13 ng l böger et al 2021 but lower than that in the suquía river in argentina 80 ng l valdés et al 2021 notably the results indicated that most nqs were detected less frequently than sas and mls in the mainstream of the yellow river which is likely due to strong sorption on river sediments or suspended matters duong et al 2008 in addition table 3 showed that the overall detection frequency of tcs in the yellow river is quite low and their concentrations were lower than those in other rivers azanu et al 2018 pérez et al 2022 singh and suthar 2021 this can be explained by the strong binding capacity of tcs on sediments and cations in river systems figueroa and mackay 2005 mackay and canterbury 2005 the concentrations of detected antibiotics varied significantly with maximum levels ranging from 0 27 to 30 14 ng l table 1 3 as a result these detected antibiotics posed potential risks at different levels in the yellow river according to their rq values in table s7 1 table s7 2 and table s7 3 most upstream and midstream yellow river sampling sites were found to have maximum green algae rq values ranging from 0 to 0 1 indicating insignificant to low risk for most downstream sites antibiotics are likely to pose a moderate risk to green algae with rq green algae values in the range of 0 1 to 1 and the compound that poses a moderate risk to green algae is ery in the case of daphnia s risks the detected antibiotics posed a negligible or low risk of rq daphnia below 0 1 in the upstream and midstream of the yellow river while smx may have a medium downstream risk due to its maximum rq daphnia range of 0 1 1 in addition no risk was found for zebrafish due to the maximum rq zebrafish values of detected antibiotics below 0 01 in the yellow river 3 2 spatial distribution of antibiotics relatively high concentrations of tcs were generally found in the upstream reaches fig 1 probably due to the high density of industrial areas for livestock farming to the north of the 400 mm isoprecipitation line fig s2 the vegetation is mainly grassland fig s3 which is not suitable for agricultural production due to the chronic rainfall deficit as such livestock is the dominant industry wenping et al 2022 which explains the higher upstream tc levels than in other regions the high variability in the concentration and detection frequency of qns in different sampling sites could be mainly related to their different consumption patterns and environmental behaviors in different regions for example nor is an antibiotic for both human and veterinary use while enr is for veterinary use only berkner et al 2014 in addition the midstream section of the river flows through desert areas of china fig s2 and is a barren land type fig s3 with tributaries carrying large amounts of sediment when merging into the mainstream douglas 1989 qns that strongly associated with soil or and sediment li et al 2012 may enter the yellow river along with soil erosion contributing to high spatial distribution of species in the midstream section fig 2 a for qns moran s scatter plot fig 2b showed moran s i 0 345 and z 3 35 which is greater than 1 96 suggesting moran s index is significantly effective p 0 005 and the spatial distribution of detected antibiotics is not random the lisa aggregation plots showed a high concentration and high concentration aggregation distribution among themselves at upstream endpoints however the concentration of qns in the downstream lakes was higher than the mainstream river the downstream reaches of the yellow river are suspended rivers with fewer tributaries to the mainstream yue et al 2017 furthermore lakes are not directly connected to the mainstream resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of detected antibiotics in lake water near the downstream of the mainstream as compared to mainstream river water in addition the composition of detected qns was almost identical in all water samples indicating general consistency in the use of qn along the yellow river basin in the case of the sas group their pollution levels were concentrated downstream of river water fig 3 a furthermore the spatial correlation data showed that sas exhibited a high concentration and high concentration aggregation positive correlation downstream but a low concentration and low concentration aggregation positive correlation upstream moran s i 0 680 z 6 10 p 0 001 fig 3b sas are highly water soluble and recalcitrant and in most cases exhibit the highest concentrations and detection frequencies yonggang et al 2015 si li et al 2018 in terms of the composition of detected sa compounds sampling lakes consisted of smp and smm specifically the concentration of smp gradually decreased from upstream to downstream interestingly the concentration of smm showed a gradual increasing trend which was not consistent with the changing pattern of the concentration of smp and smm in the upstream and downstream of the yellow river fig s5b c the reason for this is on one hand because the bodies of lake water in the midstream and downstream reaches are not connected to the mainstream river and on the other hand according to our field observation most of the midstream and downstream lakes have aquaculture industries that may cause veterinary smp and smm use to account for the main component of sulfonamide antibiotics in lakes in addition screening was conducted to reflect heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of antibiotic concentrations in lake water adjacent to mainstream and mainstream rivers the composition of antibiotics in reservoirs and mainstream water was similar and the change in concentration was consistent upstream and downstream fig s5a and fig s5c in particular the concentration of smm decreased gradually from upstream to downstream while the concentration of smx showed an opposite upstream to downstream trend in both the reservoir and mainstream river fig s5a and fig s5c this is because the reservoir is used to store flood water and reduce flood flow into the downstream channel during flood disasters and its water body is part of the mainstream water body in addition smm and smx are often used for animals and humans only table s1 the land type from upstream to downstream along the yellow river ranges from high altitude grassland to cropland and anthropogenically developed land fig s2 s3 this could indirectly indicate that livestock farming decreases as agriculture and population increase quan et al 2022 resulting in a gradual decrease in the use of smm and a gradual increase in the use of smx from upstream to downstream in addition smx is non biodegradable in the aquatic environment ying et al 2013 which may further contributes to its high occurrence in rivers for the ml antibiotics only ery was detected and concentrated levels were observed in the downstream yellow river fig 4 a further spatial correlation analysis showed that eyr had a high concentration and high concentration aggregation positive correlation in downstream reaches but a low concentration and low concentration aggregation positive correlation in upstream reaches moran s i 0 588 z 5 45 p 0 002 fig 4b this may be related to the widespread occurrence of high altitude grassland areas upstream of the yellow river basin fig s2 and fig s3 where the population is relatively small compared to downstream areas eastern coastal cities resulting in less use of ery upstream than downstream ery is unstable under acidic conditions and prone to hydrolysis zhang et al 2012 the ph of river water in the mainstream of the yellow river ranges from 8 to 9 table s2 which is not conducive to ery hydrolysis in addition ery s non biodegradability may also contribute to its high pollution loads in the yellow river table s8 3 3 fluorescent characteristics of dom the mean concentration of dom in different reaches of the yellow river followed the rank order downstream upstream midstream fig 5 a the mean organic matter content in the upstream reaches of the yellow river was higher than in the midstream reaches p 0 001 this may be because the qinghai tibet plateau the water source of the yellow river has higher soil organic matter content than other parts of the yellow river basin zheng et al 2023 similarly a previous study reported that scouring and leaching such as snow mountain ablation and rainfall in high organic matter soils may result in higher dom concentrations in upstream areas than in midstream areas liu et al 2014 significant increase in mean dom concentrations in the downstream region fig 5a is possibly associated with significant human impact nearly half of the cropland in the downstream reaches of the yellow river basin is irrigated with yellow river water yang et al 2004 the application of livestock manure is a common practice to increase the organic matter and nutrients in these croplands ju et al 2005 during one time or multiple base applications of fertilizer in seasonal or wheat crop rotation organic matter in soil may migrate through leaching and or percolation of rainwater and eventually enter rivers sharpley and halvorson 2020 moreover in recent years nearly 70 of the water consumption in the yellow river basin can be attributed to inefficient irrigation methods mainly flood irrigation in the midstream and downstream reaches zhang et al 2013 resulting in a large amount of high dom water reentering the yellow river in addition the impact of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater cannot be ignored especially for the highly polluted tributaries that discharge into the midstream and downstream reaches of the yellow river zhao et al 2020 as presented in fig 5b dom humification index hix in the upstream and midstream reaches of the mainstream mainly ranged from 3 to 5 while those in the downstream reaches were generally less than 3 as widely reported an hix 1 50 indicates that dom is mainly derived from microorganisms an hix of 1 50 3 00 indicates weak humus characteristics and obvious endogenous characteristics while an hix 3 00 indicates strong humus and terrestrial characteristics huguet et al 2009 therefore the results of this study suggest that the humification degree of dom was high in upstream and midstream reaches while in downstream reaches dom had obvious endogenous characteristics and was weakly humified p 0 05 this may indicate that the mainstream of the yellow river is heavily polluted by urban domestic sewage and biological activity is higher in the downstream reaches three optimal dom fluorescence fractions in the mainstream of the yellow river were derived from eem parafac analysis fig 6 including visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and tryptophan like fraction of protein like fraction c3 these fluorescence peaks are present in both the river dom and ocean dom coble 1996 del castillo et al 1999 yao et al 2011 in addition the dom component of the river is more strongly affected by human activities and anthropogenic pollutants xia et al 2022 pollution can lead to increased fluorescence intensity of protein like components in the aquatic environment mounier et al 1999 fu et al used 3d eem to study dom river characteristics and reported that dom fluorescence consists of fulvic acid like fluorescent peaks and protein like fluorescent peaks fu et al 2004 in general dom fluorescence spectra from rivers contaminated by human activities would contain strong protein like fluorophores hudson et al 2007 it was observed that the c3 fraction gradually increased from upstream to downstream reaches of the yellow river fig 7 a this reflects that the mainstream of the yellow river is increasingly polluted by human activities from upstream to downstream previous studies investigated the effect of wastewater treatment plant discharges on the rivers dom reporting that the ratio of protein like fluorescence to fulvic acid like fluorescence was about 1 in moderately polluted rivers and was above 1 when the rivers were heavily polluted by wastewater treatment plants baker 2001 han et al 2021 wen et al 2023 we defined the ratio of protein like fluorescence peak c3 to ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence peak c2 as r c3 c2 peak c3 peak c2 as shown in fig 7b the mean values of r c3 c2 for upstream and midstream samples ranged from 0 5 to 1 and the mean value of r c3 c2 for downstream samples was greater than 1 these results reflect that river water in the upstream and midstream contained quite small amounts of pollutants released from sewage treatment plant while the river water samples in the downstream contained high amounts of sewage treatment plant substances this further confirms the statement that the discharge of urban domestic sewage into the yellow river basin gradually increases from upstream to downstream as population density increases as suggested by yin et al 2020 3 4 correlations between dom components and sources of antibiotics the correlations between dom and antibiotic concentrations in the yellow river basin are shown in fig 8 it was observed that r c3 c2 was significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of smx r 0 79 p 0 001 sdx r 0 60 p 0 001 and ery r 0 73 p 0 001 this could provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that these three antibiotics are commonly used for domestic and medical purposes along the yellow river basin which agrees with the fact that they are mainly consumed for the treatment of human diseases table s1 a significant proportion of antibiotics entering the body are not fully absorbed and excreted as prodrugs or metabolites in urine and feces before entering municipal wtps khetan and collins 2007 in addition most antibiotics are not completely removed by wtps and a large amount of antibiotics would be released into surface water with effluent zhang and li 2011 previous research has found smx to be one of the 35 most frequently detected substances in wastewater treatment plant effluent kim and carlson 2005 importantly smx and ery have no biodegradation capacity in aquatic organisms table s8 additionally the overall neutral ph and high turbidity of the yellow river mainstream especially downstream effectively mitigated the hydrolysis and photolysis of antibiotics likely contributing to the stable occurrence of smx and ery table s2 in the case of the relationship between hix and antibiotic concentrations fig 8 hix had a significant negative correlation with the concentrations of smx r 0 67 p 0 001 sdx r 0 59 p 0 001 and ery r 0 59 p 0 001 previously a study monitored the in situ composition and properties of dom in surface water at different influent flows and found that dom concentration and molecular size increased significantly with increasing influent flows zhou et al 2016 in addition dom spectral characteristics suggested that the dom fractions entering the river were dominated by macromolecular humic substances during the rainy season indicating that non point source pollution can directly affect dom humification in the river given that dom hix above 3 represents a dominant terrestrial contribution to dom chen et al 2016b these results further confirmed that smx sdx and ery residues in the mainstream of the yellow river mainly originate from sewage treatment plants but are not closely related to nonpoint source pollution discharges such as rainfall and irrigation runoff overall when the r c3 c2 value is higher and the hix value is smaller at a certain location of the river it not only reflects that high levels of dom components that are strongly influenced by human activities are present in the river but also indicates that the river tends to contain high levels of human antibiotics especially those that can be stable in the aquatic environment additionally fig 8 showed a negative correlation between r c3 c2 and the concentrations of 8 antibiotics smp smm lom nor mcl otc tc and ctc and a positive correlation for hix with these antibiotic concentrations at the same time p 0 05 among them smp smm and ctc were animal based table s1 reflecting the non point source contribution of their terrestrial origin for two humans mcl and lom and three common human animal antibiotics nor otc and tc they were mostly distributed upstream across the river fig s4c and fig s6 the relatively poor sewage treatment facilities upstream suggest that these antibiotics may not be discharged into the river via sewage plants zhang 2009 such a phenomenon suggests that more land based dom sources and non point source discharges of animal human and mixed use antibiotics with smaller r c3 c2 values and larger hix values were present at one point in the river moreover hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation directly affect the stability of antibiotics in the aqueous environment and have a profound effect on their environmental behavior yang et al 2021 which may be responsible for the insignificance of the non point source pollution process in relation to the dom component in the non point source discharge process however not every antibiotic has been found and reported to have a half life under specific conditions table s8 and further research on the mechanisms of degradation and transformation of each antibiotic is needed in the aqueous environment to further confirm these findings two factors representing antibiotic sources were obtained primarily using the pca mlr model table 4 factor 1 was heavily weighted by smx and ery which have been used primarily for urinary tract infections respiratory tract infections and skin infections in humans in comparison with fig 8 r c3 c2 and hix were closely correlated with these three human antibiotics i e smx ery and sdx reflecting one more point source contaminant contributor than the pc mlr method factor 2 was heavily weighted by eno smp and sdz as shown in tables1 smp and sdz are used as veterinary drugs although eno is a human antibiotic most of the high concentration points are located at upstream in the mainstream of the yellow river fig s4c where sewage treatment facilities are relatively poor resulting in the same non point source discharge of eno into the river as smp and sdz therefore pca2 represents a non point source contamination antibiotic type compared to fig 8 there was a negative correlation for r c3 c2 and 8 antibiotics smp smm lom nor mcl otc tc and ctc and a positive correlation for hix with these antibiotics at the same time a broader range of non point source contamination antibiotics was obtained than the pca mlr method overall the two source indicator variables i e r c3 c2 and hix analyzed by dom characteristics contain more information than pca mlr method and can predict antibiotic contamination without complex instrumental determination in aquatic environments 4 conclusion this comprehensive study investigated the occurrence and spatial distribution of antibiotics humification characteristics and fluorescence composition of dom and their correlations throughout the yellow river basin the study s findings indicate that tcs antibiotics were generally detected at low levels with higher concentrations observed in the upstream region qns antibiotics were found to have relatively elevated levels near the end of the upstream point while sas and mls antibiotics showed a low concentration in the upstream area and a notable increase downstream meanwhile dom was abundant and composed of visible fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c1 ultraviolet fulvic acid like fluorescence fraction c2 and tryptophan like fraction of protein like fraction c3 in the yellow river with the humification degree upstream and midstream higher than that of the downstream furthermore pearson correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of smx ery and sdx in the yellow river was closely related to the effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants the r c3 c2 and hix of dom may indirectly reflect the pollution and source composition of the detected antibiotics in the yellow river the new analytical approach using fluorescence dom as an indicator to explore sources of antibiotic like contaminants is a groundbreaking step in establishing a qualitative and quantitative source allocation method in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

14878,to avoid the inhibition of microbial activity and the emergence of bacterial resistance effective abiotic pretreatment methods to eliminate the antibacterial activity of target antibiotics before the biotreatment system for antibiotic containing wastewater are necessary in this study the vuv uv sulfite system was developed as a pretreatment technique for the source elimination of florfenicol flo resistance risk compared with the vuv uv persulfate and sole vuv photolysis the vuv uv sulfite system had the highest decomposition rate 0 33 min 1 and the highest defluorination 83 0 resulting in the efficient elimination of flo antibacterial activity with less than 2 0 mineralization which would effectively retain the carbon sources for the sludge microorganisms in the subsequent biotreatment process furthermore h was confirmed to play a more important role in the elimination of flo antibacterial activity by controlling the environmental conditions for the formation and transformation of reactive species and adding their scavengers based on the theoretical calculation and proposed photolytic intermediates the elimination of flo antibacterial activity was achieved by dechlorination defluorination and removal of sulfomethyl groups when the pretreated flo containing wastewater entered the biological treatment unit the abundance of associated antibiotic resistance genes args and the relative abundance of integrons were efficiently prevented by approximately 55 4 and 22 9 respectively these results demonstrated that the vuv uv sulfite system could be adopted as a promising pretreatment option for the source elimination of flo resistance risk by target decomposition of its responsible structures before the subsequent biotreatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction pretreatment florfenicol antibacterial activity antibiotic resistance genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction at present the problem of the abuse of antibiotics is serious especially halogenated antibiotics which account for approximately 40 0 of the total consumed antibiotics in china zhang et al 2015 florfenicol flo is widely used to treat various diseases and infections in livestock poultry and aquaculture junaid et al 2021 antibiotic a hard to degrade environmental pollutant exerts a certain selective pressure on organisms because of its bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects which will not only affect the normal life metabolic activities of organisms but also cause the risk of evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args zainab et al 2020 it is predicted that the continued development of antibiotic resistant infections will result in 10 million deaths every year xie et al 2022 currently residual antibiotics have been detected in a variety of water environments at ng l to μg l levels such as surface water groundwater and offshore waters elder et al 2021 to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance we should attach great importance to wastewater effluent treatment the antibiotic wastewater generated in the daily consumption process is finally collected to wastewater treatment plants wwtps oberoi et al 2019 biological treatment is the main unit in the process of wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants because of the high biomass concentration and a variety of types of microorganisms the sludge system in wwtps is considered to be a hot spot for the spread of args ping et al 2022 therefore effective pretreatments are warranted for antibiotic containing wastewater to lose its original antimicrobial activity prior to the biological treatment process advanced oxidation processes aops have been the most widely applied abiotic treatment technologies for antibiotic wastewater such as uv based advanced oxidation uv chlorine uv persulfate uv hydrogen peroxide fenton oxidation ozone oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation das and ahn 2022 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2017 however the highly active oxidative radicals e g ho so4 o2 will be easily consumed by the other coexisting organic substances resulting in the unsatisfactory decomposition of the target antibiotics pei et al 2019 worse still the consumption of coexisting organic matter and mineralization from aops in the elimination of antibacterial activity will further exacerbate the problem of insufficient carbon sources in wwtps which is widespread in china fu et al 2022 as a result the biotreatment system in wwtps needs more additional organic matter to supply the carbon sources required by the normal metabolism of sludge microorganisms e g heterotrophic denitrification and phosphorus removal which will lead to much more co2 emissions after microbial metabolism in biotreatment processes peng et al 2018 tian and yu 2020 zhang et al 2022 therefore an appropriate pretreatment technology should have a certain ability to retain the carbon sources while eliminating antibacterial activity advanced reduction processes arps based on the uv sulfite system have been widely studied in the reductive decomposition of various contaminants in water and wastewater such as halogenated disinfection byproducts and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass cui et al 2020 li et al 2012 rao et al 2021 different from aops arps are reductive decomposition processes based on the highly reductive species including hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atoms h the processes will selectively react with the substances that are easily reduced especially the target antibiotics rather than readily oxidized coexisting organic matters which will retain the carbon sources at the maximum level chu et al 2021 milh et al 2021 therefore arp is more advantageous as a pretreatment process for antibiotic containing wastewater in addition a low pressure mercury vapor lpmv lamp which radiates at both 185 nm vuv185 and 254 nm uv254 is considered to be more effective in decomposing pollutants than uv at 254 nm li et al 2017 vuv185 irradiation can directly photolyze water to generate more highly reactive radicals eaq h and ho gu et al 2017 li et al 2016 pan et al 2022 recently some halogenated organic contaminants such as pfass gu et al 2017 and haloacetic acid zhang et al 2021 have been reductively dehalogenated in vuv uv sulfite system but the decomposition performance of target antibiotics the retention ability of carbon sources and the elimination mechanism of antibiotic resistant risk of this system are still unknown to explore the feasibility of the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment on the elimination of flo resistance risk this study is intended to i demonstrate the excellent performance in the decomposition dehalogenation and mineralization of flo and retaining carbon sources in the vuv uv sulfite system ii investigate the effects of different environmental conditions ph dissolved oxygen and coexisting substances on the decomposition efficiency of flo iii reveal the elimination mechanism of flo antibacterial activity and the retaining mechanism for carbon sources in vuv uv sulfite system and iv evaluate the effect of the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment on the source control of the formation and spread risk of the corresponding args in the subsequent biotreatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

photoreactor and operation procedure the decomposition of flo was carried out in a glass cylinder device with a capacity of 500 ml figure s1 in the experiment the temperature of the reaction solution was controlled at 25 1 by a thermostatic circulator and a 10 w low pressure mercury lamp with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 185 nm was used as the light source which was placed vertically in the center of the reactor a magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the reactor to improve the mass transfer efficiency between the reactants and the reactive species according to the method mentioned in literatures the photonic intensity was measured as 3 88 w cm2 for 254 nm uv and 1 56 w cm2 for 185 nm li et al 2012 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the initial concentration of the antibiotic solution was 50 mg l in this experiment phosphate buffer solution pb 10 mm was used to adjust the ph from 5 0 8 0 and borate buffer solution bb 10 mm was used to adjust the ph from 9 0 to 10 0 for the test of three different dissolved oxygen do conditions nitrogen was blown for 30 min to ensure no do in the solution do 0 1 mg l and an oxygen generator was used to deliver oxygen into the solution to ensure that the initial do was supersaturated do 40 mg l under the natural condition do 8 0 mg l the solution does not need aeration treatment all trials were conducted in duplicate to determine whether the pretreated antibiotics lost the potential to induce the proliferation of args in the subsequent biotreatment system a 200 ml serum bottle with 50 ml of anaerobic sludge and 100 ml of synthetic wastewater with different pretreatments was used as the anaerobic bioreactor mlss 10 g l and placed in a constant temperature shaker at 30 c and 120 rpm for cultivation biotreated sludge samples were collected after 6 weeks for sludge metagenomic sequencing the synthetic antibiotic containing wastewater consisted of glucose nh4cl kh2po4 nahco3 trace elements and flo 10 mg l four control groups were set up including the positive control group without pretreatment after adding flo hereafter referred to as without pretreatment the negative control group without flo added hereafter referred to as without flo and the vuv uv sulfite arp pretreatment group hereafter referred to as the vuv uv sulfite arp and vuv uv photolysis pretreatment group hereafter referred to as vuv uv photolysis the synthetic wastewater in the vuv uv sulfite arp and vuv uv photolysis pretreatment groups was illuminated for 14 min and the residual concentration of target antibiotic in vuv uv sulfite pretreatment group was lower than the threshold concentration of flo antibacterial activity three parallel experiments were set up for each control group 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1

degree of flo during the vuv uv sulfite arp was determined by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the identification of intermediate products from flo decomposition was conducted by an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms system ab sciex tripletof 5600 the detailed method of uplc ms analysis is described in the si text s2 the anions f and cl produced from the photolytic process were determined by ion chromatography ic 883 ion chromatograph metrohm switzerland equipped with a hydrophilic anion exchange column 4 0 mm 250 mm the eluent was mixed with 1 8 mm na2co3 and 1 7 mm nahco3 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 2 3 2 antibacterial activity analysis the antibacterial activity of the target antibiotic or its corresponding pretreated solution was evaluated by comparing the inhibition effect to the sensitive standard strains staphylococcus aureus s aureus and escherichia coli e coli with that of a standard reference substance using the turbidimetric method the detailed procedure for the antibacterial activity assay is described in the si text s3 2 3 3 density functional theory dft calculation the theoretical calculations were performed via the gaussian 16 suite of programs the structure of the studied compound denoted by m was fully optimized at the b3lyp d3 def2 svp level of theory the bond energies of m were estimated at the b3lyp d3 def2 svp level of theory humphrey et al 1996 the visual molecular dynamics vmd program was used to plot the color filled iso surface graphs to visualize the molecular electrostatic potential mesp the fukui index of m was calculated by using the multiwfn software tian and chen 2012 2 3 4 metagenomic analysis after a 6 week biotreatment process a quantitative sludge water mixture was extracted from the anaerobic reactor and then centrifuged to obtain sludge samples for metagenomic analysis triplicate samples from each pretreatment were collected for metagenomics analysis and the extracted dna was analyzed through library construction metagenomics sequencing sequence quality control genome assembly and prediction the above detailed preparations followed our previous research ding et al 2021 arg annotations were applied using a blastp search version 2 2 28 against the antibiotic resistance genes database with an e value cutoff of 1 e 5 all the clean data were searched for integrons downloaded from the integrall database similarly a cutoff e value of 10 5 was used in the databases shi et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 decomposition and dehalogenation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system under the oxygen free condition 50 mg l flo in the vuv uv photolytic process was completely decomposed within 30 min of irradiation figure s2a and the defluorination efficiency was as high as 79 2 after 1 h of irradiation fig 2b in the vuv uv photolytic system the direct photolysis based on uv254 was the primary choice for flo decomposition because the vuv185 light emitted by the low pressure hg lamp is in the minority 10 0 zoschke et al 2014 the indirect photodecomposition of reactive species excited by vuv185 is limited eqs 1 2 a slight elevation in the decomposition rate constant 0 25 min 1 was achieved when persulfate pds was activated by irradiation table s1 and fig 1 a but the defluorination efficiency of vuv uv pds was less than 50 0 fig 1b when 1 mm na2so3 was added to the vuv uv photolytic system the irradiation time for complete decomposition of flo was shortened to 15 min and the decomposition rate constant kobs in the vuv uv sulfite process increased from 0 23 min 1 in the vuv uv process to 0 33 min 1 table s1 and fig 1a simultaneously the defluorination of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system was as high as 83 0 which was the highest among the above processes fig 1b the excellent degradation performance for flo in the vuv uv sulfite might be attributed to the enhanced formation of eaq or h by the addition of sulfite during the vuv uv photolytic process discussed in detail later eqs 3 4 in addition the mineralization efficiency of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system with 1 mm reductant was only 8 0 while the efficiency in the vuv uv pds system increased to 19 3 fig 1c and table s2 moreover the difference between these two systems increased to 34 6 when the additive concentration increased to 3 mm the above results indicated that vuv uv sulfite pretreatment process had a considerable potential retain the carbon sources of the target pollutant because of so4 and ho comes from pds stimulated by uv irradiation performed as the nonselective oxidants will consume the organic matters in water liu et al 2022 meng et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 100 mg l glucose was added to simulate the coexistence of easily degradable organic matter in flo containing wastewater to observe its interference with the decomposition of target antibiotics and preservation of the carbon sources for the subsequent biotreatment the results showed that the kobs of flo decomposition in vuv uv photolytic system with 1 mm pds was reduced significantly from 0 25 min 1 to 0 07 min 1 while the decomposition performance in the vuv uv sulfite system with the same concentration of reductant addition was not significantly decreased fig 1a and table s1 meanwhile the cod removal efficiency of the flo solution reached 1 1 and 8 6 in the vuv uv sulfite and vuv uv pds processes respectively upon further increasing the addition of oxidant or reductant the cod removal efficiency of the vuv uv pds system was increased significantly while that of the vuv uv sulfite system was still maintained at a very low level 2 0 fig 1d the above results indicated that vuv uv sulfite not only barely interfered with the coexisting organic matter in the pretreatment of flo containing wastewater but also retained most of the carbon sources in the system combined with the results of decomposition and dehalogenation the vuv uv sulfite system might be more suitable for the pretreatment of flo containing wastewater 1 h 2 o 185 nm e aq h o h 2 h 2 o 185 nm h o h 3 so 3 2 hv 254 nm so 3 e aq 4 hso 3 hv 254 nm so 3 h 3 2 effect of environmental factors on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 2 1 effect of ph on flo decomposition it is well known that the ionic distribution of sulfite depends on solution ph so3 2 is the dominant species under alkaline conditions and eaq plays an important role in this case when hso3 dominates the solution under alkaline conditions h becomes the main active species eqs 3 4 chen et al 2021 in addition solution ph also affects the stability of the presence of eaq and h previous studies have reported that acidic conditions are conducive to the accumulation of h while alkaline conditions are more advantageous to eaq existence under alkaline condition eqs 5 7 gu et al 2017 li et al 2012 seid et al 2020 therefore a series of experiments were conducted to explore the effect of ph on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system and the decomposition efficiency was above 97 0 within 15 min figure s3a with the increase in solution ph from 5 0 to 8 0 the decomposition rate showed a positive correlation with solution ph r 0 996 the optimal decomposition effect was obtained at ph 8 0 and the decomposition rate constant was 0 33 min 1 fig 2 a when the ph was increased to 10 0 successively the decomposition rate tended to decrease instead as the ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 kobs showed a significant downward trend which indicated that alkaline conditions had a more significant inhibitory effect on the flo decomposition process that is the decomposition performance in an acidic and slightly alkaline environment dominated by h ph 5 0 8 0 was better than that in an alkaline environment ph 8 0 10 0 where eaq played a relatively important role thus we presumed that h was more nonnegligible in the decomposition process of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system and quenching experiments for the identification of major species were conducted in the next section this speculation was different from previous studies which emphasized that eaq was the dominant species for contaminate decomposition cao et al 2021 cheng et al 2021 tan et al 2021 xie et al 2017 5 e aq h h 6 o h h e aq h 2 o 7 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 in addition ph had no significant impact on the decomposition of the target antibiotic in the vuv uv photolytic process figure s3b which indicated that ph was not involved in the direct photolysis process of flo the results further demonstrated that ph was affected through the species distribution of sulfite solution to change the types and transmission of active radicals which ultimately determined the reductive decomposition process of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 2 2 effect of do on flo decomposition the presence of do will reduce the rates and efficiencies of contaminant decomposition by depleting the reductive species in most arp systems gu et al 2017 the decomposition rate constant of flo was as high as 0 33 min 1 which was the most efficient under nitrogen supersaturation do 0 1 mg l fig 2b under the natural condition do 8 mg l kobs was 10 0 lower than that of the nitrogen supersaturation group under the condition of dissolved oxygen supersaturation do 40 mg l kobs was as low as 0 17 min 1 the inhibition of excessive do on the reaction was mainly caused by the ability to clear eaq or h eqs 8 9 in addition do can also adsorb some photons to inhibit the direct photolytic process while reducing the yields of eaq or h at the source hasson and nicholls 1971 to ascertain whether a portion of do was engaged in the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system the residual do concentration after the reaction was detected the concentration of do was consumed in the irradiated solution under the natural condition and the oxygen supersaturation condition specifically the concentration of do decreased from approximately 8 mg l to less than 1 mg l under the natural condition in the oxygen supersaturation system the concentration of do declined remarkably with a final concentration as low as 8 10 mg l simultaneously the toc value was also considered before and after the reaction which could reflect the mineralization rate of the system table s3 the mineralization performances of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system under nitrogen supersaturation and natural conditions were less than 10 0 under the oxygen saturation condition the mineralization rate was the highest approximately 33 9 this suggested that partial oxygen might be dedicated to photolysis or other reactions to generate reactive oxygen species ros to enhance the oxidative decomposition of flo cui et al 2020 combined with the changes in the decomposition performance of flo under different do conditions supersaturated oxygen may mainly play the role of scavenging reducing radicals in this system that is eaq or h might be captured in the system resulting in a decrease in the flo decomposition rate eqs 8 9 therefore this result implied that vuv uv sulfite pretreatment with do at the natural concentration for flo decomposition could still preserve the most carbon sources which was conducive to mitigating the problem of the insufficient carbon sources in the subsequent biological treatment process 8 e aq o 2 o 2 k 8 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 9 h o 2 ho 2 k 9 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 effect of water matrices on flo decomposition humic acid ha cl and hco3 are widespread in natural waters and may affect the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system to illustrate the possibility of vuv uv sulfite pretreatment in actual aquatic environments it is necessary to explore the potential effects of coexisting substances on the decomposition of target pollutants when the concentration of ha in solution was at a low level 5 mg l flo was still completely decomposed within 15 min despite the inhibition of decomposition figure s4a however the decomposition rate constant of flo was reduced to 0 13 min 1 when the ha concentration increased to 20 mg l table s4 this result might be mainly attributed to the presence of its ultraviolet absorption band which had a certain blocking effect on uv resulting in the limitation of direct photolysis of flo deng et al 2022 sun et al 2017 it would also compete for photons with so3 2 or hso3 which led to a reduction in the yield of active radicals such as eaq and h because they could remove part of eaq and h present in solution the decomposition inhibition of flo was possibly achieved duan and batchelor 2014 wu et al 2021 furthermore the carboxylic acid on the ha aromatic ring could preferentially react with the generated eaq or h to capture them fennell et al 2022 this result was consistent with the result of the decomposition of monochloroacetic acid on vuv uv sulfite studied by zhang j et al zhang et al 2021 volatile fatty acids vfas including sodium formate sodium acetate sodium propionate sodium butyrate and methanol were added as a common mixed carbon source coexisting with flo to explore the effect of complex coexisting organics on flo decomposition in the vuv uv sulfite system the ratio of the five carbon source components was 1 1 1 1 1 and the final cod concentration was approximately 100 mg l the degradation of flo in the coexisting system with mixed coexisting organics was not remarkably affected which was consistent with the coexistence of 100 mg l glucose figure s4b therefore we have concluded that the vuv uv sulfite system still exhibited great decomposition performance of the target antibiotic with the common coexisting organic matters hco3 exerted a slight attenuation effect on the decomposition of flo and the change in concentration had little effect on the decomposition of flo figure s4b the reaction kinetic of eaq with hco3 is less than 106 m 1 s 1 which consumes part of the eaq and exerts a weak inhibitory effect on flo decomposition buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2017 moreover the degradation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system was almost unaffected by cl with a decomposition efficiency of up to 98 2 at 15 min figure s4c although cl has a strong absorption of 185 nm photons extinction molar coefficient of approximately 3500 m 1cm 1 han et al 2020 and will lead to the formation of oxidative chlorine radicals buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2017 the effect of this radical on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system needs to be further investigated high total suspended solids tss concentration blocked the light penetration through the water which will affect the activation of sulfite to produce reducing radicals liu et al 2021b to evaluate the effect of tss from the practical wastewater on the degradation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system we collected actual samples from two wastewater treatment plants and prepared unfiltered and filtered samples of exogenously added flo 50 mg l some differences on flo decomposition were observed among the experiments with different tss concentrations and the degradation process of flo in filtered wastewater was significantly better than that in unfiltered water figure s5 which was consistent with the expected assumption in addition the turbidity of the filtered water remained at a high level 34 12 ntu table s5 which could interfere with the effective utilization of light and further affect the production of the dominant reactive species to inhibit the decomposition of flo in vuv uv sulfite system campisi et al 2005 however the degradation efficiency of the parent compound could still reach more than 99 within 30 min of light exposure hence the vuv uv sulfite system remains potential for the application of flo degradation in the actual wastewater pretreatment 3 3 the elimination mechanism of flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 3 1 the elimination of flo antibacterial activity although antibacterial activities of samples pretreated with vuv uv and vuv uv sulfite photolytic processes both have been effectively reduced the antibacterial activity of samples after vuv uv sulfite photolysis were generally lower than that of the vuv uv photolysis process in the same period when e coli and s aureus were served as the indicator strains for gram negative and positive bacteria fig 3 the results indicated that the efficiency and rate of vuv uv sulfite pretreatment in eliminating flo antibacterial activity was higher than that of the sole vuv uv photolytic process the capacity for eliminating the antibacterial activity against the two bacteria was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of flo degraded in the vuv uv sulfite system r 0 65 p 0 05 it has been confirmed that halogen substituents are important characteristic functional groups in the composition of flo antibacterial activity schwarz et al 2004 during the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system the concentration of free f and cl can reflect the elimination of antibacterial activity of flo the correlation analysis between the antibacterial activity and the dehalogenation showed that the antibacterial activity of the samples reduced by vuv uv sulfite was negatively correlated with the corresponding defluorination and dechlorination efficiency p 0 05 this meant that the higher the concentration of f and cl generated in the solution the greater the antibacterial activity could be lowered in the process of flo decomposition thus we further deduced that the dehalogenation of flo was an important pathway to achieve a rapid elimination of its antibacterial activity furthermore there was a significant correlation coefficient between the antibacterial activity of the pretreated solution and its defluorination rate e coli r 0 933 p 0 05 s aureus r 0 961 p 0 05 which was generally higher than the correlation coefficient between the antibacterial activity of the pretreated solution and the dechlorination rate e coli r 0 851 p 0 05 s aureus r 0 916 p 0 05 therefore the result indicated that the contribution from the fluorine substituent to the antibacterial activity of flo was larger than that of the chlorine substituent 3 3 2 the dominant reactive species responsible for flo decomposition it is reported that some reactive species e g eaq h ho can be produced in the system by vuv uv photolysis with sulfite involvement but the dominant species are still uncertain liu et al 2021a zoschke et al 2014 herein different radical scavengers were selected for their corresponding reactive species to investigate their respective contributions to flo decomposition t butanol tba was chosen as the trapping agent for ho which exhibits a high reaction rate constant with ho k ho tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 wang and wang 2020 as shown in fig 4 a flo could still be completely decomposed after 15 min of reaction despite the addition of 10 mm tba indicating that the contribution of ho to flo decomposition was inconsequential in addition nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were served as quenching agents of reductive species eaq and h in flo decomposition buxton et al 1988 li et al 2012 the results suggested that the decomposition of flo was significantly inhibited with the addition of 10 mm no3 or no2 and its corresponding reaction rate constant decreased from 0 33 min 1 to 0 19 min 1 and 0 09 min 1 respectively table s6 thus vuv uv sulfite photolysis of flo process tended to rely on the action of reducing radicals eaq or h notably the degradation efficiencies of adding no2 or no3 for the 60 min photolytic reaction were 72 7 and 93 6 respectively suggesting that the inhibition of no2 was more remarkable than that of no3 at the same concentration according to previous reports the quenching constants of no2 and no3 for eaq are on the same order of magnitude eqs 10 11 while the h scavenging activity of no2 eq 12 is approximately 500 times higher than that of no3 eq 13 bolton 2000 li et al 2012 therefore the well founded speculation that the quenching of h by no2 was the main reason for the decrease in flo decomposition efficiency indicated that h was the dominant active species during the process of flo decomposition in the vuv uv sulfite system combined with the fact that acidic conditions were more conducive to the presence of h the result further validated that acidic conditions were more suitable for flo decomposition than alkaline conditions 10 no 2 e aq n o 2 2 k 10 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 11 no 3

photolysis system had a similar trend to the vuv uv sulfite arp system fig 4b significantly with the addition of 10 mm no3 or no2 the flo decomposition rate constants decreased from 0 23 min 1 to 0 13 min 1 and 0 08 min 1 table s7 respectively which were slightly weaker than those in the vuv uv sulfite complex system first the results demonstrated that the indirect photolysis of flo in the vuv uv system relying on active species was a reduction oriented process which was inconsistent with the results of previous reports where both oxidation and reduction processes simultaneously acted on the decomposition of pollutants li et al 2017 pan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the reduction process was enhanced by the addition of sulfite into the vuv uv sulfite system 3 3 3 the possible elimination pathways of flo antibacterial activity based on dft the antibacterial activity of flo is contributed by the fluorine substituent sulfomethyl group and thero configuration jiang et al 2018 schwarz et al 2004 the charge distribution shown in the electrostatic potential diagram fig 5 b and the equipotential map of the fukui function f fig 5c and table s8 indicated that 16cl and 17cl possessed a high potential for nucleophilic attack while the reaction activity of 13f was weak the sulfomethyl group might also undergo nucleophilic reactions which was further determined by cdd table s8 combined with the calculation results of bond energy and bond length table s9 15c 17cl 344 66 kcal mol 1 792 å 15c 16cl 334 51 kcal mol 1 798 å 5c 7s 334 75 kcal mol 1 797 å 7s 16cl and 17cl were the active sites to further reveal the elimination pathways of flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite reductive process the major intermediates were identified and the structural variations of the above representative groups were speculated some intermediates of different reaction durations were exhibited at detectable levels figure s6 primary mass spectra of the products in vuv uv sulfite reduction were analyzed and their potential structures were derived figure s7 based on the identified products and previously reported decomposition pathways the main decomposition pathways of flo in this reaction were inferred as follows fig 5d ding et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 at first the photoinduced removal of the sulfomethyl group from the benzene ring was the main way to eliminate the antibacterial activity of flo p2 m z 278 0156 and then the product underwent defluorination p3 m z 258 0094 although the 13 f reaction activity of flo was weak based on dft calculations the relativly high defluorination efficiency approximately 83 0 in the vuv uv sulfite system indicated that the pathway of defluorination could not be ignored and even acted as an important pathway for the elimination of flo antibacterial activity in the cooperation of reductive species another route was the direct loss of chlorine followed by chlorohydroxylation to remove another chlorine resulting in the formation of products p4 m z 322 0324 p5 m z 302 0504 the third route mainly relied on hydrolysis to achieve dehalogenation p6 m z 288 0347 p7 m z 199 0088 after these proposed pathways flo was broken down into lower molecular weight substances and some inorganic ions e g f cl therefore the removal of the sulfomethyl group and halogenated substituents were the major elimination pathways for flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite arp process 3 4 effective prevention of args formation and spread with vuv uv sulfite pretreatment during the subsequent anaerobic biological system to confirm the effectiveness of vuv uv sulfite arp pretreatment on the source prevention of antibiotic resistance risk in the subsequent biotreatment system the abundances of typical and relevant args in anaerobic reactors were quantified after 6 weeks of biotreatment operation as an important representative of encoding efflux pumping mechanisms flor is sensitive to the fluctuation of environmental selective pressure generated by flo braibant et al 2005 liang et al 2019 after the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment with 14 min irradiation the abundance of flor in the subsequent biotreatment process was as low as 2 44 10 3 copies cell fig 6 a it was at the same abundance level as the negative control without flo and significantly lower than that of the positive control without pretreatment p 0 05 which was approximately 30 0 of the same light dose vuv uv photolytic treatment group moreover the abundance of chloramphenicol resistance genes crgs after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment was 7 02 10 3 copies cell nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that in the untreated positive control simultaneously the abundance of crgs after vuv uv photolytic pretreatment was twice that in the vuv uv sulfite arp the above results indicated that the vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction pretreatment could efficiently achieve the source repression of the proliferation of relevant args in the subsequent biotreatment process furthermore the abundance of total resistance genes in the vuv uv sulfite arp group was significantly lower than that in the positive control without pretreatment and vuv uv photolysis with the same dose of vuv uv irradiation p 0 05 in the untreated positive control group except for crgs sulfonamides macrolides aminoglycosides and multidrug resistance genes were the 4 most abundant types of args with vuv uv sulfite pretreatment for flo containing wastewater the abundances of above 4 major args were reduced to about 80 6 60 5 44 4 and 80 8 without pretreatment group respectively which was lower than that in the vuv uv photolytic pretreatment the results further confirmed that vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction pretreatment effectively prevented the diffusion of args at the source and exhibited a better performance than vuv uv photolytic pretreatment it is nonnegligible that the primary mechanism of acquired resistance is horizontal gene transfer hgt of args from their environment or other bacteria via mobile genetic elements mges xu et al 2011 as an important indicator of the horizontal transfer potential of args the abundance of integrons in biotreatment systems and their prevention techniques has become a research hotspot guo et al 2017 moreira et al 2021 integron is a genetic platform that allows bacteria to rapidly evolve by acquiring storing excising and reordering open reading frames in mges escudero et al 2015 consequently the relative abundance of integrons in the subsequent biotreatment was investigated the results showed that the relative abundance of integrons after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment was 370 3 ppm which was obviously lower than that in the flo containing water without pretreatment p 0 05 fig 6c moreover it was 11 2 less than that of the vuv uv photolytic pretreatment group therefore the vuv uv sulfite reduction pretreatment had a better preventing performance for the horizontal transfer potential of args in the subsequent anaerobic biological system 4 conclusions in this study the eliminating mechanism of flo resistance risk in the vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction system before biological tretreatment was revealed the conclusions are as followed 1 compared with the vuv uv photolytic and vuv uv pds oxidation processes vuv uv sulfite system had the highest decomposition rate constant kobs 0 33 min 1 and the best defluorination efficiency approximately 83 0 of flo which eliminated antibacterial activity efficiently in addition vuv uv sulfite had the lowest mineralization performance of flo 8 0 and the cod removal efficiency of the whole system 1 1 which determined that it had the ability not to be disturbed by coexisting organic matters and to retain carbon sources 2 acidic and weak alkaline conditions were more favorable for the decomposition of the target antibiotics and do under natural conditions did not have an impact on flo decomposition 3 the radical quenching experiments revealed that the main reactive radical was h which could explain the effect of ph on target antibiotics and further established that the process mainly relied on the reduction process 4 three potential eliminating pathways for flo antibacterial activity in vuv uv sulfite system were proposed including dechlorination defluorination and the removal of sulfomethyl group 5 the abundances of flor and crgs and in the subsequent biotreatment fed with vuv uv sulfite pretreated flo containing wastewater were at the same abundance level as the negative control in addition the relative abundance of integrons after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment were 22 9 lower than that in the flo containing wastewater without pretreatment which would source reduce the potential of horizontal transfer risk of corresponding args declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14878,to avoid the inhibition of microbial activity and the emergence of bacterial resistance effective abiotic pretreatment methods to eliminate the antibacterial activity of target antibiotics before the biotreatment system for antibiotic containing wastewater are necessary in this study the vuv uv sulfite system was developed as a pretreatment technique for the source elimination of florfenicol flo resistance risk compared with the vuv uv persulfate and sole vuv photolysis the vuv uv sulfite system had the highest decomposition rate 0 33 min 1 and the highest defluorination 83 0 resulting in the efficient elimination of flo antibacterial activity with less than 2 0 mineralization which would effectively retain the carbon sources for the sludge microorganisms in the subsequent biotreatment process furthermore h was confirmed to play a more important role in the elimination of flo antibacterial activity by controlling the environmental conditions for the formation and transformation of reactive species and adding their scavengers based on the theoretical calculation and proposed photolytic intermediates the elimination of flo antibacterial activity was achieved by dechlorination defluorination and removal of sulfomethyl groups when the pretreated flo containing wastewater entered the biological treatment unit the abundance of associated antibiotic resistance genes args and the relative abundance of integrons were efficiently prevented by approximately 55 4 and 22 9 respectively these results demonstrated that the vuv uv sulfite system could be adopted as a promising pretreatment option for the source elimination of flo resistance risk by target decomposition of its responsible structures before the subsequent biotreatment process graphical abstract

1 introduction at present the problem of the abuse of antibiotics is serious especially halogenated antibiotics which account for approximately 40 0 of the total consumed antibiotics in china zhang et al 2015 florfenicol flo is widely used to treat various diseases and infections in livestock poultry and aquaculture junaid et al 2021 antibiotic a hard to degrade environmental pollutant exerts a certain selective pressure on organisms because of its bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects which will not only affect the normal life metabolic activities of organisms but also cause the risk of evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args zainab et al 2020 it is predicted that the continued development of antibiotic resistant infections will result in 10 million deaths every year xie et al 2022 currently residual antibiotics have been detected in a variety of water environments at ng l to μg l levels such as surface water groundwater and offshore waters elder et al 2021 to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance we should attach great importance to wastewater effluent treatment the antibiotic wastewater generated in the daily consumption process is finally collected to wastewater treatment plants wwtps oberoi et al 2019 biological treatment is the main unit in the process of wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants because of the high biomass concentration and a variety of types of microorganisms the sludge system in wwtps is considered to be a hot spot for the spread of args ping et al 2022 therefore effective pretreatments are warranted for antibiotic containing wastewater to lose its original antimicrobial activity prior to the biological treatment process advanced oxidation processes aops have been the most widely applied abiotic treatment technologies for antibiotic wastewater such as uv based advanced oxidation uv chlorine uv persulfate uv hydrogen peroxide fenton oxidation ozone oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation das and ahn 2022 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2017 however the highly active oxidative radicals e g ho so4 o2 will be easily consumed by the other coexisting organic substances resulting in the unsatisfactory decomposition of the target antibiotics pei et al 2019 worse still the consumption of coexisting organic matter and mineralization from aops in the elimination of antibacterial activity will further exacerbate the problem of insufficient carbon sources in wwtps which is widespread in china fu et al 2022 as a result the biotreatment system in wwtps needs more additional organic matter to supply the carbon sources required by the normal metabolism of sludge microorganisms e g heterotrophic denitrification and phosphorus removal which will lead to much more co2 emissions after microbial metabolism in biotreatment processes peng et al 2018 tian and yu 2020 zhang et al 2022 therefore an appropriate pretreatment technology should have a certain ability to retain the carbon sources while eliminating antibacterial activity advanced reduction processes arps based on the uv sulfite system have been widely studied in the reductive decomposition of various contaminants in water and wastewater such as halogenated disinfection byproducts and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass cui et al 2020 li et al 2012 rao et al 2021 different from aops arps are reductive decomposition processes based on the highly reductive species including hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atoms h the processes will selectively react with the substances that are easily reduced especially the target antibiotics rather than readily oxidized coexisting organic matters which will retain the carbon sources at the maximum level chu et al 2021 milh et al 2021 therefore arp is more advantageous as a pretreatment process for antibiotic containing wastewater in addition a low pressure mercury vapor lpmv lamp which radiates at both 185 nm vuv185 and 254 nm uv254 is considered to be more effective in decomposing pollutants than uv at 254 nm li et al 2017 vuv185 irradiation can directly photolyze water to generate more highly reactive radicals eaq h and ho gu et al 2017 li et al 2016 pan et al 2022 recently some halogenated organic contaminants such as pfass gu et al 2017 and haloacetic acid zhang et al 2021 have been reductively dehalogenated in vuv uv sulfite system but the decomposition performance of target antibiotics the retention ability of carbon sources and the elimination mechanism of antibiotic resistant risk of this system are still unknown to explore the feasibility of the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment on the elimination of flo resistance risk this study is intended to i demonstrate the excellent performance in the decomposition dehalogenation and mineralization of flo and retaining carbon sources in the vuv uv sulfite system ii investigate the effects of different environmental conditions ph dissolved oxygen and coexisting substances on the decomposition efficiency of flo iii reveal the elimination mechanism of flo antibacterial activity and the retaining mechanism for carbon sources in vuv uv sulfite system and iv evaluate the effect of the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment on the source control of the formation and spread risk of the corresponding args in the subsequent biotreatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents in text s1 of the supporting information si were at least of analytical grade all solutions were prepared in milli q ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm millipore 2 2 photoreactor and operation procedure the decomposition of flo was carried out in a glass cylinder device with a capacity of 500 ml figure s1 in the experiment the temperature of the reaction solution was controlled at 25 1 by a thermostatic circulator and a 10 w low pressure mercury lamp with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 185 nm was used as the light source which was placed vertically in the center of the reactor a magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the reactor to improve the mass transfer efficiency between the reactants and the reactive species according to the method mentioned in literatures the photonic intensity was measured as 3 88 w cm2 for 254 nm uv and 1 56 w cm2 for 185 nm li et al 2012 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the initial concentration of the antibiotic solution was 50 mg l in this experiment phosphate buffer solution pb 10 mm was used to adjust the ph from 5 0 8 0 and borate buffer solution bb 10 mm was used to adjust the ph from 9 0 to 10 0 for the test of three different dissolved oxygen do conditions nitrogen was blown for 30 min to ensure no do in the solution do 0 1 mg l and an oxygen generator was used to deliver oxygen into the solution to ensure that the initial do was supersaturated do 40 mg l under the natural condition do 8 0 mg l the solution does not need aeration treatment all trials were conducted in duplicate to determine whether the pretreated antibiotics lost the potential to induce the proliferation of args in the subsequent biotreatment system a 200 ml serum bottle with 50 ml of anaerobic sludge and 100 ml of synthetic wastewater with different pretreatments was used as the anaerobic bioreactor mlss 10 g l and placed in a constant temperature shaker at 30 c and 120 rpm for cultivation biotreated sludge samples were collected after 6 weeks for sludge metagenomic sequencing the synthetic antibiotic containing wastewater consisted of glucose nh4cl kh2po4 nahco3 trace elements and flo 10 mg l four control groups were set up including the positive control group without pretreatment after adding flo hereafter referred to as without pretreatment the negative control group without flo added hereafter referred to as without flo and the vuv uv sulfite arp pretreatment group hereafter referred to as the vuv uv sulfite arp and vuv uv photolysis pretreatment group hereafter referred to as vuv uv photolysis the synthetic wastewater in the vuv uv sulfite arp and vuv uv photolysis pretreatment groups was illuminated for 14 min and the residual concentration of target antibiotic in vuv uv sulfite pretreatment group was lower than the threshold concentration of flo antibacterial activity three parallel experiments were set up for each control group 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1

degree of flo during the vuv uv sulfite arp was determined by a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the identification of intermediate products from flo decomposition was conducted by an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms system ab sciex tripletof 5600 the detailed method of uplc ms analysis is described in the si text s2 the anions f and cl produced from the photolytic process were determined by ion chromatography ic 883 ion chromatograph metrohm switzerland equipped with a hydrophilic anion exchange column 4 0 mm 250 mm the eluent was mixed with 1 8 mm na2co3 and 1 7 mm nahco3 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 2 3 2 antibacterial activity analysis the antibacterial activity of the target antibiotic or its corresponding pretreated solution was evaluated by comparing the inhibition effect to the sensitive standard strains staphylococcus aureus s aureus and escherichia coli e coli with that of a standard reference substance using the turbidimetric method the detailed procedure for the antibacterial activity assay is described in the si text s3 2 3 3 density functional theory dft calculation the theoretical calculations were performed via the gaussian 16 suite of programs the structure of the studied compound denoted by m was fully optimized at the b3lyp d3 def2 svp level of theory the bond energies of m were estimated at the b3lyp d3 def2 svp level of theory humphrey et al 1996 the visual molecular dynamics vmd program was used to plot the color filled iso surface graphs to visualize the molecular electrostatic potential mesp the fukui index of m was calculated by using the multiwfn software tian and chen 2012 2 3 4 metagenomic analysis after a 6 week biotreatment process a quantitative sludge water mixture was extracted from the anaerobic reactor and then centrifuged to obtain sludge samples for metagenomic analysis triplicate samples from each pretreatment were collected for metagenomics analysis and the extracted dna was analyzed through library construction metagenomics sequencing sequence quality control genome assembly and prediction the above detailed preparations followed our previous research ding et al 2021 arg annotations were applied using a blastp search version 2 2 28 against the antibiotic resistance genes database with an e value cutoff of 1 e 5 all the clean data were searched for integrons downloaded from the integrall database similarly a cutoff e value of 10 5 was used in the databases shi et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 decomposition and dehalogenation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system under the oxygen free condition 50 mg l flo in the vuv uv photolytic process was completely decomposed within 30 min of irradiation figure s2a and the defluorination efficiency was as high as 79 2 after 1 h of irradiation fig 2b in the vuv uv photolytic system the direct photolysis based on uv254 was the primary choice for flo decomposition because the vuv185 light emitted by the low pressure hg lamp is in the minority 10 0 zoschke et al 2014 the indirect photodecomposition of reactive species excited by vuv185 is limited eqs 1 2 a slight elevation in the decomposition rate constant 0 25 min 1 was achieved when persulfate pds was activated by irradiation table s1 and fig 1 a but the defluorination efficiency of vuv uv pds was less than 50 0 fig 1b when 1 mm na2so3 was added to the vuv uv photolytic system the irradiation time for complete decomposition of flo was shortened to 15 min and the decomposition rate constant kobs in the vuv uv sulfite process increased from 0 23 min 1 in the vuv uv process to 0 33 min 1 table s1 and fig 1a simultaneously the defluorination of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system was as high as 83 0 which was the highest among the above processes fig 1b the excellent degradation performance for flo in the vuv uv sulfite might be attributed to the enhanced formation of eaq or h by the addition of sulfite during the vuv uv photolytic process discussed in detail later eqs 3 4 in addition the mineralization efficiency of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system with 1 mm reductant was only 8 0 while the efficiency in the vuv uv pds system increased to 19 3 fig 1c and table s2 moreover the difference between these two systems increased to 34 6 when the additive concentration increased to 3 mm the above results indicated that vuv uv sulfite pretreatment process had a considerable potential retain the carbon sources of the target pollutant because of so4 and ho comes from pds stimulated by uv irradiation performed as the nonselective oxidants will consume the organic matters in water liu et al 2022 meng et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 100 mg l glucose was added to simulate the coexistence of easily degradable organic matter in flo containing wastewater to observe its interference with the decomposition of target antibiotics and preservation of the carbon sources for the subsequent biotreatment the results showed that the kobs of flo decomposition in vuv uv photolytic system with 1 mm pds was reduced significantly from 0 25 min 1 to 0 07 min 1 while the decomposition performance in the vuv uv sulfite system with the same concentration of reductant addition was not significantly decreased fig 1a and table s1 meanwhile the cod removal efficiency of the flo solution reached 1 1 and 8 6 in the vuv uv sulfite and vuv uv pds processes respectively upon further increasing the addition of oxidant or reductant the cod removal efficiency of the vuv uv pds system was increased significantly while that of the vuv uv sulfite system was still maintained at a very low level 2 0 fig 1d the above results indicated that vuv uv sulfite not only barely interfered with the coexisting organic matter in the pretreatment of flo containing wastewater but also retained most of the carbon sources in the system combined with the results of decomposition and dehalogenation the vuv uv sulfite system might be more suitable for the pretreatment of flo containing wastewater 1 h 2 o 185 nm e aq h o h 2 h 2 o 185 nm h o h 3 so 3 2 hv 254 nm so 3 e aq 4 hso 3 hv 254 nm so 3 h 3 2 effect of environmental factors on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 2 1 effect of ph on flo decomposition it is well known that the ionic distribution of sulfite depends on solution ph so3 2 is the dominant species under alkaline conditions and eaq plays an important role in this case when hso3 dominates the solution under alkaline conditions h becomes the main active species eqs 3 4 chen et al 2021 in addition solution ph also affects the stability of the presence of eaq and h previous studies have reported that acidic conditions are conducive to the accumulation of h while alkaline conditions are more advantageous to eaq existence under alkaline condition eqs 5 7 gu et al 2017 li et al 2012 seid et al 2020 therefore a series of experiments were conducted to explore the effect of ph on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system and the decomposition efficiency was above 97 0 within 15 min figure s3a with the increase in solution ph from 5 0 to 8 0 the decomposition rate showed a positive correlation with solution ph r 0 996 the optimal decomposition effect was obtained at ph 8 0 and the decomposition rate constant was 0 33 min 1 fig 2 a when the ph was increased to 10 0 successively the decomposition rate tended to decrease instead as the ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 kobs showed a significant downward trend which indicated that alkaline conditions had a more significant inhibitory effect on the flo decomposition process that is the decomposition performance in an acidic and slightly alkaline environment dominated by h ph 5 0 8 0 was better than that in an alkaline environment ph 8 0 10 0 where eaq played a relatively important role thus we presumed that h was more nonnegligible in the decomposition process of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system and quenching experiments for the identification of major species were conducted in the next section this speculation was different from previous studies which emphasized that eaq was the dominant species for contaminate decomposition cao et al 2021 cheng et al 2021 tan et al 2021 xie et al 2017 5 e aq h h 6 o h h e aq h 2 o 7 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 in addition ph had no significant impact on the decomposition of the target antibiotic in the vuv uv photolytic process figure s3b which indicated that ph was not involved in the direct photolysis process of flo the results further demonstrated that ph was affected through the species distribution of sulfite solution to change the types and transmission of active radicals which ultimately determined the reductive decomposition process of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 2 2 effect of do on flo decomposition the presence of do will reduce the rates and efficiencies of contaminant decomposition by depleting the reductive species in most arp systems gu et al 2017 the decomposition rate constant of flo was as high as 0 33 min 1 which was the most efficient under nitrogen supersaturation do 0 1 mg l fig 2b under the natural condition do 8 mg l kobs was 10 0 lower than that of the nitrogen supersaturation group under the condition of dissolved oxygen supersaturation do 40 mg l kobs was as low as 0 17 min 1 the inhibition of excessive do on the reaction was mainly caused by the ability to clear eaq or h eqs 8 9 in addition do can also adsorb some photons to inhibit the direct photolytic process while reducing the yields of eaq or h at the source hasson and nicholls 1971 to ascertain whether a portion of do was engaged in the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system the residual do concentration after the reaction was detected the concentration of do was consumed in the irradiated solution under the natural condition and the oxygen supersaturation condition specifically the concentration of do decreased from approximately 8 mg l to less than 1 mg l under the natural condition in the oxygen supersaturation system the concentration of do declined remarkably with a final concentration as low as 8 10 mg l simultaneously the toc value was also considered before and after the reaction which could reflect the mineralization rate of the system table s3 the mineralization performances of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system under nitrogen supersaturation and natural conditions were less than 10 0 under the oxygen saturation condition the mineralization rate was the highest approximately 33 9 this suggested that partial oxygen might be dedicated to photolysis or other reactions to generate reactive oxygen species ros to enhance the oxidative decomposition of flo cui et al 2020 combined with the changes in the decomposition performance of flo under different do conditions supersaturated oxygen may mainly play the role of scavenging reducing radicals in this system that is eaq or h might be captured in the system resulting in a decrease in the flo decomposition rate eqs 8 9 therefore this result implied that vuv uv sulfite pretreatment with do at the natural concentration for flo decomposition could still preserve the most carbon sources which was conducive to mitigating the problem of the insufficient carbon sources in the subsequent biological treatment process 8 e aq o 2 o 2 k 8 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 9 h o 2 ho 2 k 9 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 effect of water matrices on flo decomposition humic acid ha cl and hco3 are widespread in natural waters and may affect the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system to illustrate the possibility of vuv uv sulfite pretreatment in actual aquatic environments it is necessary to explore the potential effects of coexisting substances on the decomposition of target pollutants when the concentration of ha in solution was at a low level 5 mg l flo was still completely decomposed within 15 min despite the inhibition of decomposition figure s4a however the decomposition rate constant of flo was reduced to 0 13 min 1 when the ha concentration increased to 20 mg l table s4 this result might be mainly attributed to the presence of its ultraviolet absorption band which had a certain blocking effect on uv resulting in the limitation of direct photolysis of flo deng et al 2022 sun et al 2017 it would also compete for photons with so3 2 or hso3 which led to a reduction in the yield of active radicals such as eaq and h because they could remove part of eaq and h present in solution the decomposition inhibition of flo was possibly achieved duan and batchelor 2014 wu et al 2021 furthermore the carboxylic acid on the ha aromatic ring could preferentially react with the generated eaq or h to capture them fennell et al 2022 this result was consistent with the result of the decomposition of monochloroacetic acid on vuv uv sulfite studied by zhang j et al zhang et al 2021 volatile fatty acids vfas including sodium formate sodium acetate sodium propionate sodium butyrate and methanol were added as a common mixed carbon source coexisting with flo to explore the effect of complex coexisting organics on flo decomposition in the vuv uv sulfite system the ratio of the five carbon source components was 1 1 1 1 1 and the final cod concentration was approximately 100 mg l the degradation of flo in the coexisting system with mixed coexisting organics was not remarkably affected which was consistent with the coexistence of 100 mg l glucose figure s4b therefore we have concluded that the vuv uv sulfite system still exhibited great decomposition performance of the target antibiotic with the common coexisting organic matters hco3 exerted a slight attenuation effect on the decomposition of flo and the change in concentration had little effect on the decomposition of flo figure s4b the reaction kinetic of eaq with hco3 is less than 106 m 1 s 1 which consumes part of the eaq and exerts a weak inhibitory effect on flo decomposition buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2017 moreover the degradation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system was almost unaffected by cl with a decomposition efficiency of up to 98 2 at 15 min figure s4c although cl has a strong absorption of 185 nm photons extinction molar coefficient of approximately 3500 m 1cm 1 han et al 2020 and will lead to the formation of oxidative chlorine radicals buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2017 the effect of this radical on the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system needs to be further investigated high total suspended solids tss concentration blocked the light penetration through the water which will affect the activation of sulfite to produce reducing radicals liu et al 2021b to evaluate the effect of tss from the practical wastewater on the degradation of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system we collected actual samples from two wastewater treatment plants and prepared unfiltered and filtered samples of exogenously added flo 50 mg l some differences on flo decomposition were observed among the experiments with different tss concentrations and the degradation process of flo in filtered wastewater was significantly better than that in unfiltered water figure s5 which was consistent with the expected assumption in addition the turbidity of the filtered water remained at a high level 34 12 ntu table s5 which could interfere with the effective utilization of light and further affect the production of the dominant reactive species to inhibit the decomposition of flo in vuv uv sulfite system campisi et al 2005 however the degradation efficiency of the parent compound could still reach more than 99 within 30 min of light exposure hence the vuv uv sulfite system remains potential for the application of flo degradation in the actual wastewater pretreatment 3 3 the elimination mechanism of flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite system 3 3 1 the elimination of flo antibacterial activity although antibacterial activities of samples pretreated with vuv uv and vuv uv sulfite photolytic processes both have been effectively reduced the antibacterial activity of samples after vuv uv sulfite photolysis were generally lower than that of the vuv uv photolysis process in the same period when e coli and s aureus were served as the indicator strains for gram negative and positive bacteria fig 3 the results indicated that the efficiency and rate of vuv uv sulfite pretreatment in eliminating flo antibacterial activity was higher than that of the sole vuv uv photolytic process the capacity for eliminating the antibacterial activity against the two bacteria was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of flo degraded in the vuv uv sulfite system r 0 65 p 0 05 it has been confirmed that halogen substituents are important characteristic functional groups in the composition of flo antibacterial activity schwarz et al 2004 during the decomposition of flo in the vuv uv sulfite system the concentration of free f and cl can reflect the elimination of antibacterial activity of flo the correlation analysis between the antibacterial activity and the dehalogenation showed that the antibacterial activity of the samples reduced by vuv uv sulfite was negatively correlated with the corresponding defluorination and dechlorination efficiency p 0 05 this meant that the higher the concentration of f and cl generated in the solution the greater the antibacterial activity could be lowered in the process of flo decomposition thus we further deduced that the dehalogenation of flo was an important pathway to achieve a rapid elimination of its antibacterial activity furthermore there was a significant correlation coefficient between the antibacterial activity of the pretreated solution and its defluorination rate e coli r 0 933 p 0 05 s aureus r 0 961 p 0 05 which was generally higher than the correlation coefficient between the antibacterial activity of the pretreated solution and the dechlorination rate e coli r 0 851 p 0 05 s aureus r 0 916 p 0 05 therefore the result indicated that the contribution from the fluorine substituent to the antibacterial activity of flo was larger than that of the chlorine substituent 3 3 2 the dominant reactive species responsible for flo decomposition it is reported that some reactive species e g eaq h ho can be produced in the system by vuv uv photolysis with sulfite involvement but the dominant species are still uncertain liu et al 2021a zoschke et al 2014 herein different radical scavengers were selected for their corresponding reactive species to investigate their respective contributions to flo decomposition t butanol tba was chosen as the trapping agent for ho which exhibits a high reaction rate constant with ho k ho tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 wang and wang 2020 as shown in fig 4 a flo could still be completely decomposed after 15 min of reaction despite the addition of 10 mm tba indicating that the contribution of ho to flo decomposition was inconsequential in addition nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were served as quenching agents of reductive species eaq and h in flo decomposition buxton et al 1988 li et al 2012 the results suggested that the decomposition of flo was significantly inhibited with the addition of 10 mm no3 or no2 and its corresponding reaction rate constant decreased from 0 33 min 1 to 0 19 min 1 and 0 09 min 1 respectively table s6 thus vuv uv sulfite photolysis of flo process tended to rely on the action of reducing radicals eaq or h notably the degradation efficiencies of adding no2 or no3 for the 60 min photolytic reaction were 72 7 and 93 6 respectively suggesting that the inhibition of no2 was more remarkable than that of no3 at the same concentration according to previous reports the quenching constants of no2 and no3 for eaq are on the same order of magnitude eqs 10 11 while the h scavenging activity of no2 eq 12 is approximately 500 times higher than that of no3 eq 13 bolton 2000 li et al 2012 therefore the well founded speculation that the quenching of h by no2 was the main reason for the decrease in flo decomposition efficiency indicated that h was the dominant active species during the process of flo decomposition in the vuv uv sulfite system combined with the fact that acidic conditions were more conducive to the presence of h the result further validated that acidic conditions were more suitable for flo decomposition than alkaline conditions 10 no 2 e aq n o 2 2 k 10 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 11 no 3 e aq n o 3 2 k 11 9 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 12 no 2 h n o o h k 12 7 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 13 no 3 h n o 3 h k 13 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 in addition the quenching results of different radical scavengers on the vuv uv photolysis system had a similar trend to the vuv uv sulfite arp system fig 4b significantly with the addition of 10 mm no3 or no2 the flo decomposition rate constants decreased from 0 23 min 1 to 0 13 min 1 and 0 08 min 1 table s7 respectively which were slightly weaker than those in the vuv uv sulfite complex system first the results demonstrated that the indirect photolysis of flo in the vuv uv system relying on active species was a reduction oriented process which was inconsistent with the results of previous reports where both oxidation and reduction processes simultaneously acted on the decomposition of pollutants li et al 2017 pan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the reduction process was enhanced by the addition of sulfite into the vuv uv sulfite system 3 3 3 the possible elimination pathways of flo antibacterial activity based on dft the antibacterial activity of flo is contributed by the fluorine substituent sulfomethyl group and thero configuration jiang et al 2018 schwarz et al 2004 the charge distribution shown in the electrostatic potential diagram fig 5 b and the equipotential map of the fukui function f fig 5c and table s8 indicated that 16cl and 17cl possessed a high potential for nucleophilic attack while the reaction activity of 13f was weak the sulfomethyl group might also undergo nucleophilic reactions which was further determined by cdd table s8 combined with the calculation results of bond energy and bond length table s9 15c 17cl 344 66 kcal mol 1 792 å 15c 16cl 334 51 kcal mol 1 798 å 5c 7s 334 75 kcal mol 1 797 å 7s 16cl and 17cl were the active sites to further reveal the elimination pathways of flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite reductive process the major intermediates were identified and the structural variations of the above representative groups were speculated some intermediates of different reaction durations were exhibited at detectable levels figure s6 primary mass spectra of the products in vuv uv sulfite reduction were analyzed and their potential structures were derived figure s7 based on the identified products and previously reported decomposition pathways the main decomposition pathways of flo in this reaction were inferred as follows fig 5d ding et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 at first the photoinduced removal of the sulfomethyl group from the benzene ring was the main way to eliminate the antibacterial activity of flo p2 m z 278 0156 and then the product underwent defluorination p3 m z 258 0094 although the 13 f reaction activity of flo was weak based on dft calculations the relativly high defluorination efficiency approximately 83 0 in the vuv uv sulfite system indicated that the pathway of defluorination could not be ignored and even acted as an important pathway for the elimination of flo antibacterial activity in the cooperation of reductive species another route was the direct loss of chlorine followed by chlorohydroxylation to remove another chlorine resulting in the formation of products p4 m z 322 0324 p5 m z 302 0504 the third route mainly relied on hydrolysis to achieve dehalogenation p6 m z 288 0347 p7 m z 199 0088 after these proposed pathways flo was broken down into lower molecular weight substances and some inorganic ions e g f cl therefore the removal of the sulfomethyl group and halogenated substituents were the major elimination pathways for flo antibacterial activity in the vuv uv sulfite arp process 3 4 effective prevention of args formation and spread with vuv uv sulfite pretreatment during the subsequent anaerobic biological system to confirm the effectiveness of vuv uv sulfite arp pretreatment on the source prevention of antibiotic resistance risk in the subsequent biotreatment system the abundances of typical and relevant args in anaerobic reactors were quantified after 6 weeks of biotreatment operation as an important representative of encoding efflux pumping mechanisms flor is sensitive to the fluctuation of environmental selective pressure generated by flo braibant et al 2005 liang et al 2019 after the vuv uv sulfite pretreatment with 14 min irradiation the abundance of flor in the subsequent biotreatment process was as low as 2 44 10 3 copies cell fig 6 a it was at the same abundance level as the negative control without flo and significantly lower than that of the positive control without pretreatment p 0 05 which was approximately 30 0 of the same light dose vuv uv photolytic treatment group moreover the abundance of chloramphenicol resistance genes crgs after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment was 7 02 10 3 copies cell nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that in the untreated positive control simultaneously the abundance of crgs after vuv uv photolytic pretreatment was twice that in the vuv uv sulfite arp the above results indicated that the vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction pretreatment could efficiently achieve the source repression of the proliferation of relevant args in the subsequent biotreatment process furthermore the abundance of total resistance genes in the vuv uv sulfite arp group was significantly lower than that in the positive control without pretreatment and vuv uv photolysis with the same dose of vuv uv irradiation p 0 05 in the untreated positive control group except for crgs sulfonamides macrolides aminoglycosides and multidrug resistance genes were the 4 most abundant types of args with vuv uv sulfite pretreatment for flo containing wastewater the abundances of above 4 major args were reduced to about 80 6 60 5 44 4 and 80 8 without pretreatment group respectively which was lower than that in the vuv uv photolytic pretreatment the results further confirmed that vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction pretreatment effectively prevented the diffusion of args at the source and exhibited a better performance than vuv uv photolytic pretreatment it is nonnegligible that the primary mechanism of acquired resistance is horizontal gene transfer hgt of args from their environment or other bacteria via mobile genetic elements mges xu et al 2011 as an important indicator of the horizontal transfer potential of args the abundance of integrons in biotreatment systems and their prevention techniques has become a research hotspot guo et al 2017 moreira et al 2021 integron is a genetic platform that allows bacteria to rapidly evolve by acquiring storing excising and reordering open reading frames in mges escudero et al 2015 consequently the relative abundance of integrons in the subsequent biotreatment was investigated the results showed that the relative abundance of integrons after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment was 370 3 ppm which was obviously lower than that in the flo containing water without pretreatment p 0 05 fig 6c moreover it was 11 2 less than that of the vuv uv photolytic pretreatment group therefore the vuv uv sulfite reduction pretreatment had a better preventing performance for the horizontal transfer potential of args in the subsequent anaerobic biological system 4 conclusions in this study the eliminating mechanism of flo resistance risk in the vuv uv sulfite advanced reduction system before biological tretreatment was revealed the conclusions are as followed 1 compared with the vuv uv photolytic and vuv uv pds oxidation processes vuv uv sulfite system had the highest decomposition rate constant kobs 0 33 min 1 and the best defluorination efficiency approximately 83 0 of flo which eliminated antibacterial activity efficiently in addition vuv uv sulfite had the lowest mineralization performance of flo 8 0 and the cod removal efficiency of the whole system 1 1 which determined that it had the ability not to be disturbed by coexisting organic matters and to retain carbon sources 2 acidic and weak alkaline conditions were more favorable for the decomposition of the target antibiotics and do under natural conditions did not have an impact on flo decomposition 3 the radical quenching experiments revealed that the main reactive radical was h which could explain the effect of ph on target antibiotics and further established that the process mainly relied on the reduction process 4 three potential eliminating pathways for flo antibacterial activity in vuv uv sulfite system were proposed including dechlorination defluorination and the removal of sulfomethyl group 5 the abundances of flor and crgs and in the subsequent biotreatment fed with vuv uv sulfite pretreated flo containing wastewater were at the same abundance level as the negative control in addition the relative abundance of integrons after vuv uv sulfite pretreatment were 22 9 lower than that in the flo containing wastewater without pretreatment which would source reduce the potential of horizontal transfer risk of corresponding args declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14879,an fe based catalyst was prepared by oxidising waste fe shavings directly in a solution in engineering applications fe shavings were compressed and modified to form fe based monolithic catalyst

porosity small pore diameter and the effective specific surface area ssa up to 3500 m2 m3 these characteristics are conducive to mass transfer and promote the effective utilisation of oh in the catalyst action zone a tower reactor 3000 m3 d and reinforced concrete construction reactor 5000 m3 d were designed according to the wastewater flow regression analysis showed that hydraulic residence time hrt and o3 codin are important parameters in engineering design and operation in addition strategies for the application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing to wastewater with high salinity and high inorganic carbon concentration have been proposed fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation is a relatively cost effective and eco friendly process with extremely broad application prospects in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater graphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords fe based monolithic catalyst packing reactor design catalytic ozonation practical engineering operation industrial wastewater advanced treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a considerable amount of attention in the development and application of wastewater treatment technologies the efficacy of aops is determined by the generation of highly reactive oxidative agents amongst mainly including hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so4 yang et al 2017 in this study oh based aops are investigated oh is highly reactive and non selective and oxidizes organics mainly by extracting h from c h n h or o h bonds or adding to c c bonds or aromatic rings to form organic radicals r eq 1 brillas et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang and xu 2012 the intermediate r participates in the chain reaction eqs 2 4 forming more oh or reacts with o2 to form organic peroxide radicals roo or oxyl radicals ro eq 5 that can ultimately be degraded into co2 h2o and organic acids wang and xu 2012 and consequently the removal of pollutants was realised with regard to the strong oxidising properties and organic pollutants removal ability of oh the oh based aops especially the fenton process and catalytic ozonation have been widely investigated miklos et al 2018 they were successfully used 1 to remove toxic pollutants that are difficult to chemically oxidise 2 as a pretreatment method to convert specific known recalcitrant pollutants into biodegradable compounds such as acrylonitrile and 3 in advanced treatment of wastewater when biological treatment technologies are insufficient li et al 2018 timmers et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 the fenton process utilises the ferrous ion fe2 as an activator to decompose h2o2 under acidic conditions eq 6 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the main advantages of the fenton process include its rapid reaction rate low operating cost and low toxicity of the reagents used however there are some obvious drawbacks such as the formation of a large amounts of fe hydroxide sludge zhou et al 2020 1 r h o h r h 2 o 2 r h 2 o r o h h 3 h o 2 h o 2 4 h o 2 h o 2 5 r o 2 roo ro 6 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h catalytic ozonation technology has the advantages of low cost no additional chemical reagents low sludge yield eco friendliness and a great potential for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater owing to the selective oxidation of o3 the oxidation rate of some organic pollutants is relatively slow leading to the incomplete removal of pollutants the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of wastewater is only 10 20 by sole ozonation in advanced treatment tian et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 effective catalysts or activators have been introduced to promote o3 efficient decomposition to generate more oh various transition metal oxides such as mno2 tio2 nio co3o4 moo3 and fe2o3 have been reported as suitable catalysts for catalytic ozonation chen and wang 2019 chen et al 2011 manivel et al 2015 shen et al 2020 tan et al 2017 wu et al 2018 besides fe hydroxides such as α β and γ feooh also have high catalytic activity that can promote the decomposition of o3 to generate more oh and thus enhance the removal of organic pollutants nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 wang and bai 2017 zhang and ma 2008 catalytic oxidation processes are chain reaction sequences and in general involve radical propagation and diffusion once the radical is formed short lived oh is produced only on and near the surface of the catalyst oxidizing organic matter in a minuscule space we defined this space as the catalyst action zone kopinke 2020 zhang et al 2017 therefore to develop catalysts for ozonation an effective ssa needs to be optimised and regulated usually the catalyst is in a bulk state such as particles powder or granular and is prepared by dipping the carrier in a salt solution and then drying or sintering chen and wang 2019 guo et al 2021 shen et al 2020 although powder catalysts can effectively utilise the oh generated on the surface of catalysts to a certain extent the problems of difficult separation and recovery limit their application in industrial wastewater treatment common granular catalysts are relatively easy to recycle however the constant friction and erosion of the catalyst in solution leads to a large consumption of effective catalytic components considering the catalytic efficiency practical engineering applications and the cost of catalysts our research group has carried out extensive work on the development of fe based monolithic catalyst packing fei et al 2021 li et al 2019 2018 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020 2022 in this study fe based monolithic catalyst packing with simple preparation method and low cost was developed to achieve a high efficiency treatment of industrial wastewater the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the catalytic performance of fe based catalyst and fe based monolithic catalyst packing 2 analyse the advantages of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing and structural characteristics in catalytic ozonation 3 design and optimise two types of pilot scale reactors according to wastewater flow and kinetic analysis 4 assess the effects of operating parameters on cod removal efficiency and 5 estimate the cost of investment and operation of the pilot plant this novel catalyst packing provides information for the application of other catalysts and has contributed to the development of related technical engineering applications 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade chemical agents were purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd shanghai china and the solutions were prepared from ultrapure water obtained from a milli q biocel water system 2 2 preparation of catalysts fe shavings were selected as raw materials that were formed by section steel under the action of the blade shearing force to produce flake like solids thickness of approximately 40 μm and presented a layered and distorted character structure a strong oxidant acid base and h2o2 modified method was used for fe shavings in this study as described by li et al 2018 2019 and wang et al 2020 typical preparation procedures for fe based monolithic catalyst packing were as follows first spiral fe shavings with a thickness of approximately 40 μm were selected to remove materials that were too large or small to ensure uniformity and mechanically compressed subsequently the compressed fe shavings were modified in situ using a strong oxidant according to the above mentioned method to form fe based monolithic catalyst packing 2 3 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand measurements were performed using the potassium dichromate method hj828 2017 china total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a toc instrument toc l shimadzu corporation kyoto japan electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using an electrochemical workstation chi760d shanghai chenhua instrument co ltd china aniline content was determined using a spectrophotometric method with n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine the crystal structure of the fe based catalyst was characterised by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv japan the surface microstructure of the fe based catalyst was observed using scanning electron microscopy zeiss gemini 300 germany the ssa was determined using the gas adsorption bet method and the methylene blue solution adsorption method 2 4 experimental procedure 2 4 1 laboratory scale experimental procedure the laboratory scale experimental apparatus employed for the catalytic ozonation is shown in fig 1 2 4 2 pilot scale reactor design and experimental procedure considering the cost and flexibility two types of reactors were designed for practical engineering based on wastewater flow and effluent quality requirements a tower reactor wastewater quantity 3000 m3 d and a reinforced concrete construction reactor wastewater quantity 5000 m3 d are usually used 2 4 2 1 tower reactor a tower reactor with a large height to diameter ratio and reverse flow of gas and liquid has obvious advantages in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater less than 3000 m3 d such advantages include the efficient removal of organic pollutants facilitating water distribution and low cost the tower reactor wastewater treatment system and its components are shown in fig 2 a tower reactor adapted to different wastewater amounts was designed and the representative reactors were as follows tower 1 stainless steel used as raw material height 8 10 m the height of catalyst packing is approximately 7 m with a volume of 3000 l this reactor required additional o3 generators and pumps tower 2 stainless steel or stalinite as raw material height 3 4 m with a volume of 300 l it was appropriate for a small flow of wastewater can manually transport water and there is no need to purchase additional large o3 generators 2 4 2 2 reinforced concrete construction reactor reinforced concrete construction reactor characterised by low cost and a large volume are usually used in large wastewater treatment plants 5000 m3 d fig 3 the reaction tank was rectangular with an effective water depth of 6 m it was divided into many cells to ensure the vertical flow of gas and liquid that were the smallest units for construction installation and calibration depending on the type of reactor a 1 5 m 1 m 1 2 m unit fe based monolithic catalyst packing was developed each cell was equipped with two layers of packing units approximately 1 3 of the total volume the o3 gas distribution diffuser is a microporous air distribution device with material resistant to o3 corrosion the upward moving o3 bubbles were in counter current contact with wastewater to enhance the mass transfer process and dissolved o3 flowed downward with the wastewater in the catalytic region oh was effectively generated to remove organic contaminants to improve the removal efficiency both the distance from the catalyst packing to the o3 gas distribution device and the distance from the o3 gas distribution device to the water collecting pipe can be optimised according to the dissolution and diffusion rates of o3 simultaneously the service life of the gas distribution device the convenience of disassembling and replacing the catalyst packing unit and the anti clogging performance of the back wash were considered comprehensively 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of catalyst 3 1 1 characterisations of fe based catalyst catalytic capacity as shown in fig 4 xrd and sem were used to examine the surface crystalline phases and morphology of the in situ modified fe based catalyst the surface was composed of γ feooh and fe3o4 rather than fe2o3 with relatively modest catalytic performance on the fe catalyst surface prepared by the conventional impregnation roasting method ruiz et al 2021 yan et al 2019 protection performance after modification the leaching concentration of fe ions was less than 10 mg l besides electrochemical surface impedance can be used to represent the surface state and corrosion resistance of the oxide films luo et al 2011 after modification the half arc diameter of the fe based catalyst increased considerably indicating that the thickness of the oxide film on the surface of the fe shavings increased with better compactness and corrosion resistance fig 4e fe oxy hydroxide on the surface of fe shavings acted as both an effective catalytic component and a passivation layer that could delay the dissolution of the inner fe self regeneration the oxidation of the inner fe has the potential to produce the same substances as the modification process which is referred to as self regeneration at present almost all transition metal compound catalysts on the market have been prepared using the impregnation method the catalytic layer on the surface of the supporting material was very thin and the friction in the catalytic reaction could easily cause the loss of effective catalytic components for the fe based catalyst minor surface damage caused by transportation and installation can be recovered through a quick self regeneration process in the catalytic reaction after long term use the surface composition of the fe based catalyst was still dominated by γ feooh and could achieve stable and efficient toc and cod removal li et al 2018 above all the fe based catalyst could guarantee the stability of catalytic performance through its catalytic capacity protection performance and self regeneration in addition the leaching of fe ions less than 10 mg l and detached surface components were also non toxic therefore the application of fe based catalyst is not limited by the high cost of collection recycling and regeneration and avoids the risk of secondary pollution 3 1 2 fe based monolithic catalyst packing with micro channel structure 3 1 2 1 action zone of fe based monolithic catalyst packing the fe based catalyst promotes the decomposition of o3 leading to the generation of oh and superoxide radicals o2 on the catalyst surface li et al 2019 2018 zhang and ma 2008 eqs 7 8 the o2 was transformed into another oh through chain reactions eqs 9 11 zhang and ma 2008 the oh generated on the catalyst surface accumulated within the surface region of the catalyst zhang et al 2017 generally the diffusion behaviour of oh in water is mainly affected by the thermal motion of the molecule and can be explained with the einstein smoluchowski equation kopinke 2020 schwarzenbach et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 and kopinke 2020 calculated the diffusion distances of oh in fenton like chemistry systems and oxidative treatment systems which were 173 nm and 60 nm respectively this indicates that the oh generated on the catalyst surface reacted with dissolved organic pollutants in a minuscule range however in a catalytic ozonation system with an fe based catalyst the o2 generated on the catalyst surface could induce the expansion of the action zone the lifetime of o2 is several orders of magnitude longer than that of oh and has similar diffusion coefficients kopinke 2020 li et al 2009a wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 it diffused outwards because of molecular thermal motion and simultaneously reacted with o3 to form oh the oh continued to diffuse outwards and reacted with the organic pollutants thus the oh formed by the transformation of o2 played a major contribution to the range of action zone rather than oh generated on the catalyst surface fig 5 7 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 8 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 9 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 10 o 3 h h o 3 11 h o 3 o h o 2 the molecular movement of organic pollutants caused the expansion of the action zone too ma et al 2022 molecular motion depends on temperature molecular mass and the electrostatic attraction strength of the catalyst to organic pollutants ph zeta potential of the catalyst and pollutant type the molecular mass of organic pollutants is much larger than those of oh and o2 and they have a low average velocity moreover the electrostatic attraction range of a catalyst to organic pollutants is in the order of several nanometers spitzer 1984 zhang et al 2020 in short the action zone of the catalyst is minuscule in a stationary liquid ma et al 2022 reported that the action zone of fe based monolithic catalyst packing was approximately 30 μm that was formed through the mass transfer generated by the movement of microscopic molecules 3 1 2 2 micro channel structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in practical applications to protect the characteristics of large ssas and reduce the loss of active components fe shavings were mechanically compressed and modified to form fe based monolithic catalyst packing with uniform internal density in the mechanical compression preparation process there was an extreme point between the bulk density and effective ssa beyond which the effective ssa decreased rapidly fig 5d the effective ssa of fe based monolithic catalyst packing was the surface area that constituted the micro channel structure and could reach 3500 m2 m3 which was several times greater than that of ordinary packing lee et al 2021 li et al 2009b furthermore porosity and average pore diameter of fe based monolithic catalyst packing approximately 95 and 1 0 mm respectively all the characteristics accommodated sufficient volume of the action zone accounts for a relatively large proportion of the catalyst volume which are conducive to the reaction of organic pollutants with oh in action zone we defined the effective catalytic structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing as micro channel as shown in fig 5e in the region of fe based monolithic catalyst packing due to the macroscopic mass transfer formed by wastewater flow all components in the wastewater can reach the action zone of the catalyst ma et al 2022 in a continuous flow reactor the mass transfer of organic pollutants and oh in action zone of the catalyst were key factors influencing the removal of organic pollutants the mass transfer of organic pollutants in laminar flow zones is usually achieved by molecular diffusion however this is slow dong et al 2022 according to the einstein smoluchowski equation and fick s second law owing to the short lateral diffusion length of micro channels the mass transfer process can be fast and organic pollutants can be mixed evenly dong et al 2022 ober et al 2015 tanimu et al 2017 for example the diffusion coefficient d of benzoic acid in water at 298 k is 1 2 10 9 m2 s and the diffusion time of benzoic acid from the centre of the micro channel to the channel wall was approximately 104 s t d 2 2 2d the unique irregular micro channel structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing can take advantage of the hydrodynamic focusing chaotic advection flow separation or split and recombine flows to promote the uniform distribution of organic pollutant concentrations in time and space hardt et al 2005 ma et al 2022 the vortexes and disordered flows generated by the fluid flow can achieve fast mass transfer efficiency which could improve the utilisation efficiency of oh in the catalyst action zone ma et al 2022 stroock et al 2002 in a reinforced concrete construction reactor the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was equipped with an oxidation resistant stainless steel outer frame fig 5b s1 which protected the effective catalytic component of the catalyst the upper and lower sides of the packing were provided with a sieve plate to prevent blocking of the micro channel by suspended substances in the wastewater a hollow layer was placed on the upper side of the frame and the structure resolves the positioning problems of forklift transportation and hoisting tasks in addition it can also achieve secondary water distribution and avoid blocking and short circuiting caused by packing module stacking in addition positioning blocks are placed on the outer frame to aid in accurate installation and convenient maintenance the combination of unitary packing and the outer frame was chemically modified fe based monolithic catalyst packing is novel with packing properties chemical catalytic functions and engineering practical application characteristics 3 2 catalytic effect of fe based catalyst in laboratory scale to evaluate the catalytic potential of the fe based catalyst catalytic ozonation experiments on industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment were carried out at a laboratory scale chemical oxygen demand and toc removal rates were used as indicators of the catalytic effect of the fe based catalyst for light industrial wastewater mainly containing natural organic matter such as alcohol vegetable processing liquor brewing and paper making wastewater the cod of the biochemical effluent varies greatly for example the cod of vegetable processing wastewater was only 70 2 mg l and that of paper making wastewater was as high as 355 mg l the fe based catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity in their advanced treatment after 120 mins the cod removal rates were all above 70 fig 6 a and the toc removal efficiencies of liquor brewing and paper making wastewater were 79 8 and 72 6 respectively fig s2 for general industrial wastewater such as coking dyeing electronic and tannery wastewater the fe based catalyst also presented a positive catalytic effect on their advanced treatment although the cod concentration varied greatly 66 8 345 mg l a cod removal rate of 58 70 can be achieved fig 6b after the catalytic ozonation of leachate aniline and printing wastewater toc removal of 33 47 was also achieved fig s2 the results demonstrated that the fe based catalyst exhibited a significant catalytic effect in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater the biotreatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical and pesticide industries proved to be difficult due to high concentrations complex compositions and toxic characteristics of the contaminants present in this experiment the cod of pharmaceutical and pesticide wastewater after biochemical treatment was approximately 100 mg l as shown in fig 6c the cod removal rate was 45 50 and the toc removal rate of pharmaceutical wastewater after 120 min was 53 1 generally after biochemical treatment wastewater does not contain residual organic matter which is easily oxidised to produce intermediate products with biological toxicity our research group studied the effect of catalytic ozonation via fe based catalyst on the conversion of hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic fractions of bio treated paper making and bio treated dyeing wastewater in comparison with sole ozonation the remaining organic contaminants in the effluent from fe based catalytic ozonation were mainly hydrophilic small molecules substances which were easier to be degraded if biochemical process was followed fei et al 2021 as a result the catalytic ozonation technology applied to the bio treated effluent of industrial wastewater could reduce the cod of wastewater and simultaneously improved the biodegradability therefore fe based catalyst is suitable for the practical engineering applications in wastewater advanced treatment acrylonitrile wastewater is a toxic and refractory industrial wastewater containing complex pollutants including nitrile cyanide pyridine lipids organic acids a large number of oligomers and copolymers etc dai et al 2015 after the biological treatment the degradation of the pollutants was incomplete as shown in fig 6d the possible achievable cod removal rates of acrylonitrile wastewater without biochemical treatment and after biochemical treatment were 81 5 and 77 2 respectively in addition to the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater fe based catalyst can also be applied to remove the characteristic pollutants from some industrial wastewater as shown in fig 6d the fe based catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for aniline removal 3 3 pilot scale reactor kinetic analysis the effect of catalytic ozonation was dependant on the concentration of aqueous o3 and its effective decomposition decomposition to form oh the key process influencing the aqueous o3 concentration included 1 o3 dissolves in the liquid phase 2 o3 decomposes in the gas phase 3 ineffective decomposition in the liquid phase and 4 efficient decomposition in the action zone o3 is a polar molecule and its solubility in water is approximately 10 times that of non polar molecular o2 because of the high solubility of o3 and decay rate in air is much lower than that in the liquid phase the concentration of o3 in wastewater was usually not the main factor affecting oxidation efficiency in practice the amount of o3 overflowing from wastewater in actual engineering was less than 1 in tower reactors therefore the dissolution and decomposition of o3 are not the limiting processes in catalytic ozonation more than 99 of o3 was decomposed in wastewater but not necessarily efficiently to form oh many metals such as cu and zn can cause o3 ineffective decomposition without producing oh our research group showed that when the temperature increased from 30 c to 80 c the o3 decomposition rate in low concentration o3 aqueous solution increased by 13 times without an increase in the oh yield therefore the core issue is the effective decomposition of o3 in water there are two key factors that influence effective o3 decomposition in practice and these were presented below 3 3 1 gas distribution device the transfer of gas into liquid is dependents on the properties of the gas and liquid such as temperature partial pressure of the gas liquid and gas flow rates and size and number of bubbles present etc john et al 2020 shin et al 1999 xu and liu 1990 the diameter of o3 bubbles was a crucial and adjustable factor influencing the transfer rate of o3 gas microbubbles have many favourable characteristics such as high interfacial area high gas holdup slow rising velocity etc that can considerably improve the gas liquid mass transfer efficiency and increase the o3 utilisation efficiency in the catalyst packing area john et al 2020 li et al 2020 eqs 12 is given by park et al 2017 parkinson et al 2008 in practice gas diffusion devices such as titanium plates sieve plates etc play a key role in producing small bubbles ensuring adequate residence time of o3 in the catalyst packing area and effectively decomposing to generate oh 12 u h r 3 2 u s ρ l ρ g g d 2 12 μ l where u h r is the hadamard rybczynski terminal rising velocity m s u is the stokes terminal rising velocity m s ρl is the liquid density kg m3 ρg is gas density kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 d is the bubble diameter m and μl is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid pa s however the bubble size was too small when the reactor was in counter current gas liquid flow which would make the rising velocity of the bubbles less than the flow velocity of reverse flow wastewater which is not conducive to the removal of organic pollutants in this case the treatment effect could be improved by using a co current gas liquid flow meanwhile the ineffective decomposition of o3 was mainly thermal decomposition therefore the retention time of o3 gas in the pipeline from the generator to the liquid phase should be short the bubble size was not entirely dependant on the initial state because it could change in the packing area because the average pore size of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was only 1 0 mm the changeable pore channels could not only cut the o3 bubble but also cause the small bubbles to collide and coalesce resulting in turbulence which increased the dissolution mass transfer and utilisation of o3 3 3 2 gas liquid flow direction the effective decomposition and utilisation of o3 were also associated with the gas liquid flow direction in which the counter current gas liquid flow has certain advantages over the sequential batch and co current gas liquid flow the counter current gas liquid flow can prolong the bubbles residence time strengthen the turbulent mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases and have a significant impact on the removal efficiency of organic contaminants ma et al 2022 to ensure long term stable operation of the catalytic system ma et al 2022 estimated the water flow resistance and flooding point of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in a tower reactor according to eq 13 the calculation results showed that the head loss of the reactor was 0 157 m which was smaller than that of the general filtration process ma et al 2022 the occurrence of flooding is related to gas viscosity liquid viscosity packing structure porosity and other factors zapke and kröger 2000 ma et al 2022 estimated the liquid flow velocity under the flooding phenomenon and the actual liquid flow velocity was only 22 7 of the velocity at the flooding point therefore the problem of flooding phenomenon will not occur in the practical application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing ma et al 2022 13 h f λ l d v 2 2 g where hf is the frictional head loss m l is the flow path distance packing height in the tower reactor m d is the inner diameter of the reactor m v is the velocity m s λ is the resistance coefficient 3 4 pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing 3 4 1 practical application in industrial wastewater treatment in sequential batch experiments at the laboratory scale the fe based catalyst catalytic ozonation of dyeing electronic paper making and liquor brewing wastewater showed good cod and toc removal effects the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was further applied to the practical engineering treatment of wastewaters on a pilot scale the continuous flow experimental results in fig 7 show that different components of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater led to different cod removal characteristics the cod removal rate of dyeing wastewater was approximately 43 liquor brewing and electronic industry wastewater was approximately 60 and the cod removal rate of paper making wastewater exceeded 70 the fe based monolithic catalyst packing exhibited a good catalytic effect in the advanced treatment of wastewater from the dyeing electronics paper making and liquor brewing industries 3 4 2 critical parameters in catalytic ozonation system 3 4 2 1 influent quality and hrt in the catalytic ozonation reaction the outflow cod or cod removal rate was the dependant variable and the initial cod concentration o3 dose and hrt were the main independent variables owing to the limitations of experimental conditions such as fluctuation of the initial cod concentration of wastewater hrt can only be set to a fixed value in each experiment o3 codin can only be maintained within a certain range in the pilot scale test and it is difficult to design an orthogonal experiment we investigated the influence of existing factors on the cod removal of wastewater from different industries to improve cod removal and guide the engineering application of the catalytic ozonation technology for the applications of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in dyeing electronic paper making and liquor brewing wastewater the correlations between the initial cod codin and cod removal are depicted in fig 8 a d we observed that codin had a significant effect on cod removal amount but had a weak to no effect on the cod removal rate except for paper making wastewater with relatively stable codin and the value was comprised between 210 and 235 mg l the codin of dyeing electronic and liquor brewing wastewater has a significant effect on outflow cod codout fig s3a d these results indicated that in the catalytic ozonation process the outlet values and cod removal amount of wastewater were related to the inlet loads but the cod removal rate was substantially independent of the inlet loads in the catalytic ozonation reactor hrt was considered as the effective retention time that is the retention time of wastewater in the catalyst packing hrt v q v effective reaction volume of catalyst packing the relationship between the hrt and cod removal amount rate is shown in fig 8e h effective removal of cod was realised in a short reaction time for dyeing electronic and liquor brewing wastewater the removal efficiency could not be improved by prolonging the hrt in contrast for paper making wastewater with high codin and natural organic contaminants the extension of the hrt could achieve a better effect fig s3e h 3 4 2 2 o3 codin and o3 δcod in addition to hrt the o3 dose equivalent o3 codin or o3 equivalent o3 δcod are also important parameters in engineering design and operation overall simple linear regression and third order polynomial regression analyses showed that o3 codin and o3 δcod had significant influences on codout and cod removal amount rate figs 9 and s4 at lower o3 codin and o3 δcod values codout could be considerably reduced by increasing the o3 dose however when the o3 dose exceeded a certain range the utilisation rate of o3 decreased indicating that the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater was close to the limit and that the economic benefits of the process were low based on the oxidation reaction shown in eq 5 dominated by oh it can be seen that o2 participated in the reaction process and could be completely derived from the decomposition of o3 through radical chain reactions o3 was converted to oh that were generated on the surface of the catalyst or by o3 transformation and induced the formation of o2 to oxidise organic contaminants eqs 7 11 therefore the theoretical equivalent of o3 δcod 1 125 for the oxidation of organic pollutants by o3 was derived generally in actual wastewater treatment when the o3 dose was increased to o3 δcod 2 the utilisation rate of o3 decreased rapidly as shown in figs 9e h and s4e h therefore o3 δcod was usually 1 2 1 8 in the advanced treatment of actual industrial wastewater with the fe based monolithic catalyst packing and the dose of o3 added in the pilot test could be obtained by estimating cod removal rate according to wastewater type and measuring codin concentration 3 4 3 wastewater with high salinity or high inorganic carbon concentration in fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation of high salinity pharmaceutical wastewater 10 000 mg l cl the catalyst can be corroded by cl caco3 was formed on the surface of the fe shavings during the oxidation process leading to a decrease in the catalyst life in response to this problem low cost carbon steel was used as the catalyst raw material lifespan of up to 3 years and the surface of the catalyst packing was treated with effective anti corrosion in the pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing which increased the cost effectiveness a high concentration of inorganic carbon mainly co3 2 hco3 in bio treated paper making wastewater was discovered in the pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing the large co3 2 hco3 cod ratio of the wastewater did not achieve ideal catalytic efficiency co3 2 is a well known species that scavenges the radicals involved in o3 decomposition resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity and oh concentration that leads to a loss of efficiency the practical solving strategies included 1 removing co3 2 by the chemical precipitation method 2 reducing the ph to increase the relative content of hco3 li et al 2018 because hco3 was less reactive than co3 2 reacting with oh eqs 14 15 tian et al 2021a 14 o h h c o 3 o h h c o 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 15 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 k 4 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 4 4 cost analyses and estimation the fenton process and catalytic ozonation have been developed and extensively applied for advanced treatment of industrial wastewater data obtained from the survey for catalytic ozonation via fe based monolithic catalyst packing and the fenton method were collected to estimate and compare the cost of investment and operation of the pilot plant as shown in table 1 compared to the fenton method catalytic ozonation with fe based monolithic catalyst packing has a relatively high investment cost owing to the o3 generator and catalyst however it has the advantages of a relatively small occupation low operational costs low chemical input and no secondary pollution considering the depreciation of the o3 generator and the catalyst the general life of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing is five years and the o3 generator is eight years the investment cost was approximately 0 00102 cny l fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation was a relatively low cost process with an operational cost only electricity of just 0 00122 cny l o3 δcod 1 2 considering the high cod removal efficiency catalytic ozonation with fe based monolithic catalyst packing is an economical choice for advanced treatment of industrial wastewater 4 conclusions fe based monolithic catalyst packing exhibited excellent catalytic effects in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater and was cost effective and eco friendly the main conclusions are as follows 1 the preparation method of fe based catalyst from waste fe shavings has the advantage of being fast cheap and without a catalyst carrier surface γ feooh was formed by direct oxidation in a liquid and functioned as both a catalytic component and a corrosion resistance layer laboratory scale tests showed that the fe based catalyst exhibited good catalytic efficiency in the catalytic ozonation of industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment for most industrial wastewater the cod removal rates were all above 58 it can also achieve a 45 50 cod removal rate for the refractory pharmaceutical and pesticide wastewater 2 the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was prepared with fe shavings via mechanical compression and modification to fit the practical engineering the effective ssa reached 3500 m2 m3 the unique irregular micro channel structure effectively strengthened the mass transfer process this was conducive to the reaction of oh with organic pollutants in the catalyst action zone approximately 30 μm and improved the utilisation efficiency of oh the catalyst packing was equipped with an oxidation resistant stainless steel outer frame which protected the effective catalytic component of the catalyst in engineering applications the hollow outer frame plays a role in secondary water distribution 3 in practical engineering according to the quantity of wastewater flow a tower reactor 3000 m3 d and reinforced concrete construction reactor 5000 m3 d were applied the catalytic ozonation process was a counter current gas liquid flow and gas diffusion devices such as titanium plates and sieve plates were applied to generate small bubbles and promote the effective decomposition of o3 into oh the continuous flow experimental results showed that the cod removal rate of dyeing wastewater was approximately 43 liquor brewing and electronic wastewater was approximately 60 and paper making wastewater exceeded 70 the o3 codin and hrt are important parameters in engineering design and operation the theoretical equivalent of o3 δcod for the oxidation of organic pollutants was 1 125 in the actual wastewater treatment when o3 δcod 2 the utilisation rate of o3 decreased rapidly 4 fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation was a relatively low cost process with no secondary pollution dominated by investment costs o3 generator and catalyst and electricity was the only operational cost credit authorship contribution statement wenhui an writing original draft xufang li writing review editing

14879,an fe based catalyst was prepared by oxidising waste fe shavings directly in a solution in engineering applications fe shavings were compressed and modified to form fe based monolithic catalyst packing both of which exhibited excellent catalytic activity in catalytic ozonation industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment fe based monolithic catalyst packing has irregular channels large

application prospects in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater graphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords fe based monolithic catalyst packing reactor design catalytic ozonation practical engineering operation industrial wastewater advanced treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a considerable amount of attention in the development and application of wastewater treatment technologies the efficacy of aops is determined by the generation of highly reactive oxidative agents amongst mainly including hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so4 yang et al 2017 in this study oh based aops are investigated oh is highly reactive and non selective and oxidizes organics mainly by extracting h from c h n h or o h bonds or adding to c c bonds or aromatic rings to form organic radicals r eq 1 brillas et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang and xu 2012 the intermediate r participates in the chain reaction eqs 2 4 forming more oh or reacts with o2 to form organic peroxide radicals roo or oxyl radicals ro eq 5 that can ultimately be degraded into co2 h2o and organic acids wang and xu 2012 and consequently the removal of pollutants was realised with regard to the strong oxidising properties and organic pollutants removal ability of oh the oh based aops especially the fenton process and catalytic ozonation have been widely investigated miklos et al 2018 they were successfully used 1 to remove toxic pollutants that are difficult to chemically oxidise 2 as a pretreatment method to convert specific known recalcitrant pollutants into biodegradable compounds such as acrylonitrile and 3 in advanced treatment of wastewater when biological treatment technologies are insufficient li et al 2018 timmers et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 the fenton process utilises the ferrous ion fe2 as an activator to decompose h2o2 under acidic conditions eq 6 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the main advantages of the fenton process include its rapid reaction rate low operating cost and low toxicity of the reagents used however there are some obvious drawbacks such as the formation of a large amounts of fe hydroxide sludge zhou et al 2020 1 r h o h r h 2 o 2 r h 2 o r o h h 3 h o 2 h o 2 4 h o 2 h o 2 5 r o 2 roo ro 6 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h catalytic ozonation technology has the advantages of low cost no additional chemical reagents low sludge yield eco friendliness and a great potential for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater owing to the selective oxidation of o3 the oxidation rate of some organic pollutants is relatively slow leading to the incomplete removal of pollutants the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of wastewater is only 10 20 by sole ozonation in advanced treatment tian et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 effective catalysts or activators have been introduced to promote o3 efficient decomposition to generate more oh various transition metal oxides such as mno2 tio2 nio co3o4 moo3 and fe2o3 have been reported as suitable catalysts for catalytic ozonation chen and wang 2019 chen et al 2011 manivel et al 2015 shen et al 2020 tan et al 2017 wu et al 2018 besides fe hydroxides such as α β and γ feooh also have high catalytic activity that can promote the decomposition of o3 to generate more oh and thus enhance the removal of organic pollutants nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 wang and bai 2017 zhang and ma 2008 catalytic oxidation processes are chain reaction sequences and in general involve radical propagation and diffusion once the radical is formed short lived oh is produced only on and near the surface of the catalyst oxidizing organic matter in a minuscule space we defined this space as the catalyst action zone kopinke 2020 zhang et al 2017 therefore to develop catalysts for ozonation an effective ssa needs to be optimised and regulated usually the catalyst is in a bulk state such as particles powder or granular and is prepared by dipping the carrier in a salt solution and then drying or sintering chen and wang 2019 guo et al 2021 shen et al 2020 although powder catalysts can effectively utilise the oh generated on the surface of catalysts to a certain extent the problems of difficult separation and recovery limit their application in industrial wastewater treatment common granular catalysts are relatively easy to recycle however the constant friction and erosion of the catalyst in solution leads to a large consumption of effective catalytic components considering the catalytic efficiency practical engineering applications and the cost of catalysts our research group has carried out extensive work on the development of fe based monolithic catalyst packing fei et al 2021 li et al 2019 2018 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020 2022 in this study fe based monolithic catalyst packing with simple preparation method and low cost was developed to achieve a high efficiency treatment of industrial wastewater the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the catalytic performance of fe based catalyst and fe based monolithic catalyst packing 2 analyse the advantages of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing and structural characteristics in catalytic ozonation 3 design and optimise two types of pilot scale reactors according to wastewater flow and kinetic analysis 4 assess the effects of operating parameters on cod removal efficiency and 5 estimate the cost of investment and operation of the pilot plant this novel catalyst packing provides information for the application of other catalysts and has contributed to the development of related technical engineering applications 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade chemical agents were purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd shanghai china and the solutions were prepared from ultrapure water obtained from a milli q biocel water system 2 2 preparation of catalysts fe shavings were selected as raw materials that were formed by section steel under the action of the blade shearing force to produce flake like solids thickness of approximately 40 μm and presented a layered and distorted character structure a strong oxidant acid base and h2o2 modified method was used for fe shavings in this study as described by li et al 2018 2019 and wang et al 2020 typical preparation procedures for fe based monolithic catalyst packing were as follows first spiral fe shavings with a thickness of approximately 40 μm were selected to remove materials that were too large or small to ensure uniformity and mechanically compressed subsequently the compressed fe shavings were modified in situ using a strong oxidant according to the above mentioned method to form fe based monolithic catalyst packing 2 3 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand measurements were performed using the potassium dichromate method hj828 2017 china total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a toc instrument toc l shimadzu corporation kyoto japan electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using an electrochemical workstation chi760d shanghai chenhua instrument co ltd china aniline content was determined using a spectrophotometric method with n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine the crystal structure of the fe based catalyst was characterised by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv japan the surface microstructure of the fe based catalyst was observed using scanning electron microscopy zeiss gemini 300 germany the ssa was determined using the gas adsorption bet method and the methylene blue solution adsorption method 2 4 experimental procedure 2 4 1 laboratory scale experimental procedure the laboratory scale experimental apparatus employed for the catalytic ozonation is shown in fig 1 2 4 2 pilot scale reactor design and experimental procedure considering the cost and flexibility two types of reactors were designed for practical engineering based on wastewater flow and effluent quality requirements a tower reactor wastewater quantity 3000 m3 d and a reinforced concrete construction reactor wastewater quantity 5000 m3 d are usually used 2 4 2 1 tower reactor a tower reactor with a large height to diameter ratio and reverse flow of gas and liquid has obvious advantages in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater less than 3000 m3 d such advantages include the efficient removal of organic pollutants facilitating water distribution and low cost the tower reactor wastewater treatment system and its components are shown in fig 2 a tower reactor adapted to different wastewater amounts was designed and the representative reactors were as follows tower 1 stainless steel used as raw material height 8 10 m the height of catalyst packing is approximately 7 m with a volume of 3000 l this reactor required additional o3 generators and pumps tower 2 stainless steel or stalinite as raw material height 3 4 m with a volume of 300 l it was appropriate for a small flow of wastewater can manually transport water and there is no need to purchase additional large o3 generators 2 4 2 2 reinforced concrete construction reactor reinforced concrete construction reactor characterised by low cost and a large volume are usually used in large wastewater treatment plants 5000 m3 d fig 3 the reaction tank was rectangular with an effective water depth of 6 m it was divided into many cells to ensure the vertical flow of gas and liquid that were the smallest units for construction installation and calibration depending on the type of reactor a 1 5 m 1 m 1 2 m unit fe based monolithic catalyst packing was developed each cell was equipped with two layers of packing units approximately 1 3 of the total volume the o3 gas distribution diffuser is a microporous air distribution device with material resistant to o3 corrosion the upward moving o3 bubbles were in counter current contact with wastewater to enhance the mass transfer process and dissolved o3 flowed downward with the wastewater in the catalytic region oh was effectively generated to remove organic contaminants to improve the removal efficiency both the distance from the catalyst packing to the o3 gas distribution device and the distance from the o3 gas distribution device to the water collecting pipe can be optimised according to the dissolution and diffusion rates of o3 simultaneously the service life of the gas distribution device the convenience of disassembling and replacing the catalyst packing unit and the anti clogging performance of the back wash were considered comprehensively 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of catalyst 3 1 1 characterisations of fe based catalyst catalytic capacity as shown in fig 4 xrd and sem were used to examine the surface crystalline phases and morphology of the in situ modified fe based catalyst the surface was composed of γ feooh and fe3o4 rather than fe2o3 with relatively modest catalytic performance on the fe catalyst surface prepared by the conventional impregnation roasting method ruiz et al 2021 yan et al 2019 protection performance after modification the leaching concentration of fe ions was less than 10 mg l besides electrochemical surface impedance can be used to represent the surface state and corrosion resistance of the oxide films luo et al 2011 after modification the half arc diameter of the fe based catalyst increased considerably indicating that the thickness of the oxide film on the surface of the fe shavings increased with better compactness and corrosion resistance fig 4e fe oxy hydroxide on the surface of fe shavings acted as both an effective catalytic component and a passivation layer that could delay the dissolution of the inner fe self regeneration the oxidation of the inner fe has the potential to produce the same substances as the modification process which is referred to as self regeneration at present almost all transition metal compound catalysts on the market have been prepared using the impregnation method the catalytic layer on the surface of the supporting material was very thin and the friction in the catalytic reaction could easily cause the loss of effective catalytic components for the fe based catalyst minor surface damage caused by transportation and installation can be recovered through a quick self regeneration process in the catalytic reaction after long term use the surface composition of the fe based catalyst was still dominated by γ feooh and could achieve stable and efficient toc and cod removal li et al 2018 above all the fe based catalyst could guarantee the stability of catalytic performance through its catalytic capacity protection performance and self regeneration in addition the leaching of fe ions less than 10 mg l and detached surface components were also non toxic therefore the application of fe based catalyst is not limited by the high cost of collection recycling and regeneration and avoids the risk of secondary pollution 3 1 2 fe based monolithic catalyst packing with micro channel structure 3 1 2 1 action zone of fe based monolithic catalyst packing the fe based catalyst promotes the decomposition of o3 leading to the generation of oh and superoxide radicals o2 on the catalyst surface li et al 2019 2018 zhang and ma 2008 eqs 7 8 the o2 was transformed into another oh through chain reactions eqs 9 11 zhang and ma 2008 the oh generated on the catalyst surface accumulated within the surface region of the catalyst zhang et al 2017 generally the diffusion behaviour of oh in water is mainly affected by the thermal motion of the molecule and can be explained with the einstein smoluchowski equation kopinke 2020 schwarzenbach et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 and kopinke 2020 calculated the diffusion distances of oh in fenton like chemistry systems and oxidative treatment systems which were 173 nm and 60 nm respectively this indicates that the oh generated on the catalyst surface reacted with dissolved organic pollutants in a minuscule range however in a catalytic ozonation system with an fe based catalyst the o2 generated on the catalyst surface could induce the expansion of the action zone the lifetime of o2 is several orders of magnitude longer than that of oh and has similar diffusion coefficients kopinke 2020 li et al 2009a wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 it diffused outwards because of molecular thermal motion and simultaneously reacted with o3 to form oh the oh continued to diffuse outwards and reacted with the organic pollutants thus the oh formed by the transformation of o2 played a major contribution to the range of action zone rather than oh generated on the catalyst surface fig 5 7 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 8 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 9 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 10 o 3 h h o 3 11 h o 3 o h o 2 the molecular movement of organic pollutants caused the expansion of the action zone too ma et al 2022 molecular motion depends on temperature molecular mass and the electrostatic attraction strength of the catalyst to organic pollutants ph zeta potential of the catalyst and pollutant type the molecular mass of organic pollutants is much larger than those of oh and o2 and they have a low average velocity moreover the electrostatic attraction range of a catalyst to organic pollutants is in the order of several nanometers spitzer 1984 zhang et al 2020 in short the action zone of the catalyst is minuscule in a stationary liquid ma et al 2022 reported that the action zone of fe based monolithic catalyst packing was approximately 30 μm that was formed through the mass transfer generated by the movement of microscopic molecules 3 1 2 2 micro channel structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in practical applications to protect the characteristics of large ssas and reduce the loss of active components fe shavings were mechanically compressed and modified to form fe based monolithic catalyst packing with uniform internal density in the mechanical compression preparation process there was an extreme point between the bulk density and effective ssa beyond which the effective ssa decreased rapidly fig 5d the effective ssa of fe based monolithic catalyst packing was the surface area that constituted the micro channel structure and could reach 3500 m2 m3 which was several times greater than that of ordinary packing lee et al 2021 li et al 2009b furthermore porosity and average pore diameter of fe based monolithic catalyst packing approximately 95 and 1 0 mm respectively all the characteristics accommodated sufficient volume of the action zone accounts for a relatively large proportion of the catalyst volume which are conducive to the reaction of organic pollutants with oh in action zone we defined the effective catalytic structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing as micro channel as shown in fig 5e in the region of fe based monolithic catalyst packing due to the macroscopic mass transfer formed by wastewater flow all components in the wastewater can reach the action zone of the catalyst ma et al 2022 in a continuous flow reactor the mass transfer of organic pollutants and oh in action zone of the catalyst were key factors influencing the removal of organic pollutants the mass transfer of organic pollutants in laminar flow zones is usually achieved by molecular diffusion however this is slow dong et al 2022 according to the einstein smoluchowski equation and fick s second law owing to the short lateral diffusion length of micro channels the mass transfer process can be fast and organic pollutants can be mixed evenly dong et al 2022 ober et al 2015 tanimu et al 2017 for example the diffusion coefficient d of benzoic acid in water at 298 k is 1 2 10 9 m2 s and the diffusion time of benzoic acid from the centre of the micro channel to the channel wall was approximately 104 s t d 2 2 2d the unique irregular micro channel structure of fe based monolithic catalyst packing can take advantage of the hydrodynamic focusing chaotic advection flow separation or split and recombine flows to promote the uniform distribution of organic pollutant concentrations in time and space hardt et al 2005 ma et al 2022 the vortexes and disordered flows generated by the fluid flow can achieve fast mass transfer efficiency which could improve the utilisation efficiency of oh in the catalyst action zone ma et al 2022 stroock et al 2002 in a reinforced concrete construction reactor the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was equipped with an oxidation resistant stainless steel outer frame fig 5b s1 which protected the effective catalytic component of the catalyst the upper and lower sides of the packing were provided with a sieve plate to prevent blocking of the micro channel by suspended substances in the wastewater a hollow layer was placed on the upper side of the frame and the structure resolves the positioning problems of forklift transportation and hoisting tasks in addition it can also achieve secondary water distribution and avoid blocking and short circuiting caused by packing module stacking in addition positioning blocks are placed on the outer frame to aid in accurate installation and convenient maintenance the combination of unitary packing and the outer frame was chemically modified fe based monolithic catalyst packing is novel with packing properties chemical catalytic functions and engineering practical application characteristics 3 2 catalytic effect of fe based catalyst in laboratory scale to evaluate the catalytic potential of the fe based catalyst catalytic ozonation experiments on industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment were carried out at a laboratory scale chemical oxygen demand and toc removal rates were used as indicators of the catalytic effect of the fe based catalyst for light industrial wastewater mainly containing natural organic matter such as alcohol vegetable processing liquor brewing and paper making wastewater the cod of the biochemical effluent varies greatly for example the cod of vegetable processing wastewater was only 70 2 mg l and that of paper making wastewater was as high as 355 mg l the fe based catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity in their advanced treatment after 120 mins the cod removal rates were all above 70 fig 6 a and the toc removal efficiencies of liquor brewing and paper making wastewater were 79 8 and 72 6 respectively fig s2 for general industrial wastewater such as coking dyeing electronic and tannery wastewater the fe based catalyst also presented a positive catalytic effect on their advanced treatment although the cod concentration varied greatly 66 8 345 mg l a cod removal rate of 58 70 can be achieved fig 6b after the catalytic ozonation of leachate aniline and printing wastewater toc removal of 33 47 was also achieved fig s2 the results demonstrated that the fe based catalyst exhibited a significant catalytic effect in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater the biotreatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical and pesticide industries proved to be difficult due to high concentrations complex compositions and toxic characteristics of the contaminants present in this experiment the cod of pharmaceutical and pesticide wastewater after biochemical treatment was approximately 100 mg l as shown in fig 6c the cod removal rate was 45 50 and the toc removal rate of pharmaceutical wastewater after 120 min was 53 1 generally after biochemical treatment wastewater does not contain residual organic matter which is easily oxidised to produce intermediate products with biological toxicity our research group studied the effect of catalytic ozonation via fe based catalyst on the conversion of hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic fractions of bio treated paper making and bio treated dyeing wastewater in comparison with sole ozonation the remaining organic contaminants in the effluent from fe based catalytic ozonation were mainly hydrophilic small molecules substances which were easier to be degraded if biochemical process was followed fei et al 2021 as a result the catalytic ozonation technology applied to the bio treated effluent of industrial wastewater could reduce the cod of wastewater and simultaneously improved the biodegradability therefore fe based catalyst is suitable for the practical engineering applications in wastewater advanced treatment acrylonitrile wastewater is a toxic and refractory industrial wastewater containing complex pollutants including nitrile cyanide pyridine lipids organic acids a large number of oligomers and copolymers etc dai et al 2015 after the biological treatment the degradation of the pollutants was incomplete as shown in fig 6d the possible achievable cod removal rates of acrylonitrile wastewater without biochemical treatment and after biochemical treatment were 81 5 and 77 2 respectively in addition to the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater fe based catalyst can also be applied to remove the characteristic pollutants from some industrial wastewater as shown in fig 6d the fe based catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for aniline removal 3 3 pilot scale reactor kinetic analysis the effect of catalytic ozonation was dependant on the concentration of aqueous o3 and its effective decomposition decomposition to form oh the key process influencing the aqueous o3 concentration included 1 o3 dissolves in the liquid phase 2 o3 decomposes in the gas phase 3 ineffective decomposition in the liquid phase and 4 efficient decomposition in the action zone o3 is a polar molecule and its solubility in water is approximately 10 times that of non polar molecular o2 because of the high solubility of o3 and decay rate in air is much lower than that in the liquid phase the concentration of o3 in wastewater was usually not the main factor affecting oxidation efficiency in practice the amount of o3 overflowing from wastewater in actual engineering was less than 1 in tower reactors therefore the dissolution and decomposition of o3 are not the limiting processes in catalytic ozonation more than 99 of o3 was decomposed in wastewater but not necessarily efficiently to form oh many metals such as cu and zn can cause o3 ineffective decomposition without producing oh our research group showed that when the temperature increased from 30 c to 80 c the o3 decomposition rate in low concentration o3 aqueous solution increased by 13 times without an increase in the oh yield therefore the core issue is the effective decomposition of o3 in water there are two key factors that influence effective o3 decomposition in practice and these were presented below 3 3 1 gas distribution device the transfer of gas into liquid is dependents on the properties of the gas and liquid such as temperature partial pressure of the gas liquid and gas flow rates and size and number of bubbles present etc john et al 2020 shin et al 1999 xu and liu 1990 the diameter of o3 bubbles was a crucial and adjustable factor influencing the transfer rate of o3 gas microbubbles have many favourable characteristics such as high interfacial area high gas holdup slow rising velocity etc that can considerably improve the gas liquid mass transfer efficiency and increase the o3 utilisation efficiency in the catalyst packing area john et al 2020 li et al 2020 eqs 12 is given by park et al 2017 parkinson et al 2008 in practice gas diffusion devices such as titanium plates sieve plates etc play a key role in producing small bubbles ensuring adequate residence time of o3 in the catalyst packing area and effectively decomposing to generate oh 12 u h r 3 2 u s ρ l ρ g g d 2 12 μ l where u h r is the hadamard rybczynski terminal rising velocity m s u is the stokes terminal rising velocity m s ρl is the liquid density kg m3 ρg is gas density kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 d is the bubble diameter m and μl is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid pa s however the bubble size was too small when the reactor was in counter current gas liquid flow which would make the rising velocity of the bubbles less than the flow velocity of reverse flow wastewater which is not conducive to the removal of organic pollutants in this case the treatment effect could be improved by using a co current gas liquid flow meanwhile the ineffective decomposition of o3 was mainly thermal decomposition therefore the retention time of o3 gas in the pipeline from the generator to the liquid phase should be short the bubble size was not entirely dependant on the initial state because it could change in the packing area because the average pore size of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was only 1 0 mm the changeable pore channels could not only cut the o3 bubble but also cause the small bubbles to collide and coalesce resulting in turbulence which increased the dissolution mass transfer and utilisation of o3 3 3 2 gas liquid flow direction the effective decomposition and utilisation of o3 were also associated with the gas liquid flow direction in which the counter current gas liquid flow has certain advantages over the sequential batch and co current gas liquid flow the counter current gas liquid flow can prolong the bubbles residence time strengthen the turbulent mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases and have a significant impact on the removal efficiency of organic contaminants ma et al 2022 to ensure long term stable operation of the catalytic system ma et al 2022 estimated the water flow resistance and flooding point of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in a tower reactor according to eq 13 the calculation results showed that the head loss of the reactor was 0 157 m which was smaller than that of the general filtration process ma et al 2022 the occurrence of flooding is related to gas viscosity liquid viscosity packing structure porosity and other factors zapke and kröger 2000 ma et al 2022 estimated the liquid flow velocity under the flooding phenomenon and the actual liquid flow velocity was only 22 7 of the velocity at the flooding point therefore the problem of flooding phenomenon will not occur in the practical application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing ma et al 2022 13 h f λ l d v 2 2 g where hf is the frictional head loss m l is the flow path distance packing height in the tower reactor m d is the inner diameter of the reactor m v is the velocity m s λ is the resistance coefficient 3 4 pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing 3 4 1 practical application in industrial wastewater treatment in sequential batch experiments at the laboratory scale the fe based catalyst catalytic ozonation of dyeing electronic paper making and liquor brewing wastewater showed good cod and toc removal effects the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was further applied to the practical engineering treatment of wastewaters on a pilot scale the continuous flow experimental results in fig 7 show that different components of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater led to different cod removal characteristics the cod removal rate of dyeing wastewater was approximately 43 liquor brewing and electronic industry wastewater was approximately 60 and the cod removal rate of paper making wastewater exceeded 70 the fe based monolithic catalyst packing exhibited a good catalytic effect in the advanced treatment of wastewater from the dyeing electronics paper making and liquor brewing industries 3 4 2 critical parameters in catalytic ozonation system 3 4 2 1 influent quality and hrt in the catalytic ozonation reaction the outflow cod or cod removal rate was the dependant variable and the initial cod concentration o3 dose and hrt were the main independent variables owing to the limitations of experimental conditions such as fluctuation of the initial cod concentration of wastewater hrt can only be set to a fixed value in each experiment o3 codin can only be maintained within a certain range in the pilot scale test and it is difficult to design an orthogonal experiment we investigated the influence of existing factors on the cod removal of wastewater from different industries to improve cod removal and guide the engineering application of the catalytic ozonation technology for the applications of fe based monolithic catalyst packing in dyeing electronic paper making and liquor brewing wastewater the correlations between the initial cod codin and cod removal are depicted in fig 8 a d we observed that codin had a significant effect on cod removal amount but had a weak to no effect on the cod removal rate except for paper making wastewater with relatively stable codin and the value was comprised between 210 and 235 mg l the codin of dyeing electronic and liquor brewing wastewater has a significant effect on outflow cod codout fig s3a d these results indicated that in the catalytic ozonation process the outlet values and cod removal amount of wastewater were related to the inlet loads but the cod removal rate was substantially independent of the inlet loads in the catalytic ozonation reactor hrt was considered as the effective retention time that is the retention time of wastewater in the catalyst packing hrt v q v effective reaction volume of catalyst packing the relationship between the hrt and cod removal amount rate is shown in fig 8e h effective removal of cod was realised in a short reaction time for dyeing electronic and liquor brewing wastewater the removal efficiency could not be improved by prolonging the hrt in contrast for paper making wastewater with high codin and natural organic contaminants the extension of the hrt could achieve a better effect fig s3e h 3 4 2 2 o3 codin and o3 δcod in addition to hrt the o3 dose equivalent o3 codin or o3 equivalent o3 δcod are also important parameters in engineering design and operation overall simple linear regression and third order polynomial regression analyses showed that o3 codin and o3 δcod had significant influences on codout and cod removal amount rate figs 9 and s4 at lower o3 codin and o3 δcod values codout could be considerably reduced by increasing the o3 dose however when the o3 dose exceeded a certain range the utilisation rate of o3 decreased indicating that the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater was close to the limit and that the economic benefits of the process were low based on the oxidation reaction shown in eq 5 dominated by oh it can be seen that o2 participated in the reaction process and could be completely derived from the decomposition of o3 through radical chain reactions o3 was converted to oh that were generated on the surface of the catalyst or by o3 transformation and induced the formation of o2 to oxidise organic contaminants eqs 7 11 therefore the theoretical equivalent of o3 δcod 1 125 for the oxidation of organic pollutants by o3 was derived generally in actual wastewater treatment when the o3 dose was increased to o3 δcod 2 the utilisation rate of o3 decreased rapidly as shown in figs 9e h and s4e h therefore o3 δcod was usually 1 2 1 8 in the advanced treatment of actual industrial wastewater with the fe based monolithic catalyst packing and the dose of o3 added in the pilot test could be obtained by estimating cod removal rate according to wastewater type and measuring codin concentration 3 4 3 wastewater with high salinity or high inorganic carbon concentration in fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation of high salinity pharmaceutical wastewater 10 000 mg l cl the catalyst can be corroded by cl caco3 was formed on the surface of the fe shavings during the oxidation process leading to a decrease in the catalyst life in response to this problem low cost carbon steel was used as the catalyst raw material lifespan of up to 3 years and the surface of the catalyst packing was treated with effective anti corrosion in the pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing which increased the cost effectiveness a high concentration of inorganic carbon mainly co3 2 hco3 in bio treated paper making wastewater was discovered in the pilot scale application of fe based monolithic catalyst packing the large co3 2 hco3 cod ratio of the wastewater did not achieve ideal catalytic efficiency co3 2 is a well known species that scavenges the radicals involved in o3 decomposition resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity and oh concentration that leads to a loss of efficiency the practical solving strategies included 1 removing co3 2 by the chemical precipitation method 2 reducing the ph to increase the relative content of hco3 li et al 2018 because hco3 was less reactive than co3 2 reacting with oh eqs 14 15 tian et al 2021a 14 o h h c o 3 o h h c o 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 15 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 k 4 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 4 4 cost analyses and estimation the fenton process and catalytic ozonation have been developed and extensively applied for advanced treatment of industrial wastewater data obtained from the survey for catalytic ozonation via fe based monolithic catalyst packing and the fenton method were collected to estimate and compare the cost of investment and operation of the pilot plant as shown in table 1 compared to the fenton method catalytic ozonation with fe based monolithic catalyst packing has a relatively high investment cost owing to the o3 generator and catalyst however it has the advantages of a relatively small occupation low operational costs low chemical input and no secondary pollution considering the depreciation of the o3 generator and the catalyst the general life of the fe based monolithic catalyst packing is five years and the o3 generator is eight years the investment cost was approximately 0 00102 cny l fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation was a relatively low cost process with an operational cost only electricity of just 0 00122 cny l o3 δcod 1 2 considering the high cod removal efficiency catalytic ozonation with fe based monolithic catalyst packing is an economical choice for advanced treatment of industrial wastewater 4 conclusions fe based monolithic catalyst packing exhibited excellent catalytic effects in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater and was cost effective and eco friendly the main conclusions are as follows 1 the preparation method of fe based catalyst from waste fe shavings has the advantage of being fast cheap and without a catalyst carrier surface γ feooh was formed by direct oxidation in a liquid and functioned as both a catalytic component and a corrosion resistance layer laboratory scale tests showed that the fe based catalyst exhibited good catalytic efficiency in the catalytic ozonation of industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment for most industrial wastewater the cod removal rates were all above 58 it can also achieve a 45 50 cod removal rate for the refractory pharmaceutical and pesticide wastewater 2 the fe based monolithic catalyst packing was prepared with fe shavings via mechanical compression and modification to fit the practical engineering the effective ssa reached 3500 m2 m3 the unique irregular micro channel structure effectively strengthened the mass transfer process this was conducive to the reaction of oh with organic pollutants in the catalyst action zone approximately 30 μm and improved the utilisation efficiency of oh the catalyst packing was equipped with an oxidation resistant stainless steel outer frame which protected the effective catalytic component of the catalyst in engineering applications the hollow outer frame plays a role in secondary water distribution 3 in practical engineering according to the quantity of wastewater flow a tower reactor 3000 m3 d and reinforced concrete construction reactor 5000 m3 d were applied the catalytic ozonation process was a counter current gas liquid flow and gas diffusion devices such as titanium plates and sieve plates were applied to generate small bubbles and promote the effective decomposition of o3 into oh the continuous flow experimental results showed that the cod removal rate of dyeing wastewater was approximately 43 liquor brewing and electronic wastewater was approximately 60 and paper making wastewater exceeded 70 the o3 codin and hrt are important parameters in engineering design and operation the theoretical equivalent of o3 δcod for the oxidation of organic pollutants was 1 125 in the actual wastewater treatment when o3 δcod 2 the utilisation rate of o3 decreased rapidly 4 fe based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation was a relatively low cost process with no secondary pollution dominated by investment costs o3 generator and catalyst and electricity was the only operational cost credit authorship contribution statement wenhui an writing original draft xufang li writing review editing
